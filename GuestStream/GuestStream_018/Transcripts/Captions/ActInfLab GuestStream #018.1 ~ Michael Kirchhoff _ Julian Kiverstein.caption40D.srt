00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,641
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:12,946
Welcome to Active Flab Stream
number 18.1.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,149
We're here with Julian Epstein.

4
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:21,021
And Michael Kirchhoff, as well as Dave
Dean and Steven from Acton Lab.

5
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:26,026
And we're really appreciative
for the authors for joining today.

6
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,361
To be discussing some of their work.

7
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:32,432
We're going to have a presentation
by the authors.

8
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:37,303
And then following the presentation,
we'll have ample time for discussion.

9
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:41,274
So please feel free to write
any questions down in the live chat

10
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,742
and we'll get to it.

11
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,246
So without further ado,
Julian and Michael,

12
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,282
thanks a lot for joining
and please take it away.

13
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,719
Well, thanks so much for inviting us.

14
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,755
We've been looking forward
to this particular session

15
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,490
and thanks for staying up late in the US

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,492
and where we are in Europe
for getting up early.

17
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,562
It's only 330 in the afternoon here
for us, so

18
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,131
that's more manageable in Australia.

19
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,500
I'll just share my screen

20
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,905
share

21
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:13,873
so that

22
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,443
you guys can see that.

23
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,610
Bring that up

24
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,647
So that should all be clear in a second.

25
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,383
Is that right? Looks good. Great.

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,321
So the paper is called the Literalness
Fallacy and the Free Energy Principle.

27
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:35,028
It's a it's a philosophical paper
on the topic of scientific realism.

28
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:39,332
Scientific entropy is much less
instrumentalist in the context of the ATP

29
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,770
or the free energy principle,
I suppose, just as a primer.

30
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,574
This is a revise
and resubmit stage for our paper.

31
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,843
This particular moment in time.

32
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,646
So any comments that we might be able
to get to further

33
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,549
improve the quality of the paper will,
of course, be

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,284
welcomed

35
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,121
So let's let's start.

36
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:06,226
There will be a little bit of, I suppose,
conceptual stage setting at the start,

37
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,828
just given the nature
of this particular paper.

38
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,832
And also because it sort of speaks
to a few other issues that go beyond

39
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,869
just the sort of narrow
focus on the free energy principle

40
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,404
So this is

41
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:22,642
the debate as it sits, or at least
as we try to sketch it in the paper

42
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,678
between scientific realism
and instrumentalist.

43
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:30,950
So let's just say briefly
what scientific realism is and briefly

44
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,154
what instrumentalist means,
and then we'll say a little bit more

45
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,657
about how to think about scientific
realism overall.

46
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,727
The point of the paper was to sort of
try to marshal

47
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,863
a set of arguments for why

48
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,399
at least a version of scientific realism

49
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,970
can be accommodated by models.

50
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,541
And it was motivated in part

51
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,943
because it seems like
in the last few years that's been the

52
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,946
there's been a flurry of papers

53
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:04,951
sort of in one way or another arguing
for scientific anti realism with respect

54
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:10,190
to the CPE or how to interpret parts
of that particular model.

55
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,692
So that's the kind of that's
the kind of setting we're in.

56
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:18,231
So scientific realism, that's the view
that one reasonable goal for currently

57
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:23,036
best scientific theories, scientific
models, is to offer literally true

58
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:28,274
or probably true or approximate and true
or probably approximately true

59
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,011
descriptions
and explanations of target systems.

60
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,547
Have you in brackets,
for example, natural phenomena

61
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,484
but it could also be artificial systems
in the context

62
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:42,188
of artificial intelligence,
artificial life, for example.

63
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,658
Now, by contrast, an

64
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,062
instrumental issue or scientific realism,

65
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:53,866
that's the view that scientific theories
and models are nothing but instruments

66
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:58,037
for prediction of observable
behavior of target systems.

67
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,608
So here the claim is something like this

68
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,645
from an instrumentalist
perspective theory slash models.

69
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:09,482
They have explanatory power
and that gives them some utility,

70
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,420
but they're not in any in
any sense of the word truth producing.

71
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,557
So when it's not to think about
instrumentalists

72
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,095
or the instrumental position
as putting forth statements

73
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,231
about how the world
is on the basis of their models,

74
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:28,201
by which you can say something,
say true or false about how

75
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,602
the world is

76
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,739
So the main question now

77
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,742
is for this particular paper
we are considering,

78
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:41,481
is the truth producing in a way that's
consistent with scientific realism.

79
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,116
And of

80
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,986
course, as I mentioned
just a minute or so ago, we think it is

81
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:51,858
indeed consistent with a particular way
of conceiving of scientific realism.

82
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,461
And maybe a footnote here
that's important,

83
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,031
both scientific realism and instrumental.

84
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,066
Quite okay.

85
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,770
A multiple there's multiple different
versions of each particular

86
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,307
framework in the philosophy of science
that we're trying to offer

87
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,377
a reasonable general characterization
of these particular frameworks

88
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,546
in order to sort of
get some traction on the debate

89
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,618
So as I said, it's a reasonable goal

90
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,921
of our scientific theories and models
to apply these true will probably

91
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,657
to approximate true
descriptions of target systems

92
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:31,097
Now, here we we we draw inspiration
from Peter Godfrey-smith.

93
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,535
His book here is in reality
that tells us how

94
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,371
perhaps to interpret
that particular general claim.

95
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,008
Now, he says the following
he says it's mistake to express

96
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,078
the scientific situation
in a way that depends

97
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,548
on the accuracy
of our current scientific theories.

98
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,583
So if we express

99
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,487
scientific realism by asserting
the real existence of entities

100
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,590
recognized by science
at this particular point in time,

101
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,893
then if those particular theories
turn out to be false,

102
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,731
well then the whole framework of
scientific realism turn out to be false.

103
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,632
So we shouldn't think that's

104
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:11,237
what you have to do in order to advocate
for a kind of scientific realism

105
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:15,007
about scientific models, theories
and their relation to target systems

106
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,414
So building on this, we can say

107
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,217
again, this notion here
is that an actual and reasonable

108
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,853
aim of science is to give us
these accurate descriptions.

109
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,621
Well, that's not the claim.

110
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,690
The scientific
theories must be true. Now,

111
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,293
and make truth
producing claims about targets.

112
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,765
Now, I mean, it's a nice thing if they
do, but it is not a necessary condition

113
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:44,170
for the one to adopt scientific realism,
not scientific theories, models.

114
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,841
There's no commitment to the success
of the individual sciences.

115
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,512
So there can be trouble in biology
but we can still hold, for instance,

116
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,048
scientific realism about, for instance,
the applied

117
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,619
to the cognitive sciences, for example.

118
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,288
Now, importantly, and this is
and this is why I'm just spending

119
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,124
a little bit of time
initially on scientific realism

120
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,763
the kind of version of scientific
realism we're interested in

121
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:16,202
is going to allow for theories and models
to posit idealized nations.

122
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:20,306
For instance, understood
as distortions, approximations,

123
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,777
understood here as perhaps in exactness
of scientific models

124
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:31,050
they can pose a fictional entity,
for instance, entities

125
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,021
that are not actual
and thus like in the here and now.

126
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,324
But the important point is
that you can keep

127
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,761
that view
and still endorse scientific realism,

128
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:46,833
because one aspect here
is that the long term aim

129
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:48,868
of working with

130
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:54,540
your scientific models is for them
to become to producing or to become more

131
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,978
and more aligned with the target systems
that we're interested in.

132
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,614
And we'll finish this view
as we sort of move along

133
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,952
Now, this issue

134
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,155
between the scientific realist
and the instrumentalist as that's

135
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,659
considering it in the context of the key
it comes up

136
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,498
when we consider
what we call the map problem.

137
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,968
And this is not a term of art
that we have invented

138
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,905
or the sort of authors in the both
in the AFP and elsewhere

139
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,039
that make use of this.

140
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,410
For instance, Mil Andrews
in her nice paper from 2021 in biology

141
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,680
and philosophy
that speaks of this particular problem

142
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,551
So this is just a quote from the paper

143
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,521
thinking about what our focus is.

144
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,557
So we're going to ask
what is the relationship between

145
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,326
scientific models
constructing using the body

146
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,930
and the realities
these models purport to represent?

147
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,600
My focus is especially on the sea
and what,

148
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,937
if anything, it tells us about the system
that is used to model.

149
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,940
And this is what we call the map problem.

150
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,111
How does the map, your theories,
your models relate to the territory?

151
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,514
Real world
target systems of which those theories

152
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,450
and models are maps

153
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,720
Now, if there's anybody
joining on the livestream,

154
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:20,259
this is just a very brief statement about
what the free energy principle says.

155
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,096
Julian and I and as well as Ian,
are working under the assumption

156
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:28,901
that that doesn't need to take long to introduce that in this particular context.

157
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,637
But very briefly then

158
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:35,074
states that are self-organizing system
that tends towards maintaining

159
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:39,612
an equilibrium and steady state for this
environment must minimize free energy

160
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,816
where minimizing free energy,
at least under a certain Bayesian

161
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:48,487
interpretation, is to maximize
model evidence, that is, maximize

162
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:52,124
the likelihood of some data given
even model of the systems interactions

163
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,694
with its environment.

164
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,929
Now, how does the problem arise

165
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,032
in the context of the ATP?

166
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,668
Well, it might arise if you're a

167
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,440
researcher working
in artificial intelligence, and the aim

168
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,744
is to build robots that engage
in active inference for example,

169
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,182
navigating or making decisions, cetera.

170
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,218
So here the question becomes
what's the relationship

171
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:23,889
between our EP model understood
as an active inference model?

172
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,593
And then how one engineered is,
if you like,

173
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,164
artificial agents to perform in
accordance with those particular models.

174
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,002
What the model specifies in terms
of, say, decision making

175
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,905
belief, updating and selecting action
policies for adaptive.

176
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,439
Pavia

177
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,642
a different way than that

178
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,111
problem might arise
would be from the computational

179
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:48,814
neuroscientific perspective,
where one might be interested in tracking

180
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,351
transitions across belief,
perhaps in deep

181
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,621
generative models.

182
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,824
And the problem then is, well,
how does that

183
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,896
you reticle specification of free energy
minimization under active inference?

184
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,134
How does that move on to
what the brain actually does

185
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,803
in order to say, shift
from beliefs to beliefs

186
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,039
or to make decisions
about what to do in the world?

187
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,243
So that's just a few examples of where
this particular issue becomes

188
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,478
pervaded.

189
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,452
Now, just to situate this discussion
a little bit,

190
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,622
because there's a few tweaks
and turns in the paper and it's a large,

191
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,092
somewhat complex
conceptual landscape we're working on.

192
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,694
But it seems to me

193
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:36,562
we're just going to

194
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:40,266
try to situate this a little bit more
so you get a feel for this.

195
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,036
We've got a nice review, a comment

196
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,606
that sort of introduces the issue here.

197
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,309
So the comment is something like

198
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,945
if we take the free energy
principle, like

199
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,315
many other theories
across different sciences,

200
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,819
then we can think about that as a kind
of model based approach to science.

201
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:04,156
And if you look at the little image
over here, which is a modification of is

202
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,493
sort of a little description
of how this works, modified

203
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,962
by Godfrey-smith in the 2009 paper,

204
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,899
we can initially start
to develop a description of a model

205
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,969
and say something about what
the model system

206
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:20,072
in question is
and the comment is something like this.

207
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,809
We can study models for their own sake,
as Andrew's has pointed out.

208
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,412
No, that's so true earlier.

209
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,281
Any model that can be treated
realistically can also be treated

210
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:33,486
instruments and scientists can disagree
about which the model I meant to be real.

211
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:38,791
Now, this is important in understanding
how the that problem arises.

212
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:44,330
So Andrew's in the 2021 paper
gives us a whole list of different ways.

213
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,768
One can see the kind
of mathematical structure of the machine

214
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,805
being interpreted as a scientific model.

215
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,242
The work of Michael Weisberg
is influential

216
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,678
in the context of philosophy of science,
philosophy of biology.

217
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,683
So she and
he, they can give sort of minimally three

218
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:08,554
different models that we're interested in
at the essay sort of target.

219
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,924
Let's model
the ATP as a generalized model and then

220
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,693
is a target directed model.

221
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,963
Now you can work
purely on the mathematics,

222
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,132
if you like, of the free energy principle

223
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:21,734
for the sake of

224
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,771
just understanding the model
for getting your model description right.

225
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,140
Of your model system as per that image.

226
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,645
Now here,
the point is that that in and of itself

227
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,115
doesn't give rise to anything
like the math problem

228
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,450
because you can disagree,
you can come at that

229
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,619
that work
from an instrumentalist perspective,

230
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,255
you can come at it
from a scientific realist perspective.

231
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,892
But doing that kind of work
doesn't really allow you

232
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,895
to adjudicate between the two positions
or so it seems to us.

233
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,066
So that would be the instance of a target
less model.

234
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,870
You're not asking questions that relate
from the model to a target system.

235
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,507
You can treat the AP
as a generalized model.

236
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,643
You can
perhaps think of it as super model.

237
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,249
Theories with natural selection
from the point of view of the.

238
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,184
But we are not saying anything

239
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,954
about development of any particular
kind of species.

240
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,391
That's one to, for instance,
a different discussion as well,

241
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,894
which we consider
but we won't talk to unless it comes up.

242
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:25,764
In the Q&A about the role of the mock up
blanket notation.

243
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,034
Now, if we put it in the paper,
that gives you a kind of

244
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,871
generalized approach
for delineating boundaries,

245
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,741
but it doesn't give you a approach
for delineating boundaries

246
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,476
for any particular individual.

247
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:42,882
In that sense, it's a generalist take
on models on the basis of the formulas

248
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,784
now the math problem

249
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:50,189
gets interesting
when you pursue a target directed model,

250
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,693
when you try to implement
the mathematical structures positive

251
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:59,131
by the effective in terms of a process
theory such as act of inference.

252
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,002
So you sort of moving
from a mathematically general

253
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,906
characterization of the adaptive behavior
to specifying

254
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,976
what a particular individual
or a set of individuals must do

255
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,113
in order to engage adaptive in the world.

256
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,017
So you're sort of committing yourself to
and to to getting the sort

257
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:22,454
of the right hand side of this this model
or this little image, if you like,

258
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:27,860
saying something about which way
do you model now resemble the systems

259
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,297
that you actually are aiming to explain
or understand

260
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:37,303
something about OK,
so we should say once we have that,

261
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,239
we should give the argument
for the instrumentalists.

262
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,576
And then once we've done that, we'll see
the kind of problem that we raise

263
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:49,081
for the instrumentalists that we think
it's a kind of a fallacy of inference

264
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,551
from certain considerations
to certain claims about the

265
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:55,921
so premise.

266
00:15:55,921 --> 00:16:02,161
One here is that active inference
models on the CFP introduce distortions

267
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,397
in representing biological
and cognitive systems

268
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,634
via idealization.

269
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,635
So one way to think about that

270
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,771
might be the introduction of variation
or free energy as a kind of distortion

271
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,742
into the framework
in order to explore, in order to solve

272
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,279
a computational problem
about how surprising it's minimized

273
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,916
as well as in acceptance approximately.

274
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:29,755
And one example might be something like
introducing this idea that three energy

275
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:34,760
minimization can be construed
mathematically as akin to a kind of

276
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,930
Bayesian inference

277
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,433
would be in in exactness
introduced into the formalism

278
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,772
primarily because it was
so it seems nobody thinks that the brain

279
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,507
quite literally

280
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,976
encodes something like Bayes Theorem

281
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,215
OK, and it's to
that is that scientific realism requires

282
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,651
that models provide descriptions
of target systems that are literally true

283
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,190
so that's a somewhat of a denial,
if you like,

284
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,127
if you would, a whole scientific realism
perspective, premise one,

285
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,264
premise three then is that active
inference models are not true

286
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,868
an accurate representation of biological
and cognitive systems

287
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,370
precisely because of the issues
raised in premise one.

288
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,274
Therefore, active inference models false.

289
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,811
There are best useful fictions.

290
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,847
And just to give you

291
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,084
the references
where we are drawing work from in terms

292
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:36,221
of defining the term idealization
and the term approximation.

293
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,858
Here, we're using a nice paper
by McMullen on Galileo,

294
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,561
an idea that I say
wants to think about idealization,

295
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:47,166
and we are using a canonical paper
by Naughton to define approximation of

296
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,737
these somewhat contentious mean
because there's,

297
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,673
as one might expect,
there's all kinds of other takes on it,

298
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,242
but you have
to come down on 11 side post.

299
00:17:58,811 --> 00:17:59,678
So once we

300
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:04,383
have the instrumentalist claim up
and running, this is the kind of fallacy

301
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:08,187
that we're arguing
that a set of set of papers

302
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,257
defending instrumentalist
in the context of the effect he is making

303
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,827
and we pointed to this for this fallacy

304
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,930
and just the prime use of

305
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,034
premise two here is the claim that
scientific realism requires that models

306
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,537
provide descriptions of target systems
that are literally true.

307
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,841
And it's the claim, the literature,
this fallacy, because we're going to show

308
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:33,879
that's that that's not a necessary
condition upon which to base one's

309
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,215
defense

310
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,518
of scientific realism.

311
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,021
So what we say is the mistake,
the literalist fallacy

312
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,824
is the mistake of accepting or affirming,
apart

313
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,161
from the fact
that act of inference model,

314
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,531
not literally mapped on to biological
and cognitive systems,

315
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,470
it's slightly different formulation
that we have here

316
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,075
is that in this context of the P,
some find the discrepancy between the map

317
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,278
and the territory a compelling reason
to defend instruments.

318
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,181
It isn't about the P,
and we take that to be problematic.

319
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,851
Given this particular kind of fallacy.

320
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:16,021
We identify this particular fallacy
by those defending instrumentalists.

321
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,357
We call it the this one is fallacy.

322
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,093
Here's this the second variation of it,
if you like.

323
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,096
This is the fallacy
of inserting the truth of instruments.

324
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,332
It isn't based on the claim
that the properties, if you p models

325
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,502
do not literally map onto real world
target systems.

326
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,907
So so one question that might be
interesting to discuss in the Q&A

327
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:39,144
is whether or not this is indeed
the problem for a instrumentalist

328
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,213
to infer the truth of their own position

329
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,550
on the basis of the claim
that the properties of their models

330
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,986
do not map literally map
onto real world target systems

331
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,690
so the pushback here on the

332
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,826
second formulation is something like this
instrumentalist and others

333
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,730
searching the truth of their own position
that will be so contradictory

334
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,667
now, this is sort of conceptual issues
here,

335
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,103
but I just wanted to flag the issue
and perhaps come back to it in the Q&A.

336
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,005
It would take us too long to get into it.

337
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,474
And they did some more philosophical,
conceptual

338
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,312
ism, ism evidence, if you like,

339
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,714
set of papers
across some different topics that

340
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,618
we were arguing or committing this.

341
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,589
This kind of fallacy
is a 2020 paper by Venice.

342
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,657
And so that's great.

343
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,460
They say that it remains quote
it remains disputed

344
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:33,031
whether it's the statistical models
of scientific tools

345
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,667
to describe non equilibrium
steady state systems

346
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,903
which we call the instruments of this
meaning

347
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:42,207
or necessarily implemented
and utilized by those systems.

348
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,176
The so-called realist reading

349
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,779
know what they're going to conclude
is that since P models are not true

350
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,847
and accurate descriptions

351
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:53,085
of these target systems instrumented
as it turns out to be the only option.

352
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,388
So for us that's a
that's the nature of this fallacy

353
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:01,560
because it assumes that the real position
is that your theoretical models

354
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,996
literally have to be implemented
in target systems

355
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07,899
for that kind of framework in the philosophy of science to be up and running

356
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,438
within
about 20, 21 because we only updated

357
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:17,643
20, 22 at some point
this year in the Target article and Bob's

358
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,879
focus on the logical status

359
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,849
of the Markov blanket formula,
some in the SNP.

360
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,585
Now they argue
that much of the literature

361
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,555
on the implies
that organisms literally instantiate

362
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,025
the mathematical structure of Markov
monkeys.

363
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,095
They argue that the use of the formalism
conflicts

364
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,131
a model with its target system.

365
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,135
Now if you think that in order
to use the Markov

366
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:47,439
rank and formalism productively,
even from the scientific point of view,

367
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:51,243
that the mathematical formulation
of that particular formalism

368
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,879
has to be implemented
in the actual target system,

369
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,315
then you are committing
the literalist fallacy

370
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,384
because even the scientific view
this is going to push back against that

371
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,622
so Columbo and police use

372
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:08,360
in a 2021 article in biology
and philosophy target the issue of

373
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,698
this city in the city namely
that one can realistically model

374
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,001
biological systems
as having an exotic density.

375
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:20,372
Now they deny that this city captures
properties of biological systems

376
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,709
and therefore the effect
is biologically implausible.

377
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:28,547
And our line on that is that's, that's
akin or species of literalist fantasy

378
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,884
precisely because it's going to assume
that the theorists

379
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:36,521
actually think that it's part
and parcel of target systems

380
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:40,625
that they have and ergo
the density I'll take on it is no.

381
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:45,697
That particular approach
to modeling state transitions

382
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:51,036
and under DFP is precisely
that it's a kind of

383
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,540
its approach to the sort of it's
an approximation

384
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:59,578
with more scientific convenience
in order to say

385
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,614
something about how systems
occupy states over time.

386
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,684
But you shouldn't conflate
that particular perspective

387
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,254
with saying that's
naturally the case of target systems.

388
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,190
I'll skip

389
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,961
the last quote here just for time
considerations.

390
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,731
We can come back to this
if there's any issues.

391
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,903
OK, so let's turn with some examples
and some cases of this.

392
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,039
It's really a fallacy in
how to how to think about it.

393
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,308
And in terms of scientific realism,

394
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,047
though, in the paper we consider a bunch
of this sort of cases or examples.

395
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,851
We consider the notion of variation
of free energy.

396
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:44,823
We consider the Markov blanket formalism,
we consider

397
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,460
the role of Bayesian inference
in these sorts of formulations.

398
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,663
And then finally
we turn to consider the topic of obesity

399
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,367
for this particular presentation,
if you like.

400
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,669
We're only going to focus on

401
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,871
the first variation free energy,
and then the latter,

402
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,809
this is you, and perhaps we can come back
to the other cases in Q&A

403
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,081
OK, it strikes

404
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,652
us there's two different ways
of interpreting

405
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,756
the variation of free energy notation

406
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:21,726
primed here on the big consideration
that it seems as

407
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:26,364
if organisms are minimizing variation
of free energy in the long run.

408
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:31,236
So the formulation here would seems
however pervasive now in the literature,

409
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,539
is not, I think, a one way street.

410
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,341
This is a couple of options here
that we now

411
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,344
want to try to unpack, especially
because we're doing the presentation

412
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:40,545
and especially because

413
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:44,182
we've been prompted to do so,
I think by by a set of review comments.

414
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:45,116
But let's get into it.

415
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,486
This is the sort of first option,
if you like.

416
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,122
That's going to it's going to deliver

417
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,992
a set of reasons for thinking
that instrumental ism was the case.

418
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:55,327
And we're going

419
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,430
to push back on those particular reasons

420
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,534
so variation of free energy
is an information theoretic construction

421
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:06,872
used to compute how organisms
are able to resist decay by positing

422
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,474
variation of free energy.

423
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,512
Now, under the ATP,
for an organism to exist,

424
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,081
it must keep its states
within certain bounds.

425
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,884
OK, so that's the generic opener.

426
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,454
So I'll give you some examples now of the
IF formulation

427
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,223
sort of prompted
by this quote from fish then

428
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,060
is a mathematical formulation
of how the systems

429
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,931
to decay rem state and colleagues

430
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:38,703
to say this means the internal
and active states will look as if they're

431
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:42,574
trying to minimize the same quantity,
namely the surprise rule of states.

432
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:46,745
It constitutes the thing,
a particle or some creature.

433
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:51,783
So here we have the se
if statement they appear to perform

434
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,620
this this kind of minimization
of variation of free energy.

435
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,692
Similarly, in a 2019 paper and

436
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,131
any system that avoids
surprising exchanges

437
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:10,235
with the world will look as if it's
predicting, tracking and minimizing

438
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,872
the quantity called variation
or free energy on average and over time.

439
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,841
Now I've included this
because we're going to speak to this one,

440
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:20,946
this particular paper as a second option
for how to think of the acid formulation

441
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:25,116
and how perhaps the square acid
formulations with a kind of scientific

442
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,017
realism.

443
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,988
Venice 2020
the system does not actually predict

444
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,124
and so will minimize
the quantity called variation of energy.

445
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:38,096
But it really it looks as
if the probabilistic model merely tracks

446
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:42,100
certain real statistical relations
in the organism environment system.

447
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:47,138
So this particular reading here
is first meeting

448
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:51,843
the formulation of variation
free energy needs to scientific realism

449
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,380
about active inference
models under the P,

450
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:59,250
and it does so precisely
because we have to sort of treat systems

451
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,188
only as if we're actually minimizing
this particular quantity.

452
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:03,421
I can

453
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,292
just jump in on this a minute.

454
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,496
So the Rammstein quotes there
saying that what it looks

455
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:15,900
as if the system is
minimizing is surprising,

456
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:20,639
whereas von s it's to talking
about variation of free energy.

457
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:21,673
A good point.

458
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,710
So yeah, I think we could accept that.

459
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,980
It looks as if the system is minimizing
surprise.

460
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,883
All looks variation or free energy.

461
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,352
Is this bound on surprise? Well, yes.

462
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,556
So the round so quotes are actually
consistent with realism. Yes.

463
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,760
They could be read as allowing that

464
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,730
the system really does
minimize variation of the energy

465
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,702
and it looks as if in doing
so it's minimizing surprise or

466
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,172
perhaps we can come back to that
in the discussion

467
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,343
that Ramstad and colleagues are

468
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,713
necessarily
best read as endorsing instrumental ism

469
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,849
and I think

470
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,085
it's quite consistent
with realism, actually.

471
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,520
Yeah, no, I agree.

472
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,121
And I think we'll see that come out

473
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,024
recently explicitly.

474
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,959
We turn to the second option to step in.

475
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,463
If I don't if I don't actually manage
to pull that out explicitly.

476
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,965
Very good. Yeah.

477
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:26,171
So basically what we can now assume
is that variation of three energy on

478
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:30,842
this first reading
is a mathematical fiction.

479
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,911
At least that's what we're told.

480
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,113
These sorts of constructs
are useful fictions,

481
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,583
but they don't actually exist.

482
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,052
So how to think about that?

483
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,455
Because we, we tend to agree
with that particular point.

484
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:49,027
So you can think that variation
of three energy,

485
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,297
a bit like a Galilean frictionless plane,

486
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:55,166
for example, is a concrete entity

487
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,104
that has some mathematical concreteness
about it,

488
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,008
but it's not one
that actually exists in the system here.

489
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,610
The mass is not that territory.

490
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,113
So even though we can,

491
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,516
we can we can kind of think
of frictionless planes as being concrete

492
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:15,253
in one sort of sense of it's
mathematical concreteness

493
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,692
one wouldn't want to infer that that
Julian is a friction plane, for example,

494
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,661
that that would be, that would be false
and it would all to me.

495
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:27,232
And but in the bad sort of inferences

496
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,568
Now, here again,
we draw on the work of Gotham

497
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,837
Smith in order
to think sort of more generally

498
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:37,208
about the use of fictional entities
in the context of science more generally.

499
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,543
Here's what he says.

500
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,479
Generally speaking, he doesn't address
anything to do with the AFP.

501
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,115
Just to make that clear.

502
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,952
Now, fictions do not exist,
he says, but at least many of them

503
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:52,090
might have existed, and if they had,
they would have been concrete,

504
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,662
physical things located in space and time
and engaging in causal relations.

505
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,999
So that's kind of counterfactual test.

506
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,768
You can run on fictional entities
and science

507
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,538
from the point of view given you

508
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,742
now you can say fictional entities
such as variation or free energy

509
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,379
that might lack actual existence
and target systems

510
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:19,050
can be useful for understanding
target systems nevertheless.

511
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,387
So you might say that

512
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,456
active inference models
provide insight into the workings

513
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,660
of biological systems, for instance,
would help helping to understand

514
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,264
what a system has to do
in order to maintain homeostasis.

515
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,135
You can also say something
like the following, namely

516
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,605
that under a kind of patient
interpretation

517
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,374
of how one minimizes
this particular quantity,

518
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:48,546
you can draw some similarities
to how that so how to price

519
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:52,884
is minimized in actual target systems
by understanding something

520
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,753
about the minimization
of variation of free energy.

521
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,225
So there's a kind of similarity relation
one can draw between the positive

522
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,962
or fictional entities
in the theoretical models

523
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,332
and then what actual
target systems are doing

524
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,769
now, just to give you a

525
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,139
sense of it so motivated by active
inference models on the day

526
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,244
he time colleagues say the following
about the significance of their work

527
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,144
on active inference.

528
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,513
I'll just give you the quote
and you can kind of see this.

529
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,618
This is coming in to
to to being very brief

530
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,923
we use Magnetoencephalography

531
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:35,760
Graphy in combination with eye
tracking to assess the neural correlates

532
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,465
of form of short term memory
doing a cancelation task using dynamic

533
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,968
modeling to quantify changes
in effective connect connectivity,

534
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,273
we found evidence that the coupling
between the dorsal and ventral retention

535
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:52,210
networks change during this interrogation
of a simple visual scene.

536
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,246
Now, they say here
and I've highlighted this intuitively,

537
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,850
this is consistent with the idea
that these neuronal connections

538
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,620
may encode beliefs about what
I would see if I were sort of there

539
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,292
and that this mapping is optimized,
this new data obtained with each fixation

540
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,763
so the idea here
is that fictional entities

541
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:16,868
such as variation or free energy
allows for a further understanding

542
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:20,672
of target systems by making precise
how target systems

543
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:25,610
may minimize free energy, whether or not
that be variation for energy or

544
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:27,745
expected free

545
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,848
energy
in the sense of minimizing this appraisal

546
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:34,485
and not directly in the sense
of minimizing these two notations

547
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,423
so the summary here

548
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:41,759
that we give in the article

549
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,929
is that the F comprises

550
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:49,767
what is known as indirect representation
of the target system.

551
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:53,204
So it says something indirectly
about the operations of target systems,

552
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,740
even if it involves the use of abstract
entities.

553
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,610
It's an idealized approach,
sensing complex

554
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,913
or unknown processes in the world.

555
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,082
It's standard practice
to view scientific models

556
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,218
as indirect representations
of the real world target system.

557
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:12,023
Now, furthermore, most theoretical models
are composed of a set of mixed claims.

558
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,326
Now this is going
this is rather important for us

559
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:19,030
to sort of preserve
a notion of scientific realism

560
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,601
about the FDP, basically,
and we use the work of Spieler here.

561
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,805
This means that the model will posit,
if true, the presence of what

562
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:31,142
he calls both OK entity such as electrons
and their ilk

563
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:36,147
and supposedly non OK entities
such as numbers or theoretical ideals.

564
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,984
And we think this is something
like such a model.

565
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,054
So a model post or composed of mixed
claims,

566
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:47,725
it put forward all kinds of OK entities,
neurons, reflex acts, et cetera,

567
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,862
and perhaps what you might think of
as not OK

568
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,798
in such as the variation
or free energy notation

569
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,135
where non OK entities
has to be understood in terms

570
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,238
of not being literally
true of their target systems.

571
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,742
So this gets us to the second

572
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:09,547
formulation that Julien alludes
to, alluded to earlier of the S.F.

573
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,815
formulation.

574
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,217
Now, take us an example here

575
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,954
from Dan, it's 1996, both kinds of minds
and I think

576
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:20,825
thanks to an anonymous review here
for pointing this to this this idea

577
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,328
then it's so called Iberian creatures.

578
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:29,233
Now these creatures said to be able
to select from possible action policies,

579
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,203
although it's not put exactly in those
in those terms

580
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:36,841
in order to prune away inferior options
to avoid fatal consequences.

581
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,111
So in this sense these features
have some kind of in an environment

582
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,780
where they can select
among possible actions.

583
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,652
Now here's the tails of two densities
paper

584
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:51,322
that I coauthored with Max Ramstad in
and and

585
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:57,895
I'm not going to read you the quote here,
but the basic idea is going to be

586
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:03,134
something like this
that one can prune away unwanted action

587
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:08,906
policies by testing what kind of expected
sensory observations

588
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,744
one might encounter were one to elicit
certain kinds of actions.

589
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,513
But whether or

590
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:20,151
not one pulls away action,
all of this crucial part here

591
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:24,322
is that that kind of the least transition
if you will, of possible

592
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:28,092
sensory outcomes,
given certain kinds of actions,

593
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,863
can itself
be characterized in the fictional way

594
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,300
in a in a form of factionalism,
as Julia mentioned earlier,

595
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,070
that is entirely consistent
as far as we can tell.

596
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,006
And with scientific realism

597
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,077
so for the proper reason,

598
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,680
active inference feature, one can think
of trajectories pursued of a possible

599
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,650
action policies in terms of fictions,
as I just mentioned.

600
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,487
Now we come back to our formulations

601
00:35:56,787 --> 00:36:00,858
of fictional entities in science
from the previous couple of slides ago

602
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,596
now you might say that action
policies are concrete belief states,

603
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,664
but they're not actual.

604
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,033
They do not actually exist.
They do not actually exist.

605
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,302
Given that counterfactual,
hypothetical character

606
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,474
yet, were they to exist, they
would be actual with some causal powers,

607
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,043
there would be implications
for inferring one over the other

608
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,413
arguably some of the hypothesis

609
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,950
come to fruition and therefore exist

610
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,052
so what we have here is an

611
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,455
if formulation of the of FP explanations

612
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,425
that has a fictional characteristic
to it.

613
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,696
So part of the entities
that compose our explanations,

614
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,366
fictional entities,
but they're entirely consistent with

615
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:47,071
scientific realism about explanations
given the considerations

616
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,741
about the status of fictional entities
and science in general.

617
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,512
OK, so let's see, we've been going

618
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:58,683
for about 35 minutes, so start wrapping
this up so we can get to the Q&A.

619
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:02,286
Second case, one slide really quickly
about basically just,

620
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,257
just to get us thinking about this,
at least we can come back to it now

621
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,727
first and define
the circle DCT in the following way.

622
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,062
One can interpret

623
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:15,099
the average amount of time
a state is occupied as the probability

624
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,969
of a system being in that state

625
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,838
when it's observed at random. OK,

626
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:27,178
now Colombo and Palacios in this 20, 21
paper in biology and philosophy, they say

627
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:31,716
that they spaces of biological systems
are structurally unstable.

628
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,919
They're always changing
and unpredictable, unpredictable

629
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,056
making them non ergodic
there isn't a set of fixed states,

630
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,224
if you like, that

631
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,961
the system keeps returning to
if such a system is a biological system

632
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,397
on this particular account
by Colombian corrections.

633
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,002
Now they say that the FSP trades off

634
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,272
realism
for generality and mathematical precision

635
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,575
and they do so in a sense

636
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:02,413
to sort of put pressure on this idea
that the FSB can be

637
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,616
thought of in terms that are consistent
with scientific realism.

638
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:10,488
And it's true if you have you take a
the approach to the

639
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,357
as a generalized strategy to modeling

640
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,695
that the traits of realism for generality

641
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,831
and in the same time
maximizing mathematical precision.

642
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,068
But I think here's here's the twist

643
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,305
so this would be the first way
of responding to this particular claim.

644
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,407
If you turn the

645
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:33,077
p the mathematical structure
into a target directed system,

646
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:36,280
what we get here,
we get to work with specific systems.

647
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,850
So now you get to increase
the level of realism in your

648
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,487
in the relationship, if you like, between
your model and your target.

649
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,255
System.

650
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:49,427
A second way of thinking about this city
is that, yeah, OK, it's true

651
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,596
that they don't
they don't have biological plausibility

652
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:57,068
but you can think of this
as a convenient modeling assumption.

653
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:02,807
So the AFP doesn't claim that
biological systems are literally a gold

654
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,510
that's even a loosening in the literature
now to say locally ago

655
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,579
or there's even a further loosening.

656
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,282
So shifting to work with this city

657
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,352
entirely
to talk about commonness densities

658
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:18,789
and so on, where you can actually
still retain this kind of message,

659
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:23,160
stability, this level of change
and this degree of predictability

660
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,630
so to conclude,

661
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,265
arguments for instrumentalist

662
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,634
about the CEP, or at least
the ones that we are considering.

663
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,036
And so there's one or two.

664
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,072
We have not considered
trade on the Literalness fallacy.

665
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,074
They accept or affirm instrumentalist

666
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:40,845
on the grounds that the properties
of act of inference models under the AFP

667
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:43,347
do not literally map
onto biological systems

668
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,419
if we are correct,
then the subversion of scientific realism

669
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:57,228
that is alive and tenable option
with respect to the awesome.

670
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,130
Thank you.

671
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,600
OK, great times

672
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:07,505
perhaps for the first word,
we'll go to Julian.

673
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,908
Just feel free to maybe say hi,

674
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,945
give your first take and then we'll go
to the Acton Flap participants.

675
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,847
Yes. So thanks for having us.

676
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,350
It's going to be fun
to talk about this paper and

677
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,686
I think we should just jump straight
into the discussion rather than me.

678
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,689
Add anything onto what
Michael already said.

679
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,059
You gave an excellent
summary of the paper,

680
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,595
so let's see what you guys make of it.

681
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,667
OK, so age or beauty?

682
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,969
Where do we begin

683
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,606
Dave or Dean or Stephen?

684
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,408
Who would like to go first?

685
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,710
Stephen first, then either Dave or.

686
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,281
Well, I'd just like to say
thanks for the book

687
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,250
that you've published a few years ago,
about the Third Wave.

688
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,420
It was actually the key book
that kind of made me keep going

689
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,923
back to infants
after I first heard about it, because

690
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,226
it was a really, really cool,

691
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,796
nice to hear boundaries
because I've been looking at an active,

692
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,767
embodied approaches
and so that's the first piece.

693
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,905
And so in there
you talk about the idea of of blankets.

694
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:18,809
You're not dying, but the idea of things
being dynamic and changing.

695
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:23,180
And I'm curious
whether when you're thinking

696
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,016
about instrumentalists
and there's a there's a

697
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,821
there's some ways
that the danger of instruments isn't

698
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,692
is it starts to
everything gets referred back to math

699
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:39,630
and then the math isn't totally wrong
it's because it's instrumental.

700
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,500
And you of
it can be a kind of a challenge then

701
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,569
where you're trying to bring in the 40.
