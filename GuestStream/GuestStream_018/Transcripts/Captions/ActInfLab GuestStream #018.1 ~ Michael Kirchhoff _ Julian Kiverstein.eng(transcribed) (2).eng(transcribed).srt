00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,720
hello everyone

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
welcome to actin flab guest stream

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,679
number 18.1

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,120
we're here with

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,520
julian keverstein and michael kirchoff

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
as well as dave dean and steven from

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,520
actin flab

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
and we're really appreciative for the

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,640
authors for joining today to be

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,039
discussing some of their work we're

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,400
going to have

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,800
a presentation by the authors

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,960
and then following the presentation

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
we'll have ample time for discussion so

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
please feel free to write any questions

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
down in the live chat and we'll get to

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,719
it so without further ado

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,280
um julian and michael thanks a lot for

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,480
joining and

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,039
please take it away

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,879
thanks so much for inviting us we've

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,800
been we've been looking forward to this

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,160
particular session and thanks for

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
staying up late in the us and whoever

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,920
you are in europe for getting up early

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
it's only 3 30 in the afternoon here for

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,440
us so that's

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
more manageable in australia

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,360
i'll just share my screen

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,280
let's see and share

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,320
is that right yeah you guys can see that

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,880
bring that up

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
so that should all be clear in a second

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,960
is that right looks good

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,680
great um so the paper is called the

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,759
literalist fallacy and the free energy

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,960
principle

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,680
um it's a it's a philosophical

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
paper on the topic of scientific realism

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,439
scientific antiviralism instrumentalism

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,159
in the context of the fep or the free

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,600
energy principle

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,240
um i suppose just as a primer

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
this is a revised and resubmit stage

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
for our paper at this particular moment

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,840
in time

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,640
so any comments that we might be able to

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,960
get to further improve the quality of

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
the paper will of course be

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,439
welcomed

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
so let's let's start there will be a

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,560
little bit of i suppose conceptual stage

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,119
setting at the start just given the

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,598
nature of this particular paper and also

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,680
because it sort of speaks to a few other

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
issues that go beyond just a sort of

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
narrow focus on the free energy

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
principle

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
so this is the debate as it as it sits

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
or at least as we try to sketch it in

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
the paper

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
between scientific realism and

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,000
instrumentalism so let's just say

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
briefly what scientific realism is and

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,400
briefly what instrumentalism is and then

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,319
i'll we'll say a little bit more about

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,040
how to think about scientific realism

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
overall the point of the paper was to

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
sort of try to marshal a set of

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
arguments for why

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,040
at least a version of scientific realism

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,959
can be accommodated

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,400
by fep models

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
and it was motivated in part because it

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,480
seems like in the last few years there's

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,519
been a

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
there's been a flurry of papers

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,319
sort of in one way or another arguing

79
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,959
for scientific anti-realism with respect

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,879
to the fep or how to interpret parts

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,640
of that particular model so that's the

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,480
kind of that's the kind of setting we're

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,519
in

84
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,680
so scientific realism that's the view

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,239
that one reasonable goal for currently

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
best scientific theories

87
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,640
scientific models is to offer literally

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,760
true or probably true or approximately

89
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,959
true or probably approximately true

90
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,440
descriptions and explanations of target

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
systems i have here in bracket for

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,200
example natural phenomena

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,519
but it could also be artificial systems

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,760
in the context of artificial

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,599
intelligence artificial life for example

96
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,879
now by contrast then

97
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,080
instrumentalism or scientific

98
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,599
anti-realism

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,599
that's the view that scientific theories

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
and models are nothing but instruments

101
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
for prediction of observable behavior of

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,799
target systems

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
so here the the claim is something like

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
this um from an instrumentalist

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
perspective theory slash models they

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
have explanatory power

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
and that gets them some utility

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,799
but they're not in any in any sense of

109
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,360
the word truth producing so that one is

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,079
not to think about instrumentalists or

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,639
the instrumentalist position as uh

112
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,560
putting forth statements

113
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,479
about how the world is on the basis of

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,000
their models by which you can say

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,160
something say true or false about how

116
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,800
the world is

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
so the main question now is

118
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,120
for this particular paper we are

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
considering

120
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,360
is the fep truth producing in a way

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
that's consistent with scientific

122
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,479
realism

123
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
now one of course as i mentioned just a

124
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
minute or so ago we think it is indeed

125
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
consistent with a particular way of

126
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,520
conceiving of scientific realism

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
maybe a footnote here that's important

128
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
both scientific realism and

129
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
instrumentalism are quite

130
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
a multiple there's multiple different

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,560
versions of each particular uh framework

132
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
and that was it science so we're trying

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,840
to offer a reasonable general

134
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,720
characterization of these particular

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
frameworks in order to sort of get some

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,520
traction on the debate

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,560
so as i said there's a reasonable goal

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,080
of our best scientific theories and

139
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
models to offer these true or probably

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
true approximately two descriptions of

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
target systems

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,759
now here we we we draw inspiration from

143
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,600
peter guthrie smith

144
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,639
uh his book here erian reality that

145
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,720
tells us how perhaps to interpret that

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
particular general claim

147
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
he says the following he says it's a

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
mistake to express the scientific

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,440
realist position in a way that depends

150
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,280
on the accuracy of our current

151
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
scientific theories

152
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,840
so if we express scientific realism by

153
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,560
asserting the real existence of entities

154
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,639
recognized by science at this particular

155
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,240
point in time

156
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,080
then if those particular theories turn

157
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
out to be false well then the whole

158
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,000
framework of scientific realism turn out

159
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,479
to be false so we shouldn't think that's

160
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,639
what you have to do in order to advocate

161
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,720
for a kind of scientific

162
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,199
realism about scientific models theories

163
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,880
and their relation to target systems

164
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,120
so building on this we can say

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,199
so again this notion here is that an

166
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,120
actual unreasonable aim of science is to

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,360
give us these accurate descriptions well

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,199
that's not the claim that scientific

169
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,759
theories must be true now

170
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,840
and make truth producing claims about

171
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,319
target systems now i mean it's a nice

172
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,759
thing if they do but it is not a

173
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,319
necessary condition for

174
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,400
for one to adopt scientific realism

175
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,840
about scientific theories models

176
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
there's no commitment to the success of

177
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,199
the individual sciences so there can

178
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
there can be trouble in biology but we

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
can still hold for instance uh

180
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
scientific realism about for instance

181
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
the fep applied to the cognitive

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,520
sciences for example

183
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
now importantly and this is and this is

184
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,880
why i'm just spending a little bit of

185
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,039
time initially on scientific realism

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
the kind of version of scientific

187
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,199
realism we're interested in

188
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
is going to allow for theories and

189
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
models to posit

190
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,280
idealization for instance understood as

191
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,000
distortions

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,720
approximations

193
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,479
understood here is perhaps

194
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,520
inexactness of scientific models

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,240
they can propose fictional

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
entities for instance

197
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,800
entities that are not actual

198
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
and thus like in the here and now but

199
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,599
the important point is that

200
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,400
you can keep that view and still endorse

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,199
scientific realism because

202
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,919
one aspect here is that the long

203
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,000
term aim

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
of working with your scientific models

205
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,120
is for them to become truth-producing or

206
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,160
to become

207
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
more and more aligned with

208
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
the target systems that we're interested

209
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,520
in

210
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,039
and we'll finesse this viewer sort of

211
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,520
move along

212
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,960
now this issue between the scientific

213
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,360
realist and the instrumentalist as we

214
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,000
are considering it in the context of the

215
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
fep that comes up

216
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
when we consider what we

217
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,440
call

218
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,560
the map problem and this is not a term

219
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879
of art that we have invented the other

220
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,280
authors in the both in the fep and

221
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,199
elsewhere that make use of this for

222
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,360
instance mel andrews in her nice paper

223
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,640
from 2021 in biology and philosophy that

224
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,559
speaks of this particular problem

225
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,719
so this is just a quote from the paper

226
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,200
that gets thinking about what our focus

227
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,159
is

228
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,519
so we're going to ask what is the

229
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
relationship between scientific models

230
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,080
constructing using the fep

231
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
and the realities these models purport

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,839
to represent

233
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,240
our focus is especially on the fep and

234
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
what if anything it tells us about the

235
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
system that is used to model and that

236
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,880
this is what we call the map problem

237
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
how does the map your theories your

238
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,519
models relate to the territory real

239
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,920
world target systems of which those

240
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,839
theories and models are maps

241
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
now if there's anybody joining on the

242
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,120
live stream um this is just a very brief

243
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,959
statement about what the free energy

244
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
principle says

245
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,959
julian and i and as well as ian are

246
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,640
working under the assumption that that

247
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,279
doesn't need to take long to introduce

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,920
that in this particular context

249
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
but very briefly then the ftp states

250
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,160
that a self-organizing system that tends

251
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
towards maintaining a non-equilibrium

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
steady state with its environment must

253
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,399
minimize free energy

254
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,640
where minimizing free energy at least

255
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,040
under a certain invasion interpretation

256
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,440
is to maximize model evidence

257
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
that is maximize the likelihood of some

258
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
data even a model of the system's

259
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
interactions with its environment

260
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,040
now how does the map problem arise in

261
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
the context of the fep

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,680
well it might arise if you're a say

263
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,000
a researcher working in artificial

264
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
intelligence and the aim is to build

265
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
robots that engage in active inference

266
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,120
for example

267
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,720
navigating or making decisions etc

268
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,560
so here the question becomes what's the

269
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,079
relationship between our fep model

270
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,320
understood as an active inference model

271
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,000
and then how

272
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,160
one engineers if you like

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
artificial agents to perform in

274
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,160
accordance with those particular models

275
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
what those models specifies in terms of

276
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,040
say

277
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,600
decision making belief updating and

278
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
selecting action policies for adaptive

279
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
behavior

280
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
a different way the map problem might

281
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
arise would be from the computational

282
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,959
neuroscientific perspective where one

283
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,040
might be interested in tracking

284
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
transitions across belief perhaps in

285
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
deep

286
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,600
generative models

287
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
and the map problem then is well how

288
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,279
does that

289
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,839
theoretical specification of free energy

290
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,399
minimization under active inference

291
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,200
how does that map onto what the brain

292
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,680
actually does in order to say shift from

293
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,760
beliefs to beliefs or to make decisions

294
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
about what to do in the world so that's

295
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
just a few examples of where this

296
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,240
particular issue becomes

297
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
prevalent

298
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,440
now

299
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
just to

300
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,399
situate this discussion a little bit

301
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,920
because there's a few tweaks and turns

302
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,839
in the paper and it's a large and

303
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,320
somewhat complex conceptual landscape

304
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,399
we're working in or at least it seems to

305
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,120
me

306
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,160
um we're just gonna try to situate this

307
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,920
a little bit more so you get a feel for

308
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,800
this

309
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,760
um

310
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,120
we got a nice reviewer comment uh that

311
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,000
sort of

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
introduces the issue here

313
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
so the comment is something like

314
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,639
if we take the free energy principle

315
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,600
like

316
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,760
many other theories across different

317
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,360
sciences then we can think about that as

318
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
a kind of model based approach to

319
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,560
science

320
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
and if you look at the little image over

321
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,560
here which is a modification of ears

322
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
uh sort of a little description of how

323
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
this works modified by graffiti smith in

324
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,800
the 2009 paper

325
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
we can initially start to develop a

326
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
description of a model

327
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,160
and to say something about what the

328
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
model system in question is

329
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,000
and the comment is something like this

330
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,160
we can study models for their own sake

331
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,800
as andrews has pointed out male as i

332
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
referred to earlier

333
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,680
any model that can be treated

334
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,279
realistically can also be treated

335
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,279
instrumentally scientists can disagree

336
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,800
about which bits of the model are meant

337
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
to be real

338
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
now this is important

339
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,079
in understanding how the map problem

340
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,240
arises so andrew's in the 2021 paper

341
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
gives us a whole list of different ways

342
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,519
one can see

343
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
the kind of mathematical structure

344
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,440
of the fep

345
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,240
being

346
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,600
interpreted as a scientific model

347
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
the work of michael weisberg is

348
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
influential

349
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,480
in the context of philosophy of science

350
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,639
philosophy of biology

351
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,680
so

352
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,920
she and he they can with sort of a

353
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
minimally three different models that

354
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,600
we're interested in the fab essay sort

355
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,399
of target less model the ftp is a

356
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,880
generalized model and then the fep is a

357
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
target directed model

358
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,120
now you can work purely on the

359
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
mathematics if you like of the free

360
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,040
energy principle

361
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
for the sake of just understanding the

362
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,440
model for getting your model description

363
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,680
right of your model system as per that

364
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,040
image

365
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
now here the point is that

366
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,120
that in and of itself

367
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
doesn't give rise to anything like the

368
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
map problem because you can disagree you

369
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
can come at that that work from an

370
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
instrumentalist perspective you can come

371
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,639
at it from a scientific realist

372
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
perspective but doing that kind of work

373
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,519
doesn't really allow you to adjudicate

374
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
between the two positions or so it seems

375
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,880
to us

376
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,399
so that would be the instance of a

377
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,680
target-less

378
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,440
model you're not asking questions that

379
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,959
relate from the model to a target system

380
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,120
you can treat the fpp as a generalized

381
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,000
model you can perhaps think of it as you

382
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
could model

383
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,120
theories natural selection

384
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,199
from the point of view of the fep but we

385
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,560
are not saying anything about the

386
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,240
evolvement of any particular kind of

387
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,320
species

388
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
that maps on to for instance a different

389
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240
discussion as well which we consider but

390
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,920
we won't talk to unless it comes up in

391
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,040
the q a

392
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,120
about the role of the markov blanket

393
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,320
notation

394
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,480
now as we put it in the paper that gives

395
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
you a kind of generalized approach for

396
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
delineating boundaries but it doesn't

397
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,199
give you a approach for delineating

398
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,440
boundaries for any particular individual

399
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
in that sense it's a generalist take on

400
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,000
fep models on the basis of the markov

401
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,399
magnetic formulation

402
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
now the map problem first gets

403
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,279
interesting when you pursue a target

404
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
directed model

405
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
when you try to implement the

406
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,120
mathematical structures positive by the

407
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,240
fep in terms of a process theory such as

408
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,760
active inference

409
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,680
so you're sort of moving from a

410
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
mathematically general characterization

411
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,120
of the adaptive behavior to specifying

412
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,440
what a particular individual or a set of

413
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,800
individuals must do in order to engage

414
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,720
adaptively in the world so you start

415
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
committing yourself to an act to to

416
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,279
getting the sort of the right-hand side

417
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,600
of this this model uh or this little

418
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
image if you like uh saying something

419
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,720
about in which way do your model now

420
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,160
resemble the systems that you're

421
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,199
actually

422
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,279
aiming to explain or understand

423
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,920
something about

424
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,199
okay

425
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,360
so we should so once we have that we

426
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,040
should give the argument for the

427
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,720
instrumentalists

428
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,800
and then once we've done that we'll see

429
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,639
the kind of problem that we raise for

430
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,480
the instrumentalists that we think is a

431
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,600
kind of

432
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
a fallacy of inference

433
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,680
from certain considerations to certain

434
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,880
claims about the feb

435
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,759
so premise one here is that active

436
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,560
inference models on the under the fep

437
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
introduce distortions in representing

438
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,240
biological and cognitive systems

439
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,399
via idealizations

440
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,920
so one way to think about that might be

441
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,360
the introduction of variation of free

442
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
energy as a kind of distortion into the

443
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,519
framework in order to explain you know

444
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,160
it's kind of solve a computational

445
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,680
problem about how surprising it's

446
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
minimized

447
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,880
as well as in exactness via approximate

448
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,199
and one example might be something like

449
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,120
introducing this idea that

450
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,720
free energy minimization can be

451
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,279
construed mathematically as

452
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,920
akin to a kind of bayesian inference

453
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,639
would be an inexactness introduced into

454
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,800
the formalism

455
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
primarily because

456
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,399
well so it seems nobody thinks that the

457
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,639
brain quite literally

458
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,959
encodes something like basis theorem

459
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,199
okay premise two then is that scientific

460
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,959
realism requires that models provide

461
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,720
descriptions with target systems that

462
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,680
are literally true

463
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,519
so that's a

464
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,599
somewhat of a denial if you like uh if

465
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,039
you were the whole scientific realism

466
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,359
with respect to premise one

467
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,799
premise three then is that active

468
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,400
inference models are not true and

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,640
accurate representations of biological

470
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
and cognitive systems precisely because

471
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,839
of the issues raised in premise one

472
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,919
therefore active inference models are

473
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,760
false

474
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,799
there are best useful fictions

475
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,240
and

476
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,919
just to give you the references of where

477
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,240
we are drawing work from in terms of

478
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,880
defining the term idealization and the

479
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,760
term approximation here we're using a

480
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,160
nice paper by mcmullen on galilean

481
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,679
idealizations to think about

482
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,760
idealization and we are using a

483
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,240
canonical paper by norton to define

484
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
approximation

485
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,640
these are somewhat contentious

486
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,320
primarily because there's

487
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,840
as one might expect there's all kinds of

488
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,440
other takes on it but you have to come

489
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,799
down on one one side i suppose

490
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,440
so once we have the instrumentalist

491
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,600
claim up and running this is the kind of

492
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,200
fallacy that we're arguing that a set of

493
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,559
set of papers

494
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,720
defending instrumentalism in the context

495
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,520
of the fep is making and we coined the

496
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,080
literalist fallacy and just the prime

497
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,840
use though

498
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,760
premise two here is the claim that

499
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
scientific realism requires that models

500
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
provide descriptions of target systems

501
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,559
that are literally true hence the claim

502
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,160
the literalist fallacy because we're

503
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,400
going to show that's

504
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,720
that's not a necessary condition upon

505
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,960
which the base one's

506
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,720
defense

507
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,440
of scientific realism

508
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,080
so what we say is the mistake the

509
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
literalist fallacy is the mistake of

510
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,280
accepting or affirming about the fep

511
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,720
from the fact that active influence

512
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,480
model cannot literally map onto

513
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,919
biological and cognitive systems

514
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,840
a slightly different formulation that we

515
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
have here is that in this context of the

516
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
fep some find apparent discrepancies

517
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
between the map and the territory a

518
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,760
compelling reason to defend

519
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,919
instrumentalism about the fep and we

520
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,679
take that to be problematic

521
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,799
given this particular kind of fallacy

522
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,720
we identify this particular fallacy by

523
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
those defending instrumentalism about

524
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,679
the fep and we call it the little

525
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,320
fallacy here's this the second variation

526
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
of it if you like this is the fallacy of

527
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
inferring the truth of instrumentalism

528
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
based on the claim that the properties

529
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,799
of fep models do not literally map onto

530
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,000
real world target systems so so one one

531
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
question that might be interesting to

532
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,160
discuss in the q a is whether or not it

533
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,240
is indeed the problem for a

534
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
instrumentalist to infer the truth of

535
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
their own position on the basis of the

536
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,480
claim that the properties of fep models

537
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,960
do not map literally map onto real world

538
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,840
target systems

539
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,919
so the pushback here on the second

540
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,600
formulation is something like this

541
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
instrumentalists are not asserting the

542
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,039
truth of their own position that would

543
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,520
be self-contradictory

544
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,280
now there's a set of conceptual issues

545
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
here but i just wanted to flag the issue

546
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
and perhaps come back to it in the q a

547
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
it would take us too long to get into it

548
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,799
and they did somewhat philosophically

549
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,880
conceptual

550
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
here's some here's some evidence that

551
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
you like uh a set of papers across some

552
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
different topics that

553
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,200
that

554
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,760
we arguing are all committing this this

555
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,280
kind of fallacy

556
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,640
is a 2020 paper by venice and polito

557
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,039
that state they said that it remains

558
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,120
quote it remains disputed

559
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,760
whether it's the fep statistical models

560
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,600
or scientific tools to describe

561
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
non-equilibrium steady-state systems

562
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
which we call the instrumentalist

563
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,480
reading or are literally implemented and

564
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,720
utilized by those systems the so-called

565
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
realist reading and what they're going

566
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,120
to conclude is that since fep models are

567
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,880
not true and accurate descriptions of

568
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,200
these target systems instrumentalism

569
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,600
turns out to be the only option so for

570
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,919
us that's a lit that's the literalist

571
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,919
fallacy because it assumes

572
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,000
that the realist decision is

573
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
that your theoretical models literally

574
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,919
have to be implemented in target systems

575
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,600
for that kind of framework and the

576
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,520
philosophy of science to be up and

577
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,840
running

578
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,039
we're in about adele 2021 presumably

579
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,679
updated 2022 at some point this year in

580
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,320
their target article in bbs

581
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,440
focused on the ontological status of the

582
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
markov blanket formulism in the fep

583
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
now they argue that much of the

584
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
literature on the fep implies that

585
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,640
organisms literally instantiate the

586
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,480
mathematical structure of markov

587
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
blankets

588
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,679
they argue that such a use of the

589
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,240
formulism conflates a model with its

590
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,080
target system

591
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,480
now if you think that in order to use

592
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,159
the markov blanket formalism

593
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,240
productively even from the scientific

594
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,159
realist point of view that the

595
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,080
mathematical formulation of that

596
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,400
particular formula has to be implemented

597
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
in the actual target system

598
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,840
then you're permitting the literalist

599
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,360
fallacy because even the scientific

600
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,120
realist is going to push back against

601
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,360
that

602
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,600
colombo and palacios in a 2021 article

603
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,679
in biology and philosophy target the

604
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,960
issue of herbal dicity in the fep namely

605
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
that one can realistically model

606
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,360
biological systems as having anagrotic

607
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,000
density now they deny that ergodicity

608
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,840
captures properties of biological

609
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,000
systems and therefore the fep is

610
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,720
biologically implausible now the line on

611
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,280
that is that's that's a kin or a species

612
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,440
of the literalist fallacy precisely

613
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,159
because it's going to assume that the

614
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,320
theorists actually think

615
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,000
that it's part and parcel of target

616
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,159
systems that they have an ergodic

617
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,280
density

618
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,000
our take on it is no that particular

619
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,039
approach

620
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,240
to modeling uh state transitions

621
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,919
uh under the fep is a precisely that

622
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,919
it's it's a kind of um

623
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,559
it's a problem it's a sort of a it's an

624
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,400
approximation

625
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,480
scientific convenience

626
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,400
in order to say something about how

627
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,799
systems occupy states over time but you

628
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,039
shouldn't conflate that particular uh

629
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,960
perspective with saying that's literally

630
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,120
the case of target systems

631
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,159
i'll skip the last quote here

632
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,400
just for time considerations we can come

633
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,640
back to if there's

634
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,039
there's any issues

635
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,039
okay let's turn to some examples and

636
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,400
some cases

637
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,039
of this literalist fallacy and how to

638
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,200
how to think about it than in terms of

639
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
scientific realism

640
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,760
so in the paper we consider a bunch of

641
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,400
these sort of cases or examples we

642
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,440
consider

643
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,480
the notion of variational free energy

644
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,000
we consider the markov blanket formulism

645
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,320
we consider the role of bayesian

646
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,400
inference in these sorts of formulations

647
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,320
and then finally we turn to consider the

648
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
topic of ergodicity

649
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,799
now for this particular uh presentation

650
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,600
if you like we're only going to focus on

651
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
the first variation of free energy and

652
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
then the latter epididy and perhaps we

653
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,840
can come back to the other cases in q a

654
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,919
okay

655
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,520
um

656
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,679
it strikes us there's two different ways

657
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,640
of

658
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,120
interpreting

659
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,240
the variational free energy notation

660
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
primed here under the consideration that

661
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,240
it seems as if organisms are minimizing

662
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,559
variational free energy in the long run

663
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,400
so the as if formulation here which

664
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,559
seems ever pervasive now in the

665
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,159
literature um is not i think a one-way

666
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,840
street there's a couple of options here

667
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,360
that we now want to try to unpack

668
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,640
especially because we're doing the

669
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,480
presentation and especially because

670
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,559
we've been prompted to do so i think by

671
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,559
by a set of revenue comments but let's

672
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,559
get into it this is the sort of first

673
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,159
option if you like

674
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,039
that's gonna that's gonna deliver

675
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,559
a set of reasons for thinking that

676
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,799
instrumentalism is the case for the fep

677
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,240
and we're gonna push back on those

678
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,400
particular reasons

679
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,640
so uh variational free energy is an

680
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,799
information theoretic construction used

681
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,880
to compute how organisms are able to

682
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,000
resist decay by positing a variation of

683
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,720
free energy in an aquaponic rival

684
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,960
now under the fep for an organism to

685
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
exist it must keep its states within

686
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,559
certain bounds

687
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,799
okay so that's the generic opener

688
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,799
so i'll give you some examples now of

689
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,960
the as if formulation uh sort of

690
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,919
prompted by this quote from fristen the

691
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,000
ftp is a mathematical formulation of how

692
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,320
adaptive systems is natural

693
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,679
to decay

694
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,720
ramps that and colleagues 2020 paper say

695
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
this means that internal and active

696
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,400
states will look as if

697
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
they're trying to minimize the same

698
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,159
quantity namely the surprise law of

699
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,559
states it constitutes the thing a

700
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,279
particle or some preacher

701
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,159
so here we have the as if statement

702
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,200
they appear to perform this this kind of

703
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
minimization of variation of free energy

704
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,559
similarly in a 2019 paper um

705
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,520
any system that avoids surprising

706
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,840
exchanges with the world will look as if

707
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,240
it's predicting tracking and minimizing

708
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,840
a quantity called variational free

709
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,640
energy on average and over time now i've

710
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,919
included this because we're going to

711
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,000
speak to this one this particular paper

712
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,840
as a second option for how to think of

713
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
the acid formulation and how perhaps the

714
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,480
square acid formulations with a kind of

715
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,960
scientific realism

716
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,200
then as 2020 the system does not

717
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,440
actually predict infer track or minimize

718
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,720
the quantity called variational free

719
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,679
energy but it merely looks as if the

720
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,159
probabilistic model merely tracks

721
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,159
certain real statistical relations in

722
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,600
the organism environment system

723
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,400
so this particular reading here this

724
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,880
first reading the as if formulation of

725
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,720
variation of free energy leads to

726
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,200
scientific realism about active

727
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,840
inference models under the fep

728
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
and it does so essentially because we

729
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,000
have to sort of treat systems only as if

730
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,760
but not actually minimizing this

731
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,159
particular quantity

732
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,440
yeah

733
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,840
just jump in on this a minute so the

734
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,480
ramstead quotes there are saying that uh

735
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,200
what it looks as if the

736
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,000
system is minimizing is surprisal

737
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,919
whereas van s

738
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,159
shifts to talking about variational free

739
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,679
energy

740
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,520
so um

741
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,320
yeah

742
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
i think we could accept that it looks as

743
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,919
if the system is minimizing surprisal

744
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,240
because variational free energy is this

745
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,120
bound on surprisal yes so the ramstead

746
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
quotes are actually consistent with

747
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,240
realism

748
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,720
yes that they could be read as allowing

749
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,679
that

750
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,399
the system really does minimize

751
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,559
variational free energy and it looks as

752
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,600
if

753
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,520
in doing so it's minimizing surprisal

754
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,279
so perhaps we can come back to that in

755
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,720
the discussion

756
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,240
yeah i don't think that ramsteid and

757
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,399
colleagues are

758
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,640
necessarily best read as endorsing

759
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
instrumentalism

760
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,679
um

761
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,799
i think

762
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,559
it's quite consistent with realism

763
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,600
actually

764
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,440
yeah no i agree and i i think we'll see

765
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
that come out i sort of

766
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,600
recently explicit when we turn to the

767
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,360
second option to just step in if i don't

768
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,120
if i don't actually manage to pull that

769
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,279
out uh explicitly

770
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,880
very good yeah

771
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,760
so

772
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,640
basically what we can now assume is that

773
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,120
variational free energy under this first

774
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,520
half reading is a

775
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,760
mathematical fiction at least that's

776
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,440
what we're told these sorts of

777
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,080
constructs are used for fictions uh but

778
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,559
they do not actually exist

779
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,960
so how to kind of think about that then

780
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640
because we we tend to agree with that

781
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,440
particular point

782
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,399
so

783
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,399
you can think that variational free

784
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,279
energy a bit like a galilean

785
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,600
frictionless plane for example

786
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
is a concrete entity

787
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,000
as in it has some mathematical

788
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
concreteness about it

789
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,640
but it's not one that actually exists in

790
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,960
target systems here the mass is not the

791
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,559
territory

792
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,080
so even though we can

793
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,679
we can we can kind of think of friction

794
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,000
as planes as being concrete in one sort

795
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,640
of sense of its mathematical

796
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,919
concreteness

797
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,919
one wouldn't want to infer that that

798
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,120
julian is a frictional plane for example

799
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,880
that that would be that would be false

800
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,320
and it would ultimately end up in in a

801
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,600
bad set of inferences

802
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,080
now here again we draw on the work of

803
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,000
guthrie smith in order to think sort of

804
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,760
more generally about the use of

805
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,080
fictional entities in the context of

806
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,000
science more generally but here's what

807
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,760
he says generally speaking he doesn't

808
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,000
dress anything to do with the fep

809
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
just to make that clear

810
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,960
now fictions do not exist he says but at

811
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,600
least many of them might have existed

812
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,440
and if they had they would have been

813
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,480
concrete physical things located in

814
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,960
space and time and engaging in causal

815
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,559
relations

816
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,960
so it's kind of counterfactual test

817
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,279
you can run on fictional entities and

818
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,880
science from the point of view given

819
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,720
here

820
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,880
now you can say fictional entities such

821
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,200
as variation or free energy

822
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,360
that might lack actual existence and

823
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,880
target systems

824
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,520
can be useful for understanding target

825
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,720
systems nevertheless

826
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,200
so you might say that active inference

827
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,360
models provide insight into the workings

828
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,440
of biological systems for instance with

829
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
helping to understand what a system has

830
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,320
to do in order to maintain homeostasis

831
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,159
you can also say something like the

832
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,080
following meaning that

833
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,039
under a kind of basian interpretation of

834
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,799
how one minimizes this particular

835
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,360
quantity you can draw some similarities

836
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,720
to how that

837
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,760
to how um surprisal is minimized in

838
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,399
actual target systems by understanding

839
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,559
something about the minimization of

840
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,399
variational free energy but there's a

841
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,120
kind of similarity relation one can draw

842
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,360
between depositing or fictional entities

843
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,240
in

844
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,960
the theoretical models and then what

845
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,200
actual target systems are doing

846
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,120
now

847
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,640
just to give you a sense of this so

848
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,880
motivated by active inference models on

849
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
the dfep par and colleagues say the

850
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,640
following about the significance of

851
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,480
their work on active inference i'll just

852
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,080
give you the quote and you can kind of

853
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,919
see this this is coming in

854
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,559
to to to being so in brief

855
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,399
we use magno in circular graphic graphy

856
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,320
in combination with eye tracking to

857
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
assess the neural correlates a form of

858
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,720
short term memory doing a dot uh

859
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,640
cancellation task using dynamic

860
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,240
remodeling to quantify changes in

861
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,720
effective connect connectivity

862
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
we found evidence that the coupling

863
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,159
between the dorsal and ventral attention

864
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,919
networks changed during the psychotic

865
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,720
interrogation of a simple visual scene

866
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,320
now they say here and i've highlighted

867
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,640
this intuitively this is consistent with

868
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,799
the idea that these neuronal connections

869
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,039
may encode beliefs about what i would

870
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
see if i were to look there and that

871
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,440
this mapping is optimized new data are

872
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,000
obtained with each fixation

873
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,960
so the idea here is that fictional

874
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,000
entities such as variational free energy

875
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
allows for the further understanding of

876
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,679
target systems by making precise how

877
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,799
target systems may minimize free energy

878
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,399
whether or not that be variational free

879
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,880
energy or

880
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,480
expected free energy

881
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,080
in the sense of minimizing their

882
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,399
surprisal and not directly in the sense

883
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,399
of minimizing these two notations

884
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,039
so the summary here that we give in the

885
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,279
article is that

886
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,799
the fep comprises what is known as

887
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,360
indirect representation of a target

888
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,200
system so it says something indirectly

889
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,120
about the operations of target systems

890
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,200
even if it involves the use of abstract

891
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,880
entities

892
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,039
it's an idealized approach representing

893
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,960
complex or unknown processes in the

894
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,840
world

895
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,200
it's standard practice to view

896
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
scientific models as indirect

897
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,799
representations of the real world target

898
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,440
system now furthermore most theoretical

899
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,519
models are composed of a set of mixed

900
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,240
claims now this is going this is rather

901
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,440
important for us to sort of preserve a

902
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,360
notion of scientific realism about the

903
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,799
fdp

904
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,039
basically and we use the work of spiel

905
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,480
out here

906
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,399
this means that the model will pass it

907
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,159
if through the presence of what he calls

908
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,559
both okay entities such as electrons and

909
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,200
their ilk and supposedly non-okay

910
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,440
entities such as numbers or theoretical

911
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,559
ideals

912
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,200
now we think the fvp is something like

913
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
such a model it's a model posed or

914
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,679
composed of mixed claims

915
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,360
it put forward all kinds of okay

916
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,320
entities neurons reflex acts etc and

917
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,240
perhaps what you might think of as

918
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,559
non-ok entities such as the variational

919
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,200
free energy notation where non-okay

920
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,039
entities has to be understood in terms

921
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,279
of not being literally true of their

922
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,159
target systems

923
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,840
so this gets us to the second

924
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,600
formulation that julian alludes to

925
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,520
alluded to earlier of the asif

926
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,280
formulation

927
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,599
now take us an example here from

928
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,719
dennett's 1996 book kinds of minds and i

929
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,560
think thanks to an anonymous reviewer

930
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,839
here for pointing us to this this idea

931
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,399
then it's so-called screeches

932
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,800
now these creatures are said to be able

933
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,280
to select from possible action policies

934
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,199
although it's not put exactly in those

935
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,079
in those terms in order to prune away

936
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,918
inferior options to avoid fatal

937
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,079
consequences so in this sense these

938
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,520
creatures have some kind of inner

939
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,199
environment where they can select

940
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,239
amongst possible actions

941
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,520
now here's the

942
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,918
tales of two densities paper that i

943
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,440
co-authored with

944
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,839
max ramster and cal fistin

945
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,199
um

946
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,399
i'm not going to

947
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,639
read you the quote here but the basic

948
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,520
idea is going to be something like this

949
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,119
that one can prune away unwanted action

950
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,720
policies

951
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,920
by testing what kind of expected sensory

952
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,200
observations

953
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,480
one might

954
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,560
encounter will want to elicit certain

955
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,640
kinds of actions

956
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,960
but whether or not one prunes away

957
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,720
action policies

958
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,760
the crucial part here is that that kind

959
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,880
of beliefs transitioning over possible

960
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,599
sensory outcomes given certain kinds of

961
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,960
actions can itself be characterized in a

962
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,800
fictional way

963
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
in in in a form of fictionalism as julia

964
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
mentioned earlier that is entirely

965
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,400
consistent as far as we can tell um

966
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,160
with scientific realism

967
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,800
so for the puberian active inference

968
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,560
feature one can think of trajectories

969
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,640
and suit over possible action policies

970
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,359
in terms of fictions as i just mentioned

971
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,599
and now we come back to our our

972
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,320
formulations of a fictional entities and

973
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,079
science from a previous from a couple of

974
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,839
slides ago

975
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,079
now you might say that action policies

976
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,839
are concrete belief states but they're

977
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,839
not actual they do not actually exist

978
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,359
they do not actually exist given their

979
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,800
counterfactual hypothetical

980
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,200
characteristics

981
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,800
yet whether to exist they would be

982
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,560
actual with some causal powers there

983
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,400
will be implications for inferring one

984
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,880
over the other

985
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
arguably some of the hypotheses come to

986
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,160
fruition and therefore exist

987
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,320
so what we have here is an sf

988
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,520
formulation of the of fep explanations

989
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,240
that

990
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,280
has a fictional characteristic to it so

991
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,359
part of the entities that compose our

992
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,640
fep explanations are fictional entities

993
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,320
but they're entirely consistent with

994
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,560
scientific realism about fep

995
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,960
explanations given the considerations

996
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,599
about the status of fictional entities

997
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,320
and science in general

998
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,640
okay so let's see we've been going for

999
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,800
about yeah 35 minutes i'll start

1000
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,400
wrapping this up so we can get to the q

1001
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,960
a second case one slide really quickly

1002
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,040
about ergodicity just to just get us

1003
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,640
thinking about this at least we can come

1004
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,839
back to it

1005
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,720
now fristen defines ergodicity in the

1006
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,079
following way

1007
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,000
one can interpret the average amount of

1008
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,240
time a state is occupied as the

1009
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
probability

1010
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,079
of a system being in that state when

1011
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,839
it's observed at random

1012
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,160
okay now colombo and palacios in this

1013
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,720
2021 paper in biology and philosophy

1014
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,440
they say that phase spaces of biological

1015
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,760
systems are structurally unstable

1016
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,359
they're always changing and

1017
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,920
unpredictable unpredictable making them

1018
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,560
non-ergotic there isn't a set of fixed

1019
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,119
states if you like that the system keeps

1020
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,880
returning to if such a system is a

1021
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,640
biological system on this particular

1022
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,079
account by columbia and palacios

1023
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,040
now they say that the fep trades off

1024
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,760
realism for generality and mathematical

1025
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,839
precision

1026
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,880
and they do so in a sense to to to sort

1027
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,440
of put pressure on this idea that the

1028
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,839
feb can be thought of in terms that are

1029
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,240
consistent with scientific realism

1030
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,599
now it's true if you have you take a the

1031
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,079
approach to the fep as a generalized

1032
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,000
strategy to modeling

1033
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,880
that the fep trades off realism for

1034
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,800
generality and in the same time

1035
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,520
maximizing mathematical precision

1036
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,000
but i think here's here's the twist

1037
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,040
so this would be the first way of

1038
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,320
responding to this particular claim

1039
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,720
if you turn the fep the mathematical

1040
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,440
structure into a target directed system

1041
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,200
what we get here we get to work with

1042
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,119
specific systems so now you get to

1043
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,480
increase the level of realism in your

1044
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,240
in the relationship if you like between

1045
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,960
your model and your target system

1046
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,320
a second way of thinking about

1047
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,760
ergodicity is that yeah okay it be true

1048
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,119
that they don't map up they don't have

1049
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,119
biological plausibility

1050
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,440
but you can think of ergodicity as a

1051
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,640
convenient modeling assumption

1052
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,960
so the fap doesn't claim that biological

1053
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,280
systems are literally ergodic there's

1054
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,040
even the loosening in the literature now

1055
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,280
to saying locally ergodic or there's

1056
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,040
even a further loosening the shifting

1057
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,440
talk of ergodicity uh

1058
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,680
entirely to talk about kind of nest

1059
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,240
densities and so on we where you can

1060
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,440
actually still retain this kind of

1061
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,280
metastability this this level of change

1062
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,119
and this degree of unpredictability

1063
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,280
so to conclude arguments for

1064
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,440
instrumentalism about the fep at least

1065
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,720
the ones that we are considering i'm

1066
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,480
sure there's one or two we have not

1067
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,640
considered trade on the literalist

1068
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,160
fallacy they accept or affirm

1069
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,920
instrumentalism on the grounds that the

1070
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,000
properties of active inference models

1071
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
under the fep do not literally map onto

1072
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,200
biological systems

1073
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,880
if we are correct then there is a

1074
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,040
version of scientific realism that is a

1075
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,280
live and tenable option with respect to

1076
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,040
efep

1077
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,200
thank you

1078
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,000
awesome

1079
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,320
thank you

1080
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,760
okay

1081
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,200
great times

1082
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,560
um perhaps for the first word we'll go

1083
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,960
to julian just

1084
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,079
feel preach maybe say hi give your first

1085
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,920
take and then we'll go to the acting

1086
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,240
flab participants yeah so thanks for

1087
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,920
having us it's going to be fun to talk

1088
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,400
about this paper um i think we should

1089
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,920
just jump straight into discussion

1090
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,560
rather than me add anything onto what

1091
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,160
michael already said

1092
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,760
he gave an excellent summary of the

1093
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,040
paper

1094
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,520
so let's see what you guys make of it

1095
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,280
okay so age or beauty

1096
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,800
where do we begin

1097
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,000
um

1098
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,720
uh

1099
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,119
dave or dean or stephen who would like

1100
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,359
to go first all right stephen first and

1101
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,079
then either dave or

1102
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,000
well i'll just like say thanks for the

1103
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,160
book that you published a few years ago

1104
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,839
about the third wave it was actually the

1105
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,440
key book that kind of

1106
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,200
made me keep going with active inference

1107
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,760
after i first heard about it because uh

1108
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,480
so it was a really really cool supposed

1109
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,920
to hear boundaries because i've been

1110
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,960
looking at

1111
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,000
inactive embodied approaches and

1112
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,880
so just that's the first piece um

1113
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,200
and um so in there you talk about the

1114
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,280
idea of markov blankets you're not

1115
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,480
directly but the idea of things being

1116
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,079
dynamic and

1117
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,280
changing

1118
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
and um

1119
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,119
i'm curious whether when you're thinking

1120
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,200
about instrumentalism

1121
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,800
there's a there's a

1122
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,720
in some ways the

1123
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,760
the danger of instrumentalism or is it

1124
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,839
starts to everything gets referred back

1125
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,599
to maths

1126
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,520
and then the maths isn't tethered to

1127
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,240
reality because it's instrumental

1128
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,680
and you can't it can be kind of a

1129
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,079
challenge then as we try where we're

1130
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,560
trying to bring in the four e's

1131
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,920
um to think about well how how does

1132
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,800
this start to map onto

1133
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,000
the way that organisms are trying to get

1134
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,760
a grip on the world

1135
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,240
in a bit more of a literal sense outside

1136
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,599
of the model

1137
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,920
and so um

1138
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,839
yeah i'd be interested in your thoughts

1139
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,040
about

1140
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,560
this this question of um

1141
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,280
the the ability for

1142
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,599
um the modeling to

1143
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,119
be used in something almost a way to

1144
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,079
get into phenomenon that might be

1145
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,920
happening during this minimization

1146
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,920
process

1147
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,119
michael do you want to start

1148
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,480
i i i can start um

1149
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,000
well one i think one thing that's

1150
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,760
important there just stepping back and

1151
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,680
thanks for the nice words on on the book

1152
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,359
that's always a pleasure to hear

1153
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,720
the instrumentalist i suppose is is just

1154
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,599
sort of as i said making a truth

1155
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,920
claim is off the table for an

1156
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,040
instrumentalist partly because

1157
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,240
the definition of instrumentalism is

1158
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,359
the sort of not to put forward any kinds

1159
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,440
of statements about the world that can

1160
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,960
be true or false

1161
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,160
now they can say that you have

1162
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,800
observations

1163
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,720
you know you take in observations about

1164
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,520
how systems work and that's fine

1165
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,760
one one line there that's been pushed a

1166
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,839
bit in the literature now is to say well

1167
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,720
you can then you can be agnostic about

1168
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,200
whether those kinds of observations

1169
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,160
can sort of truthfully reflect or you

1170
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,960
know

1171
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,200
oppositely falsely reflect anything

1172
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,520
about the actual world

1173
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,839
now my sense is that and and this is

1174
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,440
just my sense that scientists

1175
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,880
given different

1176
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,359
tasks and activities questions and focus

1177
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,520
points will shift a bit

1178
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,839
between these and and that's in a sense

1179
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,240
why i had this notion of why we have

1180
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,960
this notion of of a targetless model

1181
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,319
i think precisely because that's the

1182
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,880
domain we we don't need to come down on

1183
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,119
one or the other side clearly the model

1184
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,680
for the sake of its for for gaining more

1185
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,880
understanding

1186
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,960
you know a nice example i was talking to

1187
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,920
an ecologist on the weekend is just

1188
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,000
thinking about these massive climate

1189
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,839
change models

1190
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,800
right with this hyper practical goal

1191
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,599
but yet they're so wonderfully complex

1192
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,920
that one spends one's career

1193
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,560
figuring out how the model works and

1194
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,280
that's and that's okay uh in a sense but

1195
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,160
i then shifting it and trying to answer

1196
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,480
uh your question

1197
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,319
i think some of the work that julian and

1198
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,520
i have been doing on the sort of ever or

1199
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,160
on occasion this is soften that shifting

1200
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,359
boundaries

1201
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,640
delineated by appeal to markov blankets

1202
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,280
tells us something concretely

1203
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,880
about such systems

1204
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,119
so we can start thinking a bit about the

1205
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,040
differences between say the spider and

1206
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,280
the spider web relative to with whether

1207
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,960
or not the australian or private has

1208
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
just eaten its web or whether it's

1209
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,040
producing its web so in that sense you

1210
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,160
might think

1211
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,599
that you know it's it's 7th sensory

1212
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,000
is shrinking and expanding depending on

1213
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,040
you know what time of day it is

1214
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,359
so yeah i might as and to add to that i

1215
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,760
i i'd like to think that

1216
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,200
but i'd like to think that it's the

1217
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,040
ambition of

1218
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,680
even theoretical neurobiologists

1219
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,480
or

1220
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,040
if you know from depending on the domain

1221
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
or issue they're targeting

1222
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,760
is to if you're working in the context

1223
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,800
of psychiatry on the basis of fep models

1224
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,000
do you want to understand something

1225
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,440
about

1226
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,240
well actual uh psychiatric disorders

1227
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,400
that we as human beings may

1228
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,599
may go through

1229
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,960
and then and you want to understand the

1230
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,720
the mechanisms of how that of how that

1231
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,240
works so you can intervene in the right

1232
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,440
kind of way now if you want to do that

1233
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,040
presumably you have to say something

1234
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,440
about how those mechanisms work

1235
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,079
and so you can you can quite literally

1236
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,000
as i said manipulate them if that's

1237
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,760
possible in one when one way or another

1238
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,359
anyway so that's my initial take on that

1239
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,720
i want to go in a slightly different

1240
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,800
direction on the how does

1241
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,640
the free energy principle relate to

1242
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,319
these ideas about

1243
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,920
embodied inactive extended cognition

1244
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,520
um

1245
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,800
well

1246
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,760
thomas

1247
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,200
van s and uh innis hippolyto

1248
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,440
both argue for

1249
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,920
an instrumentalist reading of the free

1250
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,640
energy principle in order to uh

1251
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,520
to show how it could be consistent with

1252
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,079
a non-representational understanding of

1253
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,520
cognition

1254
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,720
and so they are they're keen on avoiding

1255
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,560
the idea that the brain literally

1256
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,720
represents the world by

1257
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,599
encoding a generative model

1258
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,920
and the way that they avoid that

1259
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,599
interpretation of the free energy

1260
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,599
principle is by

1261
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,520
endorsing the claim that the free energy

1262
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,480
principle is just a useful fiction

1263
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,280
for modeling the brain

1264
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,560
um

1265
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,160
and we think there's a couple of

1266
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,040
different

1267
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,680
issues that are getting mixed up here

1268
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,640
so one is

1269
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,319
representational readings of the free

1270
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,000
energy principle and uh karl kristen

1271
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,400
often says that uh

1272
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,920
the brain

1273
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,839
um doesn't have a model but is a model

1274
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,880
that the organism as a whole

1275
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,119
is a model of its environment

1276
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,319
and here he's picking up on ideas from

1277
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,720
cybernetics like the the good regulator

1278
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,680
theorem

1279
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,599
the law of requisite uh variety is it

1280
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,359
from ashby

1281
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:37,890
um

1282
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,520
[Music]

1283
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,559
so

1284
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,599
that idea of the organism being a model

1285
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,359
of its environment

1286
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,960
um

1287
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,440
we think can be read in a realist way

1288
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,800
actually

1289
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,359
but but also as suggesting a a

1290
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,359
non-representationalism

1291
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,760
uh so this came up a little bit when

1292
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,000
uh michael was talking about pop aryan

1293
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,599
creatures

1294
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,640
where they're able to because of the

1295
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,680
deep

1296
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,319
uh hierarchical nature of the generative

1297
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,440
model

1298
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,920
and try out possibilities

1299
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,480
before they act on them

1300
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,880
and that's sometimes taken to imply in

1301
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,760
the in the philosophical literature

1302
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,880
that

1303
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,000
the

1304
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,800
organism if it's able to to

1305
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,720
do that kind of counter factual

1306
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,079
inference

1307
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,800
it must have some kind of model of these

1308
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,119
possible states of affairs

1309
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,240
that it's carrying out inference over

1310
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,960
and so that gets you back into a kind of

1311
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,599
um representational reading of the free

1312
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,000
energy principle again

1313
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,839
but uh

1314
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,680
we are offering uh

1315
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,440
an interpretation of the free energy

1316
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,280
principle where we take very seriously

1317
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,640
this idea that the organism is a model

1318
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,119
but doesn't have a model

1319
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,160
and

1320
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,760
and therefore that opens up the space

1321
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,480
for a realist interpretation

1322
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,559
of the free energy principle

1323
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,000
um that is also non-representationalist

1324
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,319
or inactive

1325
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,599
and

1326
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,079
and that's that i think the space that

1327
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,240
thomas fan s for instance thinks is not

1328
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,480
available to proponents of the free

1329
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,640
energy principle

1330
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,720
but rather than go into why we think

1331
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,400
he's wrong let's let me just stop there

1332
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,160
because i've said quite a lot already

1333
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,800
thank you for the responses

1334
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,680
so

1335
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,000
dean

1336
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,000
well i think i'll ask both gentlemen for

1337
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,200
your opinion on this i i think if

1338
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,760
if you set your argument up as

1339
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,240
a literal one

1340
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,680
you're gonna you're gonna find yourself

1341
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,359
into trouble because

1342
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,880
um

1343
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,920
i

1344
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,319
i think if this thing kind of gets

1345
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,680
resolved there's no debate if it's

1346
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,040
metaphorical

1347
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,400
because you have to have a minimum of

1348
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
two i mean with these markov blankets

1349
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,480
you got internal and external

1350
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,960
you need you need minimum of two just so

1351
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,880
that you have discrimination just so

1352
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,319
that you can tell

1353
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,880
variation in the world and that's what

1354
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,040
metaphors allow for so

1355
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,720
i'm just wondering

1356
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,800
why we're not arguing

1357
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,359
for both that it's the synthesis of the

1358
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,880
instrumentalist

1359
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,400
and that way to measure and filter

1360
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,880
what's in and what's out because we do

1361
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,319
measure that

1362
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,480
and and filter for that and also the

1363
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,800
relational piece i still like to bump

1364
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
into edges so i agree with you as an

1365
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,240
organism i am the model until i fall off

1366
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,400
the cliff right so

1367
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,480
if we if we looked at this as a metaphor

1368
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,960
instead of literally wouldn't that kind

1369
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,480
of

1370
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,079
at least smooth out some of the

1371
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,119
differences instead of versus

1372
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,839
its and this

1373
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,280
equals that

1374
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,000
in in a metaphorical sense what are your

1375
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,680
thoughts in that i don't think you can

1376
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,839
have both instrumentalism and realism

1377
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:02,880
although

1378
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,359
max ramstead has said things along those

1379
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,680
lines that he wants to try to well then

1380
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,800
i'm with max best of both worlds yeah

1381
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,880
but uh but the difficulty is that these

1382
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,520
positions actually come into conflict

1383
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,119
contradict each other

1384
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,280
because one says that the free energy

1385
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,319
principle

1386
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,359
does not

1387
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,839
map onto anything in the world so we

1388
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:24,880
can't

1389
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,160
make any

1390
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
claims based on the free energy

1391
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,599
principle about

1392
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,079
how cognitive biological systems are

1393
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,839
organized

1394
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,520
it's literally just a modeling tool

1395
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,440
so it can help us to predict make

1396
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,359
predictions about

1397
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,960
the behavior that we can observe of

1398
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,760
biological or cognitive systems but but

1399
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,599
the free energy principle

1400
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,640
doesn't correspond to doesn't map onto

1401
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,200
anything in the behavior or the

1402
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,520
organization of biological and cognitive

1403
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,079
systems and that to me seems in conflict

1404
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,520
with the idea that

1405
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,280
the organism is

1406
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,880
a generative model if you say the

1407
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,359
organism is a generative model then

1408
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,280
that seems to me to commit you to the

1409
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,400
idea that

1410
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,760
the free energy principle is describing

1411
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,079
something about how

1412
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,839
biological cognitive systems are

1413
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,680
organized and therefore

1414
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,079
it's uh it's so

1415
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,079
it ought to be construed in realist

1416
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,240
terms not in instrumentalist terms now

1417
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,000
you said something else about metaphor

1418
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,800
there

1419
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,520
yeah science introduces all kinds of

1420
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,800
metaphors

1421
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,960
and i think that that introduces a kind

1422
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,760
of

1423
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,319
distinct set of issues really

1424
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,800
from the instrumentalism and

1425
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,760
versus realism debate because we can

1426
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,680
still ask for how do we interpret those

1427
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,040
metaphors

1428
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,119
so no doubt it's true that science

1429
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,559
engages in

1430
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,040
metaphorical talk all the time

1431
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,720
but it is once you get into the question

1432
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,800
of how to interpret the metaphors that

1433
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,920
then

1434
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,240
the realism instrumentalism issue comes

1435
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,000
back again

1436
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,200
so can i just

1437
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,599
do one quick follow-up if i focus on the

1438
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,040
instrumentalism

1439
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,000
or the realism and not focus on the link

1440
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,920
with the with the two arrow ends the

1441
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,200
metaphor i i i absolutely appreciate

1442
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,680
what you're saying julian if if i

1443
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,520
if i pick one camp with the other

1444
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,440
then i'm not focused on the metaphor but

1445
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,240
what if i'm just exclusively looking at

1446
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,680
that link as opposed to the the opposing

1447
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,800
camps

1448
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,000
can i i i'm very comfortable i'm i'm a

1449
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,240
contradiction i'm a human being

1450
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,359
right so i'm not sure why i have to pick

1451
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,319
a side

1452
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,400
i'm you haven't convinced me about that

1453
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,440
yet but

1454
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,720
yeah

1455
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,040
i mean

1456
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,359
depends a bit about how you how you

1457
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,920
flesh out the term metaphor here right

1458
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,000
so if we went back to the uh

1459
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,079
that little image i had from gear you

1460
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,520
had you know your model description

1461
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,480
model system and some target system

1462
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,720
so they say for instance you pass

1463
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,720
metaphorical entities i suppose is that

1464
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,000
what you have in mind there by metaphor

1465
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,680
i'm talking about i'm talking about the

1466
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,280
process of the

1467
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,440
of the way to be able to link to

1468
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,400
discrete or discriminatory

1469
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,319
ideas or

1470
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,480
objects or because i want to be able to

1471
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,000
hold up the relationship and the measure

1472
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,319
of that relationship i don't want to say

1473
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,880
that i have to discard one in order to

1474
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,800
take up the other

1475
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,720
maybe it's useful to bring in the markov

1476
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,480
blanket here as a metaphor for the

1477
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,160
boundary

1478
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,680
so the blanket seems like a good

1479
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,799
metaphor for capturing the boundary of a

1480
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,319
of a particle or an organism

1481
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,599
right

1482
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:46,880
and

1483
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,480
so then we can ask well what is the

1484
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,480
relation between that markov blanket

1485
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,119
concept where you can where the markov

1486
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,040
blankets are nested

1487
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,280
and so you can find them at multiple

1488
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,319
scales of organization multiple temples

1489
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,799
spatial scales

1490
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,720
what's the relationship between that

1491
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,559
nesting of markov blankets and the

1492
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,960
self-organizing systems that we're

1493
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,680
we're using them to model

1494
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,040
and

1495
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,799
so i think that's where you get to when

1496
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,599
you try to unpack the metaphor

1497
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,599
there's a nested markov blankets is a

1498
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,119
metaphor

1499
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,000
and how do we then interpret that

1500
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,079
and for michael and i the way to

1501
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,640
interpret that metaphor is to think of

1502
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,960
self-organizing systems as literally

1503
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,559
having this

1504
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,040
well not literally that's

1505
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,799
vacant use of words isn't it

1506
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,280
as uh

1507
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,799
to think that there is a nested

1508
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,599
organization within uh self-organizing

1509
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,040
systems

1510
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,680
that can be modeled and described

1511
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,079
indirectly using the mathematics of the

1512
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,880
free energy principle or using the

1513
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,200
the formalism of markov blankets so

1514
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,160
using the bayes causalness

1515
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,559
it's yes on that note you use these

1516
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,640
particular constructs i think on the

1517
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,559
basis of what julian just said to

1518
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,920
actually guide your research

1519
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,000
in the sense of figuring out something

1520
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,559
about how your target systems are

1521
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,680
organized so the one way of casting this

1522
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,079
in this in the jargon we've been using

1523
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,680
that you

1524
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,760
you distort you introduce a distortion

1525
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,040
that you think you need to take

1526
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,119
literally for instance the mathematics

1527
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,640
underlying this particular markov

1528
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,480
language of formalism

1529
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,319
but you use that in order to guide and

1530
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,079
direct your search

1531
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,720
now that's important because that's the

1532
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,319
that's the kind of key to our particular

1533
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,000
to the way of thinking for us about

1534
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,760
scientific realism that we can have all

1535
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,440
these distortions and all these points

1536
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,079
of inexactness in our theoretical models

1537
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,880
however the ambition is to say something

1538
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,359
about the target system that's the

1539
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,960
that's where the sort of conversation

1540
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,440
between the instrumentalists at least a

1541
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,960
version of that the version of the

1542
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,599
scientific realist framework uh

1543
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,359
come apart now there's i should say

1544
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,200
there's there's there's a set of good

1545
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,440
reasons for thinking that the two

1546
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,200
positions and philosophy of science are

1547
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,559
mutually exclusive they can't be true

1548
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,319
at the same time

1549
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,240
and one is the positive of a set of

1550
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,640
metaphysical claims on behalf of the

1551
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,640
scientific realist

1552
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,319
it's typically the case that one is

1553
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,920
committed to the following there's some

1554
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,440
kind of mind independent reality

1555
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,440
okay now that can't be the commitment of

1556
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,799
the instrumentalist because you can't

1557
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,559
possibly because you have no you're not

1558
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,319
producing the truth about how the world

1559
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,079
is

1560
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,920
the second metaphysical commitment is

1561
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,079
that we can somehow get a grip

1562
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,040
on uh unobservable causes

1563
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,160
of our observations

1564
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,400
but that's not an option for the

1565
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,160
instrumentalists they can say something

1566
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,799
about their observations of your

1567
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,119
empiricists for example you can't you

1568
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,720
can't start making

1569
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,799
influences from that

1570
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,960
to unobservable causes of those

1571
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,520
observations but metaphysically there's

1572
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,839
there's something at stake

1573
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,960
when you have a discussion that goes

1574
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,119
that considers these expansive

1575
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,480
sort of broader considerations and

1576
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,200
positive science

1577
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,920
but those are metaphysical commitments

1578
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,960
and i suppose we can argue

1579
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,160
so to make it more concrete again going

1580
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,200
back to the nested markov blankets and

1581
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,799
the reason that we

1582
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,440
we describe self-organizing systems in

1583
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,839
those terms is because of how the

1584
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:41,760
the faster processes are enslaved by

1585
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,200
slower processes so you see this

1586
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,000
this circular causality

1587
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,040
and

1588
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,760
that's described in uh

1589
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,720
in

1590
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,160
complex systems theory and

1591
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,119
so

1592
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,640
there's there's a

1593
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,760
there's a dynamics that you can observe

1594
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,480
in

1595
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,280
living self-organizing systems

1596
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,400
that

1597
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,799
um that can be in exactly and

1598
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,760
approximately described using

1599
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,040
the formalism of markov blankets

1600
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,359
and and it's because of that similarity

1601
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,440
or resemblance between the

1602
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,440
the formal apparatus that we're using

1603
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,280
when we employ

1604
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,680
uh base nets and the

1605
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,440
the

1606
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,799
modeling

1607
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:34,319
formalism of markov blankets

1608
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:35,520
it's because there's that kind of

1609
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,599
similarity or resemblance between the

1610
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,880
models that we're making as scientists

1611
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,839
and the

1612
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:45,680
dynamics of self-organizing systems

1613
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,000
that we think it makes sense to

1614
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,160
interpret that metaphor

1615
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,319
in realist terms

1616
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:53,839
does that make sense

1617
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,440
well yeah i

1618
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,480
i

1619
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,839
again i wouldn't argue that

1620
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:02,559
that if you if you do place yourself in

1621
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,799
one camp you

1622
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,799
you reject

1623
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,680
what maybe the other side is arguing

1624
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,760
what i'm thinking of is the

1625
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,000
the statistical probability as a

1626
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,880
distribution allows for perforations

1627
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,079
meaning

1628
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,720
the metaphor al is i wouldn't say it's a

1629
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,119
bridge but it's kind of an escape patch

1630
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,960
to boundary cross

1631
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,359
and i mean quite literally if i use a

1632
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:28,480
metaphor

1633
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,200
i i get out of the constraint of

1634
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,920
of not having that other person share

1635
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,400
the idea unless we can arrive at some

1636
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,240
convergence around something that we

1637
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,680
both understand

1638
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,280
from the past in order to be able to

1639
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,040
project into that

1640
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,400
that new set of congruencies so

1641
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,680
i don't want to take up all of this

1642
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,440
conversation i just wanted to see i

1643
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,359
think that the issue here is really

1644
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,960
something to do with what philosophers

1645
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,680
do

1646
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,520
where we like to disagree and argue with

1647
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,359
each other right

1648
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,400
now

1649
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,599
that works for some people depending on

1650
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,599
their personality and for other people

1651
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,440
it doesn't work so well they prefer to

1652
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,319
try and find agreement or

1653
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,480
to find a way of communicating with each

1654
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,200
other for us and as philosophers i think

1655
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,760
disagreeing and arguing is not to fail

1656
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,599
to communicate is that

1657
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,839
it's just what we do as philosophers and

1658
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,160
what that made me think about is um very

1659
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,000
few people are in the position of

1660
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,640
putting their name and a year and a

1661
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,640
version on an idea

1662
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,559
and being like the um avatar of the idea

1663
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,359
like godfrey smith 2009

1664
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,720
longino 2013. here's what the idea is

1665
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,160
and um

1666
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,119
dean or anyone who might be interested

1667
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,079
in applying these ideas might have less

1668
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,280
of a qualm with shifting their regime of

1669
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,480
attention

1670
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,480
even within a sentence

1671
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,200
from one usage to another

1672
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,559
and it's um in the fine art and science

1673
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,079
of philosophy

1674
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,960
where some of these um

1675
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,839
minds become fleshed out and we can

1676
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,359
really see like

1677
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,720
how deep

1678
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,160
the

1679
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,079
logic goes

1680
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,839
and that's like kind of like

1681
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,079
higher overtones

1682
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,400
in the symphony of thought and then you

1683
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,000
know dean's just fiddling away on the

1684
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,160
subway trying to trying to get whatever

1685
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,079
currency they get up there in canada um

1686
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,119
let me go to dave with a question

1687
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,039
um because you haven't gone yet and then

1688
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,839
uh stephen afterwards

1689
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,559
okay um

1690
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,960
coming at this whole question

1691
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,359
particularly the question of metaphor

1692
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,319
my background is i'm coming at this from

1693
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,599
general semantics through the

1694
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:50,640
cybernetics theory of learning teaching

1695
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,880
through george lakoff's grounded

1696
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,079
metaphor theory and through mark saul's

1697
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:59,280
conscious ego so when you say

1698
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,640
metaphor dot dot dot i say well who's

1699
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,119
actually driving

1700
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,039
the analysis who is it that has to be

1701
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,240
appealed to

1702
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,839
and i would say look the the

1703
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,799
interpretation is done by

1704
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,839
the metaphoric structure

1705
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,720
why is that a good grounding because the

1706
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,200
fundamental grounding of the entire of

1707
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,520
every living

1708
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,240
control system

1709
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,720
the speed of updating the

1710
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,559
the question of how existentially

1711
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,760
imperative

1712
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,640
that you not violate your priors

1713
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,960
down through very delicate questions of

1714
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,920
of

1715
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,000
mathematical formalisms it's all

1716
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,039
grounded in

1717
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,160
the decline of

1718
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,640
avoidance or approach

1719
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,880
and decline of pain versus pleasure so

1720
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,039
it's all grounded it's got a basis your

1721
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,200
entire

1722
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,119
structure of

1723
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:01,570
um

1724
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,119
[Music]

1725
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,359
of inference of induction your whole

1726
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,520
induction is already ground and so don't

1727
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,240
worry about what the metaphor means

1728
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,240
in terms of

1729
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,280
theories

1730
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,520
ask what do the theories mean in terms

1731
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,720
of metaphor

1732
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,359
don't be shy about telling me i've gone

1733
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,799
off the deep end

1734
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,520
every last person i respect has been

1735
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,640
accused of going off the deep end

1736
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,200
i might i might i might like i might let

1737
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,960
julian take first dips here so i can

1738
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,359
sort of get myself into into my own

1739
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,680
headspace all right um

1740
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,520
so

1741
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,839
i like what you how you describe

1742
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,319
metaphors and uh and the place that they

1743
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,280
have within the free energy principle

1744
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,760
where they're grounded in these

1745
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,599
perception action emotion processes and

1746
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,359
so

1747
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,319
for fep that

1748
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:01,119
what

1749
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,760
everything is organized around is

1750
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,680
these imperatives to resist

1751
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,520
disintegration

1752
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,640
and

1753
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,880
and so it makes sense to me that

1754
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,839
the metaphors we use in in communicating

1755
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,079
with each other and thinking

1756
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,280
are

1757
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,880
in the end gonna

1758
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,680
inherit there and be grounded in

1759
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,400
in

1760
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,559
life processes

1761
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:25,760
and

1762
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,520
that's something that we talk about in

1763
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,319
terms of the life-mind continuity

1764
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:33,119
thesis coming out of inactive ideas in

1765
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,720
philosophy

1766
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,039
the philosophy of biology

1767
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,520
uh so there's an interesting connection

1768
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,039
there between uh

1769
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,440
the embodied cognition ideas that lack

1770
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,599
often johnson are using and

1771
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,559
and the the four e ideas so i think

1772
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,559
that's what you were just describing

1773
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,000
but uh

1774
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,760
but that comes up at this from a

1775
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,000
slightly different direction to to what

1776
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,640
we're concerned with in our paper

1777
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,319
um

1778
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,359
where

1779
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,280
what we're looking at is say

1780
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,280
a matlab model

1781
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,920
that somebody might make of uh in

1782
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,559
simulating active vision like thomas

1783
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,000
paris done

1784
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,119
or

1785
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,760
micah allen when he's looking at how

1786
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,319
to model the interactions between heart

1787
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,200
rate

1788
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,440
and fear perception

1789
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,160
and he's constructing like a

1790
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,920
a simulation and in silico model

1791
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,400
using the mathematics of the free energy

1792
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,520
principle

1793
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,839
to describe those kinds of interactions

1794
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,799
between intraceptive processes like

1795
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,960
monitoring of your heart rate

1796
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,760
and extraceptive perception say

1797
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,640
of

1798
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,680
fearful images of faces making fearful

1799
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,200
expressions

1800
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,760
so that's a kind of in silico model

1801
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,000
that's been made there

1802
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,760
and what can we learn from those sorts

1803
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,480
of simulations about

1804
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,880
say interactions between heart rate and

1805
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,039
visual perception

1806
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,119
and that's where our our sorts of

1807
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,640
questions come up

1808
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,400
because you can think while the

1809
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,960
the in silico simulations that are being

1810
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,160
made

1811
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,400
they're just um

1812
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,640
instruments for making predictions about

1813
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,880
say heart rate how heart rate's going to

1814
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,960
interact with perception

1815
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,920
um

1816
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,960
and the the simulation can be

1817
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,720
useful for

1818
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,280
um predicting the kinds of data that we

1819
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,119
could measure

1820
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,160
but

1821
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,559
the simulation itself isn't

1822
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:33,839
gonna

1823
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,240
give us knowledge of

1824
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,359
how

1825
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,680
the intraceptive system

1826
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,359
interacts with

1827
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,160
visual perception

1828
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,480
and and we just say no that's wrong the

1829
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,079
simulation can actually tell you

1830
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,880
something important give you a kind of

1831
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,200
knowledge maybe in the long term so we

1832
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,319
have to look

1833
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:56,240
over time and look at all of the

1834
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,920
refinements that are going to happen in

1835
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,599
active inference models

1836
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,280
before we can actually

1837
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,680
arrive at something that is a true

1838
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,440
accurate description

1839
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,960
but in the meantime the kinds of

1840
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,079
approximations idealizations that we're

1841
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,000
operating with when we make these kinds

1842
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,480
of in silico simulations

1843
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,399
are still telling us something important

1844
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,920
about how

1845
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,158
uh how the mind is organized how

1846
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,719
living systems are organized

1847
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,000
okay so that's the sort of claim that

1848
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,600
we're making can you see that that's

1849
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,520
sort of a little bit a tangent from what

1850
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,238
you were asking about metaphor

1851
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,080
maybe it isn't you can explain why you

1852
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,238
see how you see them coming together

1853
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,000
i have probably uh stated my my point in

1854
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,238
an overly political way i was very

1855
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,399
excited i was really

1856
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,238
i am very excited about what you're

1857
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,080
doing um

1858
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,040
kind of like when muhammad the

1859
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,479
the the opponent finally lands a really

1860
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,120
solid blow on muhammad ali and elise is

1861
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,600
okay enough playing around let's

1862
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,839
let's hit that uh no i'm very

1863
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,640
sympathetic i invited professor solms to

1864
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,198
this discussion i certainly hope he's

1865
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:09,759
going to watch the film um

1866
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,679
no i'm i'm i'm very much on your side

1867
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:14,719
i'm just saying i think what the i think

1868
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,640
the the the

1869
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,399
embodied

1870
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,238
perspective the um

1871
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,759
the pre-galilean perspective where

1872
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:29,198
valence where value where teleology

1873
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,080
are

1874
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,719
viewed as the foundation or at very

1875
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:35,600
minimum a co-equal foundation of the

1876
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,920
entire intellectual structure the entire

1877
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,198
research structure i think that is

1878
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:40,960
exactly correct

1879
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,319
um and i'm really pleased for instance a

1880
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,439
subtle

1881
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,238
british nuance perhaps that professor

1882
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,399
used the same uh professor christian

1883
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,319
uses the term

1884
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,840
teleology so often in such an

1885
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,239
an important sense i think that already

1886
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,120
by itself involves hitting back yeah

1887
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,800
but he always says he's deflating

1888
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,120
teleology doesn't he he loves this word

1889
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,920
deflation

1890
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,239
something that we can see in in physics

1891
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,740
as well

1892
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,280
[Music]

1893
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,600
and uh

1894
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,960
yeah michael found something very

1895
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,320
interesting in a in a

1896
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,280
a youtube video from pristin about uh

1897
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,760
where he was responding to

1898
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,800
some some presentations that he'd heard

1899
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,000
where he described describes how

1900
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,560
uh this variational free energy relates

1901
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,280
to to gibbs free energy michael did you

1902
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,280
want to come in on that yeah i mean this

1903
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,360
is definitely well well beyond sort of

1904
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,719
my my pay grade with social media

1905
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,520
probably with some people in in our

1906
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,920
group here and in our audience well

1907
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,880
we'll be here

1908
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,040
basically the basic gist of it is

1909
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,040
something like this

1910
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,880
that you can you can describe

1911
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,159
transitionings across belief states by

1912
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,480
appeal to variational free energy

1913
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,000
and that's nice that gives you a nice

1914
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,239
sort of computational modeling language

1915
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,560
to to speak about state transitions

1916
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,880
across different beliefs

1917
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,920
so so the so the claim is here

1918
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,920
and it claim is interesting because it

1919
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,400
allows for an even tighter

1920
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,960
grip between your fictional constructs

1921
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,679
and actual systems that you can give a

1922
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,760
formulation of those

1923
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,360
state transitions

1924
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,440
by mathematically showing an equivalence

1925
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,360
relation across the variation of free

1926
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,239
energy

1927
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,719
and the gibbs free energy which then by

1928
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,239
definition allows you to show in energy

1929
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:43,120
spent per joule or something like that

1930
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,600
but it what it actually costs

1931
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,159
to change one's beliefs for example

1932
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:51,120
uh in the context of the fep now that's

1933
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,040
that's that's great if that's the case

1934
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,280
because that brings you even closer from

1935
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,280
your model from your model space to your

1936
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,040
target system space

1937
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,880
but that that's a bit like when somebody

1938
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,800
asks me and okinawa well how does the

1939
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,880
octopus

1940
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,800
mechanistically select its action

1941
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,640
policies well i'm not a marine biologist

1942
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,040
and i'm not a specialist in octopi i

1943
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,280
mean that that that's not for me as a

1944
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,840
philosopher to tell you and i have i'm

1945
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,159
gonna i'm gonna cheat out and provide

1946
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,880
the same sort of reason for not going

1947
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,199
any further than that

1948
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,960
but it's a good example i think um

1949
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,840
yeah the reason i brought up was because

1950
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,320
you were talking about teleology and

1951
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,280
and what

1952
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,520
kristen does in deflating that notion is

1953
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,600
actually bring it back to

1954
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,840
to something in physics as well like

1955
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,920
gibbs free energy and the free energy

1956
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,239
principle shows you how you can take

1957
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,000
something that looks like it's going

1958
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,159
back to aristotle but actually show how

1959
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,120
to bring it into contact with

1960
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,520
um with

1961
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,840
the mathematics that we now have for

1962
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,080
understanding self-organizing dynamical

1963
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,760
systems

1964
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,960
i mean it's i think it's just an

1965
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,280
important note there so even if

1966
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,360
the term teleology is being used in the

1967
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,520
literature one ought not to confuse it

1968
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,280
with the sort of notion of a final cause

1969
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,000
as per the aristotelian system right so

1970
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,760
so we have we have sort of a final cause

1971
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,080
and ultimate end point that one

1972
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,400
necessarily strives towards

1973
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,199
right but rather that self-organization

1974
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,880
is somehow inherently purposeful and to

1975
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,640
me that's what strikes me as right but

1976
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,239
it also destruction is a deflated notion

1977
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,959
of teleology

1978
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,679
yeah but

1979
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,040
there's there's lots more we could say

1980
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,880
on this before it's for another session

1981
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,080
isn't it

1982
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,159
it's a little bit of a tangent from what

1983
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,880
we're currently talking about true

1984
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,679
cool um stephen and then i'll have a

1985
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,600
question and then we can sort of

1986
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,600
land

1987
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,040
yeah i think this this question about

1988
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,400
what we can model with the fbp or what

1989
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,960
fep is able to be used to do modeling on

1990
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,360
using variational free energy

1991
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,440
and

1992
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,320
what

1993
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,080
the model is

1994
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,760
and i think you've kind of resolved this

1995
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,920
to some extent by distinguishing

1996
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,480
modeling from models so there's

1997
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,000
instrumental

1998
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,280
models there's

1999
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,000
realist models and there's this process

2000
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,679
of modelling

2001
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:25,199
and one of the things about non and i

2002
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,320
think in some ways you don't say

2003
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,800
non-linear i mean non-linear dynamical

2004
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,520
systems might be better than that

2005
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,480
but

2006
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,520
the the thing with those systems is

2007
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,560
and

2008
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,120
is that they are

2009
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,199
in this case anyway generative

2010
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,560
and we've been looking at and i was

2011
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,880
actually talking to daniels in our tools

2012
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,120
session like about how these bayesian

2013
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,880
graphs can be thought of and one of the

2014
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,760
things

2015
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,120
is that

2016
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,719
generally of a modern you try and fit

2017
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,120
things to your model like in psychology

2018
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,480
you fit someone to the model of

2019
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,880
psychology right that can be the problem

2020
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,880
because now this person's being fit to

2021
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,960
sit with all these models

2022
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,320
well in this case these models generally

2023
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,239
always generate

2024
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:09,440
the data

2025
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:10,560
and but they generate a little bit

2026
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,760
different each time because it's

2027
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,480
stochastic so you see that the way they

2028
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,199
evolve and that's what we're sort of

2029
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,800
getting at so

2030
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,320
building the model can be a useful

2031
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,560
design thinking tool to think about how

2032
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,320
it would be structured and then you get

2033
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,640
this idea of modelling

2034
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,719
and and this is actually maybe timeless

2035
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,480
with what dave was saying a little bit

2036
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,280
because my belief is that at the moment

2037
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,280
all the ways that we are able to model

2038
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,640
are very low dimensional like extremely

2039
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,960
low dimensional

2040
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,280
however i do believe i've been looking

2041
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,960
at stuff

2042
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,520
where phenomenologically it would be

2043
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,000
possible

2044
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,880
to use experience as the raw instrument

2045
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,760
so i think high dimensionality

2046
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,840
can be done

2047
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,600
through

2048
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,719
there is a potential for high

2049
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,880
dimensionality so there's this question

2050
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,920
of like when we're modeling

2051
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,880
using models which are low dimensional

2052
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,480
to such an extent and they even like

2053
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,880
often are partially observable

2054
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,719
markov decision processes so they're not

2055
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:19,199
even actually saying the data coming in

2056
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,520
has been aching

2057
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,440
necessarily through

2058
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,120
you know you either have these

2059
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,480
psychological

2060
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,560
models which are very low dimensional

2061
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,159
and are partially observable so it's

2062
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,520
gone up and it's hit the point of

2063
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,440
beliefs and then they start to look or

2064
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,440
they have these incredibly

2065
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,320
particulate models starting from like

2066
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,360
the first atoms of life or whatever

2067
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,640
and

2068
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,520
i think that your intuition is probably

2069
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,000
right actually in terms of there are

2070
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,880
then

2071
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,239
because i've we've been looking at some

2072
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:53,520
of this in terms of phenomenologically

2073
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,760
there is there ways that

2074
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,560
experiential

2075
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,040
information can be modeled in

2076
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,199
or put into these models

2077
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:04,159
um

2078
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:07,040
and so it doesn't only have to be

2079
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,520
these very low dimensional ones which

2080
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,920
may be so low dimensional that maybe

2081
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,679
that's part of the problem it's not that

2082
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,440
the fep

2083
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,839
is

2084
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:20,480
real it's just what they're using to

2085
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,560
model it is still so low dimensional

2086
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,280
yeah that's a nice question um

2087
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,280
let me at least attempt a form of

2088
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,199
response um

2089
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,199
so julian and i ian met the other day

2090
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,880
and was just sort of chit chatting here

2091
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,960
and since you did mention micro

2092
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,719
precision processes

2093
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,360
i suppose one way of conceiving of this

2094
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,120
if you like low dimensional versus high

2095
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,199
dimension or kind of simplicity versus

2096
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,920
complexity but kind of inaccuracy versus

2097
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,000
more accuracy distinction would be just

2098
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,600
a sort of

2099
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,080
quite often one finds that those sorts

2100
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,840
of processes are modeled in discrete

2101
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,400
states

2102
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,560
and and my my assumption is that that's

2103
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,040
a simplification because it makes work

2104
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,840
somehow more tractable

2105
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,400
right so it's manageable you can you can

2106
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,960
write the code on the basis of of this

2107
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,320
discrete state

2108
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,480
transitions for example

2109
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,960
um and and and still learn something

2110
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,520
even if you you sort of think that maybe

2111
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,280
state transitions are continuous for

2112
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,719
example right

2113
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,800
um

2114
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,400
another thing that's more

2115
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,760
meta i suppose to that new is just it's

2116
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,280
sort of the following so we're quite

2117
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,760
inspired by a philosopher by the name of

2118
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,239
michael weisberg so his name is appears

2119
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,480
frequently now in the paper

2120
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,719
and he has this it's really this really

2121
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:43,159
nice paper from

2122
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:46,080
2006 i believe it is all seven in

2123
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,320
biology and philosophy where he gives

2124
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,320
you two different approaches to a model

2125
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,159
based science

2126
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,400
we follow one in part because we don't

2127
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,199
think it's very feasible to do the other

2128
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,040
one he refers to as a kind of brute

2129
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,280
force approach now i suppose this is

2130
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,320
going to give you all the high

2131
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,719
dimensionality that you can imagine

2132
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,719
that given computational power to pull

2133
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,880
it off on that approach the goal is to

2134
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,760
have the values of all the variables you

2135
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,080
can identify in your target system

2136
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,520
reflected

2137
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,679
in your model

2138
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,920
this is you have a super high degree if

2139
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,840
you like the correspondence between your

2140
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,480
model system and your target system

2141
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,560
but

2142
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,800
the catch is that that particular

2143
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,000
ambition

2144
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,560
is extremely difficult given the sheer

2145
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,480
complexity of real world systems

2146
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,159
so the alternative

2147
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,000
is to say well then any other kind of

2148
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,320
model based approach

2149
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:47,040
in sciences if you can't achieve that

2150
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,880
degree of completeness if you like is to

2151
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,080
use idealizations

2152
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,159
so by necessity almost you have to

2153
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,920
simplify i suppose that would be one way

2154
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,400
of thinking about why we why we have low

2155
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,320
dimensional models and why one uses low

2156
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,920
dimensional models can you use

2157
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,320
experience to improve those models

2158
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,840
um

2159
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,679
yeah i i'm not sure perhaps it seems

2160
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,520
like you ought to be able to

2161
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,440
ask a slightly different question but i

2162
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,679
see stephen wants to come back so i'll

2163
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,560
hold my comment for a minute yeah cool

2164
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,360
well just one that i think i suppose

2165
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,679
the dimensionality is so low that it's

2166
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,600
almost like even if you made it a

2167
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,880
thousand times more it still

2168
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,560
would be

2169
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,560
it's still useful because it shows the

2170
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,719
dynamics shifting

2171
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,239
which is a little bit different to most

2172
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:37,760
models

2173
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,960
however

2174
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,639
yeah there's like

2175
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,080
it's

2176
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,920
it's it's it's

2177
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,600
i don't know how many zeros it has been

2178
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,679
magnified by in terms of multiplying the

2179
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:52,480
complexity but that that that that um

2180
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,320
that might be anyway so that that i

2181
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,520
think it's a good point you're making

2182
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,800
though yeah

2183
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,679
thanks well let's take the casper hes

2184
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:01,679
deeply thought effect model i don't know

2185
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:03,280
if you know that one

2186
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,960
so there's a

2187
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,280
there's a variable in that model a

2188
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,679
matrix the g matrix

2189
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,120
which is

2190
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,719
uh

2191
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,159
which is trying to capture the

2192
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:17,600
minimization of expected free energy

2193
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,360
and the role that that plays in

2194
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,400
selecting between action policies

2195
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,520
and then and the idea is that uh

2196
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,920
that that g matrix is something that's

2197
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,239
changing over time

2198
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:31,520
um

2199
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,600
such that you can do better or worse

2200
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,360
than expected

2201
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,400
at

2202
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,440
minimizing expected free energy

2203
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,360
so there's a there's a variable there

2204
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,199
which i guess is still there

2205
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,199
gonna yield models which are low

2206
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,600
dimensional in your sense but

2207
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,600
but it it's still

2208
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,800
um being used to model something

2209
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,320
um that

2210
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,480
is i think phenomenological in the end

2211
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,519
namely valence

2212
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,040
and

2213
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,960
so

2214
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,840
now

2215
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,080
the mole i would draw from that is that

2216
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,000
something that's an idealization an

2217
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,760
approximation

2218
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,320
because it's low dimensional

2219
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:16,159
doesn't necessarily mean that that that

2220
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,000
modeling tool that you're using there

2221
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,159
that's that has this low dimensionality

2222
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,600
you can't still

2223
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,800
um

2224
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,760
be used to describe

2225
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,960
something high level and

2226
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,000
phenomenological namely valence

2227
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,239
and and that goes back to what dave was

2228
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,560
saying before i think that the valence

2229
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,840
is actually something that's built into

2230
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,760
free energy minimizing systems because

2231
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,920
variational free energy

2232
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,159
is

2233
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:49,600
a way of describing a way of indirectly

2234
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,360
representing

2235
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,560
is something that's fundamental to life

2236
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,480
and which is this

2237
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,639
tendency to avoid decay or

2238
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:00,880
disintegration

2239
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,120
and

2240
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,199
so the low dimensionality i think

2241
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,360
doesn't uh doesn't stand in the way of

2242
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,239
using this as uh to model very high

2243
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:11,800
dimensional

2244
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,560
phenomenologically deep thick

2245
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,360
concepts like valence

2246
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,960
yeah that's a really good example

2247
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,120
actually just one point on that and it

2248
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,400
also

2249
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,679
we're talking about

2250
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,920
general because i do agree with the idea

2251
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,600
of if we're saying

2252
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,320
what are generally tractable

2253
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,800
dynamical processes which maybe is

2254
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,719
another type of realism in a way or it's

2255
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,719
realism but to think of that

2256
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:37,440
is

2257
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,520
it does show that affect becomes a

2258
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,040
plausible way

2259
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,040
which pretty well hasn't i don't know

2260
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,560
any other way to think about it

2261
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,239
previously it's why we start to get into

2262
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:47,520
consciousness

2263
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,760
as well with mark soames

2264
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:50,560
is

2265
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,960
yeah it gives this plausible way

2266
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,120
where what was relegated in our

2267
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,719
scientific world because basically

2268
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,159
consciousness was taken away by

2269
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,440
psychology

2270
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,600
and feelings were kind of

2271
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,840
these this lower down ideas like well

2272
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,679
wait a sec this is actually

2273
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,560
the all-encompassing way to

2274
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,480
know what you think

2275
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,159
so that's actually because i actually do

2276
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,000
a lot of work with metaphors and one of

2277
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,520
the things that happens with metaphors

2278
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,840
is people what's the metaphor of knowing

2279
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,560
when you get something right

2280
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,040
like what's it like to know something so

2281
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,400
if you ask a mathematician what the

2282
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,239
answer is to a problem

2283
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,000
they don't get an answer on a computer

2284
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,639
screen they actually feel the answer

2285
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,000
being right

2286
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,600
so they've kind of somehow and then

2287
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,120
what's that like and then you can

2288
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,120
process that as a spatial metaphor in

2289
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,239
the room

2290
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,760
but the

2291
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,480
that you said it's affective so yeah i

2292
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,199
do

2293
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,280
agree with what you're saying and i i

2294
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,120
what i'm interested as well is working

2295
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,239
backwards from an effective state

2296
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,560
and trying to plot out people's

2297
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,320
low dimensionality

2298
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,679
another way but that's for another

2299
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:58,159
conversation but i i i do agree with

2300
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,440
what you're saying

2301
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,800
but i don't know whether you would say

2302
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,760
that

2303
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,280
that

2304
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,920
dynamics is different to realism

2305
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,440
in

2306
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,199
physical

2307
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:12,678
physical ways

2308
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,719
so in that model that the g vector is uh

2309
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,560
it's being used to set precision on

2310
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,400
action policy so

2311
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,080
which action policies can you be

2312
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,920
confident in that's a kind of

2313
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,560
metacognitive process in that

2314
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,320
it's not just

2315
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,199
acting based on some gut feeling

2316
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:32,880
you know in in the way that you

2317
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,560
described but

2318
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,480
but using that feedback from the body to

2319
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,280
to

2320
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,159
uh assign precision so to

2321
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,159
to look at how reliable

2322
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,159
a prediction error is in relation to

2323
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:47,760
your predictions

2324
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,080
when the quantity that you're minimizing

2325
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,199
is this expected free energy quantity

2326
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,199
um so there's something global going on

2327
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,040
there i think which gets you closer to

2328
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:57,920
what you

2329
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,120
what you're looking for when you're

2330
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,040
thinking about consciousness

2331
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,480
and

2332
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,400
something in the global dynamics when

2333
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,080
you're thinking about the g

2334
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,080
vector

2335
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,239
so

2336
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,239
i'll just read out one

2337
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,159
question from the chat and the answer

2338
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:16,159
could be as simple as read the paper or

2339
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,600
give a thought

2340
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,679
and then i'll ask a closing question for

2341
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,760
the authors so the question is from

2342
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,520
matthew mctigue

2343
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,040
and they wrote

2344
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,840
how do we resolve the controversy of the

2345
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,800
conflation between heuristic and markov

2346
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,000
blankets

2347
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,080
what metaphysical legwork should be done

2348
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:38,639
to defend an ontological markov blanket

2349
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,520
okay so so the question is something

2350
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,880
like we don't really take that

2351
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,120
opportunity one sneaky movement they say

2352
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,239
go go read the greenback idiot paper but

2353
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:51,280
um

2354
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,760
moving from heuristics to

2355
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,239
ontology i think i think julian has

2356
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:58,639
already touched on that quite a bit when

2357
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,639
speaking on the sort of multi-scale

2358
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,800
characteristics of self-organizing

2359
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,320
systems

2360
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,600
um such that you just you so if you have

2361
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,120
as part of your model and this is our

2362
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,960
preferred approach here

2363
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,280
uh the formula isn't like the mark of

2364
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,679
blanket formulism then of course you're

2365
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,600
not going to be saying that heuristic

2366
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,520
this would be the literalist fallacy

2367
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,080
it's going to just be mappable onto

2368
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,719
this multi-scale

2369
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:27,360
structure that comprises the system so

2370
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,199
now you have to interpret that's the

2371
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,040
next step in this modeling move you have

2372
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,080
to interpret these sorts of notations

2373
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,679
under a certain description such that

2374
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,600
you can start thinking about what it is

2375
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,840
about biological

2376
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,800
uh organization that reflects in that

2377
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,719
indirect sense that we're working with

2378
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:46,400
these sorts of heuristics so that's the

2379
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,400
work that one should do

2380
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,520
but it's not it's not the kind of thing

2381
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,400
that we discuss at length in one section

2382
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,080
of the paper we call the section the

2383
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,920
paper moves across four different

2384
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,920
domains that has to be done with some

2385
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,000
swiftness and level of generality to

2386
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,239
bring the philosophical point home

2387
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:05,040
but

2388
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,480
that would i mean i think that that's

2389
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,400
that's a separate paper actually that

2390
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,760
that little question so thank you

2391
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,760
matthew for that

2392
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,880
awesome

2393
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,199
so just one closing um question

2394
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:20,080
as you are reviewing and revising the

2395
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,440
paper

2396
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,280
who is your audience

2397
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,159
and how would it impact the next

2398
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:29,280
several months or years of active

2399
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,280
inference and free energy principle

2400
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,840
research and application if people were

2401
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:34,880
to really

2402
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,280
direct the regime of attention and

2403
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,440
understand what you're talking about and

2404
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,800
update their generative models

2405
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,199
accordingly

2406
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:44,800
william do you want me or usually go

2407
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,560
first i'm happy to go first initially

2408
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,800
with initial thoughts so

2409
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,440
i wanted to to bring up

2410
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,480
the

2411
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,400
recent paper by

2412
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,000
miguel aguilera and um

2413
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,360
and

2414
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,719
chris buckley and others um where

2415
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:03,920
the

2416
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,520
the problems that they raised there

2417
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,280
about how to take the free energy

2418
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,840
principle

2419
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,960
and uh and use it to to model

2420
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,880
uh

2421
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,760
real

2422
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,080
biological cognitive systems and they

2423
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,920
take very simple system and then show

2424
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,679
what kinds of assumptions

2425
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,440
you need to build into the free energy

2426
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,360
principle in order to

2427
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,159
to

2428
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,719
use it to model those systems

2429
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,480
and they argue that those assumptions

2430
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,960
are are unrealistic

2431
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,880
and they pick out a very small class of

2432
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,719
systems and those systems are unlikely

2433
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:40,320
to be biological cognitive systems

2434
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,400
so that looks like bad news for the free

2435
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,080
energy principle

2436
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,040
and

2437
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,199
but not from the perspective of our

2438
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:48,320
paper

2439
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,000
because what our paper shows is that all

2440
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,719
of those assumptions that they identify

2441
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,320
are actually exactly the kinds of

2442
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,679
idealizations and approximations that

2443
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:59,679
that don't rule out

2444
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,560
taking the free energy principle to

2445
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,440
to

2446
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,440
indirectly represent

2447
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,320
biological cognitive systems

2448
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,719
and so the contribution of our paper to

2449
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,880
the community i think is to just

2450
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,239
point out that

2451
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:16,000
you know even if we

2452
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,600
look at the assumptions that underlie

2453
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,280
the free energy principle and think well

2454
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,440
those don't literally apply to

2455
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,320
biological and cognitive systems

2456
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,400
that doesn't rule out the possibility of

2457
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,440
still

2458
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,320
making active inference models and

2459
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,880
and using them to

2460
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,280
to learn important things about

2461
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,760
their biological cognitive systems it

2462
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,199
would only rule that out if you think

2463
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,000
that

2464
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,920
those systems literally have to

2465
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,480
instantiate the assumptions that

2466
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,199
uh

2467
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,760
that are built into the fep before you

2468
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,760
can apply the fep

2469
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,080
and but we've argued no those

2470
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,920
assumptions don't need to literally

2471
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,120
obtain

2472
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,360
and they can just be idealizations and

2473
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,800
approximations

2474
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,280
so so the contribution i think from of

2475
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,960
our paper to the community is to say

2476
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,159
well

2477
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,480
there are these real challenges but they

2478
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,880
don't stand in the way of using the free

2479
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,040
energy principle to carry on doing

2480
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,639
active inference models and learn

2481
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:16,840
something important from those models

2482
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,920
okay now if we can achieve that that's

2483
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,920
certainly a job well done

2484
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,719
um i think in terms of the terms of the

2485
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,960
audience

2486
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,199
perhaps outside um

2487
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:32,000
just the technical very specific niche

2488
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,480
of the the free energy principle

2489
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,560
but i mean one one would like to hope

2490
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,120
that a bit like when you had steven uh

2491
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,040
on a few weeks back talking about free

2492
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,360
energy a user's guide

2493
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,320
which we crafted as a sort of

2494
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,320
the ambition in part was of course to

2495
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,320
introduce these sorts of conversations

2496
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,840
into the context of philosophy of

2497
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,440
biology

2498
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,960
and then hopefully they'll they will

2499
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,880
they will see the light of day

2500
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,960
i think similarly here and i'm sure

2501
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,800
julian will agree that you know i think

2502
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,639
these these sorts of papers that take up

2503
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,320
like broad picture discussions and the

2504
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,000
philosophy of science with say an

2505
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,440
emphasis on the free energy principle

2506
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,639
will bring

2507
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,000
an audience from the philosophy of

2508
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,800
science into contact with with the kind

2509
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,199
of you know area speciality that we're

2510
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,320
working on

2511
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,480
i would like to see that as a as an aim

2512
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,880
as well i think secondly as well

2513
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,520
or secondly just that

2514
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,400
just

2515
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,639
working through with some precision

2516
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,520
these kinds of conceptual details

2517
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,920
in this highly mathematical and and

2518
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:32,800
sometimes

2519
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,719
really abstract domain that is the free

2520
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:37,280
energy principle is important

2521
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,239
uh

2522
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,639
precisely also i think for the sciences

2523
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,960
working on it to have a feel for what

2524
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,440
what is the conceptual assumptions of

2525
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,520
making some claim

2526
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,520
right so so you're also like

2527
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,120
conceptually sort of

2528
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,480
engineering or

2529
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,239
this this this debating in a particular

2530
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:56,880
sense that can be fruitful i think for

2531
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,800
non-philosophers working on a knife a

2532
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,239
bit like what julian was touching on

2533
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,480

2534
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,120
