For those who are watching Live, feel free to write questions in the live chat.	Presentation on Causal Inference via Predictive Coding scheduled for 2023	Causal Inference via Predictive Coding

Biggest revolution came in 1999 when apparative coding was seen as a learning algorithm. Predative coding is an evidence maximization scheme of a specific kind of generative model.	Predative coding is famous for being a neuroscience inspired learning method	Predictive coding and its generative model
633428	906422	10:33	Pre tip coding is a nice algorithm to study. It optimizes the correct objective which is the model evidence or marginal likelihood. It can be modeled on more complex and flexible architectures. It is more robust than standard neural networks during with back propagation.	Pre tip coding is a hierarchical model with neural activities	Pre- and Intermediate coding in machine learning
906476	1153080	15:06	Causal inference is a general theory that has been formalized the most by Judea Pearl. Correlation is the first level, intervention is the second level and counterfactual is the third level.	I'm now moving to the second topic which is causal inference	Predictive coding and causal Inference
1156330	1566840	19:16	What are interventions? I'm going to define them more formally. A counterfactual is a generalization of this that, as I said, lived in the past. They're computing using structural causal models. This is the last slide of the causal inference introduction and it's about structured learning.	What are interventions? I'm going to define them more formally now	Inferring causal connections and performing counterfactual Inference
1567610	1653220	26:07	Predictive coding so far has only been used to perform to compute correlations in Bayesian networks. The big question is can we go beyond correlation and model intervention and counterfactual in a biological plausible way?	Predictive coding has only been used to compute correlations in Bayesian networks	Predictive coding and causal inference
1656750	2392390	27:36	How to perform correlations with Abrasive coding which is already known. How to perform interventional queries which I think is the real question of the paper. And we have a couple of experiments and I'm going to show you now two different experiments. One shows how operative coding is able to perform intervention and counterfactual inference.

2392810	2726430	39:52	Now we move to the second part of the work which is about structure learning. This deals with the problem of learning the causal structure of the model from observational data. A new research paper from 2018 showed that it's possible to learn this structure not using a combinatorial search method, but using a gradient based method.	Structural learning deals with learning causal structure of model from observational data	Structural Learning and Causal Inferring
2729420	3157690	45:29	The first step is to generate a vision network from a random graph. The second class of experiments are classification experiments. The idea is to use structure learning to improve the classification on the classification results on the means and fashion means data set. And the results show that they perform similarly to contemporary methods.	First step is to generate a vision network from a random graph	Inferring the structure of the network
3159740	3445030	52:39	The idea here is, is the structure of the model able to recognize that the second half of the image is actually meaningless in learning. Can the model converge to a hierarchical structure, which is the one that we know performs the best on classification tasks?	Can the model converge to a hierarchical structure when performing classification tasks	Classification with Acyclic Priority
3445800	3608596	57:25	Predictive coding is a belief updating method that is able to perform end to end causal learning. It's able to learn a structure from data and then perform interventions and counterfactuals. Future works would be to improve the performance of the model we have defined.	Predictive coding is a belief updating method that performs causal learning	Predictive coding
3608708	3823420	1:00:08	ML. Don: How did you come to study this topic? Were you studying causality and found predictive coding to be useful. What if non Gaussian distributions are used? Basically, the general method stays.	How did you come to study predictive coding and find it useful	Predictive coding and causality
3823570	4058888	1:03:43	Another topic that's definitely of great interest is similarities and differences between the attention apparatus in Transformers and the way that attention is described from a neurocognitive perspective. From a predictive processing and also vocational inference perspective, attention can be seen as a kind of structured learning problem.	Another, I think topic that's definitely of great interest is similarities between the attention apparatus in Transformers	Inference from Transformers and the Attention Mechanism
4058974	4109076	1:07:38	Have you implemented generalized coordinates in predictive coding? No, I've never done it. I know they tend to be unstable, and it's very hard to make them stable.	Have you implemented generalized coordinates in predictive coding	Generalized Coordinates in Predictive Coding
4109268	4340656	1:08:29	Does adding more levels in the hierarchy reduce the distraction problem of predicting input? Why hasn't this been done under a Bayesian causal modeling framework? There are definitely breakthroughs out there that still have to be discovered.	Does adding more levels in the hierarchy reduce the distraction problem of predicting input	Does adding more levels in the hierarchy reduce the distraction problem of predicting
4340758	4480750	1:12:20	If I would have to build a language model using predictive coding, I would still use transformers. Structure learning is a way, but will still approximate transformers anyway.	How would language models using predictive coding differ from those using transformers	How would language models with predictive coding differ from those without transformers
4482880	5001830	1:14:42	We can consider depth as independent, basically pair of latent variable, latent variable and arrow. Every operation in predictive coding networks is strictly local. This may provide a lot of advantages in federated compute or distributed computing settings.	ML Don: I could not see concept of depth in the predictive coding networks	Deep learning on arbitrary graph topologies
5004680	5208250	1:23:24	 creative coding is basically a model of perception. An action is you can see it as a consequence of what you are experiencing. Applied predictive coding and actions to solve practical problems hasn't been explored a lot.	Where do you see action in these models? Where do I see action	Predictive coding and action in neural networks
