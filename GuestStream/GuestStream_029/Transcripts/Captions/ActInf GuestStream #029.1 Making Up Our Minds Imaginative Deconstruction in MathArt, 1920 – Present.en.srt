1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,840
hello it is October 14 2022 at least

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,940
where I slash we are

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,420
and it's active guest stream number 29.1

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,900
we are Revisited by Shawna Dobson and

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,720
today we'll be discussing the paper

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,660
with Dobson and Fields making up our

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,779
minds imaginative deconstruction in math

8
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,440
art 1920 to the present we'll have a

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,899
presentation with some interspersed

10
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,660
discussion followed by more discussion

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,300
so thank you again for joining and

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,219
please take it away

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,739
hi Daniel thank you again for the invite

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,079
thank you for noticing our paper and for

15
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,879
welcoming us here

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,579
so we will be discussing and

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,260
deconstructing

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,059
um the idea of

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,480
personality and mind and self through a

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,539
very beautiful interlay of math art as

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,140
we call it so um we're going to lay down

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,840
the sort of heavy argument about what

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,360
we're actually lacing together and then

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,460
we're going to end with juxtaposing two

25
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,320
mathematical Giants growth and Deacon

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,200
erdogs and using them as a case point to

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,700
evaluate

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,340
this investigation of ours into why

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,900
we're saying the Mind Is Made Up and

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,520
what the self is

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,100
so it's a little text heavy but we're

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,840
going to pause every once in a while so

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,759
that we can get um you know understand

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,619
what's actually happening here I think

35
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,360
no figure would do justice to what we're

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,960
saying possibly the perfectoid shape I

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,220
have on the front which I've talked

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,020
about before but I'll save the Mappy

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,820
part for the ending part

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,880
so the main idea what we say

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,299
um oh and I want to say we also gave a

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,280
snippet of this talk at the recent

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,780
models of Consciousness conference in

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,280
Stanford so people want to look at it

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,799
there but you can find out the the paper

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,140
on the fill archive right now so the

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,360
main idea is that the cognitive Sciences

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,540
actually tell us that the self is a

49
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,060
construct so we're actually going to use

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,919
mathematics to give it full impression

51
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,260
expression and actually abstract the

52
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,300
self to what we're calling a grothendiq

53
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,660
site so the self

54
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,360
is going to be what we what Deluge and

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,640
guitar you have called a hasadi so it's

56
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,060
an actual ephemeral thisness and nowness

57
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,260
and so we actually claim that we

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,760
actually make up our minds so when we're

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,200
saying making up our minds we actually

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,060
are we're playing there

61
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,280
so that our acts are public and that

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
they communicate effectively becomes

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,220
what we're going to call a daily

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,160
theistic Paradox so it's a limit Paradox

65
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,099
that happens when font runs up against

66
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,620
its own limits and as you all know like

67
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,720
Chris and I are not afraid to sort of

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,760
like let's take this concept and push it

69
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,280
uh push it till it breaks or in the

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,819
words of like bards push it past the

71
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,800
antipractical recrimination so we love

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,319
playing around in this heavy heavy

73
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,019
intersection of math philosophy

74
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,519
philosophy of mind

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,680
um to figure out like

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,040
what is this self so we invoke a new

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,080
mathematical formalism by Peter schultza

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,000
and Dustin Claussen called a condensed

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,580
set to formalize the notion of a self as

80
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,560
a site so we're going to mathematize

81
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,379
what the self is and um then we're going

82
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,480
to create an event-dependent constructed

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,580
time of retrospective and prospective

84
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,640
memories event dependent not that it's

85
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,620
independent and so this is an

86
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,300
alternative to the objective time of

87
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,180
temporal logic and its descendants so we

88
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,500
discussed this in the paper and I'm

89
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,060
trying to get a snippet so in essence

90
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,400
this new condensed formalism that's

91
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,840
going to invoke some sheaves gives a

92
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,459
representation to how a self as a site

93
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,900
experiences memory so if you remember

94
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,220
Chris and I are very puzzled by why why

95
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,680
do you experience memories not not why

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
do you have them you can have some kind

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
of like you know acceptation argument

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,580
about why you actually have a memory

99
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,980
right and going down the DNA line and

100
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,599
stuff like that but why do you

101
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,700
experience memory and can you imagine

102
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,739
the first creature that actually did

103
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,500
so if we actually authenticate an object

104
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,420
by observing it again and that requires

105
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,519
a lot of memory for the ram

106
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,199
um and we conclude that an inferential

107
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,260
action or a creation has returned so we

108
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,880
play around with this notion of return

109
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,100
in the sense of eternal return instance

110
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,259
of Nietzsche Duluth does a very

111
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,320
brilliant discussion of what eternal

112
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,300
return actually means that nothing is

113
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,620
actually returning the only thing that

114
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,139
returns is pure Multiplicity

115
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,780
so it is a world without being without

116
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,020
unity and so we love that world

117
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,780
so if authentication claims that

118
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,220
something Returns what does return

119
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,600
because quantum mechanics is not going

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,800
to say that so in the pink I've

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,840
highlighted that can this notion of

122
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,620
science or this condensed frame this

123
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,479
condensed structure can then actually

124
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,660
reframe authentication

125
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,040
dialecticistically this is what I'm very

126
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,500
very perplexed in so

127
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,780
if you have a notion of dilethias in

128
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,580
which we do anytime you have a

129
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,440
self-reference a system referencing

130
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,639
itself is going to create these

131
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,960
paradoxes

132
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,639
what does that mean for us in terms of

133
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,320
authentication so we're going to

134
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,759
conclude that the greatest imaginary

135
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,860
construct is really our own mind but to

136
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,780
call these constructs ours is to abuse

137
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,120
notation so

138
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,880
um we call the I reified we say that I

139
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,139
have an experience that we actually

140
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,699
reify so it's something that you've

141
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,500
actually made up Chris said this

142
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,880
brilliantly and I put it together and

143
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,740
identity is a short-term weak

144
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,500
approximation something you quote

145
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
get away with but not for very long so

146
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,060
again Chris and I are saying that time

147
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,400
is not this continuous like beautiful

148
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,100
thing that it's actually pieced pieced

149
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,780
pieced and above every point in time

150
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,000
lies a Sheaf and I know I've discussed

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,539
sheafs before so above every point in uh

152
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,539
every Point Yeah It's Tricky so if every

153
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,160
point is modeled it's something singular

154
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,080
and you authenticate at every point then

155
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,220
what you're actually doing is like a

156
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,380
grand interpolation so to say that you

157
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,900
have an identity is actually tricky so

158
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,220
quantum mechanics is actually going to

159
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,479
justify this proof it's going to say

160
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,180
well isolated systems undergo unitary

161
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,220
Evolution which produces non-separable

162
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,460
States so this is irrefutable so we say

163
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,280
me plus everything butt means it is an

164
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,880
isolated system and we take everything

165
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,060
seriously so asymptotically I am

166
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,500
actually entangled with everything else

167
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,000
so neitheros has a separate identity

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,860
right so we are we're open we're opening

169
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,360
our arms and saying you know someone

170
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,360
help so maybe we only get away with what

171
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,120
this is in each instantaneous experience

172
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,460
this is what we're saying uh it includes

173
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,720
experiences of memories but it's

174
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,940
completely meaningless other than for

175
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,639
instant to me instantaneously

176
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,259
so that meaning is something that we

177
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,600
actually have to continually assign to

178
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,180
this notion of instantaneousness so in

179
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,919
this paper we focus on a few questions

180
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,660
that we say what are we actually doing

181
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,880
when we do mathematics or art or science

182
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,160
or philosophy that explains the actual

183
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,960
correlation what we've called math art

184
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,060
so what are we actually doing when we do

185
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,639
anything a creative act in general so

186
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,960
how do we account for that trajectory

187
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,240
through the 20th century it's very very

188
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,600
heavy that you move from a sense of

189
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,240
solidity into extreme abstraction

190
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,720
fragmentation depersonalization why have

191
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,220
all the creative disciplines followed

192
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,080
this trajectory they seem to abstract

193
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,919
subtract uh what are we left with so you

194
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,419
know we claim that well what it's been

195
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,160
deconstructed across all the creative

196
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,979
disciplines is actually the self the

197
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,740
self in particular The Confident

198
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,419
Cartesian self as an independent

199
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,580
objective Observer and a directed

200
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,780
voluntary actor so this is done so in

201
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,580
while we were working I asked Chris all

202
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,560
the time why can we never actually

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,680
access what causes a thought and so he

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,120
would say well no finite system can

205
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,979
contain a complete representation of its

206
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,020
own Dynamics okay you run into a problem

207
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,819
with self-reference why are there no

208
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,319
things in themselves well because

209
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,819
quantum theory is going to strike us as

210
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,560
self-evidently true at least as a

211
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,639
description of the interaction between

212
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,099
any finite system and its world and its

213
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:11,880
world

214
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,800
I still to this day ask what is a

215
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,940
thought

216
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,500
what is a thought and why is it that

217
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,060
maybe my thought is somebody else's

218
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,080
memory

219
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,300
what is that if somebody's memory my

220
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,300
thought you know delus talks about this

221
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,560
body without organs which I'm going to

222
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,900
get to and he opens the the paragraph

223
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,300
with at any rate you have one

224
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,339
so thoughts what are these at any rate

225
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:35,520
you have them uh so we're just we're

226
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,640
we're grasping here a thought is a modal

227
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,399
as in like a sensory mode it's an

228
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,958
immodal experience that's generated by

229
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,420
imagination and not perception

230
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,459
but what does imagination mean from an

231
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,140
actual like quantum theory perspective

232
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,880
so it must be a source of classical

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
information

234
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,940
so hence it must be written on a

235
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,160
boundary but it differs in a significant

236
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,500
way from an action on quote the world

237
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,660
because it's my imaginary world so we're

238
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,339
really we really dive into this paper is

239
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,160
like how do imagination and sensation

240
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,480
compete so there's a central

241
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,860
contradiction which I'm going to just

242
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,899
kind of go quickly through experiencers

243
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,519
really want to understand the source of

244
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,899
their experience

245
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,580
but it's actually impossible in

246
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,320
principle all you really do is just

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,500
overlay the experience with the theory

248
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,180
and then but what produce them is still

249
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,700
inaccessible in principle so category

250
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,860
Theory can help mitigate this a little

251
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,480
bit so you know there's always going to

252
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,740
be morphisms acting on whatever

253
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,959
structure we call it imminent so

254
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,360
morphisms you deem something as imminent

255
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,800
you have morphisms acting on this

256
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,060
structure

257
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,440
um otherwise you would have zero change

258
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,300
otherwise you would have fixed agents we

259
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,760
call it of temporal with zero that would

260
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,440
experience becoming but they never

261
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,519
become

262
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,000
so there is there would be no change

263
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
um yeah so the fundamental contradiction

264
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,480
any philosophy of becoming is that it

265
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,940
requires an assumption of processes

266
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,480
outside of any possible experience so

267
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,740
we're going to use sheaves and category

268
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,360
Theory to kind of get through this so

269
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,580
one of our main ideas is linking

270
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,140
imagination and the free energy

271
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,880
principles so we're actually going to

272
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,740
say that all imaginative activity is

273
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,800
both constructive and active we actually

274
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,140
have an agent a literal sense of action

275
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,300
by the agent all the agents actually on

276
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,760
on their world so using the variational

277
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,380
free energy principle we're going to say

278
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,620
we consider all creative activity

279
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,060
including all imaginative activity is

280
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,279
actually problem solving we're creation

281
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,459
we're creating novelty and uncertainty

282
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,680
in the service of testing and improving

283
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,660
a model of the experience World 100

284
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,680
percent

285
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,899
so acting creativity is you're actually

286
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,279
going to act on the world with the

287
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,899
intention of provoking an informative

288
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,000
response from the world so we say to

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
make artists to perform an experiment an

290
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,560
immediate consequence of this is that

291
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,860
all art is provocative experimental all

292
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,620
art is informative just as science is

293
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,300
informative to the extent and in

294
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,920
proportion and it's provocative and

295
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,019
experimental so we really hit this hard

296
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,000
we go right and right into it and we say

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,740
you know mathematics is actually going

298
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,480
to exemplify and express the very

299
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,760
particular dissolution of the self with

300
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,220
the greatest Clarity and poetry for some

301
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,260
reason mathematics can get a horrible

302
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,839
represent reputation that it's like

303
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,300
actually like devoid of creativity we're

304
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,519
saying it's not so Gotham makes notion

305
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,380
of a site it actually really

306
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,560
encapsulates what this whole notion it

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,079
removes the solidity and locatedness of

308
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,360
the traditional idea of a point

309
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,339
right classical physics is based on the

310
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,560
idea of modeling particles as points

311
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,779
math is that the growth index side is

312
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:34,980
actually going to kind of destroy that

313
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,980
it replaces the notion of a point with

314
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,420
something that is structureless and

315
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,180
ephemeral and moreover the notion of a

316
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,940
condensed set is going to be like a

317
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,160
notion of sheaves on a point so it's no

318
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,260
longer about the point so we've kind of

319
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,720
like thrown out ontology with that so

320
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,160
category theory is going to allow these

321
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,200
structures to be transferred and then um

322
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
so we're going to introduce the society

323
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,820
line and we're going to look at Francis

324
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,399
Bacon's work as like an artistic

325
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,700
provocateur of this stuff so when we say

326
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,860
our greatest construct is like you know

327
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,899
our mind we're left with we're left with

328
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,459
the question of how we as artists or

329
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,740
scientists or as Bayesian uncertainty

330
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,200
minimizers how can we actually see each

331
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,420
other as fellow agents communicate and

332
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,279
share ideas this is actually really

333
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,019
beautiful makes you ask what is language

334
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,940
and what does it actually mean to say

335
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,279
that art and math are actually languages

336
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,740
what does it mean to be a speaker or a

337
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,300
writer when the deconstructionist

338
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,220
challenge is you know challenge is the

339
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,560
very notion of objectivity and say from

340
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,320
bars that text Unity lies not in its

341
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,899
origin but in its destination that's

342
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,820
powerful not in its origin but it's

343
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,220
dependent on the person reading it so

344
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,899
quoting bars again we will no longer be

345
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,639
fooled by The Arrogant anti-practical

346
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,500
recriminations of good Society in favor

347
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,839
of the very thing it sets aside ignores

348
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,300
Smothers or destroys so we're going

349
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,760
apart and through the actual notion of

350
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,920
what is mined what is self

351
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,079
so does a shared semantics can it even

352
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,079
be be assumed so when we say that all

353
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,220
action is created we're going to get a

354
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,720
little neurological here

355
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,940
um creativity it actually poses a

356
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,940
complete Paradox to the very antiseptic

357
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,399
Western philosophical tradition which is

358
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,660
saying that you know it values

359
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,420
reflective deliberate rules-based

360
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,600
thinking type 2 cognition although it's

361
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,920
a little more wild which is the

362
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,860
immediate intuitive unreflective type 1

363
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,720
or process one judgment

364
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,700
so Chris is heavily trained in this

365
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,920
section rate of insight it actually has

366
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,980
the phenomenology of type 1 cognition

367
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,860
but a greater value than most type 2

368
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,959
cognition it's called the outlier right

369
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,220
so we're actually putting together a

370
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,139
phenomenology of the outlier

371
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,519
so you know and again the Western

372
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,279
discomfort is understandable uh one of

373
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,260
the key attributes of an outlier is it's

374
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,139
unpredictable unpredictability so the

375
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,360
academy from like Plato onward you know

376
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,040
is designed to render the insights of

377
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,579
others formulaic and reproducible

378
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,620
so but then you've got you what's

379
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,600
beautiful are these flow states of

380
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,480
cognition uh super athletes go into this

381
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,519
state right um in which activities are

382
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,500
performed with the automaticity that

383
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,540
comes with deep experience and expertise

384
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,519
so you have something automatic that's

385
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,079
actually coming from you know excellent

386
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,940
trained but you always talk about anyone

387
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,320
in Flow State they say I'm getting out

388
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,500
of my way there is no eye anymore so you

389
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,019
combine the phenomenology of type 1

390
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,060
cognition with the feeling of ease or

391
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,279
Bliss or ecstasy or automatic pilot

392
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,420
whatever they call it you know and you

393
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,279
get a best performance out of it so I'll

394
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,779
talk a few more slides and then we'll

395
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,940
pause for like any any like putting

396
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,740
together right before we get to Francis

397
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,720
Bacon so we say imagination and

398
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,279
sensation compete this is actually

399
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,019
really beautiful to me

400
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,600
um uh Chris and I find ourselves on

401
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,240
opposite sides of the of the a Fantasia

402
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,959
Spectrum which is like the a Fantasia

403
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,740
um is uh classified as uh someone that

404
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,040
it does not have a or it is a deficit in

405
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,420
a very Rich visualization versus the

406
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,699
hyper Fantasia which is someone who has

407
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,579
so much richer visualization and memory

408
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:12,660
that the reality seems um dull compared

409
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,100
to the actual imaginative experience

410
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,480
right that the imagination is so

411
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,220
overwhelming so it's beautiful that we

412
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,019
write on opposite sides of this spectrum

413
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,600
and we can and I think that's what makes

414
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,060
this work so powerful so if imagination

415
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,399
sensation compete how well deliberate

416
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,839
thought what is deliberate thought so

417
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,040
it's a sequence of ideas that's

418
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,560
presented to Consciousness but by

419
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,720
unconscious processes

420
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,820
so I found this curious so the real work

421
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,980
is happening below the threshold of

422
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,560
awareness we've always asked what are

423
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,120
these fundamental units of life if

424
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,560
anyone knows anyone who's really sick

425
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,779
the personality is definitely the last

426
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,060
thing that sort of comes online it is

427
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,220
are the organs functioning is the heart

428
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,660
functioning and then comes little

429
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,660
personality and appetite in these things

430
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,399
so what is this threshold of awareness

431
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,019
what are these fundamental units of Life

432
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,600
why should so much be going on below it

433
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,000
why so then we have this hint

434
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,519
imagination maybe we can gleam a little

435
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,779
bit of what's going on neurologically

436
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:07,800
about what's happening in the

437
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,660
imaginative realm so we say the ability

438
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,980
to have sensory and emotional

439
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,019
experiences without engaging sensory

440
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,279
input

441
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,339
so this is uh Chris and Rosalyn and

442
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,839
Andrew and Hannah have tried to identify

443
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,660
what imagination is it's sensory though

444
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,480
it is sensory because it does engage

445
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,300
this same large-scale functional neural

446
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,360
networks that process sensory inputs I

447
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,459
myself did not know this I myself and I

448
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,959
told Chris I said you know when I'm

449
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,940
doing a lot of math or something I try

450
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,880
not to leave I find myself uh not able

451
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,740
to operate like heavy machinery and I've

452
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,720
spoken out about this like very very

453
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,300
honestly and he was like Shanna that's

454
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,180
because those they actually compete for

455
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,620
the same hardware and I said you've got

456
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,660
to be kidding me so he in the paper he

457
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,579
really he gives an example of like one

458
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,019
of his professors that would speak but

459
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,300
was holding the wall at the same time to

460
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,399
remember that the wall is there but the

461
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,279
imaginary field is so full so we talk

462
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,439
about resource sharing so sensation

463
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,599
imagination compete they render inner

464
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,119
speech difficult in noisy environments

465
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,160
and visualization difficult during

466
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,660
visually demanding tasks like driving

467
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,819
you don't want to be like thinking of

468
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,500
thinking of something like a perfectoid

469
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,059
spit in your driving like that is a red

470
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,760
light you know stop so sensory

471
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,079
deprivation actually enhances

472
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,380
imagination why so we I'll just go

473
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,760
quickly through reality monitoring

474
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,799
there's um you know the unintentional

475
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,480
blindness of abstract thinker somebody

476
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,340
like me you cannot physically see the

477
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,840
outside because your mind is thinking of

478
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,820
everything else this can be chalked up

479
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,160
to competition from imagination so again

480
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,200
sensory networks can be taken over by

481
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,419
imagination and then imaginative

482
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,580
experiences episodic memories and

483
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,620
thinking these are very present to

484
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,200
awareness because being both sensory and

485
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,419
emotional they're create they're treated

486
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,720
by the brain as both important so this

487
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,580
gets really interesting so this this

488
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,500
reality monitoring Network involving the

489
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,539
most phylogenetically recent areas of

490
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,000
the prefrontal cortex really has the

491
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,860
task of distinguishing sensory inputs

492
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,720
from imagination

493
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,460
do we have a distinction can I tell

494
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,080
what's real versus what the meta change

495
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,700
and we want to label them as such an

496
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,799
awareness so

497
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,080
um in Neuroscience you know you can we

498
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,820
we experience these imaginings as

499
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,400
memories and pictures and you know we're

500
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,660
going to use them to understand the

501
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,760
world so the picture of the brain is

502
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,679
employing all of its available resources

503
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
to model the world right um and to act

504
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,539
appropriately within it has been given a

505
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:31,860
beautiful elegant mathematical

506
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,080
formulation for standard fields that

507
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,580
both done this the free energy principle

508
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,380
we've worked on this that any sense any

509
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,900
system will behave so as to minimize to

510
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,299
the extent possible it's uncertainty

511
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,520
about its environment's future actions

512
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,179
on it absolutely 100 here so we

513
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,160
formalize it as a variational free

514
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,840
energy principle so it's actually a

515
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,700
thermodynamic principle that applies to

516
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,080
all classical and Quantum physical

517
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,780
systems not just to brains so we're

518
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,400
actually it drives the process of active

519
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,780
inference incorporates learning about

520
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,000
the world as it presents itself actively

521
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,500
probing the world to provoke informative

522
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,660
responses so that you're constantly

523
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,720
performing all of this you know um is

524
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,000
beautiful and it also leads to an it's

525
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,980
it's Dynamic it is dynamic and we're

526
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,900
actually trying to figure out what is

527
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,360
the self and a free energy principle and

528
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,640
the uh what happens to the self as you

529
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,760
know as you apply variation to this and

530
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,880
um the time to support such an elegant

531
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,580
Theory like fep so I should pause there

532
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,140
to see anything else before we launch

533
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,419
and just to the next chunk of the actual

534
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,940
Arty stuff

535
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,539
great well there's already so much I

536
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,400
know I'm sorry what are some of the

537
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,280
formalisms I'll look forward to it a few

538
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,559
comments on the point of math and heavy

539
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,720
machinery they say don't derive and

540
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,600
drive that's what I've heard that's

541
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,740
great um then on the type 1 and type 2

542
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,559
and it made me think about how rather

543
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,260
than a category

544
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,880
of thought

545
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,340
or simple modes that are exclusionary to

546
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,400
each other type 1 and type 2 are like

547
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,780
axes in a space of behaviors and so

548
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,240
there are quadrants so to speak and

549
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,520
you're speaking to the phenomenology of

550
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,419
the outlier which is that

551
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:25,679
flow with skill and Novelty and then one

552
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,600
last point was you talked about active

553
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,860
imagination

554
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,620
and that fits in very well with some of

555
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,660
the computational models in active

556
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,559
inference where attention is a policy

557
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,919
selection so it puts attention as mental

558
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:41,940
action

559
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,039
in the same exact formalisms that we

560
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,340
would use for bodily policy selection

561
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,679
and and uh the choosing from affordances

562
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,679
attention and the inner world is like

563
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,340
policy selection on inner Landscapes and

564
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,620
I think there's many angles to explore

565
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,960
with what does it mean to create what

566
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,940
does it mean to re-create what's

567
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,280
recreational what does it mean to member

568
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,039
what does it mean to remember what is

569
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,400
this aspect of initial generation and

570
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,100
what is the aspect of regeneration when

571
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,500
we use our generative model as a

572
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,679
regenerative model potentially

573
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,780
authenticating the observations like you

574
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,299
described earlier

575
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,460
wow that is so like yeah so beautifully

576
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,960
said I'm really interested in these

577
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,520
inner landscapes

578
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,400
okay yeah once I talk about uh bacon and

579
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,740
the BW body without organs I would love

580
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,260
to see what you think after that

581
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,240
excellent okay let's let's carry on

582
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,780
I love these books all right so uh I

583
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,280
think I briefly mentioned his Sadi

584
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,740
before I do think it's overlooked in the

585
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,400
um in like the the realm of Neurology

586
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,799
and maybe we should take a look at it so

587
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,260
um Atari quote the coin this notion of

588
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,760
his Sadie

589
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,240
um and what is this right so the hasadi

590
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,559
we're going to get to get you the

591
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,360
definition about two seconds but it's a

592
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,039
new take on what individuality actually

593
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,320
means so it's an individuality that is

594
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,860
devoid uh that is trying to free itself

595
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,900
from subjectivity so they say like

596
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,179
trying to be a subject sometimes that's

597
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,760
actually too much to ask for someone who

598
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,340
maybe like you know hurting or in a

599
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,740
state of like you know uh extreme

600
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,659
pressure maybe didn't do so well on

601
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,880
something actually requiring someone to

602
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,400
be a subject could be too high of a toll

603
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,260
and individuality

604
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,419
um a husseini evokes an individuality to

605
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,159
something less than a subject I found it

606
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,720
so freeing I was like can I just please

607
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,260
be a horse today can I please just um

608
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,480
you know can I be a glass of water can I

609
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,460
have the being and the affordances of a

610
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,039
glass of water and put aside the subject

611
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,960
just for a second I need to rest right

612
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,640
so this is the kind of thought process

613
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,960
that like happens and all of us know

614
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,460
that in intense academic programs you

615
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,740
have to kind of rest you know

616
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,780
um so when we talk about again the

617
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,059
Neuroscience of creativity

618
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,860
um so what what does it mean to have a

619
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,720
decreased activation of the sense of

620
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,659
self so we ask this rest of this opening

621
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,640
what is this sense of self and how does

622
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,559
it relate to the self

623
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,120
sense of self and how does it actually

624
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,520
relate to these self can you actually

625
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,740
parse this should we say that the self

626
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,080
observes this sense of self

627
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,720
or does this sense of self observe

628
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,280
itself

629
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,440
right and I know fep can guide us

630
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,000
through something like that there's not

631
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,980
a lot of propositions that could right

632
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,620
if you don't have fep you may not be

633
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,559
able to like fine-tune this and this

634
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,659
kind of dynamicism most people would

635
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,700
just jump right over it so these like

636
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,620
the reflexive play on words which is the

637
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,960
very ground of like priest um you know

638
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,500
uh logic paradoxes and and thought

639
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,419
paradoxes and which which she calls

640
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,640
limit paradoxes so anytime you put it

641
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,020
like a self-reference on a system you're

642
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,900
going to have these problems so um we we

643
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,179
invoke this notion of an eigen form it's

644
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,280
a fixed point of a recursive process and

645
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,960
we're going to say that like

646
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,760
um saying you know that you have this

647
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,659
this

648
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,299
iteration this recursion actually

649
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:10,919
generalizes the idea of an identity

650
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,960
operator and it's going to implement the

651
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,179
eternal return so we're trying to sort

652
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:19,260
of mix this reflexivity with the often

653
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,200
with authenticating an object and what

654
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,039
does that actually mean with the

655
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,380
internal returns so again brilliantly

656
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,580
says like it's the law of a world

657
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,960
without being without Unity without

658
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,100
identity

659
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,900
far from presupposing the one or the

660
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,580
same the eternal return constitutes the

661
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,919
only Unity of the multiple as such the

662
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,600
only identity of what actually differs

663
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,179
so coming back is the only being of

664
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,220
becoming and the the function of the

665
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,080
eternal return as being is never to

666
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,780
identify but to authenticate so those

667
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,299
two once again we are finding Two Worlds

668
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,980
that are colliding on the authentication

669
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,620
different phenomenologies so if we

670
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,480
conceptualize math art in all creative

671
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,940
activities ways of distilling experience

672
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,059
into meaningful and memorable summaries

673
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,580
or abstracts so how do you how do you

674
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,760
impose meaning what why does an agent

675
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,559
impose meaning and how external meaning

676
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,880
internal meaning on the internal

677
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,740
Landscapes so we're saying that these

678
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,600
are actually Technologies for preserving

679
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,120
useful and significant aspects of

680
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,360
experience over time but we we 100 say

681
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,780
memory is constructive it requires an

682
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,280
act of authentication you got to be real

683
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,659
careful about what's actually being

684
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:25,980
authenticated like you said earlier

685
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,039
member versus remember so that qualifier

686
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,740
is actually kind of troubling so Chris

687
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,900
brilliantly said the Dark Ages lost not

688
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,000
so much text but the ability to read

689
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,140
them

690
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,940
so we say if identification is by

691
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,640
definition post-hoc after the fact what

692
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,919
is actually being authenticated what is

693
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,840
this once again I think this is another

694
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,940
limit Paradox I'm taking the notion of

695
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,559
authentication and ramming it until it's

696
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,120
going to fall apart

697
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,039
so Duluth says Society is again another

698
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,360
mode of individuation very different

699
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,799
from that of a person subject thing or

700
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,200
substance you reserve the name has Saidi

701
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,419
for it a season a winter a summer an

702
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:01,559
hour a date they have a perfect

703
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,440
individuality lacking nothing it is not

704
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,960
a thing or a subject a degree of heat an

705
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,400
intensity of Life perfect

706
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,440
individualities notice this abstraction

707
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,020
away from the subject we talk about the

708
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,120
aha moment we're going to say to the aha

709
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,100
moment does not obey the ordinary time

710
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,820
of doing and happening so if there

711
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,039
really is no self present during the aha

712
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,559
moment who is experiencing anything

713
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,100
time without present I without I this is

714
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,559
nothing of which one could say that

715
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,000
experience a form of knowledge would

716
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,799
either reveal or conceal it commensure

717
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,059
it with it there is no faith that is

718
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,940
blancho powerful so we're invoking heavy

719
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,799
Continental philosophy at the same time

720
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,500
of a neurological phenomena the aha

721
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,539
moment so blancho is powerful they're

722
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,279
commensurate with that aha moment there

723
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,380
is no faith what is that meaning there

724
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,480
is nothing measurable in that moment so

725
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,980
we say that they'll have a time of bliss

726
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,500
obeys the time of has Saidi it's it's a

727
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,120
completely different time it's that flow

728
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,100
time it's sharply contrasted with the

729
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,320
situational time of doing and and things

730
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,080
to be done so we say the individual the

731
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,940
individuation of a life is not the same

732
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,440
as it is the individuation of the

733
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,779
subject that leads it or serves as its

734
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,900
support So to say anytime not it's not

735
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,240
in the same time the same temporality I

736
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,279
think this is beautifully said so Eon

737
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,659
it's the indefinite time of the event

738
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,640
it's floating it's actually it's

739
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,960
something that is both going to happen

740
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,659
it's just happened so blanchelle also

741
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,659
has this beautiful notion of passivity

742
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:29,159
absolutely passivity no self present to

743
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:31,740
categorize the other as a depersonal of

744
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,480
time of bliss it's almost as an

745
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,340
abdication so all of this is

746
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,539
self-abdication either through

747
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,640
mathematics or philosophy so in this

748
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,260
state there really is no self to Grant

749
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,000
the authorization to say that anything

750
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
happens if there's no self-present who's

751
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
to say that anything happens according

752
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,539
to that the inner world of experience

753
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,179
so he has this quote he says I I would

754
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,220
prefer not to that statement is an

755
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,320
abstention she never had to be decided

756
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,320
upon it precedes all decisions and which

757
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,240
is not so much a denial as more than

758
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,159
that an abdication I thought that was

759
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,480
beautiful it belongs to the

760
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,419
infinitiveness of patients so that sort

761
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,520
of hard Infinity no dialectical

762
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,020
intervention can take hold of such

763
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,960
passivity so we've Fallen outside the

764
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,340
world of being outside we're immobile

765
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,840
proceeding with a slow and even step

766
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,120
destroyed men come and go this is the

767
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,039
realm I love this realm can in this

768
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,080
realm can we mathematize what's going on

769
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,820
here with fep insights and condensed

770
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,220
formalism so when you get to Source

771
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,480
monitoring there's a sense of

772
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,880
uncapturable time unreportable events

773
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,340
occur and possibly intended but

774
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,860
uncontrollable actions happen and it's

775
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,720
forced onto Us by quantum theory quantum

776
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,799
theory is a beautiful theory about

777
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,500
non-fungible or unshareable information

778
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,720
now that's precisely the quantum phase

779
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,520
information that distinguishes an

780
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,980
individuate's Quantum States it enforces

781
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,840
a radical uniqueness onto Quantum

782
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,600
systems radically unique challenges the

783
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,279
very the very idea of fully transparent

784
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,520
information sharing non-fungibility so

785
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,559
if we use the time of the Sadie then it

786
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,299
puts the the reality monitoring in a new

787
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,340
light in our own reality we're

788
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,080
monitoring including our own ability to

789
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,000
remember and authenticate but we are

790
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,760
more moreover only monitoring a

791
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,640
simulacrum of the event itself it is is

792
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,400
non-fungible and unrecordable so we say

793
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,720
that reality monitoring becomes a

794
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,460
rationalizing reconstruction the form of

795
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,899
motivated reasoning it serves the need

796
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,600
for instability doesn't really exist so

797
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,399
the continuity of time we are hardcore

798
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,220
claiming that it's illusory

799
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,840
so let's get into the self and jump into

800
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,279
grothentic and airdosh this is really

801
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,860
fun so we bring up young and some

802
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,539
beautiful things that uh that young was

803
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,520
thinking about so the reportable self

804
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,740
that Shanna that you know participated

805
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,720
yesterday it did all the things in the

806
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,220
past has plans for the future the self

807
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,020
that has beliefs and desires and other

808
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,600
attitudes the self with relationships

809
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,940
right this is the constructed self of

810
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,220
memory in in words of Seth so the

811
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,559
reportable self the the experienced self

812
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,200
the I that speaks and thinks this is the

813
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,520
eye that directs the body it's conscious

814
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,520
but severe sufficiently severe

815
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,799
anterogrid Amnesia can almost surgically

816
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,960
remove the experience itself I spoke of

817
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,480
Clive wearing before five ring has lost

818
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,520
personal memory still has motor memory

819
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,799
we'll walk in and say I you know I I've

820
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,179
never seen a doctor before in my life

821
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,500
they visit him all the time I've never

822
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,120
seen a piano before in my life but can

823
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,440
play one

824
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,600
um what what sort of experience is this

825
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,279
Clive has about a six second memory

826
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,159
right where's the authentication in a

827
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,860
six second memory right so uh Clive you

828
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,899
know Clive's use of I is profoundly

829
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:30,779
different than mine so I replied using

830
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:33,000
an eye this actually has no enduring

831
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,460
first person subject reference and what

832
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,140
can we make of that so we're forming

833
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,460
we're going to formally distinguish this

834
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,260
constructed Cartesian cell from the

835
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,440
ungraspable self-advisity what Young is

836
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,779
going to call a virtual point so young

837
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,000
started all this virtual point it's a

838
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,620
virtual point on some kind of scale

839
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,260
between unconscious and conscious so our

840
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,820
interest here is in what this experience

841
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,700
itself is like how it how it differs so

842
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,260
here's the amphitheater in the a

843
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,179
Fantasia spectrum that I spoke about uh

844
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,399
earlier a lot of people live without

845
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,440
significant internally verbalized

846
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,539
thoughts now for people in Academia or

847
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,159
people like Daniel and I like I'm

848
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,740
talking to myself all the time so

849
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,480
imagine a world where there is no

850
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,480
internal like verbalized thoughts so

851
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,279
Zeman actually sharpened this

852
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,200
distinction by introducing the Fantasia

853
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,480
Spectrum so people at capable experience

854
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,179
rich multimodal imaginings on one end

855
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,720
people severely shed in imagination in

856
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,640
at least one modality on the other so we

857
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,720
actually write in the paper that we

858
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,159
ourselves the present authors are on

859
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,659
opposite ends of the spectrum for the

860
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,460
modality of vision I think Chris will

861
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,440
remember like pure text and mine has so

862
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,760
many colors in it I don't even know

863
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,980
what's happening so a Fantasia it

864
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,260
applies to all uses of the imagination

865
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,600
include shooting the Reconstruction of

866
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,980
episodic memories there are some people

867
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,200
who have no bylaw no biographical memory

868
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,080
a fantasics also experience deficits in

869
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,799
episodic memory the purely verbal

870
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,240
textbook-like episodic memories of CF

871
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,460
Chris Fields so curiously but dream

872
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,059
imagery can be preserved in a Fantastics

873
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,159
dream imagery can be preserved so

874
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,559
somehow it's the conscious attention to

875
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,140
imagination that is deficit and I found

876
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,240
that perplexing but then Chris said well

877
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,620
it's not really surprising conscious

878
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,740
attention is a competitive process who

879
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,600
or what wins the competition is not

880
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,820
voluntarily chosen so many things are

881
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,860
competing here so let's jump into the

882
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,720
body without organs so

883
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,760
we say if the cell for is actually a

884
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,860
construction what what is it what are

885
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,899
its identity conditions right so what

886
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,640
guarantees that the self that I

887
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,500
construct now is the same as the self I

888
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,240
constructed as a child as a student or

889
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,580
even yesterday how can we make any sense

890
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,120
of any proposed continuity of self over

891
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,640
time Chris and I are still on this right

892
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,520
I I am like Enchanted by the notion of

893
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,740
overtime what does that actually mean so

894
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,320
the standard idea of like a closest uh

895
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,260
like causal continuer like the I the I

896
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,260
somehow moves through something and it

897
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,520
doesn't really straightforwardly apply

898
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,020
it's claiming that I am still the

899
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,700
Constructor of myself

900
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,640
merely begs the question again so uh

901
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,679
maybe we could see learning or

902
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,539
experience generally as modifying the

903
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,580
cell these are either gradually or by or

904
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,320
by saltations which we think maybe

905
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,720
that's what it is so daily using Atari

906
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,340
posit this body without organs right

907
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,380
we're really going at it here so but

908
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,640
where they say that a body is actually

909
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,559
not determined not defined by the form

910
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,260
that it determines that determines it

911
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,059
nor is it actually a determinate

912
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,220
substance or subject

913
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,320
um nor is it determined by the organs

914
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,019
that possess it so our toe was Notorious

915
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,179
for waging like war against the organs

916
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,279
right I don't want the organs I'm

917
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,620
independent of them and so they don't

918
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,299
they Define this body without organs

919
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:44,340
which is actually trying to free itself

920
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,320
from the determinism and say that it's a

921
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,899
collectivity it's an an assembling

922
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,080
elements things plants animals tools

923
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,419
um it's not my body without organs

924
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:58,440
instead the me the me is on it

925
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,260
or what remains of me unalterable and

926
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,059
changing informed Crossing threshold so

927
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,039
Burrows famously wrote about this about

928
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,380
how um in some people a certain deficit

929
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,780
like functioning uh organs would just

930
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,060
seemingly Sprout anywhere The Crossing

931
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,159
threshold is really fun so it actually

932
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,159
the bwo proceeds without by contagion

933
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,520
rather than by category categorizable

934
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,820
identities that quote stay stratified

935
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,980
and so they call the three axes of

936
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,739
stratification organization

937
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,139
signification and subjectivity so these

938
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,580
after all the organism it's not at all

939
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,239
the body it's a stratum it's a stratum

940
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,580
on the body without organs so in

941
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,020
contrast to the pressure of continually

942
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,080
having the same self over time whatever

943
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,540
that actually means they offer quite the

944
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,879
opposite I love this this quote in the

945
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,500
text this is in the capitalism and

946
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,839
schizophrenia book so they say recycle

947
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,418
analysis says stop find yourself again

948
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,300
we should say instead let's go further

949
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,980
still we haven't found our body without

950
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,800
organs yet we haven't sufficiently

951
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,020
sufficiently dismantled ourselves

952
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,520
substitute forgetting or an amnesis

953
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,099
experimentation for interpretation find

954
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,380
your beauty be body without organs find

955
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,599
out how to make it most importantly they

956
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,940
say it has nothing to do with fantasy

957
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,339
there's nothing to interpret so to

958
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,560
losing Atari famously or trying to

959
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,660
overthrow ontology get rid of

960
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,820
interpretation which seems to classify

961
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,700
the very thing they're trying to free so

962
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,320
through the BW I made this connection

963
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,420
with Francis Bacon

964
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,160
uh which I thought was really powerful

965
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,680
so most people see the work and they are

966
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,240
like shocked at the level of the nervous

967
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,920
system or something like this so Prince

968
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,020
speaking did some wild things and Duluth

969
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,220
has a very beautiful book on him called

970
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,980
the hysteria of painting So DeLuise

971
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,560
views the The Becoming of painting in

972
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,720
the form of a logic of sensation it

973
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,060
functions through Hysteria by way of a

974
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,859
primordial pre-representative sensation

975
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,140
it's foundational too and over any

976
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,060
accessory forms that was my take on it

977
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,400
so Duluth claims that painting in the

978
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,579
sense of bacon becomes a hysteria it can

979
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,380
or it converts hysteria because it makes

980
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,380
presence immediately visible immediately

981
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,420
visible painting directly attempts to

982
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,520
release the presences beneath

983
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,940
representation Beyond representation the

984
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,220
color system itself is a sense of direct

985
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,680
action on the nervous system watch the

986
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,180
reactions people have looking at a bacon

987
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,099
painting if there's something what is

988
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,960
that and Duluth is trying to like

989
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,119
classify that he says this is not a

990
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,760
hysteria of the painter but a hysteria

991
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,220
of a painting so a painting hysteria

992
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,320
becomes art or rather with the painter

993
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,320
hysteria becomes painting

994
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,320
so in a sense where does the bwo come in

995
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,520
the body without organs right here well

996
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,680
it says painting liberates the eye from

997
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,619
its adherence to the organism the eye

998
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,020
becomes the virtually the polyvegan

999
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,359
indeterminate organism that sees the

1000
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,640
body without organs as pure presence

1001
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,700
so painting gives us eyes all over on

1002
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,800
the ear and the stomach and the lungs

1003
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,140
the painting actually breathes so

1004
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,880
another piece that the loose finds in

1005
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,380
Bacon's work is the phenomena of

1006
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,560
autosupiah autoscopy is the phenomenal

1007
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,440
where the body is felt under the body so

1008
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,359
there's transitory organs that are felt

1009
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,400
underneath the organization of the fixed

1010
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,560
organs and he says something like it's

1011
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,480
no longer my head but I feel myself

1012
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,660
inside ahead I see and I see myself

1013
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,300
inside a head is there a psychosis in

1014
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,220
the world that might include this sort

1015
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,400
of hysterical condition so what if we

1016
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,980
geometrize the autoscopia right here's

1017
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,839
where the math comes in

1018
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,940
um Duluth calls math a monster slang and

1019
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,260
that's probably because it can do things

1020
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,220
like this

1021
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,800
so the if the body

1022
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,300
um the loose talks about

1023
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,820
the body passing through itself to

1024
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,160
escape itself so the body is sick of the

1025
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,480
organization it's going to pass through

1026
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,160
itself to escape itself and you'll see

1027
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,800
these various points in Bacon's work in

1028
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,780
the triptychs and things like that so it

1029
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,040
escapes from itself through the open

1030
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,660
mouth or the stomach or through the

1031
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,160
throat or through the point of an

1032
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,780
umbrella and the presence of a body

1033
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,579
without organs underneath the organism

1034
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:05,460
the presence of transitory organs under

1035
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,040
the organic representation so again with

1036
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,140
the bwo you are freeing um so it's

1037
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,420
almost like the hysteria painting is

1038
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,460
allowing the bwo to sit on side of the

1039
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,680
color system so again Duluth is not

1040
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,359
advocating any kind of deconstruction uh

1041
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,099
destruction he's saying care and caution

1042
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,820
must be exercised to produce such a I

1043
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,339
called it a Solarium spacium of

1044
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,740
intensities so what is salt it's not

1045
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,660
forlorn bodies so they make this very

1046
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,619
clear in their book They're not

1047
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,480
advocating something destructive nothing

1048
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,700
forlorn or

1049
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,560
um you know bodies that have emptied

1050
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,599
themselves or their organs he's saying

1051
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,160
make it more Dynamic look for the point

1052
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,960
at which they could pace efficiently and

1053
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,540
momentarily dismantle the organization

1054
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,119
of the organs that we call the organism

1055
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,220
so body I claimed that a body passing

1056
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,839
through itself was a body without organs

1057
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,900
that became a hasadi and then

1058
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,119
um so if you can see the body passing

1059
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,400
through itself as a hasidi

1060
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,560
um then you can see the body passing

1061
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,180
through itself in the ways of Duluth

1062
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,980
calls it like the spastics and the hyper

1063
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,260
Aesthetics that are indicated by wiped

1064
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,240
or scrubbed Zone again on francis's

1065
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,700
triptychs and there's anesthetics and

1066
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,579
paralytics by missing zones so you can

1067
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:15,960
also get a phenomenal phenomenology

1068
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,180
about what is missing in these pieces so

1069
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,099
he says the zones are actually rhizomes

1070
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,839
but what's really beautiful is that when

1071
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,480
the body is indistinguishable from the

1072
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,400
paint colors that are used to produce it

1073
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,560
then the body actually passes through

1074
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,900
the paint at the same time as it passes

1075
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,200
through itself so begins form a painting

1076
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,900
is hysteria it's actually hesiti once

1077
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,640
again recalling that climate win season

1078
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,960
hour

1079
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,520
um they're not of another nature than

1080
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,380
the things that populate them

1081
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,660
they sleep and awaken with them so

1082
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,359
Duluth says famously um this sentence

1083
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,980
should be read without a pause the

1084
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,619
animal Stalks at five o'clock

1085
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,540
the animal stocks at five o'clock no

1086
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,400
subject object like

1087
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,839
um Coppola here

1088
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,880
so I I kind of put a spin on that and I

1089
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,079
said likewise this should be read

1090
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,119
without a pause hysteria painting body

1091
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,740
without organs becoming painting

1092
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,619
becoming animal

1093
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,820
so um we're about to jump into

1094
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,680
gruffending air dish

1095
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,200
maybe let's pause and see if any let's

1096
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,660
recap bwo and uh

1097
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,700
and then I'll get to aired ocean wrap it

1098
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,200
up

1099
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,800
okay I'll just add it right here hold on

1100
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,020
a few comments just try to connect some

1101
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,079
dots for those who are um painting along

1102
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,140
so first authenticate

1103
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,960
that reminded me of how we describe our

1104
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,060
experience or indeed pleasurable

1105
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,000
experiences as authentic and also

1106
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,160
authenticate has a more technical

1107
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,960
definition with cryptographic

1108
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,880
verification so there's some

1109
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,300
relationships with kind of lock and key

1110
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,700
cryptographic ciphers and the Integrity

1111
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,520
of existence

1112
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,339
um you mentioned stratification

1113
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:59,760
and you used the terms organized

1114
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,880
signified and subjected and that made me

1115
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800
and you said the the body is a stratum

1116
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,920
and I thought of Riverbanks and the body

1117
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,180
in development does go through being a

1118
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,940
point with a zygote and then it's uh

1119
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,579
moving through topological and geometric

1120
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,099
phases now it's a two layer now it's a

1121
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:21,720
trilaminer disc and so we have a

1122
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,820
stratification through development and

1123
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,920
that's part of like the evolution of

1124
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Developmental complexity

1125
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,599
then art as site kind of disassembling

1126
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:37,880
but embracing this D pointing

1127
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,079
de-literalization or something of the

1128
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,440
point and seeing performance art and all

1129
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,540
are as performance but the locus of

1130
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,700
performance kind of like the cloud of

1131
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,859
the performance is the sights it's like

1132
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,260
you have to go to the show you have to

1133
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,240
be there it's about the experience and

1134
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,760
then even a type of Aesthetics like

1135
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,980
fashion there's like the narrative that

1136
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,560
comes along with the t-shirt that might

1137
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,480
look the same but then when somebody has

1138
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,460
a different Quantum reference frame or

1139
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,500
aesthetic reference frame it can mean a

1140
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,240
lot more and then just the last

1141
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,180
interesting point was that

1142
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,820
escape from autoscopia

1143
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,520
is quite an interesting

1144
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,920
idea and um should we pursue how should

1145
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,200
we pursue why would we pursue such

1146
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,859
approaches just because we can

1147
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,619
drive off the road or drive off one road

1148
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,980
or turn right or turn left or take off

1149
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,079
these affordances

1150
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:40,140
that cognitive entities have

1151
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,820
how should they be regarded and selected

1152
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,339
as to not imperil

1153
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:50,400
oneself if that is even something to be

1154
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,880
avoided

1155
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,400
oh wow okay I can't really talk about

1156
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,859
that one more yeah escaping autoscopia

1157
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,800
or autoscopia and like flipping it

1158
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,040
internalizing that even more

1159
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,140
um yeah this is excellent okay let's see

1160
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,180
if we get if we can link all of that

1161
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,700
with comparing two mathematical Giants

1162
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,760
undeniably cloth and Deacon erdosh so

1163
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,500
there is a field Mentalist that recently

1164
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,540
tried to um again you don't want to

1165
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,819
classify anybody but they seem to follow

1166
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:22,560
different tracks whereas eredosh is more

1167
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,560
of a problem solver right Problem Solver

1168
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,579
leaving

1169
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,680
um you know like little Jewels like I'll

1170
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,300
pay you if you can solve this et cetera

1171
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,380
et cetera et cetera right rampant

1172
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,760
publishing so many papers and things

1173
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,460
like that versus goth indeed laying

1174
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,680
heavy heavy Foundation I'm not sure was

1175
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,420
concerned again I would have loved to

1176
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,060
meet him to have met him but um

1177
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,099
um I know not not particularly concerned

1178
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,680
with problem solving but Theory building

1179
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,560
Theory Builder right I can't even list

1180
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,020
everything right so um

1181
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,240
when we we juxtapose we're saying which

1182
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,760
self and which time do these two

1183
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,040
mathematical Giants actually obey and

1184
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,599
where's the creativity involved in this

1185
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,520
again we are going to be infusing math

1186
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,099
and art into all of this uh both of

1187
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,780
these different fields are wildly

1188
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,960
created Eros again Super Famous Problem

1189
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,819
Solver um and like kind of more

1190
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,440
peripatetic

1191
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,420
um you know kind of traveling everyone

1192
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,920
knows these sort of eccentricities of

1193
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,540
traveling around and you would actually

1194
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,119
have the host a range where he was

1195
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,680
supposed to go next could cook for him

1196
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,300
and things like this you can play the

1197
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,260
different from growth Indy could

1198
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,480
literally left like an erasing an

1199
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,119
abdication so let's talk about these in

1200
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:31,380
a little more detail

1201
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,180
um again we're just going by like

1202
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,740
references neither one of us have met

1203
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,079
these people so um eridocious famous for

1204
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:38,940
saying you don't have to believe in God

1205
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,700
but you should believe in the book

1206
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,640
so the book is this uh his a met his uh

1207
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,839
he actually believed that there was a

1208
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,980
book that contained the most elegant

1209
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,200
theorems and expressions

1210
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,000
and we say what can we make of this sort

1211
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,240
of he treats the self as it's purely as

1212
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,980
its mathematical value

1213
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,540
self is mathematical by you through his

1214
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,800
belief in the book of divination

1215
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,599
containing the most elegant proofs and

1216
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,540
theorems literally according to like the

1217
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,520
life I think according to erdosh was in

1218
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,380
its mathematical value that's it right

1219
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,660
how many things can I publish uh what

1220
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,960
can I do he is famous for stopping

1221
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,180
um the use of like an amphetamine or

1222
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,000
something like this and uh for like for

1223
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,500
a month because his friends were worried

1224
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,660
about him and anyway so he famously says

1225
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,780
you know you've held mathematics back

1226
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,680
because you stopped me right uh I I

1227
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,660
looked at the blank paper like an

1228
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,520
ordinary person

1229
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,099
that's what he says right so um it's

1230
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,500
it's a little ruthless you know but it

1231
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,119
says like you held me back I looked at

1232
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,680
the paper like an ordinary person and

1233
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,940
this is all in the autobiography and

1234
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,740
it's also in the paper we talk about it

1235
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,579
so young quote Saint Paul famously and

1236
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:48,540
he says

1237
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,579
yet not I live

1238
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,760
but Christ liveth in me

1239
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,400
so we asked did erdogs not lived but the

1240
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,560
book levith in erdosh

1241
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,000
I think that's one of our most profound

1242
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,859
statements in this paper

1243
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,920
let's jump to grothendiq

1244
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,540
gothendig was after

1245
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,099
um he actually writes about what he says

1246
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,440
as a profound symbiosis between the hand

1247
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,660
that writes and the spirit or thought

1248
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,760
and of the creative act as the

1249
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,099
archetypal Act of the human spirit

1250
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,619
so by stating something like that there

1251
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:22,319
is a thought to believe that groffendig

1252
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,240
was aware of Young's work

1253
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,280
and this is very reminiscent of the

1254
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,560
actual virtual point

1255
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,800
so you know gothindeek um you know does

1256
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,300
not attend like the fields medal

1257
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,579
ceremony grows up stateless it's a

1258
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,579
completely different like uh being in a

1259
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:39,540
completely different relationship with

1260
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,359
self so we say what can we make of his

1261
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:44,460
literal disappearance so being into ihes

1262
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,859
you know he was a heavily anti-like the

1263
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:48,720
military funding and stuff like that

1264
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,300
um but literally just left right left

1265
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,280
and said like what can we actually make

1266
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,619
of that literal disappearance can we in

1267
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,480
particular see Roth and D C and Groff

1268
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,160
and Deek's concept of a site which is

1269
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,300
again I haven't defined that it's a

1270
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,640
category with an apology on it

1271
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,280
um very particular topology on it can we

1272
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,800
see in gruffendig's concept of a site

1273
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,520
um

1274
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,000
is that an abstraction of a point an

1275
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,359
urge to grasp the virtuality and

1276
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,880
dislocation that young ascribes to the

1277
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,780
self

1278
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,020
so what is that you know is that an

1279
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,880
actual way of grasping the virtuality

1280
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,440
and dislocation that young ascribes to

1281
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,640
the self

1282
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,520
how do you go from topos Theory

1283
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,579
um laying the wigs for a beautiful work

1284
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:34,380
in like a telecomology algebraic

1285
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,599
geometry uh

1286
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,640
um you know growth indeed group laying

1287
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,859
the matter for K Theory all this stuff

1288
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,900
to a question that haunted grothendiq

1289
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,240
which was what is a meter

1290
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,460
what is a meter you have a very very

1291
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,619
technical definition of what is a meter

1292
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:51,420
people I think have been kind of harsh

1293
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,220
with him and said something like oh well

1294
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,020
at that point he just lost his mind I'm

1295
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,060
like is that what happened you know is

1296
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,980
there a possibility that like what is

1297
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,599
the time of Mind laws can we be a little

1298
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,540
more gentler with that you know so you

1299
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,300
know you go from topo's Theory to like

1300
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,520
you know a complete hermit existence

1301
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,380
after that

1302
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,660
so closing thought that we have to ask

1303
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,780
is about the limit Paradox and we say

1304
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,359
we are left by the above not with an

1305
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:21,240
entity wrapped in a Markov blanket but

1306
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,640
with an imagined entity wrapped in an

1307
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,079
imagined blanket

1308
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:27,119
so we see a Quantum reference frame

1309
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,280
specifies a semantics so hints in the

1310
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,800
limit in which two agents fully share a

1311
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,780
common semantics and hence a Common

1312
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,520
Language they no longer have separate

1313
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,599
identities

1314
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:39,420
language itself becomes paradoxical

1315
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,300
information is nonetheless shareable

1316
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,819
although

1317
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:45,420
unfungible

1318
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,180
Communications exist this text exists

1319
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,160
you reading it exists the meaning you

1320
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,500
ascribe to it exists most importantly

1321
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,780
contradiction

1322
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,540
indeed a true contradiction a dialethia

1323
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,540
a limit Paradox so we say such paradoxes

1324
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,720
arise wherever there is self-reference

1325
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,460
and it shows how science applied to

1326
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,180
itself generates these limit paradoxes

1327
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,160
so indeed creative Acts

1328
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,200
are limit paradoxes

1329
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,720
we can go like uh you know the the model

1330
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,980
that we construct I want to like

1331
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,660
formally finish there but um everyone

1332
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,040
can find there's more information about

1333
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,319
the the very like empirical model that

1334
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,660
we Define our most important theorem is

1335
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,579
that an entropic categorization is a

1336
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:32,040
condensed set so we talk about like the

1337
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,140
phenomenology of categorizing you know

1338
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,740
events places things people memories and

1339
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,640
you know we call uh time is actually

1340
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,319
entropic because there is a flow of

1341
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:46,859
information that it values um learning

1342
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:50,280
over forgetting so once you have a

1343
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,140
disruption in this flow of learning

1344
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,540
versus you know versus uh forgetting

1345
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,160
um it's something like an Alzheimer's or

1346
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,560
something like this and is time no

1347
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,420
longer entropic in that case

1348
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,160
so that's why we call these

1349
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,960
categorizations entropic and we're going

1350
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,240
to say that this is condensed set so our

1351
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,920
famous prediction is that human

1352
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,740
retrospective and prospective memory are

1353
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,119
implemented by what are we we're going

1354
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,160
to call chiefification functors from a

1355
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,440
single Pro atel site so it's a site with

1356
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,140
a weekly Adele topology on it and it so

1357
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,079
again we're saying that monitoring the

1358
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,060
event-dependent phenomena through sites

1359
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,819
is the way that you know

1360
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:28,500
um is a better way of monitoring

1361
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,660
continuity quote over time so we're

1362
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,040
going to say if that's correct then we

1363
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,599
expect to find no persistent neural

1364
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,220
representation of either past or future

1365
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,319
events only mechanisms we're

1366
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:38,660
constructing

1367
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,579
instantaneous representations

1368
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:44,280
yeah then I think I just talk about that

1369
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,099
yeah why his Sadie and the questions and

1370
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:49,800
yeah so again you know can like sites

1371
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,599
you know reframe authentication daily

1372
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,220
theistically and

1373
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,440
if you do have this like overtime kind

1374
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,960
of thing what time is that you know

1375
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,760
great okay so I'll stop there

1376
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,440
or stop like the formal thing there to

1377
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,040
begin a discussion if you wanted that

1378
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,380
I'll pause there in time that I will

1379
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,619
pause there then then I then I will

1380
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:18,319
pause somewhere yeah

1381
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,460
and that's what that's the beauty of it

1382
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,900
it's like

1383
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,180
you know you can trip over reality right

1384
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,220
but as you zoom in

1385
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,380
it's very curious as to what is like

1386
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,200
what is holding all that together

1387
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,700
and it's very curious that the physicist

1388
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,800
is working on that you know dive pretty

1389
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,480
heavily into Eastern thinking or you've

1390
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,280
Groff and degrading young you know like

1391
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,420
trying to figure this stuff out

1392
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,619
I don't know what what do you think

1393
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:46,380
would have a take on a

1394
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,940
juxtaposing these vastly different

1395
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,220
ways of existing and interpreting their

1396
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,939
worlds right

1397
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:00,119
I wanted to pick up there and then of

1398
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,099
course we'll just see where we go and

1399
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,839
anyone who's watching may also add

1400
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,700
questions so

1401
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,160
the

1402
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,740
juxtaposition of growth indic and erdosh

1403
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,720
was very interesting

1404
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,000
and you described growthendig as a

1405
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,040
theory Builder and erdosh as a problem

1406
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,420
solver and that seemed to map back into

1407
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,480
that type 1 type 2 space

1408
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,680
like type 1 intuition is problem solving

1409
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,020
it's like the thing is falling off the

1410
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,380
table and there's a reflexive response

1411
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,960
to solve the problem even before there's

1412
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,660
a theory of the problem or someone is

1413
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,819
skiing and they're able to use their

1414
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:44,220
body and extended cognitive apparatus

1415
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,980
and skill and all of this to solve

1416
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,920
problems that aren't even stated in

1417
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,700
contrast the development of theory and

1418
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,540
generalizations and to codify

1419
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,280
is a a case

1420
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,099
Independence process you're solving a

1421
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,599
ton of problems you're solving every

1422
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:09,599
problem of a nail needing to be hit

1423
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,780
the hammer solves above any specific

1424
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,920
nail but also it solves no specific nail

1425
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,059
and um that I felt like was very

1426
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:26,040
illustrative and spoke to potentially

1427
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,079
other

1428
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,400
continua of

1429
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,720
doing and thinking

1430
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,280
what do you think about that yeah yeah

1431
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,859
just again it brings me back to this

1432
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:42,780
like Saint Paul like beautiful quote

1433
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,000
yeah not I love it but Christ liveth in

1434
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,940
me so that also seems uh

1435
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,680
that's tricky I'm not sure if that's

1436
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,859
like case independent right yeah it's

1437
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:56,339
almost like uh

1438
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,040
I like that solving the problem before

1439
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,599
there exists a theory of the problem

1440
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:02,520
that's tricky

1441
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,280
that's tricky uh

1442
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,800
and you know the the question is like

1443
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,319
what is the sense of self of a problem

1444
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,079
solver and versus a theory solver do you

1445
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:16,200
have to have a uh less tethered sense of

1446
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,540
self to be a theory Builder because

1447
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,700
you're trying to figure out for all

1448
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,980
possible males

1449
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:28,319
and that's I think that's I think uh

1450
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,300
I think a lot of mathematicians do that

1451
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,220
right because it's just all about the

1452
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,780
nobody really cares if you're well or

1453
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,940
not it's sort of just like did you Ace

1454
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,260
this exam

1455
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,059
did you Ace his exam did you finish the

1456
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:41,520
theorem did you do all of this and so

1457
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,200
everybody knows you know the reason

1458
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,640
there's a lot of like you know mental

1459
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,680
health like scares in fields like that

1460
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,780
is because nobody really asks how you

1461
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,859
are

1462
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:52,740
so I'm wondering if all the ideas about

1463
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,599
how is Shanna is she eating today she's

1464
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:57,900
sleeping oh you have to push it aside

1465
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,460
now look at all the pressure that Gotham

1466
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,260
digs under you have to push all the like

1467
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,079
growth indic aside to be an abstraction

1468
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,240
to create these theories

1469
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,980
to create these theories let me put the

1470
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,780
self aside

1471
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,079
in order to create that many theories

1472
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:15,240
versus somebody like erdosh I don't

1473
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,300
think was particularly deeply emotional

1474
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,099
about these things or something but you

1475
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:22,380
know gothindeak had a lot there was a

1476
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,140
lot there and it's notorious in his like

1477
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,540
you know 800 page letters to people

1478
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,480
right something like who is he writing

1479
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,180
for who is he writing for he dipped out

1480
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,460
does not want to be found so there's a

1481
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,839
nice website that kind of like talks

1482
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:38,760
about like last interactions some a few

1483
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,559
mathematicians kind of saw him so they

1484
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,839
opened the door and the look was sort of

1485
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,940
like you know I don't want to be found

1486
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,280
so what can you make of that like I

1487
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,720
don't want to be found yet I'm going to

1488
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,359
be writing

1489
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:54,000
profound volumes right I don't even

1490
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,500
think what do you I don't even think

1491
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,780
that's a self that it's interesting to

1492
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,400
not want to be found

1493
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,260
but to continue to write

1494
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,660
who's who's the writing for when it is

1495
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,900
still in this sort of like

1496
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,359
epistolary form who's he writing to

1497
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,400
so it's almost like again like you had

1498
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,500
to get rid of all the emotionality or

1499
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,359
put it somewhere else which makes me

1500
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,460
think of like any mathematician is

1501
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,099
skilled on that that young sort of line

1502
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,619
between conscious and unconscious and

1503
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:25,680
the self being like a point on it

1504
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,059
you know a lot of mathematicians will

1505
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:28,980
identify as heavily

1506
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,900
um you know Autistic or something like

1507
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,599
this right and why is that something

1508
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,520
that helps the mathematics

1509
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,559
is it because your mind was free of the

1510
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:40,260
emotional turmoil of being of subject of

1511
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,640
something like this you know it's you

1512
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,160
know it's really sad you could you know

1513
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,260
what if you had like something emotional

1514
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,059
happened to you everybody knows you're

1515
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:49,020
not going to be able to perform very

1516
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,599
well in a math test so what what is that

1517
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,880
what is it that the theorem's like are

1518
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,500
trying to Trump the emotionality or

1519
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,300
something like that so you almost have

1520
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,880
to be in this monk state

1521
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,160
probably or have a life that does not

1522
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,099
have a bunch of peril in it to do well

1523
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:06,300
on these theorems and so what do you

1524
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,400
think about that like to do some of

1525
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,619
these like hardcore Sciences maybe you

1526
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:12,540
have to put the self aside or you

1527
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,500
abstract it I don't know

1528
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,140
well a few things there it seems related

1529
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:23,700
to Maslow's hierarchy of needs and

1530
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,180
indeed the um higher order though higher

1531
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,940
and lower is just a spatial metaphor

1532
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,500
um it's possible for someone to be

1533
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,660
having the worst emotional day of their

1534
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,280
life but their blood pressure is

1535
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,380
regulated and there are complex

1536
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,880
feedbacks the way one feels can

1537
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,859
influence their physiology and vice

1538
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:44,220
versa but then zooming out to the level

1539
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,040
of the researcher involved in theory

1540
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,960
building as well as the problem solver

1541
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,119
involved in applications like kind of

1542
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,359
research and practice that is enabled by

1543
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:56,940
the physiology of society

1544
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:01,140
and so it is um a scaffolded work that

1545
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,599
can influence the whole you you

1546
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,460
mentioned the

1547
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,579
um epistolary nature of growth and

1548
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:11,339
Dick's writing which means in the form

1549
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:14,700
of letters and that's quite a connection

1550
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,140
not just to the Bible and certain books

1551
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,400
of the Bible which are written as

1552
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,619
letters but also to this

1553
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:28,319
emergence of art as sight

1554
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,020
if the art is a letter a letter is to

1555
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,819
someone someone could write a letter to

1556
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:34,800
themself in the future or it could be

1557
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,720
like a letter who's kind of ironic

1558
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,059
performativity is that it's to no one or

1559
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:40,260
it's two

1560
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,140
um some imaginary character but the

1561
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,859
genre and the format of art that is a

1562
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:47,819
letter

1563
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:49,799
is

1564
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:52,200
needing to be mailed and it has to be

1565
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,599
opened and read and so I think the

1566
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:57,260
letter is like a very plain text

1567
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,559
performance art

1568
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,640
yeah that's really beautiful because

1569
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,020
again you know there's like some sad

1570
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,240
things that occur by letter two right so

1571
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,579
some things it's interesting it's

1572
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,559
interesting that it's like let me write

1573
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,440
this let me deliver it to you so that

1574
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,960
I'm not there when you open it

1575
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,819
right it can take you know that's like

1576
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:20,099
the nature of surprise or maybe like a

1577
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,540
partner leaving somebody you know you

1578
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,460
hear these horrible stories right all

1579
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,339
right suicidal thing like I left a note

1580
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:28,740
it's interesting that that the letter

1581
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,079
writing yeah what is that I like that

1582
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:34,440
needed to be mailed I love that you know

1583
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,420
there's like photos of the place that he

1584
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,119
was at like in France just in the I

1585
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,799
don't know the I think the population's

1586
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,940
like 150 it's tiny and uh volumes

1587
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,400
volumes

1588
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,400
like it's like male to whom

1589
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,900
and what's In Our Mail system I don't

1590
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,520
think this is like you know Hedwig

1591
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,400
sending sending it by Al or something

1592
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,020
but it's almost like

1593
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,880
I don't know and that's why we were

1594
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,740
fascinated by that because you go from

1595
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,180
someone who already excelled in

1596
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:06,119
everything but had a very harsh

1597
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:08,339
upbringing into that world they all say

1598
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,020
that they're like you know this isn't

1599
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,520
like the normal person that comes to

1600
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,099
like a you know mathematical like place

1601
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:16,619
and so in one sense like you know I like

1602
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:18,299
that I like that it gave him more

1603
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:19,740
whereas some people saw him as so

1604
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,260
strange I was like maybe that's why you

1605
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,660
know he did so much you know because he

1606
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,420
came in with something different and um

1607
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,619
you know you could also say that he was

1608
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:30,240
just sick of sort of the the bureaucracy

1609
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,700
of everything but you know we you know

1610
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,500
are like lost mind and Chris and I were

1611
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,579
like maybe there's something deeper

1612
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:38,339
there can we be more gentle to someone

1613
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:40,859
in a state like that you know

1614
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:43,079
so I like this needing to be mailed I

1615
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:44,460
have no idea anything a lot of

1616
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:46,200
mathematical working in Robert lands I

1617
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,700
could say Mr Johnny Orlando's program by

1618
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,260
writing a letter as well but it didn't

1619
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,240
have this same like depth to it you know

1620
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,339
so grothink was on something else which

1621
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:54,359
is why I really relate because he's

1622
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,099
always about the philosophy in there you

1623
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:57,420
know I've often been perplexed I

1624
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,460
remember really whenever I learned like

1625
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,680
you know acceleration or something per

1626
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,059
second per second

1627
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,220
it's like what is that and then you can

1628
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,540
do it again for a second per second per

1629
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,920
second and it's like you know what are

1630
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,200
these fundamental units uh Becca talks

1631
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,579
about that in a lot of his work as well

1632
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:14,760
so we're really perplexed that you know

1633
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,520
that Chris and I are able to slide

1634
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,740
around like we know who we are in a

1635
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,240
sense but we're not tied to something

1636
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,660
and we're open that we ourselves can be

1637
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,960
able to uh intersect I think these heavy

1638
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,299
ideas and look at like look at these

1639
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:32,579
grandiose personalities

1640
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:35,280
from such a different space

1641
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,720
I was like yeah there's Theory building

1642
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,700
but again like you know when you mail a

1643
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,380
letter indefinitely is it a message in a

1644
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,960
bottle that only somebody will read

1645
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,220
and you know this kind of different it's

1646
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,420
like is it a male is it a letter

1647
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,160
addressed to someone

1648
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,680
or is it just addressed you know to the

1649
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,180
fact that Quantum mechanically it'll be

1650
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:54,799
opened at some point you know

1651
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,180
all right a few interesting thoughts

1652
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,540
here very early you said thoughts and

1653
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,280
then you quoted an author and you said

1654
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,099
the paragraph begun with at any rate you

1655
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,920
have them well rate is what something

1656
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,920
through time so even that uh just

1657
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,299
turn a phrase speaks to time and then

1658
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:21,720
is the self a theory well it does

1659
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,339
theorize about certain things and that

1660
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,140
was related to self and the sense of

1661
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,440
self is the self a problem to be solved

1662
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,880
is the self a solution to a problem

1663
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,540
so where in the growth indic erdosh

1664
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:40,740
type 1 type 2 space is self

1665
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,960
self-ass problems self-ass solution

1666
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,079
theory of self as problem theory of self

1667
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,740
as solution

1668
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:54,020
I love that

1669
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,240
oh wow maybe that's the open-endedness

1670
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,920
because I know some of the math stuff

1671
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,480
stopped and then he was just like

1672
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,180
Enchanted by this notion of meter light

1673
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,460
speed of light and things like this you

1674
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,920
know and uh I don't know there's been a

1675
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,780
lot of like cool work about

1676
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,940
different physical theories about like a

1677
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,099
non- a variational speed of light and

1678
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:16,020
things like that you know

1679
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:18,079
um or like primordial black holes so

1680
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,599
there was like you know Armenia is girl

1681
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,579
I think just really alone was there like

1682
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:25,200
whoa you know you you have to think

1683
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,359
about things like that you know if you

1684
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,619
had a collaborator or somebody to talk

1685
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:30,000
to you like you or me would that have

1686
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,520
changed something I don't know I don't

1687
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,440
know you have to think about like is the

1688
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,220
abdication

1689
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,839
yeah is the abdication a problem or a

1690
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,339
solution

1691
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:44,160
I'm not sure I'm really not sure you

1692
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,099
know so but again like you know go ahead

1693
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:49,740
don't the solutions one day turn into

1694
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:53,160
problems tomorrow through time see

1695
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,440
through time

1696
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,480
at any rate you have them

1697
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,540
no idea you know yeah and again we all

1698
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,400
know that to be high level functioning

1699
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,720
like you know someone like you and I are

1700
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,520
people watching this able to like follow

1701
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,200
this thread

1702
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,299
um you have like we are able to function

1703
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:10,740
so Chris told me that very well I'm

1704
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:13,559
highly imaginative Super Hyper uh

1705
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:16,140
fantastic right and yet I'm like

1706
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,940
extremely functional extremely

1707
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,500
functional so we all know that deficit

1708
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,960
functioning can start plaguing

1709
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,700
um you know certain people like uh

1710
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,140
diagnosis schizophrenics or something

1711
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,059
like this that are actually unable to

1712
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:29,520
recognize the internal thoughts

1713
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,079
as their own thoughts you know and so uh

1714
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,000
sometimes neurology can be a little like

1715
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,640
not so kind with something like that and

1716
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,380
say oh you're unable to recognize the

1717
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,359
inner voice as your own remember I asked

1718
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:43,559
Chris that a couple times I was like

1719
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:44,880
Chris whenever we're sitting there

1720
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,339
thinking to ourselves like uh who is

1721
01:04:47,339 --> 01:04:49,260
that who is that that you're actually

1722
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,540
talking to and he said Shanna just open

1723
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,880
like speak whenever that thought is

1724
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,260
there whenever the internal thoughts are

1725
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,900
there just open and speak sure enough it

1726
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,059
was the same speaking voice that was

1727
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:01,380
inside

1728
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,140
and I thought okay so that that's that's

1729
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,020
not as Mystic as I thought but somehow

1730
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:10,380
if you're unable to Source Monitor and

1731
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,299
reality monitor that like what does that

1732
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:15,180
actually mean you know so in the case of

1733
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,280
like deficit functioning or something

1734
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,780
like that with these like you know with

1735
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,540
schizophrenics then you have to think

1736
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:22,380
um

1737
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,660
like how can you slowly reintroduce

1738
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:28,260
noticing the inner self to an extent

1739
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:31,319
that doesn't like blast apart the you

1740
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:33,660
know the current self if that makes

1741
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,000
sense you know it must be kind of scary

1742
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,740
to say

1743
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,780
oh well there's another person inside of

1744
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,460
me that thinks like this or okay that's

1745
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,780
not the other person that thinks like

1746
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:44,760
this it's actually me I'm just not

1747
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,220
recognizing the other axes of me like

1748
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,720
you kind of said earlier

1749
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,700
so I think you know you either have to

1750
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,819
be very chill with the fact that you

1751
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:55,740
have so many systems running at the same

1752
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:58,319
time or you're hyper aware like Chris

1753
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,119
and I are and you're functional with it

1754
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:02,160
because I think if you're hyper aware

1755
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,900
and you're non-functional then you're

1756
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,920
not going to be able to leave the

1757
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,520
hyper-fantastic world and like save your

1758
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,380
child you have to come back right so

1759
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,640
people like John Nash and things like

1760
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,619
this again you know math and physics

1761
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:15,000
will do this to people because there's

1762
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,859
it's such a pressure cooker such a

1763
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:18,000
pressure cooker and again I think you

1764
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,740
have to put the self aside or something

1765
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,540
like that which needs to be dealt with

1766
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,940
but at a certain point you know the

1767
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,799
hallucinations like do occur and you

1768
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:28,140
know John Nash is like literally seeing

1769
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,359
people right so and that famous like

1770
01:06:30,359 --> 01:06:32,400
scene in A Beautiful Mind where he's

1771
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,020
like oh I'll watch you know I can give

1772
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,299
the baby a bath and you know the baby is

1773
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:38,460
like almost drowning and the wife you

1774
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,039
know runs in his wife runs in and you

1775
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,180
know she's like what happened he goes

1776
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,400
well Charles is taking you Charles is

1777
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,500
taking care of the child you know so for

1778
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,119
me it's like

1779
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:51,000
I'm interested in this can you be an

1780
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,980
excellent mathematician on this scale of

1781
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,720
golf and you can Earnest and still care

1782
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,859
for your child

1783
01:06:55,859 --> 01:06:59,520
can you swing back to the actual conch

1784
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,980
if you're a virtual point if you have to

1785
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,500
quote Focus right people say I need to

1786
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,119
get rid of distraction so I can focus

1787
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:08,460
can you actually focus and then go save

1788
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,740
your child right like this would be a

1789
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:11,760
sense of self what do you think about

1790
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,640
that then you're like I'm I'm able to

1791
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,619
recognize my inner thoughts I'm not

1792
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:18,359
going to be pushed to a deficit

1793
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:20,339
functioning right I'm going to be able

1794
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:21,839
to recognize what is real and what is

1795
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,339
not I'm not going to let hyper Fantasia

1796
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:28,619
tilt my complete access but I'm going to

1797
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:30,240
be able to come back and be able to go

1798
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,819
fully to the imaginary space and come

1799
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:34,680
back and take care of my family or stop

1800
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,940
at that red light like what do you think

1801
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,859
about that

1802
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:41,160
well a few things I'll respond to that

1803
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,680
and then two other areas that were going

1804
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,119
to be touching upon are art visual art

1805
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,339
and history of philosophy just kind of

1806
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:52,319
planting that so as to the is it

1807
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,339
possible to be functional and

1808
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:57,740
imaginative

1809
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,660
in the context of

1810
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,380
uh deficits

1811
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,880
what if we flipped it and said it's a

1812
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,980
surplus of free energy

1813
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:11,760
and the lack of the deficit is the

1814
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,200
Surplus

1815
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,140
and so that just does this kind of

1816
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,120
minimum maximum inversion that happens

1817
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,120
so often in the fep and then also

1818
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,698
um with this again type 1 to type two

1819
01:08:23,698 --> 01:08:26,880
problem solving to Theory building air

1820
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,520
Dosh to growthentic axis that we're

1821
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,719
working with it seems like both of them

1822
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:36,238
in a social cultural context can be

1823
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:39,120
aligned with service or not someone can

1824
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,698
develop Theory or they can ruminate on

1825
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:45,738
Theory and have a um failure to serve

1826
01:08:45,738 --> 01:08:48,359
and although some mathematicians and

1827
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,399
there's a particular mode with Academia

1828
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,738
and everything as we know it today where

1829
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:54,660
people might be obsessed with a proof

1830
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,759
and that leads them to neglect the bath

1831
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,880
water somebody else might be thinking

1832
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,759
about free throws in their head or they

1833
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:03,779
might be

1834
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:06,660
practicing their other skill and so

1835
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:10,560
there's different modes of

1836
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,479
rumination

1837
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:14,819
that might be just for different people

1838
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:18,259
in different situations look more

1839
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:22,439
professional technical academic or might

1840
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:25,620
be which is Theory building

1841
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,698
or closer to problem solving and thus

1842
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:33,299
resemble more of a mechanical obsessive

1843
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:35,520
compulsive

1844
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,520
situation

1845
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:44,759
to art

1846
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:48,540
well in the title of this paper

1847
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:51,319
there's of course the creative and fun

1848
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:54,780
portmanteau of math art

1849
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,120
and also the paper

1850
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,940
situates itself as describing the period

1851
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,460
from 1920 to the present now I guess

1852
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,620
it's always the present

1853
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,260
that's why they call it the gift

1854
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:10,460
um but we can just take it as 2022. so

1855
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:16,800
what happens from 1920 to 2022 why 1920

1856
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,640
as a beginning and could you mention any

1857
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,840
movements in Aesthetics or are

1858
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,840
impressionism cubism pointillism all

1859
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,800
these just different schools of Art and

1860
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,900
fads and hype Cycles

1861
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,540
what has happened since 1920 and how

1862
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:41,120
does that relate to your deeper stances

1863
01:10:42,659 --> 01:10:44,280
yeah so again we're just seeing that

1864
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,040
through line that you know

1865
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,120
of of elimination abstraction

1866
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,679
reification

1867
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:55,860
uh like yive's Klein Blue on Blue

1868
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,719
right where do you go after that where

1869
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,760
do you go after white on white

1870
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,420
and so I think we're saying

1871
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,760
you have endless places to go through

1872
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,500
white on white

1873
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,760
so

1874
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,640
instead of just giving up and saying

1875
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,100
that you know once you've abstracted

1876
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,780
everything to a point

1877
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:18,600
I think that's where it's almost like

1878
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,360
uh it's like it's like a seesaw or

1879
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,340
something where art you know thought it

1880
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:26,580
was maybe kind of done math swooped in

1881
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:29,820
and said you know what what is the point

1882
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,219
what is a point what is color

1883
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:34,920
why don't we try to create dark colors

1884
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,320
right so we all know that you know dark

1885
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,000
energy and things like those are what 90

1886
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,920
of this place

1887
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,140
baryonic matter is like such a small

1888
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,159
percentage

1889
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,199
so you have a light spectrum you know

1890
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,580
that I don't know that white light is

1891
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:48,719
Prismatic

1892
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,820
what about dark colors

1893
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,260
you know

1894
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,940
since dark energy does not interact

1895
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,280
electromagnetically with matter could we

1896
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,080
create a dark energy equivalent of a

1897
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,400
cover color wheel

1898
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,900
you know the color of wheel looks like

1899
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,580
the circle of fifths so I think there's

1900
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,719
like a lot of places for you know

1901
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,360
uh white on white to push through

1902
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,580
towards when you start questioning what

1903
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:15,960
is white what is things like this so

1904
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,120
we're saying that like through that

1905
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,679
abstraction through the dissolution of

1906
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,179
the self

1907
01:12:21,179 --> 01:12:23,280
if you're going abstract it away you

1908
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,659
have to really talk about what the self

1909
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:27,480
is if you think you have abstracted it

1910
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,340
away you really need to talk about what

1911
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,520
the self is and so I think

1912
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,080
what we've done is shown that through

1913
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,880
20s right with data and all this kind of

1914
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,920
stuff you know Advent of like quantum

1915
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,780
mechanics and things like that huge

1916
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,300
explosion on all kinds of Realms that I

1917
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,500
think you could be guided by a couple

1918
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,780
things limit paradox

1919
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,540
limit Paradox right the IDE the nature

1920
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,340
of self-reference

1921
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,780
you know even when you have something as

1922
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:54,300
anesthetic a term as self-reference what

1923
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,500
is this self

1924
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,560
so I think uh what math is going to do

1925
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,140
is ask Art to

1926
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,900
please ask what is self and can you take

1927
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,280
these two lines

1928
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,100
can you draw from a virtual point what

1929
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,239
does yelling have to do with the

1930
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:10,980
intersection of math art

1931
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:13,739
is math art an inevitable consequence

1932
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:15,719
and that's what Chris and I are kind of

1933
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:17,580
like

1934
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,199
alluding to

1935
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,960
that you have to join them possibly to

1936
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,760
get out of white on white

1937
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,040
join them together let them merge forces

1938
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,900
and then you can start mathematizing

1939
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,940
autoscopia and figuring out different

1940
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,440
spaces

1941
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,800
right so like if a point is no like how

1942
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,940
do you define a point like a zero

1943
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,080
dimensional object or something like

1944
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,140
that but if you re-identify point as a

1945
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:42,179
growthendiq site then you have actually

1946
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:45,179
infused a new set of Infinities into

1947
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:47,460
that point so Chris and I are advocating

1948
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,040
for if you think you've done it if you

1949
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,360
think you've gotten rid of the self if

1950
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,620
you think white on white if you think

1951
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:54,780
you've just

1952
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:56,640
squished everything to a point or

1953
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,080
something like that well the gothentic

1954
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,940
notion of a site and category theory is

1955
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:03,060
going to always allow morphisms and ways

1956
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,140
out

1957
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,120
so I think it's kind of cool that like

1958
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,400
you know in the vein of like Duluth we

1959
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,219
should follow to lose in guitari uh

1960
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:13,560
through this work of his Sadie try to

1961
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,719
invoke a mathematization of society and

1962
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:17,640
then you can see something like body

1963
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,120
passing through itself like I think art

1964
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,100
can always go further go through white

1965
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,420
on white what does that actually look

1966
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,760
like you know like create create the

1967
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,500
white hole create quote on the other

1968
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,960
side create all sides at once I know I

1969
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,219
always do this thought experiment of

1970
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:34,739
like you know what if I could draw an

1971
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:37,380
object from 360 degrees or what if I

1972
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,400
could be

1973
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,840
you know

1974
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,699
or like you know if you want to proceed

1975
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:43,920
by the way of like limit paradoxes why

1976
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,420
is it that every day I wake up and I'm

1977
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,340
the same you know I'm not like a lobster

1978
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,199
or something like that so these kind of

1979
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,120
thought experiments I think can like I

1980
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,080
don't know if I don't know if what I

1981
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,340
said makes any sense but does that make

1982
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,260
any sense that you can push through this

1983
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:58,260
and that maybe possibly math art is like

1984
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,780
a necessary emergence or does math art

1985
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:03,420
become the space of affordance you have

1986
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,380
such great ideas what do you think of

1987
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,920
any of that stuff

1988
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,460
well

1989
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,360
to return to this historical

1990
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,600
dance and interplay with philosophy art

1991
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,260
and math

1992
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,659
I'm reminded of the development of

1993
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:23,580
perspectival drawing

1994
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:27,800
in the let's just say latter half of the

1995
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,860
1000s Millennia where there's a few

1996
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,780
points there's the vanishing point

1997
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:36,600
that's like the classic you know on the

1998
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,880
horizon you draw the string and all the

1999
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,620
buildings go towards it

2000
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,780
and then there's also the the point of

2001
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,520
perspective and there's like the light

2002
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,380
point source and there's the center of

2003
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:50,340
gravity and all of these complexities

2004
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:53,400
relational complexities

2005
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,520
do play into that Zero Dimensional Point

2006
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,179
concept

2007
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:03,780
if we have a rich Point concept

2008
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:07,140
like to point at perhaps to point out a

2009
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:10,260
locus of action or to use a Point

2010
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,780
concept like that from Bucky Fuller's

2011
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,900
synergetics where a point is just a

2012
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,420
tetrahedra that you're seeing as a speck

2013
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:21,060
but it's a geometry of lumps and so you

2014
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:24,960
have space packing of finite actual

2015
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,199
space enclosed shapes and a point is

2016
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:29,400
just one that you're really far away

2017
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,400
from it's outside of your kind of tuned

2018
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,920
into it

2019
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,600
then there's

2020
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,520
more richness

2021
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,760
and there's also a an inherent

2022
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,460
plurality in those points

2023
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,140
whereas the vanishing point and the

2024
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,330
Cartesian Observer it's

2025
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:49,560
[Music]

2026
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,060
um

2027
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,000
it's narrow

2028
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,219
and then that leads to potentially a

2029
01:16:56,219 --> 01:16:57,179
narrow

2030
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:01,500
or fragile or over fit self

2031
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:07,380
for whom even small changes can be

2032
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,239
extremely troubling

2033
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:12,780
whereas if the self is more like a swarm

2034
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:16,340
or a locus of action then certain

2035
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,100
phenomena that might be more troubling

2036
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,040
potentially up to and including death

2037
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,679
are more naturally

2038
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,679
part of the becoming of that Locus

2039
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:30,780
rather than

2040
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:36,019
the cessation of a point yeah

2041
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,239
I love that and then from the nature of

2042
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,460
authentication it's itself is multiple

2043
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,900
so I completely agree with you on that

2044
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:45,780
there is nothing fixed in a swarm can

2045
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:51,060
more quickly be able to respond react

2046
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:54,540
can like Theory perhaps Theory building

2047
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:57,060
will lead us to the self to be multiple

2048
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:00,920
in a swarm I agree uh with the ability

2049
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,199
for each point in this form

2050
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:06,560
act act act act act act

2051
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,880
so it could lead to a crescendo of

2052
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,940
actions I agree I know in like you know

2053
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,920
in really really beautiful like martial

2054
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,540
art training or something teach you to

2055
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,800
be ready

2056
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,380
be ready be open because if I'm sitting

2057
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,699
here like waiting for somebody to come

2058
01:18:20,699 --> 01:18:22,500
this way and somebody comes behind I'm

2059
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,699
already lost

2060
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,520
be open be Omni right

2061
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,920
so I think that's like yeah it's a

2062
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,960
different state it's a different state

2063
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,060
so Theory building I think absolutely

2064
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:36,420
relates with swarm thinking and swarm

2065
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,739
multi

2066
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:41,219
so if point is multi then point is able

2067
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:43,020
to engage

2068
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,679
with with more things yeah I agree and I

2069
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:49,080
think that's what site is doing so

2070
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,760
instead of having a

2071
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,460
like a final point this is like the

2072
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:55,920
final Point uh you know she Theory and

2073
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,060
stuff like that is going to say above

2074
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:58,500
every point you actually have things

2075
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,540
that collapse down to the point so it's

2076
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,860
no longer even about the point it's

2077
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,300
about taking the inverse image of the

2078
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,679
point and seeing what lives like

2079
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:07,800
upstairs and hopefully that that's what

2080
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,480
never ends

2081
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,120
yeah so a point more is Portal I think

2082
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,580
is what I'm more interested in you know

2083
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,280
or self is Portal something like that

2084
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:21,179
yeah versus in this this finitude I am

2085
01:19:21,179 --> 01:19:24,239
this I am this

2086
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,699
yeah yeah yeah yeah

2087
01:19:25,699 --> 01:19:28,380
that's um

2088
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:30,840
how we end sentences with a point so it

2089
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:34,199
does have a finitude a few more art

2090
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:39,659
comments Kandinsky the artist had works

2091
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:41,880
that considered for example point and

2092
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,820
line to plane which looked at some

2093
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:48,960
complexity of geometry and topology on

2094
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,460
the plane

2095
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:53,880
and um also wrote concerning the

2096
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,560
spiritual in art

2097
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,159
and spoke of an outer sound and an inner

2098
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:01,679
sound and I think that is kind of

2099
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,840
pre-saging this like

2100
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,739
dark matter of colors like aren't colors

2101
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:10,980
defined by their visuality it's like

2102
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,820
well yes and matter is defined by its

2103
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:18,540
interactivity with other matter yet

2104
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:22,620
under those calculations most of it

2105
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,719
isn't even doing that

2106
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,120
so what is the inner color

2107
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,040
such that even though we know that the

2108
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,840
printed image or the computer screen is

2109
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,040
only displaying one RGB value what is it

2110
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,840
that allows you to look at

2111
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:42,179
someone's cheek and see depth

2112
01:20:42,179 --> 01:20:44,040
and how does that

2113
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,199
sort of

2114
01:20:46,199 --> 01:20:47,520
inner

2115
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,699
sound and inner color

2116
01:20:50,699 --> 01:20:54,799
relate to the letter being received

2117
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,840
yeah I agree and I do think Duluth

2118
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,460
helped Harold that while that book is

2119
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:02,580
not written in the 1960s but like the

2120
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,000
you know I mean

2121
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,739
like wherever he says the you know

2122
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:10,739
painting as hysteria so I agree it gives

2123
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:12,360
that sort of a

2124
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,659
uh

2125
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,600
it's no longer about the color the color

2126
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,340
passes through at the same time so

2127
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:25,080
there's um uh levels of becoming so the

2128
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,440
the brush stroke right becomes uh an

2129
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,380
antiseptic or a like a a form of

2130
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:33,600
abdication body leaving at this at the

2131
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,880
same time that the smear or the brush

2132
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,640
stroke right leaves color so color

2133
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,699
becomes representation uh I becomes

2134
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:44,580
polyvalent and that's the kind of thing

2135
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:47,460
that I think um with respect to what you

2136
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:50,340
said that Duluth can can give us that so

2137
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,620
Kandinsky you know saying you know inner

2138
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,239
sound outer sound and to lose I think

2139
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,219
would completely agree and point to

2140
01:21:56,219 --> 01:21:58,500
something like Francis Bacon whose work

2141
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,719
is defying that subject object relation

2142
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,780
so you just see like a scream right a

2143
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,400
lot of his figures just have open mouths

2144
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,140
and things like that so you're just

2145
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:10,020
seeing the intensity of it without the

2146
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,880
subject object Coppola and for some

2147
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,620
sense there's an immediacy in that like

2148
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,960
there is an aha so so the sense of the

2149
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,560
screen is definitely not I don't think

2150
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,140
it's at the same time as like I paid my

2151
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,780
rent today right I you know so it's um

2152
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,179
it's at the level of ghastly which

2153
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:28,860
whatever that is so that's why Chris and

2154
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,620
I are saying that all works are you know

2155
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,980
uh creative like whatever type they are

2156
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,860
in the proportion of like true

2157
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:39,719
provocativeization right so here I am

2158
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:41,280
here's a work of art I'm going to like

2159
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,860
take away your continuity of subject

2160
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:46,320
object to Coppola and I'm going to make

2161
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,659
it a hysteresis

2162
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:52,920
and I'm going to put eyes everywhere

2163
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,780
eyes everywhere so that leads into again

2164
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:56,040
like

2165
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:00,000
multiple swarm swarm thinking you know

2166
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,679
you put eyes in your head you know what

2167
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,719
I mean eyes everywhere and so I like

2168
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:06,600
what you say like it's not about RGB

2169
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,260
um

2170
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,699
it's not about RGB and you have to think

2171
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:10,920
about people like uh how does Clive

2172
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,960
wearing see color

2173
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,400
so I think we need to be really careful

2174
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,960
about these sort of like molar

2175
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:18,780
structures color is this and and

2176
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:22,020
rephrase that as to what color could be

2177
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,960
when it leaves like circle of fists or

2178
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,360
when it leaves this or merge color with

2179
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,460
something else you know have another

2180
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,620
like synesthetic experience and what is

2181
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:32,760
that

2182
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,659
um

2183
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:35,640
yeah so I think uh Duluth did that

2184
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:39,780
really well of taking these ideas and

2185
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:42,060
actually noticing in Bacon's work like a

2186
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:45,239
symptomology a symptomology oh this is a

2187
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:47,520
symptom of Hysteria right and not

2188
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,679
hysteria again like not hysteria of the

2189
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,840
like painter but hysteria painting

2190
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,940
itself so I think it's very cool to give

2191
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:56,400
Life Force to the painting and a lot of

2192
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,400
painting itself to become but it you

2193
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,800
can't like fix it so I like how he says

2194
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,179
that it's like he has this whole book

2195
01:24:03,179 --> 01:24:05,760
about uh becoming Sorcerers and things

2196
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,340
like that and so he was like a Critic a

2197
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,320
Critic of Freud sometimes for reducing

2198
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,640
everything people would come to him with

2199
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,860
severe problems and he would say oh it's

2200
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:15,659
because a dad issue or something like

2201
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:18,540
that so it always like localizes

2202
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,760
um versus having like poly vegan organs

2203
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,760
everywhere you know something like that

2204
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,040
yeah right I'll give some comments and

2205
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,320
I'll read a very nice quotes from Ali in

2206
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,239
the chat so what that made me think

2207
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,860
about is

2208
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:34,920
the hunter is an identity

2209
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,340
hunting is a process that's happening in

2210
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,860
time but the hunt

2211
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,360
the game

2212
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:46,500
the forage those are more of these um

2213
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:50,580
hasades they exist abstracted from the

2214
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:53,640
process and from the identity though we

2215
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:57,540
may linguistically symbolize it

2216
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:00,120
um so I'll read some quotes that all

2217
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,800
these added these are um I think

2218
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,920
bringing a lot of depth to the

2219
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,679
pieces you've raised so

2220
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,260
recur returning earlier to discussion of

2221
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:12,719
problem and problem solving so this is

2222
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,760
from Jeffrey Bell in inquiry into

2223
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,920
analytic Continental metaphysics and the

2224
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:20,719
quote is a problem is a non-maryological

2225
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:24,300
parts and holes non-merological part of

2226
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:27,000
its solution meaning a part that cannot

2227
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,219
be separated and detached from that of

2228
01:25:29,219 --> 01:25:30,780
which it is a part

2229
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:33,360
and this is a part moreover that is not

2230
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,659
exhausted by the determinant solution of

2231
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:38,280
which it is apart

2232
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:41,219
and I think in terms of the history of

2233
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,960
philosophy and then feel free to add any

2234
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:46,199
comments we can contrast this problem

2235
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:49,739
concept theory of problems growth and

2236
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:54,800
dig on air Dosh and we can contrast this

2237
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,659
enmeshed relationship of problem and

2238
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:58,800
solution

2239
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,300
with a

2240
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,100
classical

2241
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,880
hegelian dialectic of the sequential

2242
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,219
nature problem

2243
01:26:08,219 --> 01:26:11,880
solution consequence or other ways to

2244
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,219
State the hegelian dialectic but that is

2245
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:16,380
often framed in time

2246
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,540
as like first there's a reaction then

2247
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,679
there's a counter reaction then there's

2248
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,460
a synthesis as opposed to this

2249
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:26,159
instantaneous assemblage concept of

2250
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,380
problem and solution in which they're

2251
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:31,739
all coexisting and so therefore the

2252
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:33,780
seeds of the solution are in the problem

2253
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:38,040
and vice versa now rather than through

2254
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,560
time only and maybe both are

2255
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,000
applicable

2256
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,980
yeah I like that

2257
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,239
um yeah thank you for these beautiful

2258
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:48,960
quotes I do love uh I always tend to

2259
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,639
respect everyone for trying so

2260
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:52,380
everybody's trying these theories and

2261
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,360
you know I myself always had a problem

2262
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,600
with it's like okay uh you know nature

2263
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,580
of the problem like thesis antithesis or

2264
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:02,880
whatever and then uh synthesis so I

2265
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,860
jumped right into adorno's negative

2266
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,659
dialectics I thought that was really

2267
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:09,120
powerful because an adorno's thinking

2268
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,239
you know like that synthesis

2269
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,219
don't let the synthesis hurt the

2270
01:27:14,219 --> 01:27:15,719
multiplicity

2271
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:17,880
and so it's like can you have

2272
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,940
thesis and antithesis and then have a

2273
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,440
synthesis that doesn't destroy both

2274
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,139
that's why we think the nature of this

2275
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,659
is to go through dialethism imagine a

2276
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,159
beautiful world where you could have a

2277
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:31,080
and not a existing

2278
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,520
and this is why I think people wouldn't

2279
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,560
hurt each other so much you know or

2280
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,300
wouldn't like make these harsh comments

2281
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,980
like oh they lost their mind or

2282
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:39,600
something like this and it's like maybe

2283
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,880
they're in this dual State maybe it is

2284
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,040
the state of you know Shanna wants a

2285
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,020
banana but she also doesn't

2286
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:48,719
so I think the way out of this is going

2287
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:50,760
to be kind of Hefty and it's going to be

2288
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,800
through merging these two beautiful

2289
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,440
quotes that were just spoken can you

2290
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,659
merge these in a way that doesn't lose

2291
01:27:57,659 --> 01:27:59,699
them both right that's the nature we've

2292
01:27:59,699 --> 01:28:01,800
been struggling with for a long time the

2293
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,980
nature of conflict could it be to uh

2294
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,440
lessen the conflict by going the

2295
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,480
dilithiistic way through negative

2296
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,980
dialectics

2297
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,440
can you actually do that

2298
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,540
what kind of a space

2299
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,400
what kind of a new affordances would you

2300
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,739
actually need to be able to hold both

2301
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:21,060
States

2302
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:23,760
and I think that's possibly that's where

2303
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,620
we're getting could you be the

2304
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:28,380
growthentic air could you have you know

2305
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:30,300
Hegel and adorno actually in a room

2306
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,280
talking to each other and what does that

2307
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,840
actually mean

2308
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,820
um I we just need to always be quick to

2309
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:38,940
not mute or take away you know the voice

2310
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:41,219
of someone who possibly cannot speak

2311
01:28:41,219 --> 01:28:43,860
no so uh to just say deficit functioning

2312
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,080
is what's causing these things like can

2313
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,659
you actually can we hold Clive can we

2314
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:50,340
like hold that space

2315
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:51,960
uh and I think in the nature of these

2316
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,580
two quotes I'm reminded of a Clive a

2317
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,739
quote that Clive said where they asked

2318
01:28:55,739 --> 01:28:58,020
him uh where is home I've spoken about

2319
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:59,340
this before and he says home is

2320
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,840
yesterday

2321
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,460
so I found this doubly perplexing

2322
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,440
because here's someone whose concept of

2323
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,719
time is six seconds

2324
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,060
Clive doesn't even have a yesterday

2325
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:11,760
according to my sort of Western thinking

2326
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,760
but yet he says home as yesterday

2327
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,199
and Clyde is not an invalid there's

2328
01:29:16,199 --> 01:29:17,940
something actually here

2329
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,400
so I think you know to say thesis

2330
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,159
antithesis synthesis

2331
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:25,139
you could be excluding the synesthetes

2332
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:28,199
or somebody hyper Fantasia like me that

2333
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:31,440
can at the same time see problem like

2334
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,179
can see all of them at once and it

2335
01:29:33,179 --> 01:29:35,159
becomes like almost unbearable you know

2336
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:38,460
so what kind of mindset are we valuing

2337
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,100
when we value like someone who can

2338
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,560
actually see see thesis what about for

2339
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,000
someone who they all happen at the same

2340
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:45,840
time

2341
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,120
and so that's like in the synesthetic

2342
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,080
realm

2343
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,880
um I think we not to need to not exclude

2344
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,639
that let us not exclude that but also

2345
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:55,020
with regards to those two quotes you

2346
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:57,239
have somebody like Bard saying if you're

2347
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:59,159
really going to have like a synthesis

2348
01:29:59,159 --> 01:30:00,659
please make sure it is not

2349
01:30:00,659 --> 01:30:02,460
anti-frastical and that we are not lying

2350
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:05,400
right please make sure you're not saying

2351
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,600
that you support something which you

2352
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,340
actually aren't you know don't try to

2353
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,179
support the voice that you're

2354
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:10,800
diminishing at the same time

2355
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,199
so I agree how do we how do we hold

2356
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:17,520
affordances that will lead to a swarm a

2357
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,000
very Dynamic agent a dynamic agent that

2358
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,139
is a

2359
01:30:22,139 --> 01:30:23,280
um

2360
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,800
that is capable of becoming

2361
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,320
cable becoming and not lost in it let us

2362
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,420
not find nihilism in the limit Paradox

2363
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:32,460
that's the beauty of math that's why I

2364
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,840
think math and art can really help each

2365
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,760
other because mathematicians will just

2366
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,260
like oh you're telling me there's no

2367
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:38,820
solution to x squared is negative 25

2368
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,280
well I'll invent I you know what I'll go

2369
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,500
up a dimension and so that's what I

2370
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,000
think we need to do to logic can we add

2371
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,320
another dimension to logic can we

2372
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,719
actually work in dialecticism how can we

2373
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,520
do that you know can we add another axis

2374
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,920
on painting art is Art is wild with that

2375
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,620
can we add another axis of creation can

2376
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:58,679
we try to paint from 360 Degrees can we

2377
01:30:58,679 --> 01:30:59,940
imagine everything from All Points of

2378
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:01,739
View like that would be a purely Omni

2379
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:04,560
existence right I had a discussion it

2380
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,179
turned out to a kind of a feud with a

2381
01:31:06,179 --> 01:31:08,040
friend who I mean I don't like losing

2382
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,780
things and it's very hard on me

2383
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:11,820
um so um like people or you know animals

2384
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,320
and things like that it makes me very

2385
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,260
sad but it was like um uh you know I was

2386
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,880
like I wish everything was infinite and

2387
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,020
he actually challenged me that I

2388
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,460
wouldn't be able to handle hard Infinity

2389
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,199
because he said even the horrible memory

2390
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:24,060
would last forever and things like this

2391
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:27,000
so is there a way for us to like

2392
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,920
put the thought and the spacing so

2393
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,480
you're able to handle these things that

2394
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,980
were possibly infinite infinite

2395
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,659
becomings and things like that without

2396
01:31:33,659 --> 01:31:35,340
dipping the infinity into like nihilism

2397
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,380
you know

2398
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:38,760
thank you for their quotes they just

2399
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,600
spawned all of that you know

2400
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,120
could you describe what

2401
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:48,659
thile aesthetic means and how it's used

2402
01:31:48,659 --> 01:31:49,860
here

2403
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:55,020
yeah so um uh so dialethism is a logic

2404
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:56,820
that removes the law of the excluded

2405
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,860
middle so if everybody knows this like I

2406
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,360
always find first order logic very

2407
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,239
limiting to creatures such as vivasis as

2408
01:32:03,239 --> 01:32:04,199
us

2409
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,120
so the excluded middle says something

2410
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,679
like you know P or Q not P therefore Q

2411
01:32:10,679 --> 01:32:12,960
I thought this was so incredibly like

2412
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,020
boring and limiting and like what you're

2413
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:19,139
assuming that uh I am not multi-sentient

2414
01:32:19,139 --> 01:32:21,239
I'm not a multiplicity and then I'm

2415
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:23,580
definitely not a synesthe you know so

2416
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,199
diolethism is going to replace that and

2417
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:26,520
say you can have a logic of the

2418
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,980
structure such as P or Q not P therefore

2419
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:31,020
p

2420
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:32,580
so I think it is completely

2421
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,440
revolutionary and it's a very it's a

2422
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,719
nice logic that would be fit quantum

2423
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,219
mechanics and things like this right it

2424
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:40,260
is the very nature of having a parallel

2425
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:41,580
universe so if you do believe many

2426
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:42,780
worlds

2427
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:44,219
um which I think most people have to

2428
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:45,659
with these days unless you pause it an

2429
01:32:45,659 --> 01:32:47,580
infinite Observer then you are

2430
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,139
guaranteed the existence that at every

2431
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:51,300
mode of uncertainty there is no collapse

2432
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,620
of the wave function everything is

2433
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:55,080
realized how do you do that in a

2434
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,100
language

2435
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:57,780
the language would have to be daily

2436
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,820
theistic you'd have to replace the law

2437
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:02,699
of excluded metal with something like oh

2438
01:33:02,699 --> 01:33:04,620
Shanna chose like the pink sweater to

2439
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,060
wear for the talk today like instead of

2440
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,300
the blue the instead of also has its own

2441
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,760
reality but the ontological status of

2442
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:14,040
that is very beautifully like questioned

2443
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,540
by Chalmers and all these amazing people

2444
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:18,420
and so uh the dilethism would actually

2445
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:20,639
be able to give you pink sweater and not

2446
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,400
pink sweater and so I think so like

2447
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:24,719
Chris and I being trained in that are

2448
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,880
able to hold these very

2449
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,280
interdisciplinary papers if you know me

2450
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,500
I'm such an advocate for like can we

2451
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,659
please design like a universal Institute

2452
01:33:33,659 --> 01:33:36,120
where like you know Daniel me Chris

2453
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,040
everybody's in a room thinking artists

2454
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,199
mathematicians like physicists so

2455
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:42,420
there's there's Excellence to be to

2456
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:44,760
being the problem solver just in with

2457
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,440
respect to your discipline but can we

2458
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:47,880
open this a little bit and become more

2459
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:51,420
Theory Builders so I think that um by

2460
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,520
merging you know the I think you have to

2461
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,960
have a different mindset something like

2462
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,760
me and Chris that are open to the sort

2463
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,760
of P you know that this is natural to

2464
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,040
our language to say both p and not p

2465
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,020
then we're capable of writing these very

2466
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:06,239
heavily interdisciplinary papers you do

2467
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:07,260
find some people that are like I don't

2468
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:07,980
think I'd be able to work

2469
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:09,900
interdisciplinary because my field is

2470
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,219
this

2471
01:34:11,219 --> 01:34:13,020
well why don't we merge them you know

2472
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:14,520
and if merging leads to contradiction

2473
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,139
and that means our definitions weren't

2474
01:34:16,139 --> 01:34:18,179
good enough right like math people love

2475
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:21,060
Paradox and uh you know limit paradoxes

2476
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:23,580
it's like let me do better let me try a

2477
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,480
little harder let me make that

2478
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,880
definition just a little better uh Point

2479
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,040
leads to like UV Infinities I don't like

2480
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,620
this thing I'm going to make a string

2481
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:34,560
and make a string on registering that

2482
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,120
might help you know what a string I

2483
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,880
don't know and so there's this wild aha

2484
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,980
intuition driving all the physics they

2485
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,960
are very very you know all the hard

2486
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,120
Sciences are very heavily trained so

2487
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,980
we're saying like don't lose the AHA and

2488
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:49,380
it's perhaps the AHA join with the

2489
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:50,280
technique that's actually doing

2490
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,719
something like this so again if you

2491
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:54,060
could that's what diolethism means and

2492
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,980
so in this case right uh the

2493
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:58,020
dilethiistic work is that you have both

2494
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,760
a painting of color but you also have an

2495
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,679
autoscopy at the same time it seems like

2496
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,960
those would actually tear apart the

2497
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:05,760
notion of form but it's like you have

2498
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,280
this notion of underneath right

2499
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,380
so diolethism is questioning whatever

2500
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:11,820
you're calling the level of awareness

2501
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,560
and like you know fundamental units of

2502
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,659
life so you know take it you know sick

2503
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:17,100
people and Comas and things like that

2504
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:18,960
like sometimes they can still hear you

2505
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,659
it's like let us not be so hierarchical

2506
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:23,699
about the fundamental unit of life you

2507
01:35:23,699 --> 01:35:25,620
know and so if you can open yourself

2508
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:27,719
then you can have like

2509
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:29,100
I don't know maybe Chris and I are just

2510
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:30,239
trying to get quantum mechanics like

2511
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:31,920
more in the macro State and then you

2512
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,560
have like you know dialysis and stuff

2513
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,900
but I'm also more gentle because I know

2514
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,460
it's hard you're like no I want that no

2515
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:39,659
I don't

2516
01:35:39,659 --> 01:35:42,239
that's like the basis of like very human

2517
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,159
existence right I would love that but I

2518
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:44,820
wouldn't

2519
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:48,060
you know so we're it's like we are those

2520
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,639
kind of creatures you know so uh we're

2521
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,860
just trying kind of like uh Deluge is

2522
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,800
doing with hysteria and saying that

2523
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,060
painting releases the presence

2524
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,520
underneath representation Chris and I

2525
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,900
are trying to write interdisciplinary

2526
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:04,620
Works to release the dialethism beneath

2527
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,699
um

2528
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:08,159
this sort of silo-ness

2529
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,560
you know

2530
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,880
well

2531
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:14,040
thanks just a comment and then some some

2532
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,500
more great uh please yeah from live chat

2533
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,600
so

2534
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,100
if there is a unitary Cartesian Observer

2535
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:25,100
perspectival drawing world that we're in

2536
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:28,500
then it's not even really an excluded

2537
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,360
middle it's just either in one place or

2538
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:31,500
the other

2539
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:35,460
whereas the Swarm the assemblage must be

2540
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:38,520
in multiple places and so it can be

2541
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,260
wearing the pink sweater and the blue

2542
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,639
sweater

2543
01:36:41,639 --> 01:36:45,540
yes as a Quantum multiple worlds yes as

2544
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:49,260
an imaginary counterfactual and in

2545
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,300
embodiment and so that's why the

2546
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:54,900
assemblage can do things now that even

2547
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:57,960
the most advanced processor can't do in

2548
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,280
series

2549
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,199
yes

2550
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,780
let me add some more great um comments

2551
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:06,420
from the chat so Ian from innersense

2552
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:09,540
this was referring to your desire and or

2553
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:11,580
not for a banana

2554
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,440
holding both States

2555
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,840
taking the awareness of being in two

2556
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,900
minds about whether I want a banana or

2557
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:22,020
not and applying that to Global issues

2558
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:25,040
and group sense making so multi-scale

2559
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:29,219
holding space and then also

2560
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:31,440
um Ali has added several comments which

2561
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,679
I won't read all of them about different

2562
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:38,699
spaces and Metric spaces and also noted

2563
01:37:38,699 --> 01:37:41,460
Corey Shores the logic of Guiles to lose

2564
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:44,100
discussion discusses dialethism at

2565
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,659
length in the context of delusion

2566
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:47,460
thought yes

2567
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,739
yay the logic of sense yeah that's like

2568
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:52,620
one of my favorites oh what a what a

2569
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:54,600
what a beautiful audience

2570
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:58,400
we should all write papers together

2571
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,480
in our in our

2572
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,840
closing sections

2573
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:08,460
where do we go what do we do or what are

2574
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,780
next steps

2575
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:12,719
yeah next steps we go everywhere so

2576
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,400
Chris and I are working on that like

2577
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,500
like that you know that if we could just

2578
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,719
get this theorem like you know an

2579
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,639
entropic categorization as a condensed

2580
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:22,739
set then all in that one sentence we're

2581
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:24,719
saying time is entropic it's still

2582
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:27,360
Dynamic and we're saying that like

2583
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,360
um making like but it's not what we

2584
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,300
think it is if we can get an event

2585
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:35,460
independent uh an event-dependent logic

2586
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,800
an event-dependent notion of time to

2587
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,780
make time itself be this multiplicity

2588
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:42,239
then we're actually going to have like a

2589
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,699
way to mathematize where maybe other

2590
01:38:44,699 --> 01:38:47,400
fields stopped so where I think where we

2591
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,560
go there's so many places to go we start

2592
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,440
merging we start heavily more inter

2593
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:55,080
disciplinary Fields I want to you know

2594
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,179
what happens when the when the guitarist

2595
01:38:57,179 --> 01:38:59,699
paints what happens when the painter

2596
01:38:59,699 --> 01:39:01,500
sews I'm really interested in these

2597
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,300
intersections use the things we're

2598
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:04,800
really good at it's like it's like my

2599
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,120
literary skills that make me really good

2600
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,620
at math or the way that I talk like I

2601
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,360
don't plan this look at how I speak how

2602
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,820
is that it's the artistic side you know

2603
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,760
and are these actually uh mutually

2604
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,400
opposed no so I think what we should do

2605
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,860
is like Advocate again for like this

2606
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:22,440
multiness not not thesis antithesis

2607
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,060
synthesis how about thesis antithesis

2608
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,739
negative dialectic so that every voice

2609
01:39:25,739 --> 01:39:27,480
is heard how do you do that

2610
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,760
in a way that is not leads to like utter

2611
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,620
chaos it's through the dialysis way can

2612
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:33,659
you see points both points of view can

2613
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:35,040
you see both of these can they make

2614
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,840
sense in both ways

2615
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:39,659
um and also to reincorporate like

2616
01:39:39,659 --> 01:39:42,540
imagination imagination don't forget it

2617
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:44,760
don't forget the value of creativity in

2618
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,820
these things and to really hone the aha

2619
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:50,880
moment like take care of it you know so

2620
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,080
we're introducing something that's like

2621
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:56,280
let us be more like more more caring in

2622
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:59,639
these fields so when you think like and

2623
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:01,440
think about the sense of self that

2624
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,719
drives the next space

2625
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:05,760
so we're thinking like hey let's take

2626
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,380
this what does math art actually mean

2627
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:09,900
math art is now an it's like a you know

2628
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,900
a dynamically growing portal

2629
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:14,639
neurodiversity right can we amplify the

2630
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,739
variations in these fields

2631
01:40:16,739 --> 01:40:18,120
and that's why I think you know it's

2632
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,380
going to get a lot of resistance with

2633
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,719
like no no why my field is this you know

2634
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:24,179
my field is this you know but we're into

2635
01:40:24,179 --> 01:40:26,520
amplifying the variations and whatever

2636
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,679
actually actually made that field you

2637
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:30,780
know so I think it's like now is like

2638
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:33,300
The Best Time Ever to like you know it's

2639
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:36,239
like amplify fep Through Math art are

2640
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,280
there actually mirrors of each other the

2641
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,300
mirrors of each other in a way that

2642
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,560
doesn't die out it's like what happens

2643
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:43,020
when two mirrors see each other that's

2644
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:45,000
what we're after here it's like we can

2645
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,280
actually try to get a more um

2646
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,699
and more dynamical definition of self

2647
01:40:50,699 --> 01:40:53,460
and to not just toss it away and to say

2648
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:56,520
deficit this deficit this deficit this

2649
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,280
deficit this you know it's like oh tell

2650
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,260
me how you see things how do you see

2651
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,580
things because we all know you see what

2652
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:03,659
you are

2653
01:41:03,659 --> 01:41:07,139
is undeniable you see what you are uh

2654
01:41:07,139 --> 01:41:09,659
inner thought outer thought inner sound

2655
01:41:09,659 --> 01:41:14,400
outer sound so we're here to like

2656
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,080
I I think the more people in the room

2657
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,900
the better right so these very

2658
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:24,239
um like exclusive uh um uh institutes I

2659
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:26,699
just work on this I just work on this I

2660
01:41:26,699 --> 01:41:28,500
think like again my ultimate aim is to

2661
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,420
have this like Universal Institute where

2662
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:32,280
everybody's working everybody's working

2663
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:33,420
because you know what it's going to do

2664
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,340
it's going to refine that problem in a

2665
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:37,380
way that's Universal so I'm really into

2666
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:39,900
Universal languages Universal problems

2667
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,480
can you take that rigid point of view

2668
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,119
that you have and make it daily theistic

2669
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:46,679
can you imagine can you imagine

2670
01:41:46,679 --> 01:41:48,900
everybody problem solving by Universal

2671
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:52,139
languages or by dialethisms then then

2672
01:41:52,139 --> 01:41:54,780
the nature would already be you know

2673
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,280
people that have six languages it's

2674
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,440
impressive it's amazing because they can

2675
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:01,980
just pot like tilt tilt tilt tilt like

2676
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,320
the basis is universal but I can tilt if

2677
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,179
I actually need to I can tilt and just

2678
01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:07,440
speak English or I can tilt and just

2679
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,600
speak Mandarin whatever but I am trained

2680
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,699
in the higher dimensional space so I

2681
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:12,900
actually think that we do have these

2682
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,340
like Jedi powers and we need to actually

2683
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:17,280
actually like retrain ourselves and

2684
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,080
don't forget that imagination is a gift

2685
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:21,540
so if we can actually use it and not

2686
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:23,040
have it so excluded in the heart

2687
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,739
Sciences like it's like that aha moment

2688
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:28,500
is what led me to that you know that is

2689
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,900
pure aha thinking and then you know

2690
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,760
perhaps if we were more gentle to things

2691
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,260
like that we wouldn't lose people like

2692
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,000
graph Indy if you wouldn't lose these

2693
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,739
you know what I mean like you just have

2694
01:42:37,739 --> 01:42:39,719
to be more caring and open up the

2695
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:41,880
neurodiversity realm so that's what um

2696
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:43,320
and all the things that I'm in it's like

2697
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,719
that's my new like advocation line and

2698
01:42:45,719 --> 01:42:48,060
so Chris and I think that through more

2699
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:50,639
interdisciplinary works you know we can

2700
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,679
actually hone that dialysis you can

2701
01:42:52,679 --> 01:42:55,980
actually hone amplifying variations

2702
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:56,580
um

2703
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:59,100
yeah and amplifying like adaptivity so I

2704
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,179
think the only way to survive like

2705
01:43:00,179 --> 01:43:01,440
what's going on right now is to be

2706
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,119
adaptive right and so we just want to

2707
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:05,340
merge Fields so that we can actually you

2708
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:06,540
know

2709
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,699
uh merge a lot of like math into

2710
01:43:08,699 --> 01:43:10,440
neurology so it's like Could you

2711
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,239
actually have a brain as a you know

2712
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:13,619
could you have a quantum mechanical

2713
01:43:13,619 --> 01:43:16,440
notion of the brain brain is hologram

2714
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,960
you know is there a non-local behavior

2715
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,460
in the nervous system

2716
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:22,020
right a lot of neurologists are not

2717
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:23,520
trained and stuff like that right but

2718
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,500
Infuse the mathematician and maybe we

2719
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,960
are so after the NOC talk I gave like

2720
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,340
you know these really brilliant like

2721
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:30,900
neurologists reached out like hey I

2722
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,040
really like the model that you're doing

2723
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:34,679
so I just want all of us to sort of like

2724
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:36,360
work together so if we could pause at

2725
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,159
that Universal Institute I think that's

2726
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:41,400
in the nature of like fep you know

2727
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,719
I don't know if what I said made any

2728
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:44,340
sense but you can tell that like I care

2729
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:45,900
and so what are we trying to do it's

2730
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,820
like we're not stopping with this notion

2731
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:48,960
of self we're going to try to come up

2732
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,760
with theory of thoughts and we're just

2733
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,340
going to keep going until like

2734
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:55,380
um we try to reach that universal

2735
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:57,600
language you know like we're comfortable

2736
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,300
with like limit paradoxes and we'll say

2737
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:01,380
it up front

2738
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:03,239
what is the nature of true contradiction

2739
01:44:03,239 --> 01:44:04,739
the fact that you can still understand

2740
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:07,260
me in this very nature you still exist

2741
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:10,400
but I don't know how

2742
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,739
well very nice I'll add a few thoughts

2743
01:44:13,739 --> 01:44:17,760
as we come towards our column closing

2744
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,040
so different fields connect different

2745
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:22,139
fields first couldn't ask for a better

2746
01:44:22,139 --> 01:44:24,600
last name or collaboration to make it

2747
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,780
happen

2748
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,739
and you integrating different fields

2749
01:44:30,739 --> 01:44:33,840
like Building Bridges between different

2750
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,000
agricultural Fields they're different

2751
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,400
spatial locations or is it actually like

2752
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,340
the Electro and the magnetic fields in

2753
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:43,820
the sense that these fields are actually

2754
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:46,619
different measurement devices might pick

2755
01:44:46,619 --> 01:44:49,560
up on one or another or one mathematical

2756
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,139
model might consider these fields but

2757
01:44:52,139 --> 01:44:54,780
they're not spatially adjacent

2758
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:57,780
or sequential but rather they're

2759
01:44:57,780 --> 01:45:01,020
overlapping and they're enmeshed and

2760
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:04,080
therefore how we model those fields and

2761
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,600
how they're connected it's like that was

2762
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,880
the transdisciplinarity that we needed

2763
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,699
it wasn't a problem out there to be

2764
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:15,000
solved by concatenating or composing it

2765
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,239
was something about our own process and

2766
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:21,780
then just one lost to those General

2767
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:24,540
and um important social and

2768
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:28,139
participatory comments you brought up

2769
01:45:28,139 --> 01:45:30,719
in some other work we've been thinking

2770
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:34,100
about how the disciplinary model

2771
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,659
groups people according to their

2772
01:45:36,659 --> 01:45:38,880
identities affiliations and their

2773
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,820
practices so biology Department might

2774
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:43,380
have Affinity with other departments at

2775
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,940
that school or with other biology

2776
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:46,980
departments and there might be a culture

2777
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:48,840
of microscopy and there's the person

2778
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,699
who's skilled in microscopy and those

2779
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:55,560
practices are what create that Locus it

2780
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:57,540
becomes that kind of a thing and the

2781
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:59,520
person with a microscope might be asking

2782
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,060
identical questions and have identical

2783
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:06,600
uh intentions and intentions to somebody

2784
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:09,360
who's using a satellite imagery or

2785
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,760
somebody who's writing poetry yet the

2786
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:14,460
disciplinary model has fragmented those

2787
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:17,280
latent possibilities and so in contrast

2788
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,800
with that disciplinary model based

2789
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:22,260
around shared practices and identities

2790
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:23,699
and affiliations

2791
01:46:23,699 --> 01:46:27,179
in a Commons model

2792
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:29,219
people are linked through their shared

2793
01:46:29,219 --> 01:46:31,500
concern their shared stewardship and

2794
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,440
their meaning and in those situations we

2795
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:36,239
can be some people enjoying the park

2796
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:38,340
some people are clipping the Roses other

2797
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:40,320
people are researching which fertilizer

2798
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:43,619
to use or if we even need fertilizer and

2799
01:46:43,619 --> 01:46:45,600
there can be many practices and

2800
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,020
affiliations at the public park under

2801
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:51,420
the auspices of a Commons and so

2802
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,400
potentially thinking of the epistemic

2803
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,639
ecosystem as a Commons to be stewarded

2804
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:59,820
collectively rather than some sort of

2805
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:02,699
corpse to dissect in a disciplinary

2806
01:47:02,699 --> 01:47:05,400
fashion might bring some new people into

2807
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,520
the picture

2808
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,739
wow I love the shared stewardship like

2809
01:47:10,739 --> 01:47:13,860
that is so that is so beautiful you know

2810
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:16,320
it's like wow can you imagine if like

2811
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,060
every hard science had to have an

2812
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,619
elective like

2813
01:47:19,619 --> 01:47:21,600
building a garden

2814
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,460
can you hold that harsh theorem and like

2815
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,320
take care of like a plant like that

2816
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:27,900
would be wow that would be so amazing

2817
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,360
Daniel I think we have to like

2818
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:33,480
Wow Let's grow a plant Let's uh let's

2819
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,159
make a shared sewer like stewardship

2820
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:37,199
wouldn't that be so cool like here's the

2821
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,760
you know they kind of do it with like

2822
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,199
Trade Tech and stuff like that like tech

2823
01:47:40,199 --> 01:47:43,020
places but I think like yeah it's almost

2824
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:44,880
like elon's at Astra it's like let's

2825
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,520
make it add like ad infinitum Universal

2826
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,820
or something like that you know

2827
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:51,960
take it to the Limit

2828
