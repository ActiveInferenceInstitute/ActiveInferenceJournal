21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,199
okay great uh thank you very much thank

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,600
you very much for the invitation i spoke

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,920
to anna kanika who told me that she had

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,320
a great experience with you guys so i'm

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,959
very very happy to be able to

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,040
present and to tell you a little bit

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
about the background to this talk i was

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,320
a

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,080
originally a philosopher of mind and of

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,520
cognitive science and i'm very

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,119
interested in

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
uh the

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,920
use of

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
models and techniques in cognitive

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,759
science to understand psychiatric

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,439
disorder

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,759
and i found predictive processing very

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,040
helpful when i was writing a book on

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,680
this a few years ago but looking back at

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
um some other psychiatric disorders like

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,240
the cotard delusion and so on

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,840
i think it's really great to kind of go

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,520
a little bit deeper and more more

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,360
fundamental if you think of predictive

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,720
processing as kind of like a

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,799
computational structure at the level of

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
representation and algorithm

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,200
but of course a lot of psychiatric

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,119
disorders i think you've got a very sort

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,600
of a bottom-up genesis

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,119
we really need to know about how the

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,360
brain is working to control the body and

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
even how the body is working in its

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,799
social world

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
so the active inference framework for me

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,719
has been very helpful

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,960
in rethinking this in this book that i'm

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,640
writing right now

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
and also i think it's it's actually

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,318
crucial to understanding a phenomenon

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,319
that i'm talking about right now that

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,160
the kotar delusion

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,080
the cotard delusion is so interesting

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,360
because um

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
well it's interesting in itself as

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
you'll see it's fascinating phenomenon

67
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
but it points us to some really

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,599
interesting uh

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,080
interesting facts or yeah interesting

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,560
evidence about the way the mind is mind

71
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
is working at a really basic level and

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,360
how that ramifies

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,599
and cascades upwards throughout

74
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,680
cognition and behavior so let's go i'll

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
i'll just tell you what

76
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
the kotar delusion is it's a delusion of

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
sometimes people think of it in the folk

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
world as

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,599
the delusion that you're dead

80
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,120
i was discovered in 1882

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,879
but

82
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,560
we described it more accurately i think

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,440
as a delusion of inexistence

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,200
so here's a here's someone who has it

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
she had the experience of having no

86
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
identity or self

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,120
and being only a body without content

88
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
she convinced that her brain had

89
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920
disappeared and the whole body was

90
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,959
translucent another one more recent one

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,480
i speak and breathe and eat but i'm dead

92
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
okay so there's some classic

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,319
examples but here

94
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,080
is a really recent one published in the

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,159
last couple of years this is fascinating

96
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,040
cases coming from mexico

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
there's a really good group there that

98
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,000
works on this

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
so mr a was referred to the national

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
institute of neurology because of

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,640
psychotic and catatonic symptoms

102
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
his appetite diminished he barely slept

103
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
he stayed withdrawn and silent

104
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,640
he complained about his body saying his

105
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,560
tendons had dried up and his organs were

106
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
getting bigger speak of an internal

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
hemorrhage his organs have been torn

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,200
apart he began to insist that he was

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,959
dead i can't feel the blood flowing

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,560
through my veins

111
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
didn't deprive him of looking for sharp

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,159
objects to cut his neck and forearms

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
then he gradually improved first he

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,159
became mute began to urinate on his

115
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,840
clothes refused to eat

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,280
and

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
then speak

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,959
finally you know after some treatment he

119
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,439
said he's improved slightly but he said

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,079
i don't have feelings because i'm dead

121
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,918
he had a right-sided heart and that it

122
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,279
stopped

123
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,199
and then he kept on saying even after

124
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,280
persisting treatment his nihilistic

125
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
delusions as they're accurately called

126
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
you know delusions of inexistence of

127
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
nothingness i am dead among other human

128
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,919
beings it's like a program where i'm

129
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,800
dead

130
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,479
and he said he was a dead person among

131
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,040
the corpses under the earthquake debris

132
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,639
now

133
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,639
the genesis of this case of qatar

134
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
delusion is um

135
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
encephalitis a form of encephalitis

136
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,960
where it's an autoimmune reaction

137
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,479
against proteins in the brain so it's

138
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,160
one of the most basic

139
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,199
things that can go wrong at the cellular

140
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,440
level and if the protein is in methyl

141
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,639
the aspartate the condition is called

142
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,840
nmdar antibody encephalitis okay so

143
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,720
that's what mr a had but of course our

144
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
interesting question is

145
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
if we know what's happening you know at

146
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
the molecular level at the level of kind

147
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,800
of membranes and receptors

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
why on earth would that make you think

149
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,479
that you didn't exist

150
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,080
so they were addressing that they were

151
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,600
in the in the field of addressing the

152
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,360
question you know how does the brain

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
enable experience

154
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,199
and cognition that's that's the

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,160
questions of cognitive neuroscience

156
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,240
and psychology and anyone else who wants

157
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,199
to

158
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,840
get involved in that topic phenomenology

159
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,120
philosophy

160
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,880
okay but it's a really uh pertinent

161
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
question

162
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,840
so here's the outline of the talk i just

163
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
told you about the delusion and then i'm

164
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,840
going to tell you about some of the

165
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,120
classic attempts to explain it

166
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,199
uh just run through those

167
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
and point to a problem with those

168
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
and then in discussing uh one of the

169
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
most recent and persuasive and really

170
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,600
interesting

171
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,360
um explanations

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,919
uh that we owe to alexandre bien i'm

173
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,840
going to introduce the active inference

174
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
and i'm going to show how the active

175
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
inference approach

176
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,840
can

177
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,960
rectify a problem with beyonce's account

178
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,039
but also a point to point to some other

179
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,960
deep sort of unifying themes

180
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,280
across cognitive science and across

181
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
disorders so the active inference

182
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,440
framework i think gives a elegant

183
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
and persuasive

184
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
um way to explain not just you know

185
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
cases like mr a

186
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,319
but a lot of other dis other disorders

187
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,600
and pathologies where our experience of

188
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
our self

189
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
goes astray so things like pain and

190
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,240
symbolia where people say that they're

191
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,120
experiencing pain but also that their

192
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,880
body is experiencing pain but it's not

193
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,479
happening to them

194
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,919
but it feels as though it's not their

195
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,039
pain or depersonalization disorders in

196
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,280
which people will say not just that pain

197
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,720
is not theirs but

198
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,560
they feel outside of or detached from

199
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,919
their whole experience okay so and the

200
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,680
solution that i'll propose i'll give you

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,639
um just a short summary right now

202
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,759
is that as part of the um

203
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,759
project or process of of active

204
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,520
inference the body the brain makes uh

205
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,759
hierarchical models of itself and the

206
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,599
world of deep the deep structure of the

207
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,560
world

208
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
as as populated with objects and

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
properties that the external world with

210
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,240
which it interacts

211
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,160
but of course the brain also has to make

212
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,919
a model of its own

213
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,919
internal uh

214
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:34,960
uh

215
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,160
functioning

216
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,479
the processes that that keep it keep

217
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,560
keep us alive and functioning and in

218
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400
order to do that it makes a model of

219
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
itself as a unified persisting entity

220
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
and that's what we feel the self that's

221
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,440
what we feel

222
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,879
when we feel

223
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,879
like like persisting people when we feel

224
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,599
like ourselves we we are the model

225
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,919
that's what we're experiencing activity

226
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,560
in the circuitry that makes that uh

227
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
self-model okay

228
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,800
and in a cotard delusion there's the

229
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,080
self-model

230
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
uh goes wrong in a certain way or that

231
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,840
process of self-modeling goes wrong in a

232
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,599
certain way but we can see other

233
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,759
disorders in which that process of

234
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
self-modelling goes wrong

235
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,919
and i think that

236
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,360
theory makes

237
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,759
it maps really nicely to the um the

238
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,759
neural substrates of all these disorders

239
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,240
it explains the symptoms and so on so

240
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,440
let's go

241
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,240
so of course as we saw um

242
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,840
such an interesting disorder the the

243
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,919
quartile delusion because

244
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,279
you know there's there's questions in

245
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,599
sort of philosophy and about

246
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,919
rational belief fixation and so on i

247
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
mean how could someone coherently say

248
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,080
i've died or i don't exist and there's a

249
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,360
question about

250
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,959
rationality there and the nature of

251
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,640
reasoning and so on on the basis of

252
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
experience which is interesting in

253
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
itself

254
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
which is that's part of the philosophy

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
of delusions i guess or the philosophy

256
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
of psychiatric disorder where i came

257
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,160
into this topic a while ago

258
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
but of course it's also very interesting

259
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
in okay how can you also have the

260
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,320
experience of not existing you know so

261
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,800
it points us to the question of what is

262
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,760
going on when you actually feel like a

263
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,640
self

264
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
okay and of course it's also a great

265
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
test case for theories that

266
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,440
try and explain experience and cognition

267
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,240
in terms of underlying

268
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,880
neural functioning so here's the kind of

269
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,959
broad brush of the kind of classic

270
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,880
approaches to the these topics that you

271
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,040
get in theories of delusion since i

272
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,640
guess

273
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
the early 90s

274
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,320
which tried to wed

275
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
philosophy of belief rational belief

276
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,440
fixation to the neuroscience of dilution

277
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,279
formation and that

278
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,880
the most top-level abstract way of

279
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,080
putting it is

280
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
there's two stages in delusion formation

281
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
the first one you know is an unusual

282
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,720
binomial as they say

283
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,640
sensory

284
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,120
experience so something goes wrong you

285
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
know at the level of sensory motor

286
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,839
functioning

287
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,240
gives you an unusual experience

288
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,120
and then the second stage is

289
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
a metacognitive response to that

290
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,880
experience so this is why

291
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
someone for example who

292
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,320
lost control or was unable to feel

293
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,279
uh

294
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,959
unable to feel that they are the agent

295
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,480
of their actions when they're picking up

296
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,399
things and moving around the world okay

297
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
that's the loss of it as they call sense

298
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,920
of agency

299
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,560
due to um you know normally problems in

300
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,800
the

301
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,120
parietal lobule inferior parietal lobule

302
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,399
something goes wrong there with the kind

303
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,720
of sensory motor

304
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,640
in action of agency and then the people

305
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,720
what person will say to explain that

306
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,800
weird experience of moving around the

307
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
world but not feeling like they are the

308
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
person who initiated the movement or

309
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,560
controlling it and say someone else is

310
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,959
controlling me you know so delusions of

311
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,720
control as they say that would be a

312
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,240
classic case we have an anomalous

313
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,519
experience

314
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,360
at the first stage and then the delusion

315
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,959
is a belief or some kind of

316
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,920
metacognitive rationalization or story

317
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,279
that the person tells okay

318
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,079
now

319
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,240
there's two implications of the um the

320
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,839
two-stage theory

321
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,920
one is that well if the patient doesn't

322
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,839
have

323
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
a problem with higher order processing

324
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
then she won't develop a delusion

325
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
because the delusion is a metacognitive

326
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,839
response right so in that case the

327
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,519
person should have

328
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,519
an anomalous experience she should feel

329
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,560
like

330
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
she's making movements that aren't hers

331
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,040
for example or you might feel like

332
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,720
you're hearing voice you might hear like

333
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
feel like you're hearing voices

334
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
and the person will just report that i

335
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,120
mean having an unusual weird

336
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,200
distressing experience but they wouldn't

337
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,720
go on to have a delusion because the

338
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,800
delusion is the result of a

339
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,480
problem at the stage of as they call

340
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,360
belief fixation or metacognition

341
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
okay

342
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
and if this is really right then there

343
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,639
should be cases in which people have the

344
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,320
unusual experience

345
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
but they don't go on to

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,920
have a delusion and of course we are all

347
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,760
familiar with this in everyday life if

348
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
you think about it

349
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
you've probably had uh feelings of deja

350
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,160
vu or jamaica you know in deja vu you

351
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,680
think i've been here before i've had

352
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,920
this experience before even though you

353
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,519
know that you haven't

354
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,040
okay and this is the point that you know

355
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,519
you can have an experience

356
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,639
that is completely anomalous or weird

357
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,720
don't go on to have a delusion about it

358
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
okay and in this case you say well it

359
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,040
feels as if i've been here before or in

360
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
the opposite case jamie vu

361
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,639
you know you walk into your bedroom and

362
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,720
it feels where you sleep every night but

363
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
you just have this fleeting instant of

364
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,600
uh

365
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,680
what this is new or this is feels like a

366
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,240
duplicate of my bedroom or something but

367
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,079
you don't go on to form a delusion

368
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,200
because rational insight is retained

369
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,240
unlike the classic case of delusions of

370
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,360
misidentification which i spend no time

371
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,720
on

372
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,600
in the delusion of misidentification

373
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,399
a person will say something like

374
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,760
they'll see their wife or see their

375
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,200
husband or boyfriend or something and

376
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,320
say they're a stranger see and you say

377
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
why do you say that you know don't they

378
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,120
do they look the same as their

379
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
appearance chant and then they look

380
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
identical

381
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,680
but they are like a replica or a

382
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
duplicate or an imposter in the classic

383
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
delusion

384
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,880
and the story is what has gone wrong

385
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,720
here is there's a problem at the level

386
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
of sensory processing

387
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,800
this thought is that normally when we

388
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,519
see a familiar face we get an affective

389
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
response to that face which is part of a

390
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,680
signal that that's a familiar person you

391
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,360
know i see you

392
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,680
i see my sister or my my partner and

393
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
then it's like oh yeah that's that's her

394
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,440
so it's a feeling of familiarity that's

395
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,279
based in affect but when that goes

396
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,399
missing

397
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,600
then all the other perceptual

398
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,519
information is intact i recognize the

399
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,440
phase the shape of the face and so on

400
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,600
but i don't they don't feel familiar and

401
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,959
in the case of

402
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,040
delusions of misidentification the

403
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,199
person rationalizes these losses or

404
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,360
alterations to the sense of familiarity

405
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
by saying oh

406
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,279
you know my wife's been replaced

407
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,079
by an imposter okay amazing delusions

408
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,600
but there you go

409
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,199
but that's just an example of the kind

410
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,959
of two-stage

411
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
theory of delusion formation which was

412
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
developed for delusions of

413
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,480
misidentification now in turning to the

414
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,560
quarter division

415
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,680
what is

416
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
the first stage within this framework

417
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,880
well alexander bion

418
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,000
says that

419
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,920
it's the loss of what people call the

420
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,320
sense of mindness

421
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,959
or uh subjective presence is what anil

422
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,360
seth calls this and people from sussex

423
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,760
who work on de-personalization

424
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,160
basic idea is that

425
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,079
something that philosophers and many

426
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,320
people have remarked on or

427
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,920
thought about

428
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,639
is that when you have experiences

429
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,720
part of that experience is an awareness

430
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,560
that you are the person who's having

431
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,279
experience as jasper's said

432
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,920
every psychic manifestation perception

433
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,880
bodily memory it carries with it this

434
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,440
feeling of being mine and having an eye

435
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,079
quality of personally belonging it's

436
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,839
been termed personalizations

437
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,839
and so the thought is just as when you

438
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,519
see familiar people there's this kind of

439
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,600
subtle um just this little subtle

440
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
feeling of familiarity which you don't

441
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,279
even notice that it's there until it

442
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,639
goes missing

443
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,000
and so it's the case that with your

444
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,160
everyday experience it feels like it's

445
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,279
yours

446
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,800
i mean who else so there's this kind of

447
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
aspect of subjectivity or subjective

448
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,079
presence

449
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,760
that you wouldn't even become aware of

450
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,040
until it went missing we only see it as

451
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
we only even notice that this is an

452
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,160
experience

453
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,800
a kind of subtle accompaniment to all of

454
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
life

455
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,519
until

456
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,000
we are confronted with as beyonce's

457
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,079
exceptional and pathological cases and

458
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,759
then if it goes missing you're really in

459
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,639
trouble

460
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,440
right so for example

461
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
in case of pain a symbolia

462
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
what can happen is that

463
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,839
someone can

464
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
have a pain they can have the experience

465
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,959
of pain

466
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,000
you know

467
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
um and they can report that experience

468
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,399
of pain saying yeah you know i mean yeah

469
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
i'm in pain um but it doesn't feel like

470
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,920
it's my pain

471
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
or i feel detached like it's not

472
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
happening to me

473
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
until you know when on interrogation you

474
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,279
say

475
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,959
yeah yeah you know it feels hot i feel

476
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,639
kind of pressure it feels intense in

477
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
other words

478
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,199
they can

479
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,000
be

480
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
still able to detect

481
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,720
and represent uh bodily damage through

482
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,480
the process of as it's called you know

483
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,959
nociception the primary representation

484
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,040
of pain stimuli

485
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,360
okay but something else has gone missing

486
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
right and what uh in this nice um

487
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
and there's two theories about penis

488
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,079
symbolia

489
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,839
one is that what's gone missing is an

490
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,839
emotional response to pain so that would

491
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,920
be the thought that

492
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,759
in the normal case of pain

493
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,000
you have no conception

494
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
you know the detection and

495
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
representation of bodily damage and then

496
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
there's if you like an affective or an

497
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,880
emotional response or interpretation to

498
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,680
that

499
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,639
and the resultant pain experience is

500
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639
like a merger or combination bodily

501
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,240
damage plus

502
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
uh distress and that's what you report

503
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
but when you take the distress part out

504
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,240
you just get the representation of

505
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,919
bodily damage

506
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,760
that's one theory of pain

507
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,959
but colin klein had a different account

508
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,640
and on colin klein's view it's not a

509
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,799
loss of affect this is not a loss of

510
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,760
affect it's a loss of the sense of

511
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,520
mindness

512
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,400
so a symbolia on his view

513
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,319
is a localized

514
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,760
version of depersonalization experience

515
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,200
asymbolia is like a restricted case

516
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,160
just just to the pain processing

517
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,720
where the connection between uh the

518
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
processing of bodily damage or

519
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
nociception as it's called

520
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,200
and

521
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,280
subtle feeling that the experience

522
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,080
belongs to you comes apart so as he says

523
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,559
this sort of unity may fail

524
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,360
okay

525
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,520
and that this leads to what he calls

526
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,720
depersonalization or pain

527
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,679
as opposed to

528
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,080
depersonalization in the general case

529
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,960
where

530
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,679
the the loss of the sense of mindness is

531
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,080
not just for pain

532
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,160
but for everything

533
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,240
so someone with severe personalization

534
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,600
disorder

535
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,559
will

536
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,400
move through life

537
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,120
you know having sensations

538
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,960
sensations of movement you know

539
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
perceptual sensations bodily experiences

540
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,360
but feeling

541
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,240
as if those things don't belong to them

542
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
as someone says here it feels almost

543
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,240
like i have died but no one has thought

544
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
to tell me so i'm living in a shell that

545
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,960
i don't recognize

546
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,000
i felt my brain was somewhere else and

547
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
just watching me i couldn't tell whether

548
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,919
i was present or whether i was the part

549
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,360
that it was gone there was the one

550
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,039
watching and the other

551
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,720
it's like seeing life as if it were

552
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120
played in a film or a movie but in that

553
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,520
case who is watching the film

554
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,160
i find myself regarding existence so

555
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
from beyond the tomb i'm outside my own

556
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,320
body and individuality i'm

557
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,880
de-personalized

558
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
so just to recap

559
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,559
okay klein gives us the idea that you

560
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,280
know symbolia you lose this this sense

561
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,600
of mindness or belonging to me for one

562
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,840
particular uh channel of bodily

563
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,320
processing that's um nociception or pain

564
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,280
signaling

565
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,520
but in depersonalization this loss is

566
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
global and then and when the loss is

567
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,559
global the person reports

568
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,760
depersonalization for everything and the

569
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,600
feeling there is like

570
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,840
well they say it feels as if i don't

571
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,880
exist it feels like i'm not there right

572
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,160
and so

573
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
how should we explain what's going on

574
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,080
here well there's different theories

575
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,039
uh beyond has one i had one 20 years ago

576
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,720
it's a bit out of date now i think i'm

577
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
updating it today

578
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,840
even as we speak

579
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,440
and then we have the one i'll be talking

580
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,080
about uh today which uh we owe to the

581
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,480
active infant skies like seth sakirus

582
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,919
and so on

583
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,679
but here's beyond's take on it which is

584
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,559
very interestingly

585
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,000
so

586
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,799
dion uh what beyonce says

587
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,440
is that depersonalization is this case

588
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,840
of an anomalous experience and the

589
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,159
anomalous or strange experience is the

590
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,559
feeling that the self

591
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,840
is unreal

592
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,919
and it's not there

593
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,919
and so if we go back to the cotard

594
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,919
delusion remember the two-stage theory

595
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
of delusion is that

596
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,760
a delusion arises when you have an

597
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,679
anomalous experience

598
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,400
and then you have some

599
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,480
problem at a higher level of

600
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,880
rational interpretation narrative

601
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,520
organization or metacognition

602
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
so that you uh

603
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
you have no rational insight into the

604
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,919
experience or are unable to

605
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,080
explain it or you end up just taking it

606
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,520
for granted

607
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,400
and that's beyond's idea about

608
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,679
depersonalization it's the first stage

609
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,520
of cottage delusion

610
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,679
so when someone with depersonalization

611
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,840
says it feels as if i don't exist it

612
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
feels as if i'm not here it feels as if

613
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,960
experience is outside me or i'm not

614
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,720
involved in it

615
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,640
that's because they're having the same

616
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
experience as the kotard person had the

617
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,120
kotard patient has but they have

618
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,720
rational insight and intact

619
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,039
metacognition so they can look they can

620
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,480
as it will look at that experience and

621
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,600
say

622
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,159
it feels as if i don't exist

623
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,799
it feels as if experience isn't mine

624
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,240
but

625
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,559
i know that's not true so i report it

626
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,320
just saying it feels that way but i

627
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
don't they don't develop the delusion so

628
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,080
what differentiates cotard and

629
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,919
depersonalized delusions

630
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,000
is that the kotard patient has the same

631
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,280
experience

632
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
as a um as a patient with

633
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,960
depersonalization

634
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,880
but they have intact rational insight

635
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
okay

636
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,679
now

637
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,919
um that's the philosophical angle but

638
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,120
recently

639
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,159
this

640
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,240
very interesting

641
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,640
group of guys in mexico

642
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,880
have a neuropsychiatric version

643
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,679
of um alexandra beyond's two-stage

644
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,000
account which is they explain mr a's

645
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,600
case you know the man who thought that

646
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
his organs had dried up and that he was

647
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
dead

648
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
he has insular cortex dysfunction and

649
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,159
that insular cortex dysfunction is the

650
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,520
first factor

651
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,000
okay so the insular cortex dysfunction

652
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,840
produces

653
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,919
the experience

654
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,960
of depersonalization the feeling that

655
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,120
that one sensory experiences and

656
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,520
cognitions don't belong

657
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,280
to the subject

658
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
or that

659
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,679
and then

660
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,400
there's a prefrontal cortex dysfunction

661
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
that produces the second phase the

662
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,159
second factor so this is the story

663
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,840
if you look on the left you've got uh

664
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,480
the um the first stage

665
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,240
insular cortex

666
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,559
um produces this anomalous subjecting

667
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,720
feeling state so if you have hypoactive

668
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
insular cortex or maybe lesion or you

669
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
know neurochemical disruption

670
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,640
then you're going to have insular cortex

671
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,760
problems

672
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,600
and that's going to lead to the feeling

673
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,400
that experiences are not yours in some

674
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
way that could manifest as pain a

675
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,039
symbolia depersonalization

676
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,039
or it's also in alexa thymia which we

677
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,960
didn't talk about today

678
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,360
but in any case that gives rise to

679
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,240
this abnormal sensory state or if they

680
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,400
call it abnormal perception so something

681
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,159
has gone wrong with your ability to feel

682
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,799
that experiences belong to you

683
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,400
thanks to your insular cortex

684
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,679
dysfunction

685
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,039
and then

686
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,400
if you also have

687
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,120
prefrontal cortical dysfunction then you

688
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,520
can't explain that you have no rational

689
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,080
insight into that and so you end up with

690
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,559
the delusion

691
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,440
now just to recap the um the assumption

692
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,240
here that's shared by beyond

693
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,520
and by ramirez bermudez and his

694
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,039
collaborators

695
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,840
is that the first stage is essentially

696
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
the same or similar between the

697
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
personalization experiences and qatar

698
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,720
delusion

699
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,600
okay

700
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,840
so the anomalous experience of

701
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,760
depersonalization with rational insight

702
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,320
well that's depersonalization

703
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,159
but if you have the anomalous experience

704
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
of depersonalization with no rational

705
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,919
insight then you get the cotard delusion

706
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:16,720
right

707
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,120
and the result and this is because of

708
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,919
hypoactivity or lesion maybe in your

709
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,320
insular cortex

710
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
but this is this is where i want to go

711
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,320
today this is wrong right this doesn't

712
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
fit with the phenomenology of cotard

713
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,799
syndrome or the neurobasis of cotard

714
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,200
syndrome which is typically

715
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,760
a profound and catastrophic

716
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,360
reconfiguration of the bodily and

717
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,279
effective life world of the patient it's

718
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,679
not a restricted quasi-perceptual

719
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,799
deficit

720
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,360
and it's not just um insular cortical

721
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,799
dysfunction

722
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,799
um because look look at the variety of

723
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,120
conditions in which you see cottage

724
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,360
delusion

725
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,200
just some right affective disorders

726
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,440
schizophrenia syphilis cephalo

727
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
encephalitis hemorrhage

728
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,080
malformations brain neoplasm the cancer

729
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,720
migraine parkinson's disease dementia

730
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
right this wide spread

731
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,840
you know

732
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,360
catastrophic

733
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
uh

734
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,080
conditions of you know neural

735
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,600
malfunction and then and then you see um

736
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
a quater delusion it's not just the ins

737
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,159
not just the insular cortex

738
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,559
um hypoactive okay

739
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,559
and not only that it's not just

740
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,640
cartilage delusion doesn't look like a

741
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
i'm just like oh it feels as if i'm not

742
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,679
here

743
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,799
if you go back to the initial

744
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
description of the symptom of

745
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,799
symptomology it's not just i feel like i

746
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,840
have

747
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,720
intact perception and cognition it just

748
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
feels like it's it's not mine or i feel

749
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,039
detached from it i mean typically some

750
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,799
of qatar delusion undergoes like

751
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,880
completely profound

752
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,520
and uh quite catastrophic

753
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,679
reconfiguration of their whole life

754
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,440
experience they feel like their body is

755
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,200
expanding or constructing or you know

756
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
that guy felt as though his organs had

757
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,240
dried up

758
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,039
they can't sleep they stay urination and

759
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,360
sexual function and everything goes to

760
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,240
um crazy their appetite is out of luck

761
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,840
you know it's a complete

762
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
catastrophic breakdown

763
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,400
uh often it's progressive but there's no

764
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,240
doubt about it that's a catastrophic

765
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,760
breakdown

766
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,640
okay

767
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,720
so there's a first one we can disagree

768
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,640
with the foundational assumption but at

769
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
the same token but at the same time

770
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,960
sorry at the same point

771
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,360
it is true that insular malfunction is

772
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,080
um associated with cottage with with uh

773
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,960
depersonalization i beg your pardon

774
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,720
so let's look at that first

775
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,559
and it's also true that um the insulin

776
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,880
malfunction among other things is

777
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,520
profoundly involved in cataract dilution

778
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,159
and i think we can see why and this is

779
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,400
where active inference

780
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,799
makes its appearance enter stage right

781
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,480
active inference theory

782
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
uh active inference and predictive

783
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,559
processing provide this really nice

784
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,200
framework to um tie all these ideas

785
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
together to explain depersonalization

786
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,440
cotard asymbolia

787
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,120
and to fit together the kind of neural

788
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
correlates the phenomenology and

789
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,080
symptomatology symptomology okay

790
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,840
well first let's let's start with the

791
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
kind of

792
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,240
the restricted thing let's talk about uh

793
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,799
depersonalization why would insular

794
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,919
damage

795
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,760
lead to depersonalization why would it

796
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,240
be the case that if you had hypoactivity

797
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,559
in your insular cortex

798
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,000
you would feel like your experience

799
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,919
wasn't happening to you

800
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,399
it's pretty interesting and amazing

801
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,919
uh sensation well the reason is that the

802
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,919
insular cortex

803
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,000
it does a lot of things you know as they

804
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,480
say it's an enigmatic

805
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,760
um and ubiquitously involved neural

806
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,440
structure it's very kind of deep it's

807
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,600
kind of it receives afferents from

808
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
almost everywhere it communicates with

809
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,679
almost every every part of the brain

810
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,000
okay and you'll see it involved in in so

811
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,200
many things

812
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,880
so it's hard to it's always been very

813
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,440
hard to work out a particular function

814
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,279
that the insular cortex does right it's

815
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,120
not like you know for example

816
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,640
looking at part of the visual cortex

817
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,559
that you know processes

818
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,159
wavelength information or something like

819
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,880
that or is involved in you know

820
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,120
these neural circuits are involved in

821
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,880
determining movement or trajectory or

822
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
something like that it's not like that

823
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,320
the insular cortex somehow seems to

824
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,039
contribute to so many things as a as an

825
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,679
integrative um

826
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,440
device of integration and i would say as

827
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,880
a device of organization and

828
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,640
coordination and it's like a relay

829
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
station actually between all these other

830
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
different things

831
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,720
but the posterior insular cortex is very

832
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,039
important in somatosensory vestibular

833
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,720
and motor integration

834
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,600
okay

835
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,080
so that the posterior insular cortex is

836
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,320
basically involved i would say in

837
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,480
integrating all the information about

838
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,760
what's happening

839
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,520
in your body right

840
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
while the anterior insular cortex which

841
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,000
is our real culprit here has pres

842
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,320
projections to limbic regions

843
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,480
which are you know that's one of the

844
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,960
substrates of emotional processes

845
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
and is associated with integrating

846
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,360
autonomic and visceral information in

847
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
other words the basic information about

848
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,159
how your body is functioning

849
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,240
um you know my blood pressure my blood

850
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,440
acidification oxygenation you know

851
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,520
state of my organs and so forth this

852
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,080
kind of really basic keeping you alive

853
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,720
uh kind of information integrating that

854
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
with emotional cognitive and

855
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,760
motivational functions

856
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,600
in other words and here's the killer it

857
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,039
brings internal signals into

858
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,080
consciousness and emotional

859
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,240
interpretations supporting the neural

860
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,399
constructions of

861
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,960
subjective feelings

862
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,159
so um just to go

863
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,720
let me stay here for a moment

864
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,159
so the thought you know that we get with

865
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,520
people like bud craig and everything

866
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,679
like that is that the anterior insular

867
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,840
cortex

868
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,279
basically takes all these signals about

869
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,880
what's happening on the inside on the

870
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,039
inside of your body you know my blood

871
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,960
pressure's up my heart is beating

872
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,120
whatever my organs are functioning well

873
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,960
or not

874
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,440
and integrates that with all the other

875
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,880
uh cognitive systems that are telling

876
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
you what's going on outside you know

877
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,080
what you see what you hear what you

878
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,320
smell and the higher cognition what you

879
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,760
remember what you mentioned what you're

880
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,039
thinking about

881
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,120
okay and that creates it integrates all

882
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,279
this in other words to kind of to allow

883
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,640
you to to

884
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,799
create if you like a representation of

885
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,200
how what is happening in the world

886
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,960
is interacting with what's happening

887
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,080
inside

888
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,039
my body to enable me to function

889
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,679
adaptively in context

890
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,679
and as they say well what is that except

891
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,399
a sense of self a sense of sense of self

892
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,720
or representation of their self is

893
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,559
i'm the thing that has to manipulate my

894
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,720
body around the world to interact and

895
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,039
engage adaptively with it and to do that

896
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,279
i need to integrate all the information

897
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,520
that's relevant to that task that's what

898
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,120
we need a sense itself for and that's

899
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,760
what the anterior insula does

900
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,600
anterior insulator looks down at the

901
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,559
bodily processing looks out to the world

902
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,320
and integrates them to give you a sense

903
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,480
of as they say subjective feeling in the

904
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,679
moment

905
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,519
now so with that in place we can see why

906
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,120
when um

907
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,440
anterior insula goes wrong you or you

908
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,039
know malfunctions you might get a uh

909
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,039
the sense of not being involved in

910
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,640
experience

911
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,880
now the most um

912
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,960
persuasive i think explanation of how

913
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,320
this might go wrong is that it's a

914
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,240
dissociative response

915
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,120
to trauma this comes from medford's here

916
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,360
and david the people who work on it

917
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,200
but they explain it in kind of emotional

918
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,360
terms so they call it they call a result

919
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,919
as emotional numbing so the thought is

920
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,840
you're having a traumatic experience

921
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,519
you're being raped or being bashed or

922
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,799
maybe you're in a

923
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,159
you know destructive abusive environment

924
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,760
and

925
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,200
as a way of coping you know your

926
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,080
your

927
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,799
your brain shuts down the anterior

928
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,640
insular cortex it just turned it just

929
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,120
turns it off and what is the result you

930
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
still end up and you still end up you

931
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,840
know seeing feeling thinking

932
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,919
and so on but you don't have the kind of

933
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,080
effective as i say effective response or

934
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,480
as as uh sierra puts it

935
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
you no longer have the emotional

936
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,440
coloring of experience

937
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,600
so it leads to a qualitative change of

938
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
conscious awareness which is reported by

939
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,919
the subject as unreal or detached so the

940
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,559
basic idea is you shut down

941
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,559
affective processing

942
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,320
so that you can cope with

943
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,960
extreme distress or trauma

944
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,559
and to shut that down you shut off the

945
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,799
anterior insular cortex so you no longer

946
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,760
feel

947
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,600
that it's happening to you so you can

948
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,679
see what you have here is really an

949
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,640
effective or an emotional theory of

950
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,320
self-awareness the basic idea is

951
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,799
self-awareness is really created by

952
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,159
the emotional coloring of experience

953
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,120
and when that is gone you end up in a

954
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,720
emotionally monochrome world so to speak

955
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,559
and there's some evidence that lack of

956
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,960
anterior insulin insulin is related to a

957
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,880
diminished emotional responsiveness seen

958
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,399
in dpd

959
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,640
and that when if the insulin comes back

960
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,279
online um not only they restore their

961
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,600
effective responses you know

962
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,120
um

963
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200
then they start to feel that they are

964
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
this feeling of detachment and

965
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,399
disengagement disappears

966
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,720
i just make the point that um this

967
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,919
theory of um

968
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,440
this theory this inhibitory theory of

969
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,840
depersonalization is dissociative it

970
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,960
actually

971
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,559
it really requires a predictive

972
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,480
processing framework because it's not

973
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,200
just the fact for example that

974
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,360
the subject doesn't feel effective

975
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,240
responses it is the fact that

976
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,039
it doesn't feel effective responses in

977
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,880
contexts or conditions where they are

978
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,640
predicted where they should occur you

979
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,600
know so depersonalization arises when

980
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
you know i don't know take take a mother

981
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,279
who's just given birth

982
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,120
and then someone gives her the child to

983
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,880
cuddle or nurse

984
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,039
and she doesn't feel anything

985
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,120
right or you come home from a long trip

986
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,800
your children run up and jump into your

987
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
arms and give you a big hug you don't

988
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
feel anything

989
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,399
or you know you hear bad news um you

990
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,000
hear terrible news someone close to you

991
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,599
has died or whatever

992
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,520
don't feel anything now it's not just

993
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,879
that you don't feel anything that's the

994
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,719
problem it's that your mind predicts

995
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,399
that you should your mind

996
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,800
has this kind of ongoing model

997
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
of the world and you and you in the

998
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,719
world that your progress through the

999
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,320
world and your interactions with the

1000
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,079
world will be as they say emotionally

1001
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,199
colored

1002
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,960
and these these emotional colorings are

1003
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,639
effective responses which get you around

1004
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,520
the world

1005
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,359
and when that's gone

1006
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,599
right it's not just that it's gone so

1007
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,800
you know because

1008
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,760
we have plenty of experiences

1009
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
that are emotionally neutral walking

1010
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,599
down the street you know i don't know

1011
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,918
doing your tax return um reading a book

1012
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,839
you're not especially interested in

1013
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,520
all that kind of jazz listening to a

1014
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,960
talk you know going going to a

1015
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,720
department meeting or that is a slightly

1016
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
distressing experience but you know you

1017
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,240
know what i mean the mere fact that

1018
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,000
there's no effective response doesn't

1019
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,240
make you feel depersonalized it's the

1020
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,160
loss of affective response in a

1021
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,320
condition where your mind predicts it

1022
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,640
it's that it's the um

1023
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,880
it's the disjunction between or the the

1024
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,720
contradiction between

1025
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,400
there should be affect and now there

1026
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,599
isn't

1027
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,839
and that's reported by then that's the

1028
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,040
thought is i feel like i'm not here okay

1029
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,280
and so the hypothesized mechanism is

1030
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,400
that the

1031
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,200
you in a traumatic situation

1032
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,040
and it's too much for your brain to deal

1033
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,160
with so

1034
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,280
these inhibitory processes kick in

1035
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
to shut down the affective response in

1036
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,599
the moment as a dissociative response

1037
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,720
and its

1038
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,119
inhibition of the anterior insular

1039
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,440
cortex by this inhibitory structures

1040
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,760
okay

1041
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,240
and this is exactly what i just said

1042
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,880
why that produces depersonalization is

1043
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
because affective experience is

1044
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,450
important in um

1045
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,320
[Music]

1046
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
in getting around life and also it's

1047
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,640
predicted you know your mind's model of

1048
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,160
you acting in the world is that you will

1049
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,520
have it

1050
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,880
uh

1051
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,079
have uh

1052
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,960
effective responses to the world

1053
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,520
here's where the affective inference um

1054
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,440
starts to kick in okay so then the

1055
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,880
question is

1056
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,839
how does the mind predict

1057
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,520
that your progress through the world

1058
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,599
will have

1059
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,359
or will give rise to effective

1060
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,240
experiences how does it do that

1061
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,520
well i think it does so in a process of

1062
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,960
what is called

1063
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,520
uh inactive inference framework

1064
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,960
predictive processing framework

1065
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,440
hierarchical self-modeling

1066
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,200
okay

1067
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,760
and basically hierarchical self-modeling

1068
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,599
is as i said before briefly that um

1069
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,040
just as the mind you know makes uh

1070
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,280
models or representations of the

1071
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,920
external world the world out there

1072
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,839
in terms of its causal structure

1073
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,520
then the mind has to make a model of

1074
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,079
what's going on inside the body in terms

1075
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,400
of its causal structure

1076
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,960
and the way the mind does this is by

1077
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,560
integrating all the properties and

1078
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,480
features of the world and attributing

1079
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,760
them to unified persisting causes well

1080
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
that's objects in in the case of the

1081
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,880
external world that unified persisting

1082
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,960
causes are objects you know you don't

1083
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,839
see

1084
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,839
smears of colors and movements and

1085
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,320
changes you see cars driving down the

1086
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
railway you don't see these kind of

1087
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,839
weird interacting shapes and properties

1088
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,119
you see people's faces smiling and so on

1089
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,000
so

1090
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
it's kind of obligatory strategy for the

1091
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,560
mind to integrate

1092
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,720
properties and features by attributing

1093
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,760
them to

1094
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,119
underlying

1095
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,680
objects or in the case of substances if

1096
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,359
you want to call it that unified

1097
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,200
persisting things

1098
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
all right and that's what that's what we

1099
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,280
do in outward and the idea of the higher

1100
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,520
of the self-modeling framework is that's

1101
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,560
what we do inward as well the mind's

1102
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,760
obligatory strategy is to unify and

1103
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,079
integrate when there are regular

1104
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,000
coherent

1105
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,320
predictable

1106
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,280
flows and sequences of

1107
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,000
experiences or sensory information

1108
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,920
the mind explains that if you like

1109
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,480
interprets it and predicts it by

1110
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,359
attributing it to the same object

1111
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,880
this happens at

1112
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
multiple levels right at the most basic

1113
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,440
level you know you have to integrate all

1114
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,320
these different different homeostatic uh

1115
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,640
functioning you know blood pressure

1116
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,200
uh visceral dilation you know vascular

1117
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,560
dilation all this kind of stuff that

1118
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,920
keeps you going

1119
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,440
well actually you don't

1120
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,920
that is actually integrated

1121
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,160
into by attributing all of those things

1122
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,320
as occurring in the same entity and we

1123
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,599
feel the result

1124
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,400
in what in an interceptive state

1125
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,800
interception being the internal analogue

1126
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,920
of perception so example which makes

1127
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,640
this point well i think is

1128
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,119
uh fatigue right well

1129
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,800
when you are fatigued

1130
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,560
right what do you feel you feel like i'm

1131
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,400
fatigued the the thing you know the

1132
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,040
embodied thing feels depleted

1133
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,640
but you don't feel

1134
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,200
uh all these individual streams of you

1135
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
know glycogen depletion adenosine

1136
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,599
depletion um slow metabolism all that

1137
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,680
you just get the kind of overall vibe of

1138
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,960
i'm tired

1139
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,720
right and that's good because then you

1140
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,560
can go to sleep you don't have to fine

1141
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,359
tune

1142
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,880
anyway you can't you can't get in there

1143
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,320
and change your glycogen levels or

1144
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,720
anything like that you can just eat so

1145
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,480
hunger is another example of a kind of

1146
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,119
interceptive sensation that is um

1147
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,160
you know this does this kind of

1148
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,320
aggregative and integrative thing

1149
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,480
and

1150
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,720
this kind of type of self modeling this

1151
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,240
is very familiar from the predictive

1152
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,079
process from from that

1153
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,720
takes place at multiple levels given the

1154
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,640
kind of imperatives

1155
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,040
that we have to survive

1156
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,800
okay so let me just spend a little bit

1157
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,680
of this okay at the most within the um

1158
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,520
active inference

1159
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,960
framework

1160
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,200
okay the most basic task

1161
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,480
of any organism self-organizing system

1162
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,960
is to survive it has to maintain its um

1163
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
maintain its physical integrity you know

1164
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,119
its boundary with the world

1165
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,119
um it has to take in energy from the

1166
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,359
world you know it has and so on has to

1167
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,800
engage with the world take in energy

1168
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
from the world and then it has to do

1169
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,480
something with that energy to maintain

1170
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,440
itself

1171
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,359
to keep all its components interacting

1172
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,440
so that's at the most basic physical

1173
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,400
level organisms avoid

1174
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,160
this inevitable tendency to

1175
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,560
thermodynamic decay that we all face and

1176
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,880
you know the probabilistic and analog of

1177
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,280
that is they avoid entropy they have to

1178
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,720
keep themselves

1179
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,400
in a state far far from entropy by

1180
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,560
taking in energy and using it

1181
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,000
of course at the biological level what

1182
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,760
does that actually mean that means

1183
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,240
staying alive surviving prospering in

1184
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,359
the world

1185
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,640
and the most when we look at the

1186
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,480
physiology

1187
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,280
okay

1188
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,880
then obviously we're talking about

1189
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,119
homeostatic mechanisms we're talking

1190
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,000
about mechanisms of self-maintenance

1191
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,560
for a um

1192
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,000
for a

1193
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,400
discrete you know unique individual so

1194
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,960
to speak now there can be obviously

1195
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,160
cases where um

1196
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,040
borderline cases of home is homeostasis

1197
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,200
where you know

1198
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,040
where organisms are dependent on other

1199
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,200
organisms for example there are lots of

1200
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,560
cases where there's a kind of you know

1201
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,400
criss-crossing of boundaries but let's

1202
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,040
keep it simple for the moment

1203
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,000
think of a cell or think of an organism

1204
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,240
got to maintain their their um

1205
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,520
basic functioning and that's what

1206
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,640
referred to as homeostasis or allostasis

1207
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,319
slightly larger

1208
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,640
more sophisticated concept

1209
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,319
so these are the kind of basic physical

1210
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,400
imperatives but of course to do that

1211
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,720
there has to be a lot of um signaling

1212
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,359
within the system you know the levels of

1213
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,440
levels of endocrine function levels of

1214
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,040
blood pressure levels of blood

1215
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,359
oxygenation they are signaled

1216
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,920
to a brain or a protobrain or a mind if

1217
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,520
you want to call it that

1218
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,400
and that signaling okay

1219
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
that signaling requires

1220
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
that the organism

1221
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,960
in some sense implement or maintain a

1222
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,800
model which predicts

1223
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,720
what is um

1224
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,760
what is uh optimal for it how far it's

1225
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,880
departing from optimal and whether the

1226
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,319
actions that it's taking to get back

1227
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,760
into

1228
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,280
optimal range

1229
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,079
are

1230
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,280
successful

1231
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,040
and when it can do that

1232
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,520
when it can successfully model itself

1233
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,280
then it's minimizing what they call

1234
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,359
variational free energy

1235
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,680
and surprise here just refers to

1236
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,560
departure from

1237
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,720
the predicted optimal state given the

1238
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,000
organism's action now if that sounds too

1239
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,920
abstract just think you know here's your

1240
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,200
brain

1241
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,520
um and you're riding up you're starting

1242
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,040
to ride your bike up a hill or walk

1243
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,200
upstairs okay and you have a kind of

1244
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,480
good

1245
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,480
optimal range of heartbeat function and

1246
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,960
blood oxygenation okay but that needs to

1247
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,319
change now because you're walking

1248
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,560
upstairs right you need to you need more

1249
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,079
oxygen in your blood you need to work

1250
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,839
harder and raise your heartbeat

1251
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,319
so your mind you know sends if you like

1252
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,160
brain sense instructions

1253
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,839
raise heartbeat you know this is all at

1254
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,960
the kind of

1255
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,599
signaling level it's quite dynamic

1256
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,440
if your heartbeat goes up that's good it

1257
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
should be up when you're going upstairs

1258
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,640
and it should be up if you're riding

1259
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,800
your bike up a hill so you've minimized

1260
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,319
you know free energy you've stayed

1261
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,400
within your optimal bound okay and

1262
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,920
you're not getting in any information

1263
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,480
that's um out of

1264
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,280
out of the kind of predicted um

1265
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,359
yeah that violates a prediction my model

1266
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,880
for that situation

1267
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,000
but

1268
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,520
let's say that you come back downstairs

1269
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,599
and you sit down and you're resting

1270
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,520
and having a drink

1271
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,440
and your heartbeat is still racing well

1272
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,680
that's outside optimal range that's not

1273
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,359
what your um

1274
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,839
your body and mind you know predict for

1275
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,599
that situation your brain

1276
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,839
think your brain doesn't well your brain

1277
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,040
doesn't think but yeah now there are

1278
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,280
signals saying this is out of kilter i'm

1279
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,680
sitting on my couch my heartbeat is 200

1280
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,520
or rather i'm sweating sweating

1281
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,319
furiously but i'm not riding my bike

1282
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,960
okay and it's not 40 degrees outside

1283
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
what's going on i've got a so a lot of

1284
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,359
signaling going on all the time

1285
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,079
about whether and how you are optimizing

1286
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,560
your bodily function and so that's just

1287
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,160
that the level of signaling and some of

1288
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,920
that's very very dynamic and leads to

1289
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,240
these kind of automatic adjustments but

1290
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,079
of course at a higher level when you

1291
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,400
talk about um

1292
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,800
cognition or what you can think of the

1293
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,040
mind or as what we call cognition as the

1294
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,440
construction of sort of representational

1295
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,800
or computational systems you know

1296
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,640
that exploit these information or

1297
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,760
properties or that organize these

1298
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,359
informational and signaling properties

1299
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,319
so that we end up with a

1300
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,160
representational architecture that's how

1301
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,839
we get perception

1302
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,280
memory sensory motor control and so on

1303
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,560
and what

1304
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,400
that's what the theory of computation

1305
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,640
gives us for understanding the mind it

1306
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,000
gives us

1307
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,760
what the theory of computation basically

1308
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,960
is

1309
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,720
in its most abstract is turning

1310
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,160
information

1311
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,000
information and signaling into

1312
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,240
representation representations that can

1313
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,440
be manipulated okay translate these

1314
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,599
abstract ideas

1315
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,760
into the idea of

1316
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,280
self-modeling

1317
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,880
and we get something

1318
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,599
like this we get okay at the very

1319
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,440
basic level

1320
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,839
of organismic function

1321
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,359
then you have allostatic or homeostatic

1322
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,359
integration your mind is kind of your

1323
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,359
brain is looking around

1324
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,440
am i in or out of am i in or out of

1325
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,680
optimal functioning all this signaling

1326
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,119
is going on and what we call

1327
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,800
interception

1328
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,000
is the integration of those processes

1329
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,720
okay which attributes them to the thing

1330
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,560
which is being regulated the thing which

1331
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,880
is being managed okay the thing in which

1332
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,200
all of these um

1333
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,760
processes have to cohere to enable

1334
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,839
adaptive functioning and then we get a

1335
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,839
readout of that and the readout is your

1336
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,760
interceptive feeling fatigue you know if

1337
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,200
you feel tired

1338
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,119
that's because you know glycogen

1339
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,920
depletion adenosine levels have changed

1340
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,160
you know metabolism is slow blah blah

1341
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,640
blah muscles are weaker and and not

1342
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,400
contracting as fast

1343
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,520
and you feel that as fatigue as its

1344
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,359
integration of all of those

1345
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,839
allostatic variables and that happens

1346
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,560
basically the job of the posterior

1347
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,119
insular cortex written there as pi

1348
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,400
is to do that that's where all that

1349
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,240
stuff coheres right that's where all of

1350
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,960
that stuff coheres

1351
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,720
then of course there's not just the

1352
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,119
issue of um

1353
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,200
how is my body functioning

1354
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,560
that's one thing

1355
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,040
okay is my body de-energized well yeah

1356
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,119
that's important to know

1357
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,480
but then

1358
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,480
there's a separate kind of we might call

1359
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,560
a high level issue of the meaning and

1360
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,119
significance of those bodily processes

1361
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,240
for you

1362
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,680
in context right so if your heartbeat is

1363
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,119
racing

1364
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,760
and you're riding your bike up a hill or

1365
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,599
going for it in the gym

1366
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,520
that's a good thing right that shouldn't

1367
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,359
cause you any particular distress you'll

1368
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,680
feel that as exhaustion

1369
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,079
but if your heartbeat is racing because

1370
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,640
you're waiting for your cancer test

1371
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,640
you know and the doctor has just come

1372
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,400
back just come out of his office and

1373
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,640
he's looking at the um

1374
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,400
he's looking at your chart and he's

1375
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,880
looking at your um he's looking at your

1376
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,000
ultrasound with a look of uh concern and

1377
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,960
worry

1378
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,280
now your heart is racing right why is it

1379
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,319
racing because you're worried that

1380
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,599
you've got worried that you might have

1381
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,599
cancer that's a different thing but the

1382
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,520
point is that the feeling is different

1383
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,440
the feeling of worry uh distress

1384
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,480
anticipatory you know anxiety

1385
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,280
well that is characterized by uh racing

1386
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,280
heartbeat and and feelings of tension

1387
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,240
and so on

1388
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,319
but that's the same bodily signature

1389
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,839
that you can get when you're powering up

1390
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,440
hill on your bike or you know or

1391
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,119
something like that so

1392
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,280
the level of heartbeat in itself

1393
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,040
is as it were you know effectively or

1394
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,640
emotionally neutral

1395
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,520
what that level of heartbeat depends on

1396
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,800
and how it

1397
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,119
and how you should react to it well

1398
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,640
that's a product of the kind of

1399
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,800
emotional context and to understand the

1400
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,400
emotional context

1401
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,839
that's when you need to bring in the

1402
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,640
rest of your perceptual memory and so on

1403
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,280
faculties and indeed your

1404
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,200
self-representation of you know how i am

1405
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,079
functioning in the world and so

1406
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,200
to do that

1407
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,319
you need to

1408
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,400
uh interpret or i just put it here

1409
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,599
transcribe those bodily feelings

1410
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,640
into emotional feelings of sadness or

1411
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,400
anxiety or whatever they are i've given

1412
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,240
the example here of um

1413
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,559
fatigue because it comes up later but

1414
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,559
it's also a good one right

1415
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,800
if you're fatigued you know if you're

1416
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,640
just tired well that is a certain bodily

1417
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,400
feeling no doubt about

1418
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,160
but if you're depressed you know someone

1419
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,920
who's got persistent depression they

1420
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,160
also feel fatigued they feel tired

1421
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,319
lethargic apathetic

1422
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,480
unmotivated unenergetic

1423
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,760
but fatigue in an episode or sorry d

1424
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,000
energized bodily dna judge bodily

1425
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,680
de-energization in a episode of um

1426
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,640
sadness is experienced differently to

1427
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,640
just fatigue that's the point right and

1428
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,040
why is that because in an episode of

1429
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,800
sadness

1430
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,440
the world and your prospects in it have

1431
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,960
been appraised or evaluated or cognized

1432
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,960
choose your term

1433
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,119
that is because your your mind has

1434
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,359
basically determined that the world for

1435
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,680
you is a site of um

1436
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,760
irretrievable disconsolation you know

1437
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,359
there's losses in there that you can't

1438
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,119
recover or recapture

1439
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,800
and of course

1440
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,880
so um

1441
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,520
that produces the feelings of sadness

1442
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,839
okay so

1443
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,200
why does this so

1444
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,800
when we translate this into um

1445
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,160
self-modeling you've got the kind of

1446
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,319
physical level of bodily functioning and

1447
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,160
the kind of homeostatic and signaling

1448
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,119
stuff

1449
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,040
but then in order to interpret the

1450
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,720
significance of all of those changes you

1451
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,359
need a model the mind needs a model of

1452
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,119
your organism and how it's functioning

1453
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,559
in the world and what it should expect

1454
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,240
from the world and the kind of affective

1455
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,839
consequences that it should get from the

1456
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,640
world and so it makes

1457
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,640
multi-level um

1458
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,680
self-model at the most basic level

1459
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,520
at the most basic level you know the

1460
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,200
mind models itself

1461
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,440
as um

1462
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,960
as a unified entity in which all of

1463
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,359
these bodily signals cohere

1464
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,760
and then it can and use that model to

1465
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,280
regulate the body now you can go to

1466
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,839
sleep if you're tired at a higher level

1467
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,119
slightly the mind models itself as the

1468
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,760
entity that has these feelings these

1469
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,079
feelings of sin these affective feelings

1470
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,480
these feelings of sadness anxiety or

1471
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,319
these feelings of happiness pleasure

1472
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,160
resentment you know all these subtle

1473
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,760
feelings that are modulated by your

1474
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,160
actions as you go through the world so

1475
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,640
just as you need a model of the uh the

1476
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,720
bodily functioning to model the body at

1477
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,319
a basic level

1478
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,640
to control once to to get through the

1479
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,240
world well we get through the world by

1480
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,240
acting to manipulate our feelings so we

1481
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,520
need a higher level model of ourself as

1482
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,280
the subject of affective states

1483
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,960
okay and here's the and at the height

1484
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,359
it's still higher level still

1485
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,680
we report those feelings in a kind of

1486
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,480
verbal narrative way you know i'm late

1487
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,200
for work you know i'm studying i'm

1488
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,280
studying you know i'm practicing

1489
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,359
gymnastics you know i'm married etc all

1490
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:44,800
these things well this is just the kind

1491
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,680
of the high level narrative self model

1492
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,000
that we use to report our feeling we

1493
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,440
used to report our states and

1494
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,880
communicate them and engage with other

1495
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,640
people and so we engage at this

1496
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,079
narrative level there's a narrative

1497
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,680
level self model that's kind of

1498
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,559
linguistic but the narrative level self

1499
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,720
model is supported by a effective or

1500
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,960
emotional level because as we engage

1501
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,480
with other people and report our states

1502
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,800
what we're doing is doing that to change

1503
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,720
our change the way we feel to feel

1504
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,160
better

1505
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,839
and at a still lower level those

1506
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,839
affective feelings what are they they

1507
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,920
are transcribed bodily feelings that is

1508
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,160
to say they are emotionally interpreted

1509
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,520
bodily feelings

1510
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,400
so the um the self model is a hierarchy

1511
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,800
is hierarchical a basic level it's it's

1512
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,280
probably at a status higher level it's

1513
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,359
bodily as interpreted for its emotional

1514
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,960
significance and at the highest level

1515
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,559
it's narrative

1516
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,119
now here's your um here's the hypothesis

1517
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,160
about um all these disorders

1518
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,040
in a cotard delusion the self model just

1519
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,880
disintegrates from the bottom up right

1520
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,280
it just falls to bits it falls to bits

1521
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,040
at the

1522
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,880
physical level right

1523
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,359
at in other words this the system

1524
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,559
becomes

1525
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,359
unregulated and unpredictable

1526
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,440
right the the mind is sending his mind

1527
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,599
is sending signals control sleep control

1528
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,200
appetite control metabolism um control

1529
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,920
movement you know get up to it but

1530
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,200
they're not getting any traction they're

1531
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,960
not getting any feedback

1532
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,880
they are the whole kind of modeling

1533
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,960
structure is disintegrated

1534
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,319
so that

1535
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,160
what the mind learns so that the mind

1536
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,000
actually can't make a model which

1537
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,720
predicts the functioning of the organism

1538
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,720
it still has this kind of sensations of

1539
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,240
organismic function but they're not

1540
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,319
integrated unified and modeled as

1541
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,400
belonging to a continuing thing

1542
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,880
because and that's precisely because

1543
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,960
that model is made for the purposes of

1544
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,040
regulation

1545
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,119
and when the mind and when the body

1546
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,280
becomes unregulated

1547
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,040
the mind learns

1548
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,520
that there is no there is no model

1549
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,119
that's going to predict and regulate its

1550
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,720
behavior

1551
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,319
so in other words if you think of the

1552
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,880
self as a model that the

1553
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,119
mind makes at the most basic level for

1554
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,960
regulatory purposes

1555
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,400
then when it's when it's completely

1556
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,839
unregulable

1557
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,280
the mind learns that there is no model

1558
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,040
that can do the job

1559
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,800
okay

1560
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,520
we won't say oh

1561
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,720
yeah so that's the that's my explanation

1562
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,880
of cortad okay

1563
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,960
well but in de-personalization it's not

1564
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,240
quite like that right because in

1565
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,640
de-personalization basically the model

1566
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,160
is intact

1567
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,480
okay the model is intact you've got kind

1568
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,680
of

1569
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,839
controllable bodily functioning you've

1570
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,079
got cognition perception and so on all

1571
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,200
working

1572
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,359
but the only thing is

1573
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,920
that the affective processes have been

1574
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,319
inhibited so this kind of you're seeing

1575
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,319
the world feeling the world touching and

1576
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,960
engaging with the world but

1577
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,799
there's no effective responses to the

1578
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,960
world because they've been shut down

1579
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,359
for as a dissociative response

1580
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,839
so now you've got an intact self-model

1581
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,520
but you can't annex or incorporate

1582
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,920
effective states into it so you indeed

1583
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,160
that's why depersonalization people feel

1584
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,280
as though

1585
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,559
they feel as though their bodies the

1586
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,480
same their perceptual and sensory motor

1587
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,240
states are the same

1588
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,160
and their narrative ability to report

1589
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,599
that think about that you know their

1590
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,520
higher level metacognitive states and

1591
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,839
narrative reportage

1592
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,520
they are intact

1593
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,000
but affect is missing

1594
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,839
effect has been if you like detached or

1595
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,520
taken out of this model that's otherwise

1596
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,839
intact and that feels as if

1597
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,359
they don't think they feel detached and

1598
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,280
on the outside of experience that's why

1599
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,680
they say they report they feel as if

1600
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,920
they don't exist but they don't say they

1601
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,760
don't exist because the model still the

1602
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,880
model is basically intact just with this

1603
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,119
uh subtraction of its effective

1604
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,720
component ability now pain and that is

1605
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,280
as a result of unpredicted deactivation

1606
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,520
of the anterior insula because anterior

1607
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,520
insulin is precisely the structure that

1608
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,640
integrates

1609
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,480
all the processing

1610
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,079
that does those kind of evaluative

1611
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,240
emotional processes and produces

1612
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,480
effective responses

1613
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,640
now in pain a symbolia

1614
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,400
which is reported as a kind of

1615
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,400
restricted depersonalization that is

1616
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,000
actually a problem at the lower level

1617
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,160
because pain a symbolic is a problem at

1618
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,720
the lower level of the posterior insular

1619
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,119
cortex which is more at the level of the

1620
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,880
sensory integration

1621
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,280
not the emotional interpretation

1622
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,160
so in pain a symbolism no susceptible

1623
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,480
signals are not incorporated in the body

1624
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,240
itself or incorporated in the body

1625
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,400
itself model so that's a kind of early

1626
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,599
process so

1627
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,520
once again in pain a symbolic you've got

1628
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,359
an intact self

1629
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,599
uh bodily self-model affective and

1630
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,079
narrative but somehow no susceptible

1631
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,240
signals aren't being incorporated into

1632
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,559
that model so and since they're not

1633
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,640
incorporated into the model at all

1634
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,720
then they won't be transcribed at the

1635
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,799
effective levels of self-modeling and

1636
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,440
then you'll and then the um

1637
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,920
the mind is left with well i'm

1638
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,680
experiencing no susceptible signals

1639
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,599
but i'm not they're not incorporated in

1640
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,280
the kind of bodily self model at the

1641
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,760
basic level so

1642
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,640
they're not mine so to speak i'm

1643
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,359
anthropomorphizing on behalf of your

1644
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,559
brain here

1645
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,000
and then since they're not incorporated

1646
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,359
in the bodily self model they're not

1647
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:08,559
going to be

1648
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,640
effectively interpret interpreted at

1649
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,359
higher levels of emotional self-modeling

1650
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,200
and once again the subject is left at

1651
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,280
this kind of narrative level just

1652
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,760
reporting on the subsequent experience

1653
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,760
it feels like the pain is not happening

1654
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,920
to me

1655
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,720
okay

1656
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,640
and so is this self-modeling theory well

1657
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,799
this self-modeling theory um comes from

1658
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:29,680
of course

1659
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,920
effective i'm sorry active inference and

1660
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,200
predictive processing theories right

1661
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,119
uh and this is um from seth and fristen

1662
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,119
you know they say that on this theory of

1663
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,200
interceptive

1664
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,119
this might slide here am i going the

1665
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,520
wrong way

1666
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,400
on this theory of that that feelings are

1667
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,319
generated at the bottom level by this

1668
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,960
kind of successive interpretation

1669
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,880
in terms of models which are ultimately

1670
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,200
top down and within this framework

1671
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,119
it's as i said the anterior insular

1672
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,440
cortex is specialized

1673
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,520
to allow us to integrate information

1674
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,280
about body state to feel its

1675
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,799
significance

1676
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,400
and the point about the self-modeling

1677
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,599
theory is

1678
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,200
those feelings of significance or

1679
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,760
effective feelings are attributed to

1680
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,880
a unified persisting entity the self

1681
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,280
okay which is the self model i'm just

1682
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,160
rehearsing repeating here what i've said

1683
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,400
okay

1684
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,920
and as they say

1685
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,359
there's another way to put it what i've

1686
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,280
just said emotion and embodied itself

1687
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,280
would have grounded in active inference

1688
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,240
of those signals most likely to be me

1689
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,000
in other words as you go through the

1690
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,960
world

1691
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,640
your mind needs to

1692
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,839
model the consequences of your actions

1693
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,480
and the consequences of those actions

1694
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,160
are going to be you know interceptive

1695
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,680
internal bodily

1696
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,280
and also they're going to be emotional

1697
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,960
and affect

1698
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,359
and so at any given time we have a self

1699
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,720
model which is um predicting

1700
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,720
how our actions with the world will make

1701
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,160
us feel

1702
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,359
and what the kind of sensory

1703
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,680
consequences those actions will be at

1704
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,280
all levels from

1705
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,920
homeostasis body integrity body

1706
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,319
integrity and so forth and as they say

1707
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,559
the metacog cognitive and narrative eye

1708
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,960
or as i've put it to simplify

1709
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,200
you've got kind of basic bodily self

1710
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,040
you've got and that gets

1711
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:22,480
transcribed and interpreted as a um

1712
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,119
effective or emotional self and then um

1713
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,880
at the top level we report and

1714
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,200
communicate that with the narrative self

1715
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,240
basically the self is there to serve as

1716
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,720
to to represent the source of endogenous

1717
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,960
signals arising from inside and to be

1718
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,920
the target of internal regulation

1719
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,160
and this uh this goes back and it craigs

1720
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,040
papers in the early

1721
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,040
thousands you know to put it this way

1722
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,640
that you know within the posterior

1723
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,559
insulin that does the basic bodily stuff

1724
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,119
you know heartbeat oxygenation

1725
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,720
energy depletion

1726
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,200
and then those representations of basic

1727
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,040
body state get progressively and

1728
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,319
progressively remapped at higher levels

1729
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,880
exploiting uh more more higher and a

1730
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,960
modal cognitive processes until we get

1731
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,040
to the anterior insula

1732
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,799
the anterior insulin has to communicate

1733
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,720
with these other systems of perception

1734
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,799
memory inference imagination

1735
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,280
to tell you the experience to tell you

1736
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,079
what to tell you sorry what the uh

1737
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,599
the meaning or the significance of all

1738
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,680
these bodily changes is and should these

1739
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,400
bodily changes are they adaptive in this

1740
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,480
situation i'm running my bike uphill

1741
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,720
high heartbeat fine

1742
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,240
my heart's racing when i'm when i'm

1743
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,000
having a conversation with my wife this

1744
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,040
is bad

1745
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,559
this is kind of anxiety um and so forth

1746
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,640
okay i can skip that this is just you

1747
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,200
know to say that the anterior and

1748
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,040
posterior insula

1749
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,000
you know

1750
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,839
they are hubs they are not a place where

1751
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,599
this they are not the kind of there's

1752
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,680
not like a self module a bodily self

1753
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,559
module in a effective soft module it's

1754
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,480
more that they are kind of integrative

1755
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,520
hubs

1756
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,520
that basically direct traffic is a good

1757
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,359
way to put on or another way to think of

1758
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,799
it is they're like the read write head

1759
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,960
on a um on a turing machine right

1760
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,520
they're coordinating and doing stuff

1761
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,200
they're integrating stuff across them

1762
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,319
across the brain to this particular task

1763
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,480
all right and and they communicate with

1764
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,680
other hubs

1765
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,079
prefrontal and amygdala which are very

1766
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,160
important for collecting information for

1767
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,400
the evaluation you know the prefrontal

1768
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,480
cortex more about collecting information

1769
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,480
for at the country it's a conceptual

1770
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,280
level

1771
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,960
you know thinking about

1772
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,599
you know is my have i have i offended

1773
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,280
someone is that why they are you know is

1774
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,799
that why they're angry or ignoring with

1775
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,440
me is that because of that kind of thing

1776
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,040
whereas the amygdala is more like

1777
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,119
coordinating information about basic

1778
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,720
perceptually driven stuff you know

1779
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,640
someone raises their voice or puts on an

1780
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,559
angry expression and within a couple of

1781
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,119
hundred milliseconds i feel a response

1782
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,480
to that so

1783
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,599
all right so so where are we

1784
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,839
to summarize right these are just a

1785
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,599
couple of quotations about the the

1786
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,039
insula from various things

1787
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,480
let's just read one right the

1788
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,160
convergence of multimodal sensory

1789
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,000
information and ability to read out

1790
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,160
subjective states explains why the

1791
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,839
insular is intimately involved in

1792
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,920
effective processing correct

1793
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,079
okay it's functionally important for

1794
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,000
depicting saline information and

1795
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,920
interfacing between physiology and

1796
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,079
higher order cognitive systems and

1797
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,760
that's why it is so functionally

1798
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,039
ubiquitous

1799
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,640
and connected with so many things to

1800
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,039
form a salience detection network it

1801
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,079
allows us to feel how things matter

1802
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,160
okay but don't within the predictive

1803
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,680
processing in active inference it's not

1804
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,160
just that you feel salience salience

1805
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,440
means

1806
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,200
salient to me

1807
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,960
relevant to the organism and its

1808
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,160
prospects

1809
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,640
i just something can't be salient

1810
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,440
unless it's relevant to a goal

1811
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,079
really relevant to a goal of survival or

1812
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:51,520
salient to a goal of you know

1813
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,280
maintaining social relationships or

1814
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,240
achieving

1815
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,920
um some ambition

1816
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,240
so salience is not something in itself

1817
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,400
salience is relative to particular goals

1818
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,559
of organisming survival or organisming

1819
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,039
prospering at various levels

1820
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,520
and in order to do that the mind needs

1821
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,440
to model itself as the bearer of the

1822
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,839
goals as the thing is

1823
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,680
prospering or not is affected by its

1824
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,200
actions

1825
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,599
now here's the thought that

1826
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,440
is ethic if you have just like you have

1827
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,079
bodily states like interception

1828
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,400
you have affective states like anxiety

1829
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,160
or depression

1830
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,599
and what they what those states do is

1831
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,839
they tell you how you're prospering they

1832
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,520
tell you how you're prospering bodily

1833
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,680
and they tell you how you're prospering

1834
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,880
emotionally

1835
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,039
which is great and the good thing about

1836
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,559
that is

1837
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,200
then you can act right you can perform

1838
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,280
your active inference of foraging in the

1839
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,599
world for solutions of moving around and

1840
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,599
sampling sensations and trying out

1841
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,760
activities and so forth all these kind

1842
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,400
of ways of engaging with the world that

1843
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,559
is going to optimize you know your

1844
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,480
ability to build a model of yourself as

1845
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,480
a functioning system

1846
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,960
but you don't actually have to um

1847
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,319
fine-tune

1848
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:05,920
all the kind of the mechanisms and

1849
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,520
low-level systems

1850
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,920
and that's good because we can't right

1851
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,400
so if you think about fatigue i cannot

1852
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,160
go in and change the metabolism of all

1853
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,400
my cells i can't go in and you know

1854
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,160
change adenosine levels and i can't

1855
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,240
change the balance of serotonin and

1856
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,480
acetylcholine across my brain

1857
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,319
but i can go to sleep

1858
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,520
so i manage the feeling of exhaustion

1859
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,200
and then i wake up feeling better having

1860
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,319
optimized my um optimize my organism

1861
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,240
i optimized my organism by managed my

1862
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,359
feelings

1863
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:37,839
and similarly at a sort of higher level

1864
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:40,160
of the emotional functioning i optimize

1865
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,520
my organism

1866
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,480
by managing effective or emotional

1867
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,960
feelings so you know if i feel sad i

1868
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,000
withdraw from life and and

1869
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,799
avoid the context that make me sad

1870
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,720
if i feel happy then i'll keep doing

1871
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,680
what i'm doing you know if i feel amused

1872
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,200
or interested or engaged then that'll

1873
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,960
lead me to kind of pursue and keep

1874
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,039
performing the actions that are

1875
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,680
rewarding and so on and so on

1876
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,799
and so life then becomes a matter of

1877
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,440
acting to regulate affect

1878
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,240
by active inference as a proxy

1879
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,920
for minimizing predictive error or in

1880
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,960
other words optimizing organism function

1881
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,720
across the

1882
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,520
function of the organism so

1883
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,280
in other words and the self here is the

1884
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,200
thing if the self is modeled as the

1885
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,520
thing which sustains these feelings and

1886
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,039
the thing whose feelings can be changed

1887
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,000
by active inference or action

1888
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,079
then that's the role of the self the

1889
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,880
role of the self is to be the entity

1890
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,359
okay that we can manipulate

1891
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,319
okay so in this sense

1892
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,558
um

1893
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,440
active inference

1894
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,079
is like a proxy for overall organismic

1895
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,839
regulation

1896
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,359
okay so

1897
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,119
the self the feeling of being the

1898
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,039
feeling of being a unified persisting

1899
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,480
self

1900
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,079
allows us to get through the world by

1901
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,400
manipulating our feelings so the self

1902
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,280
model

1903
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,920
it's like the airplane icon on a control

1904
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,880
panel

1905
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,000
on a plane right so the pilot flies that

1906
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,880
boeing

1907
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,520
737 or 747 or whatever

1908
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,760
by manipulating the controls and you can

1909
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,160
see on his panel you know the little

1910
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,760
model of the plane

1911
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,760
banking or going up and down

1912
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,160
well that's great because the pilot has

1913
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,000
no access to the electronics the

1914
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,760
software the hydraulics and all the

1915
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,400
mechanisms right pilot can't impose not

1916
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,640
going to go back down to the tail and

1917
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,400
try and you know change the ailerons or

1918
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,839
anything like that and the pilot's not

1919
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:39,760
going to go in there and you know mess

1920
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,000
around with the software that of the

1921
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,680
computer that controls the system that's

1922
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,079
all delegated right that's the way down

1923
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,839
all the pilot has to do

1924
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,000
is manipulate the icon and that's all we

1925
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,039
have to do

1926
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,200
we have to just act to make ourselves

1927
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,480
feel better

1928
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,520
and the self is just the target

1929
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,720
of that regulatory actions i'll skip

1930
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,480
this now help because i think i must be

1931
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,480
finished i'm really running out of time

1932
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,440
so

1933
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,839
to sum up for our case of the uh the

1934
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,480
kotar delusion and these other things

1935
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,960
well in the cotard delusion what happens

1936
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,640
is you have a version of what these

1937
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,559
theorists step on and they'll call

1938
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,799
catastrophic dysregulation

1939
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,119
so in the case of ndmr

1940
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,520
and encephalitis right

1941
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,440
cellular metabolic function the whole

1942
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,640
thing is kind of

1943
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,640
out of whack because of this pervasive

1944
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,960
inflammation across the brain and so

1945
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,720
there can't be any kind of low-level

1946
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,880
signaling that's working and at the

1947
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,319
higher more representational levels

1948
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,319
you're not getting any kind of

1949
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,599
consistent

1950
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,760
on accurate representations when it's

1951
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,680
kind of converted into computational

1952
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,799
language

1953
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,000
so

1954
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,319
the the brain is disregulable the body

1955
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:53,599
is disregulable so the system learns the

1956
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,960
system learns

1957
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,760
that

1958
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,559
as a regulatory system as a target of

1959
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,319
regulation it doesn't exist

1960
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,440
of course it's

1961
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,119
that is that's just to say the self

1962
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,799
model disappears

1963
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,640
but you can still feel your body it's

1964
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,319
just that those bodily feelings aren't

1965
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,760
integrated as

1966
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,079
into a model of something that you can

1967
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,280
change

1968
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,759
and regulate and predict and anticipate

1969
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:19,679
okay so that's called profit

1970
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,799
dysregulation so

1971
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,040
about that my final slide has got a typo

1972
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,198
on it so i'll change that after this but

1973
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,880
just to remind you and i'll close off

1974
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,759
now because we've been going for too

1975
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,000
long but descartes famously said that

1976
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,080
it's like hunger and thirst they teach

1977
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,839
us that we're not present in our bodies

1978
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,000
as a sailor in his ship

1979
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
but we are closely joined and

1980
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,080
intermingled with it so i compose a

1981
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,920
single thing with it with it you know

1982
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,080
with my body i am my body i feel like i

1983
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,279
am my body

1984
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,198
we might say within predictive process

1985
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:53,520
that the experience of being the subject

1986
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,120
of interreceptive and effective

1987
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,479
experiences

1988
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,560
produces the feeling

1989
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,000
the inference that those experiences

1990
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,880
belong to a simple unified thing

1991
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,960
and the more that i succeed in

1992
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,960
controlling myself by regulating my

1993
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,799
experiences my interceptive and

1994
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,520
effective experiences the more i learn

1995
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,520
that i am that thing you know when i eat

1996
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,198
i'm satiated when i achieve a goal i'm

1997
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:17,920
happy and i'm worried and i i resolve my

1998
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,880
worries

1999
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,679
but states of intractable dyshomeostasis

2000
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,920
teach us the reverse

2001
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,158
in severe cases like in the ammonium

2002
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:28,158
encephalitis the mind

2003
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,399
has to end up learns that there's no

2004
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,640
viable regulatory target

2005
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,319
because experience is chaotic and

2006
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,640
unpredictable so if you can't keep

2007
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,600
entropy at bay

2008
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,839
back now

2009
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,520
and keep entropy at bay at the most

2010
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,198
basic level

2011
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:47,279
by having a kind of model that works

2012
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,399
then your biological functioning is

2013
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,000
messed up and you've got no

2014
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,560
physiological control all the signaling

2015
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,320
goes to pieces you can't minimize

2016
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,480
variational free energy and that is

2017
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,239
at the representational level the cell

2018
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,120
model disintegrates there's no kind of

2019
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,199
self model that predictably

2020
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,840
enables you to regulate yourself and

2021
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,280
you're just left with this kind of

2022
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,040
chaotic experience in the cotard

2023
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,440
delusion which you report with the kind

2024
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,120
of the shadow

2025
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,120
that's all you've got left is you know

2026
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,360
linguistic functioning

2027
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:19,630
um

2028
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:22,400
[Music]

2029
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,480
you've just got linguistic functioning

2030
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,760
rooks

2031
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,400
okay you've just got the reporting

2032
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,880
talking

2033
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,480
so that one cotard patient famously said

2034
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,360
ah

2035
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,520
i'm just a voice and if that goes i

2036
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,199
won't be anything

2037
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,960
if my voice goes i'll be lost and i

2038
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,040
won't know where i've gone so

2039
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,040
the patients this is the patient's only

2040
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,520
response to this intractable sense of

2041
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,239
bodily effective entropy the linguistic

2042
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,239
shadow the narrative eye

2043
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,320
completely disconnected from the

2044
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,679
structure of bodily ineffective

2045
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,000
experiences that normally anchor it

2046
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,840
because the small model has fallen to

2047
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,080
pieces and

2048
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,679
i should stop there because i've been

2049
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,040
going for a long time

2050
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,280
thank you you can

2051
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,440
share the screen and we can

2052
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,280
talk a little bit it's just as long as

2053
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,600
you'd like

2054
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,600
yeah sure same button as to share and

2055
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,280
then you can

2056
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,519
cool

2057
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,199
i wrote down a ton of stuff there were

2058
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,960
some questions in the chat so thanks for

2059
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,840
the awesome talk

2060
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,840
i'll start with one of dave's questions

2061
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,920
so dave had written

2062
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,400
does your evolutionary and neurological

2063
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,040
exploration of delusion especially of

2064
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,840
the pathologies of the prefrontal cortex

2065
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,520
functional connectivity

2066
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,679
preclude the validity of psychological

2067
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:44,719
approaches

2068
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,920
or how do psychological and psychosocial

2069
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,840
approaches benefit from a corp

2070
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,679
incorporating these kinds of methods and

2071
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,080
findings

2072
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,760
well that's a very good question i i

2073
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,000
don't think they preclude at all right i

2074
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,520
think they're i think they're vital to

2075
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,440
your psychological approach i mean i

2076
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,440
didn't i did write a it's a chapter in a

2077
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,880
book i wrote a while

2078
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,040
about this but

2079
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,360
i don't there's a bad tendency in

2080
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,440
psychiatry in the world to think okay

2081
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,040
you've got psychological approaches

2082
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,239
you've got people's thoughts their

2083
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,159
experiences and feelings and then you

2084
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:17,040
have

2085
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,320
the kind of things that biological

2086
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,719
psychiatry does you know molecular level

2087
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,320
interventions with receptors and

2088
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,040
serotonin and that they never they never

2089
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,560
talk to each other right and so you have

2090
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,440
a disease model of mental illness

2091
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,120
and you have a psychosocial model of

2092
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,520
mental illness you know this

2093
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,520
but clearly that's wrong right

2094
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,520
and it's got to be wrong because if you

2095
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,920
think of um think of a just an example

2096
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,920
like astigmatism

2097
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,920
or uh you know macular degeneration

2098
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,000
that's something that you experience at

2099
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,560
a personal and experiential level as you

2100
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,480
know loss off part of your visual field

2101
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,080
if you've got a black spot in your

2102
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,080
visual field that affects how you

2103
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,760
experience the world how you get around

2104
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,080
it how you interact with other people

2105
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,480
and there's a mechanical explanation

2106
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,480
there which is in terms of

2107
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,679
you know um

2108
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,159
the visual visual cortex or the retina

2109
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,159
or whatever and the capillaries and all

2110
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:11,360
that in the

2111
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,320
okay

2112
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,120
well why why would it be the case

2113
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,040
and if someone said to you oh well look

2114
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,239
you know we could only have um

2115
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,800
like a personal level an experiential

2116
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,199
phenomenological account of

2117
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,159
uh of visual experience

2118
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,000
you'd say that was mad

2119
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,520
it's oh i want to go to the eye

2120
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,280
specialist and he knows all about you

2121
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,360
know how diabetes produces this thing

2122
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,199
because we have a mechanical thing but

2123
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,640
not only that

2124
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,040
the mechanical explanation

2125
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,280
depends on a computational explanation

2126
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,199
of how vision works

2127
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,360
these cells in the retina get bombarded

2128
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,719
by photons

2129
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:49,679
they

2130
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,040
regret and the mind progressively

2131
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,640
reconstructs

2132
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,440
um an image of the image of the causes

2133
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,960
of that bombardment and that's our

2134
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,719
visual experience

2135
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:00,239
so i can tell you why macular

2136
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,480
degeneration you know at any level at

2137
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,480
the level of the retina or visual cortex

2138
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,560
it's going to affect your experience

2139
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,480
and we think that's all in order and we

2140
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,440
think that's exactly the way to do it

2141
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,880
why wouldn't we think of that for the

2142
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,199
kotar delusion or for um

2143
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:19,840
or or for uh you know any psychiatric

2144
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,000
disorder anxiety or whatever it's not

2145
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,800
that

2146
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,320
you've got this kind of

2147
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,880
autonomous level of um

2148
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,880
autonomous level of uh you know

2149
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,040
molecular level interventions and then

2150
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,800
you've got some phenomenological level

2151
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,800
of experience and thinking

2152
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,960
i mean one depends on the one depends on

2153
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,080
the other

2154
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,239
i just think that's like that

2155
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,920
yeah so so in my view

2156
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,400
the right what we're trying to do is

2157
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,920
is try and understand what's happening

2158
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,239
in the intervening level and that's what

2159
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,239
theories of visual processing do you

2160
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,239
know are you got artificial theories and

2161
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,320
you've got neurological theories and

2162
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,480
they come together and that's what the

2163
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,800
active inference self-modeling theory is

2164
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,280
supposed to do in these cases of

2165
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,600
pathologies of self-awareness you have a

2166
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,360
kind of experience of yourself has

2167
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,719
changed

2168
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,560
and we know that that's because

2169
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,920
something is happening in your body and

2170
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,760
brain

2171
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,440
how are we supposed to explain that and

2172
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,880
not just correlate the change in

2173
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,480
experience with the

2174
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,159
low level cause

2175
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:19,760
we want to say that's because these

2176
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,080
changes in your body and brain are

2177
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,920
organized to do this information

2178
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,400
processing kind of computational

2179
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,480
representational functions

2180
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,360
and when you get these low-level changes

2181
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,440
they compromise this functioning

2182
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,239
this computational level working

2183
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,520
with the result that you have these

2184
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,679
experiences and it goes the other way

2185
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:40,960
you know when someone you get

2186
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,560
information from the world

2187
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,280
it has to filter all the way down

2188
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,440
by being represented processed somehow

2189
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,920
and you know we have to take a

2190
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,760
stand on the nature of the comp of the

2191
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,600
nature of the computation whether it's

2192
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,679
wide narrow symbolic

2193
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,080
neural network whatever you know that's

2194
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,560
ongoing project so that's my it's my

2195
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,640
thoughts on that topic

2196
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,440
thank you so the next question is from

2197
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,000
dean who wrote

2198
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,560
does this does the disassociation of

2199
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,679
feelings

2200
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,800
leave the person not able to make a plan

2201
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,640
because in some way their predictive

2202
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,280
model has been compromised so how do

2203
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,520
these people you know do they grasp

2204
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,120
objects appropriately could they get

2205
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,159
across town on the bus what level

2206
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,320
or in what ways is their action

2207
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,440
prediction

2208
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,560
changed

2209
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,120
but yeah well i think you know i i think

2210
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,960
people who are very effectively

2211
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,760
flattened right and depersonalized

2212
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,679
uh i think planning is an issue planning

2213
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,199
is an issue for them

2214
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:44,320
um precisely because you know

2215
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,159
of the idea that you know if you're

2216
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,159
trying to decide where to go for

2217
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,800
holidays or whether to get married or

2218
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,880
whether to quit your job

2219
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,960
it's not just a sort of cold cognitive

2220
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,640
process of weighing the costs and

2221
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,400
benefits

2222
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,719
those things have to be felt

2223
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,880
right you know if you decide or am i

2224
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,320
going to go to hawaii where it's warm

2225
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,520
and pleasant or am i going to go to

2226
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,560
alaska and just get well how those

2227
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,640
you mentally rehearse those options

2228
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,320
and how that makes you feel determines

2229
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,840
the decision you know and if you decide

2230
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,120
to get divorced or get married um

2231
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,199
it's not just oh yeah you know if i get

2232
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,400
married this and this and this will

2233
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,159
happen and if i get divorced the

2234
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:23,679
likelihood of this it's more like that

2235
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,920
makes you feel a certain way

2236
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,960
so if your life becomes effectively

2237
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,679
flattened so that

2238
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,679
perception and cognition of all the

2239
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,280
various

2240
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,960
options for action

2241
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,520
are now effectively neutral

2242
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,159
it does make it very hard to uh to plan

2243
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,080
and engage and and in the end i think

2244
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,199
what you find in depersonalization is

2245
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,560
people just kind of go through the

2246
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,440
motions with their habitual actions

2247
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,679
you know so if you're a bus driver or a

2248
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,840
university lecturer or a husband and

2249
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,800
parent

2250
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,679
then but you feel depersonalized then

2251
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,199
you just you keep doing what you're

2252
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,239
doing

2253
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,080
but you feel like uh

2254
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,679
just the empty shell going through the

2255
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:08,080
motions but those people had a lot of

2256
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,679
difficulty

2257
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:12,159
coming up with the coherence

2258
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,400
alternative plan it's like why don't you

2259
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,880
do something else why don't you you know

2260
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,640
but but we see this actually you know

2261
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,560
even in um

2262
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,320
in everyday cases of life you know you

2263
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,679
might know that it would be good if you

2264
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,360
took up exercise

2265
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,760
but it would be you know as a objective

2266
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,040
piece of knowledge

2267
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,719
it would be great if i took up you know

2268
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,280
bike riding or if i went on a diet or if

2269
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,679
i you know whatever if i moved to cities

2270
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:36,960
but

2271
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,560
but you just know that as a kind of you

2272
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,480
know piece of information

2273
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,560
it won't make you do it

2274
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,640
unless that somehow can click into your

2275
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,640
affective self-model it's like yeah it's

2276
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,560
me

2277
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,760
i can kind of imagine myself as you know

2278
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,600
whatever it is riding up a hill walking

2279
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,640
up a you know having some future that i

2280
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,960
can actually inhabit

2281
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,960
not just intellectually but also

2282
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,760
emotionally and personally

2283
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,760
well just one thought on that and then

2284
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,679
i'll read a question from dave is like

2285
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,600
in a way society

2286
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,679
is a big top down like in active

2287
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,199
inference we talk a lot about nested

2288
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,040
systems and you focused on sort of the

2289
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,000
level of bodily integrity and brain body

2290
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,400
but in a sense the social

2291
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,440
structure our niche scaffolds our

2292
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,199
behavior whether it's hey it doesn't

2293
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:26,960
matter if you don't like broccoli you're

2294
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,280
gonna put that fork in your mouth

2295
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,920
or whether it's some other type of

2296
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,199
decision

2297
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:35,280
there are top down priors that actually

2298
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,400
structure

2299
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,640
our decision making and planning

2300
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,880
in the absence of precision or of

2301
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,560
a good way to plan

2302
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,719
so just really interesting there

2303
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,159
i think that's exactly right and you

2304
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,520
know um

2305
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,840
i think this is really your point

2306
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,560
exactly applies really really well to

2307
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,600
addiction

2308
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,280
there's a woman called hannah pickard

2309
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,679
who writes extensively on addiction and

2310
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:01,760
what she points out is that

2311
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,159
an addict can know that if they stop

2312
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,840
taking drugs it would be better for them

2313
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,239
but so what you know what they need to

2314
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,400
be able to do is project themselves into

2315
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,320
the non-addicted future where they're

2316
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,920
living engaging in the world and they're

2317
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,920
getting positive feedback from the world

2318
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:16,840
but she

2319
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,440
says to pick up your point

2320
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,960
that's very hard to have a model of

2321
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,800
yourself like that

2322
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
without social scaffolding without

2323
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,000
social structure without a kind of um

2324
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,600
positive or without a kind of positive

2325
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,800
feedback

2326
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,800
and structure from a world around you so

2327
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,360
the thought is the the self that you are

2328
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,679
is is as you say your priors your

2329
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,040
predictions

2330
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,040
they're not just about internal modeling

2331
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,639
they're also about the price

2332
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,400
expectations

2333
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,920
and plans that and plans and

2334
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,760
reinforcement that you get from being

2335
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,960
immersed

2336
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,040
in a sort of social media and for

2337
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,800
addicts that's not there

2338
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,639
they can't imagine they have no model of

2339
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,080
themselves as functioning in an

2340
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,400
alternative social media so when they

2341
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,360
get out of jail or get out of rehab

2342
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,960
unfortunately they get back in their old

2343
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,480
social media

2344
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,480
they're familiar triggering situations

2345
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,800
in the familiar social environment

2346
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,239
and that kind of activates their

2347
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,400
self-model as someone who

2348
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,400
who does this does that

2349
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,560
and there's and and she says when you

2350
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,719
ask them to reflect on

2351
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,639
what it's like as a non-addict imagine

2352
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:22,639
they can't

2353
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,800
so there's a kind she said it induces in

2354
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,199
them a kind of existential terror

2355
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,760
because um they really

2356
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,719
can't

2357
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,320
imagine themselves

2358
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,760
as a non

2359
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,520
non-addicted life it's kind of it's an

2360
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,120
empty future for them

2361
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,360
partly because she says there's no

2362
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,440
viable social scaffolding to support

2363
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,560
their

2364
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,400
their life in that world so your point

2365
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,440
is i think

2366
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,120
plays really well into that that

2367
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,800
literature

2368
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,560
and what you said there um what is it

2369
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,040
like to be you know in that case not

2370
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,440
addicted to a substance or a behavior

2371
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,159
it's kind of a subtle allusion to the

2372
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:00,080
famous philosophical tradition of what

2373
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,000
is it like to be a bat to be an ant

2374
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,760
colony et cetera

2375
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,320
and when you brought up i think even at

2376
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,320
the beginning you said what is it like

2377
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,400
to feel you don't exist

2378
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,280
that

2379
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,760
this idea of negative space

2380
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,920
and of negation came up in such

2381
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,840
interesting ways in the talk like if you

2382
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,199
ask somebody what does it feel like to

2383
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:22,000
exist it's like that's 99 of the

2384
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,400
discourse or you know that's the mystery

2385
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,280
but then by drawing our attention well

2386
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,920
what would it feel like counter factual

2387
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,360
importance for active inference what

2388
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,360
would it feel like to not exist as like

2389
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,840
i know i'm not feeling that so what is

2390
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,760
that one and then what's the other side

2391
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,280
of the coin of feeling like i don't

2392
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,360
exist it's like it's like feeling like i

2393
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,520
am in control like i am steering the

2394
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,840
ship so that was so such a cool

2395
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,880
connection

2396
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,639
that's that yeah i think that's the

2397
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,639
point i wanted i wanted to to get at you

2398
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,080
know what why i like the active

2399
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,199
inference framework for this is because

2400
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:57,199
the feeling of being me

2401
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:58,880
you know a lot of people tell you oh

2402
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,040
well if you have a perceptual experience

2403
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,120
then someone's having it you know

2404
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:03,840
an

2405
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,080
experience has to have an experience or

2406
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,360
something like that

2407
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,280
or how can you not feel like you're me

2408
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,800
if you have a body you can see your body

2409
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,800
touch your body and feel it but that's

2410
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,040
not what we're talking about the feeling

2411
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,480
of being me

2412
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,360
is the feeling of being in charge

2413
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,840
the feeling of being the thing

2414
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,600
that i can manipulate

2415
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,440
in order to bring about all these

2416
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,040
experiences

2417
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,080
right and you can still have experiences

2418
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,480
right because plenty of experiences

2419
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,719
but if you lose the feeling that those

2420
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,280
experiences are things that you can

2421
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,600
change and manipulate dependent on your

2422
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,120
intentions

2423
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,560
then you lose the experience of being

2424
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,560
you and that's at a high level but the

2425
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,159
same thing imagine the thing going right

2426
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,159
down you know really low your your

2427
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,159
hypothalamus is sending signals to raise

2428
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,679
your heartbeat and not getting any

2429
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,280
feedback

2430
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,040
your heartbeat stays low stays

2431
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,719
obstinately low

2432
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:59,679
or obstinately high it's the same thing

2433
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,760
i'm not i'm not getting any traction

2434
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,560
here

2435
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,239
obviously a hypothalamus doesn't think

2436
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,199
that but

2437
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,320
you know

2438
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,080
or you know imagine a bacterium that's

2439
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,239
trying to contract its membranes to to

2440
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,280
turn

2441
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,679
left to pursue a sugar gradient and

2442
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:14,840
nothing's

2443
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,880
happening it's getting keeping getting

2444
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,960
this kind of obstinate feeling that i'm

2445
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,800
not in charge anymore

2446
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,639
and i've got no model that i've got no

2447
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:26,639
model on myself that's working to

2448
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,239
to to give me the feeling of being me

2449
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:29,520
and that's

2450
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,679
in such a case the system still has

2451
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,560
sensory experience sort of activity at

2452
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,480
its receptors and stuff is happening but

2453
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,719
it's just not

2454
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,600
a regulatory target anymore

2455
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,920
and and that makes me think about um

2456
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,000
when you talked about the people who are

2457
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,840
suffering from pain but they're

2458
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,679
disassociated from it it feels like it's

2459
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,040
not their pain

2460
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,880
it's a little word play so it's not a

2461
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,520
philosophical argument but gnosis

2462
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,120
and nociception

2463
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,920
it's like there's the knowledge of pain

2464
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,639
but actually it's almost separable

2465
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,880
from the suffering

2466
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,239
and so this is an extreme case where the

2467
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:11,679
gnosis of nociception has been entirely

2468
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,360
separated from the narrative of the self

2469
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,679
it's like yeah there is pain in the arm

2470
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:17,360
but that's not me or it's not part of my

2471
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,280
narrative and so it doesn't bother the

2472
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,360
person psychologically

2473
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:22,960
that's exactly right

2474
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,280
there's damage there's damage to the

2475
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,960
body that i inhabit

2476
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,199
is that's what the brain is saying

2477
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,840
by this body that i live in is damaged

2478
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,120
but it's not my damage

2479
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,000
now do they ever ask who's is it or does

2480
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
it just not seem to be like oh it's just

2481
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,760
like oh someone's car someone's parked

2482
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,360
outside or is it like i'm kidding

2483
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,719
no no um

2484
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,239
the really interesting thing i mean the

2485
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,159
early cases the really interesting thing

2486
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:53,120
about um symbolics is that you know

2487
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,760
they don't take any uh action to avoid

2488
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,000
pain

2489
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,760
you know so that in in that sense you

2490
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,920
know that's really bad and so but it's

2491
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,239
it's not quite the same as um congenital

2492
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:06,159
insensitivity to pain which is a problem

2493
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,080
with the receptor level right those

2494
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,080
people don't detect pain

2495
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,520
and so um

2496
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,960
you know they're in a bad way they put

2497
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,040
their hand on a burning stove they um

2498
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,800
break their legs and they don't they

2499
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,320
just don't feel they don't even have the

2500
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,840
bodily sensation

2501
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,239
but pain asymbolics they have the bodily

2502
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:23,440
sensation

2503
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,719
but they don't

2504
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,719
annex it to themselves

2505
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,280
well it points to different um roles for

2506
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,280
different receptors so i want to ask

2507
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,760
about the nmda receptor which you kind

2508
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,679
of brought up in the beginning what does

2509
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,000
the nmda receptor do

2510
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,080
neurologically or why is it associated

2511
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,159
with that phenotype

2512
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:44,800
right well now you're um now you're now

2513
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,040
now you know now i'm up now i'm out of

2514
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,960
my league um

2515
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,920
but uh it i think that that kind of

2516
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,600
encephalitis is a um inflammatory thing

2517
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,159
right it's an inflammatory uh response

2518
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,199
and so

2519
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,199
when it hits those receptors i i think

2520
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,440
it's just because uh ndma is like it's

2521
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,000
so widespread throughout the brain

2522
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,080
i think it's like uh

2523
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,760
i'm talking out of turn here right so

2524
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,080
it's not it's not my my field so cancel

2525
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,520
this but

2526
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,600
i think it's like like a like a catalyst

2527
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,600
or modulator for so many metabolic

2528
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,960
functions

2529
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,719
right it's involved in everything as a

2530
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,480
kind of very fundamental thing so when

2531
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,159
you mess with it

2532
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,840
you pretty much

2533
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,199
you that's why you get this kind of

2534
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:28,960
catastrophic

2535
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,960
dysregulation across the brain

2536
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,040
ah yeah that's that's the thought it's

2537
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:38,400
one of these it's like um

2538
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,239
adenosine or something like that you

2539
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,719
know that these uh metabolism depends on

2540
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:44,880
that and if you mess that up or uh

2541
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,560
what's another one uh

2542
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,400
the ketones

2543
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,960
you know if you if you get a buildup of

2544
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,520
uh phenylketone in the brain

2545
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,360
you know it's this tiny chemical but if

2546
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,280
you tiny levels of this chemical can

2547
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,440
just destroy everything produce mental

2548
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,320
retardation mutism

2549
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,960
motor disorders it's a catastrophe

2550
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,440
an absolute catastrophe because

2551
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:08,320
you know

2552
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,159
the cellular level functioning is so

2553
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,199
dependent on these nano nano level

2554
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:16,800
adjustments of these basic things

2555
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,679
that

2556
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:19,520
speaks to two dimensions of the

2557
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,120
challenge which is the multi-scale

2558
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,560
systems there's little things like

2559
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,360
molecules and big things like people and

2560
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,920
then also the trans disciplinarity and

2561
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,000
it's like we should have one story for

2562
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,480
one level from one discipline and then a

2563
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,280
separate discipline and a separate story

2564
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,199
we need something like an integrated

2565
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:40,719
approach what's that going to be

2566
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,480
that's exactly right and so where i

2567
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,320
suppose where i came into this when i

2568
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,400
was you know when i got into philosophy

2569
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,320
and people thought well that what's the

2570
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,000
integrative story going to be well you

2571
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,159
know some kind of computational story

2572
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,040
you know

2573
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,199
top-down classical computational

2574
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,360
modeling cpu

2575
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,360
modular inputs modular outputs that's

2576
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,920
one way it's a kind of broad brush

2577
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,239
approach then you have neural network

2578
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,000
stories

2579
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,679
and then you have you know deep learning

2580
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:08,719
stories and all these different

2581
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,280
architectures and now you have and they

2582
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,120
have active inference

2583
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:16,239
and it depends what you think uh active

2584
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:18,639
inference is gonna um how it's gonna

2585
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:20,480
play out i mean if if you think of

2586
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,440
active inference as

2587
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,520
you know at the biophysical level it

2588
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,800
sounds right but it's very abstract

2589
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,760
right it treats like a human organism as

2590
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,960
like a physical system in space

2591
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,280
it's like a self-organizing asteroid or

2592
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,280
something like that is really

2593
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:43,440
the same the same laws of physics apply

2594
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,159
and then you have the kind of bayesian

2595
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,280
implementations of

2596
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,960
active inference

2597
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,120
it's an interesting question you know

2598
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,040
whether you think the brain is actually

2599
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,159
um

2600
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,560
bayesian

2601
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,639
you know because a lot of psychologists

2602
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:02,239
will tell you that

2603
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,800
the brain departs from bayesian optimal

2604
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,600
reasoning almost everywhere in almost

2605
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,320
all and almost always you know

2606
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,799
so yeah

2607
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,480
very interesting and welcome back dave

2608
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:20,560
so um one of the questions from dave um

2609
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,560
was have you looked at functional

2610
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,000
delusions

2611
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,800
socialized as in mobs or depth

2612
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,360
psychological

2613
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,920
no no i'm just i'm still on the um

2614
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,440
i'm still on the

2615
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,000
standard curriculum of um

2616
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,320
delusions of misidentification cotard

2617
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,239
delusions schizophrenic schizophrenic

2618
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:42,480
delusions i haven't talked about maths

2619
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,320
psychology and depth psychology i had

2620
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,000
some thoughts but

2621
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,080
i mean clearly like self-modeling

2622
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,040
applies right uh if you're talking about

2623
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,840
how ideas proper propagate

2624
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,159
in populations

2625
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,400
then i guess you could say

2626
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,639
those those ideas which are most

2627
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,679
consistent with a self model

2628
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:06,320
they're going to be more easily absorbed

2629
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,760
and

2630
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,440
stable stabilized you know within the

2631
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,639
individual

2632
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,080
so it's going to be very hard to get

2633
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,880
traction for an idea or an ideology that

2634
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,840
doesn't fit with a self model and

2635
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,440
probably

2636
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,280
self models are

2637
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,480
since they're constructed to

2638
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,800
regulate affective states

2639
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,639
that tells you that the ideas which

2640
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:31,040
propagate and stabilize are going to be

2641
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,040
those which

2642
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,520
get traction with people's um

2643
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,199
effective

2644
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:39,280
self-model you know what that make them

2645
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,040
feel a certain way

2646
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,840
rather than a kind of abstract

2647
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,880
intellectual argument you're not going

2648
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,199
to persuade an anti-vaxxer

2649
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:50,000
by giving them statistics

2650
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,280
and you're not going to get a kind of

2651
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,760
propagation of a wave of um something

2652
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,480
across social media on the basis of

2653
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:59,199
you know an irrational inference

2654
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,120
but but that's i don't have anything

2655
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,600
super much to say about that

2656
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,560
very true that we see sharing and

2657
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,719
activation patterns

2658
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:11,440
in the sort of global brain based upon

2659
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,360
affect not veracity or accuracy or

2660
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,199
any other feature

2661
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,199
um and and maybe that speaks to another

2662
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,520
one of dave's questions which was

2663
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,679
how does your work illuminate the notion

2664
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:26,560
of cognitive dissonance or consonants

2665
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,960
even in his technical work leon

2666
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,199
festenger seems not to succeed in

2667
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,800
building a credible dynamics of

2668
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,360
compatibility and incompatibility among

2669
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:36,800
psychic atoms

2670
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,199
relevant passages of gregory bateson's

2671
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,760
essays in steps towards an ecology of

2672
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,560
mind seems similarly limited so whether

2673
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,719
or not you've read those specific texts

2674
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:48,159
like i haven't read those specific

2675
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,400
things i suppose one way of thinking of

2676
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:51,679
it is

2677
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,520
within the kind of active inference or

2678
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,679
within the um

2679
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,440
predictive processing framework is you

2680
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,360
know if you get some discrepant

2681
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,960
information

2682
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,400
that uh

2683
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,920
contradicts yours contradicts a

2684
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,520
self-model or contradicts a predictive

2685
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,760
model you have you know some choices

2686
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,520
you can revise the model

2687
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,360
that's you know perceptual inference as

2688
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,400
they say

2689
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,239
or you can explore the world and try and

2690
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:15,760
get some you get some further

2691
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,320
information to confirm your model you

2692
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,840
that's that seems to be the active

2693
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,080
inference approach and obviously life is

2694
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,840
a balance right life is a balance

2695
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,280
between the two

2696
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,639
keep your model or get some more

2697
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:27,760
information

2698
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,679
but it seems like if you if we take the

2699
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,239
scientific uh

2700
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,400
analogy of you know hypothetical

2701
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,600
inference

2702
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,760
often what people do with discrepant

2703
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,679
inference in sorry discrepant

2704
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,600
information is just compartmentalize it

2705
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,239
you know they just put it away

2706
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,480
and scientists of science you know known

2707
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,000
through it no one throws out a good

2708
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,239
scientific theory just because of some

2709
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,600
discrepant

2710
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,120
evidence

2711
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,880
even if that can't be reconciled you

2712
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,480
know right now no one's chucking out the

2713
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,239
theory of evolution because someone came

2714
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,639
up with a wacky organism or a wacky

2715
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,639
function you know it's like hmm there

2716
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:08,000
must have got to be some explanation i

2717
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,679
don't know what it is but let's just

2718
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:11,600
we'll just keep doing our thing

2719
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,760
and hope that eventually it'll be

2720
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,280
realized you know so i don't think

2721
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,800
people

2722
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,639
these ideas of kind of um

2723
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:23,280
updating or upgrading hypotheses in the

2724
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,280
face of flux of new information that's

2725
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,960
actually not true because we can't be

2726
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,320
that sensitive

2727
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:31,360
to information that would be mad

2728
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,480
right

2729
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,280
so

2730
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,960
and i guess if you have a certain self

2731
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,320
model that's getting around the world

2732
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,760
and functioning

2733
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,040
you know if you're a religion if you're

2734
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,800
a highly religious person or something

2735
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,000
like that and you live in a religious

2736
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,400
community and you go to college and you

2737
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,440
know

2738
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,440
read dawkins or something like that

2739
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,440
well i mean you have a choice you can

2740
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,880
throw out your whole self model in your

2741
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,719
whole worldview

2742
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,199
or you might just think like many

2743
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,600
surgeons scientists

2744
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,440
and otherwise rational people okay this

2745
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,960
is my life

2746
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,360
in the hospital where i'm a

2747
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,119
neuroscientist or whatever

2748
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:06,880
and this is my life at home where i'm a

2749
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,560
preacher and a

2750
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,639
patient family patriarch of a religious

2751
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:12,080
community

2752
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,119
um

2753
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:15,840
because complete consistency across all

2754
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,480
the levels and all the functions

2755
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,679
is

2756
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:21,920
too much but i would say because it

2757
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,159
threatens a kind of self-model it's not

2758
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:26,239
because it's um

2759
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:26,960
you know that kind of

2760
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,280
compartmentalization is not so much a

2761
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,520
matter of intellectual consistency so

2762
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:32,639
much as

2763
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:35,760
consistency with the self model

2764
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,840
and very importantly that the self model

2765
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,080
includes the sensory evidence and that

2766
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,639
meta model so even though my background

2767
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,719
is in evolutionary biology

2768
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:47,119
very early i realized that

2769
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:48,960
people who believe in evolution people

2770
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,040
who believe in creation every other

2771
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,920
flavor look at a tree and see evidence

2772
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,840
for their world model so that's the

2773
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,080
starting point for the discussion not

2774
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,679
that you see the evidence but that

2775
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,440
everybody sees evidence confirming their

2776
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,600
worldview and that's a very different

2777
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,920
discussion than the dogmatists who might

2778
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,600
be on any side

2779
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,400
on the other side right and yeah and no

2780
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,760
one is going to come no one's going to

2781
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:12,960
come to the top no one's going to come

2782
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,040
to the topic with no model

2783
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,639
that's going to say put aside your

2784
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,159
preconceptions well there's no such

2785
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:19,840
thing right so

2786
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,320
uh yeah yes definitely and that is

2787
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,880
relevant for the uh cognitive bias and

2788
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,199
ai bias discussion

2789
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,040
in these future systems but we'll have

2790
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,280
an unbiased system

2791
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,840
what is that even going to mean

2792
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,360
yeah exactly and that is the you know

2793
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,280
the strength weakness of the bayesian

2794
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,960
thing isn't it because

2795
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,040
the bayesian idea is you know you start

2796
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,040
ab initio and then you get some evidence

2797
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,560
and you update your model you get some

2798
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,159
more evidence and you update your model

2799
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,400
and it's on but you've got to start from

2800
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,440
somewhere

2801
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,760
and so much of the action in bayesian

2802
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,679
theory is in the priors

2803
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:57,119
but there's no theory internal to base

2804
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:58,880
which will tell you where your prior

2805
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,719
assumptions about how much weight to

2806
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,480
give incoming evidence

2807
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,320
is going to come from

2808
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,119
it's a little bit more like blockchain

2809
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:09,440
with the way that we can make our priors

2810
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,560
explicit

2811
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,960
you don't step around this issue by

2812
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,199
using frequentist statistics or by

2813
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:17,679
casting tea leaves so at least we can

2814
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:19,360
have a discussion hey i use different

2815
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,360
priors i got a different answer versus

2816
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,280
we use radically different families of

2817
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,119
priors and hyper priors and we're

2818
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:28,159
converging on a similar action

2819
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:30,560
so maybe that speaks to at least this

2820
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,199
action being appropriate if not it being

2821
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,199
the ultimate yeah that's a that's a yeah

2822
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:36,480
that's a very good point it's not as

2823
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,560
though um yeah it's not as though anyone

2824
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,679
else

2825
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:41,520
has a solution

2826
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,320
to uh to where do we start from you know

2827
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,840
what what are our foundation what are

2828
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,800
our foundational assumptions um yeah so

2829
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,880
it's a bit rude to criticize

2830
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,360
uh bayesians for saying there's there

2831
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,000
has to be a lot of action in the prize

2832
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,280
right there has to be a lot of

2833
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,560
information in the prize to get the

2834
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,320
project off the ground

2835
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,600
um

2836
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,480
true

2837
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,080
but you know they're the same with

2838
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,080
anyone you know chops get chomp skins or

2839
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,119
anyone

2840
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,880
they just

2841
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:09,679
yeah

2842
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:11,280
exactly

2843
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,400
so one other um

2844
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,320
phrase or piece that came to mind was

2845
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,920
almost like parametric hysteresis

2846
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,400
the idea that although most sensory

2847
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,639
evidence is sort of just sloughed off

2848
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:26,480
kind of like teflon on our mind you look

2849
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,480
away it's just totally gone

2850
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,040
there are traumatic experiences and then

2851
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,360
on the other side there are um

2852
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,880
healing modalities whether it's a

2853
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,880
healing experience or a biochemical

2854
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,000
intervention

2855
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,080
there are sort of like

2856
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,000
there's interventions

2857
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,119
that

2858
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:44,880
restructure

2859
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,520
our models and we can think about that

2860
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,119
in active inference perspective so i

2861
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,360
just wondered like philosophically or

2862
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,040
from any view

2863
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,159
how do we think about these kinds of

2864
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:58,560
changing events whether kind of changing

2865
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,400
in a negative way like a trauma or in a

2866
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,320
positive way like healing

2867
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,920
how do we scaffold for that

2868
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,760
well that is actually a really good

2869
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,760
question because you know in this in the

2870
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:14,000
case of psychiatry it seems like um

2871
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,760
almost all therapies are equally good

2872
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,520
and equally bad

2873
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,600
like none of them really none of them

2874
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,360
really work in a way that we can kind of

2875
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,960
predict or explain there's only a

2876
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,800
statistical you know

2877
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,880
statistical correlations some people

2878
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,280
took cer antidepressants and you know

2879
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,800
certain proportion get better but then

2880
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,880
they relapse some people went to a

2881
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,840
therapist or cognitive cbt

2882
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,320
some get better some relapse you know so

2883
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,080
what kind of what kind of interventions

2884
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,520
work

2885
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,360
is really uh interesting and the kind of

2886
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,800
restructuring you know and that's the um

2887
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,400
that's part of the motivation i think

2888
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,040
for uh psychedelic uh approaches to

2889
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:54,080
psychiatry where it's like okay

2890
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,000
one thought might be look i can't we

2891
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,760
can't really have a successful

2892
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,159
intervention because that would require

2893
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:03,679
you to rebuild or remodel

2894
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:05,199
yourself it's not just changing your

2895
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:06,719
perception and changing your experience

2896
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,560
it's the way you incorporate that

2897
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,159
in your whole kind of regulatory

2898
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:12,639
framework how we're going to do that

2899
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,719
well maybe with 10 years of therapy and

2900
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:17,280
you know lots of um patient

2901
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,520
reconstruction or or sometimes a life

2902
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,280
changing event

2903
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:24,320
people give up drugs because you know

2904
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,679
for some reason

2905
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:27,280
it's a life-changing event or they just

2906
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,119
grow out of it people say

2907
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:31,199
but it's hard too

2908
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,600
hard to systematize that isn't it it was

2909
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,199
psychedelics what people are saying is

2910
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:38,800
well let's disrupt their self model

2911
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,719
let's kind of for a while let's

2912
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:43,040
introduce maximum entropy into the

2913
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,639
system again

2914
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:45,520
you know

2915
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,639
so that

2916
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:48,840
they experience life

2917
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,760
briefly hopefully safely

2918
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,560
uh

2919
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,719
with a lot of their self-model um

2920
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,040
disintegrated

2921
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,239
yep and so

2922
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:01,360
they get to see life for once unfiltered

2923
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,119
you know normally everything is filtered

2924
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,719
how does this matter to me in relation

2925
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:08,080
to me in relation to my history my plans

2926
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,520
you know the other people that matter to

2927
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,239
me

2928
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:11,679
all of life is you know just being

2929
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,080
filtered at every level like that

2930
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,560
and that's very hard to to experience

2931
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,360
life without that filter

2932
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:20,960
and

2933
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,840
psychedelics give you a um

2934
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,040
a brief

2935
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,840
immersive very destabilizing

2936
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,719
experience of life unfiltered

2937
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,719
and maybe from that can be a starting

2938
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:35,280
point for something that's good

2939
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,600
classic william blake doors of

2940
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,119
perception

2941
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:43,440
um idea and also the the rebus work by

2942
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,239
fristen and and carhartt harris as well

2943
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:49,119
as adam saffron and actually asking like

2944
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,840
maybe there's certain aspects that these

2945
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,520
neurochemical interventions they

2946
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,960
strengthen maybe it's not just this

2947
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,800
across-the-board weakening of our world

2948
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:59,040
model but there are certain levels of

2949
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,960
analysis in which things might be

2950
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,440
strengthened and right right

2951
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,040
on this note though of the the treatment

2952
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,040
and the recovery one of the very early

2953
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,119
slides i think it was mr a

2954
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:12,239
um was the patient and then um

2955
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,159
came in initially presenting some

2956
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:16,239
phenotypes and then there was plasma

2957
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:17,760
exchange

2958
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,320
and it said after a few plasma exchanges

2959
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,480
you know he had improved and then he's

2960
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:25,840
had this other um thing and so i thought

2961
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,119
um

2962
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:28,960
interesting treatments

2963
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,040
what does it say about the body and the

2964
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,840
brain or what made those doctors go for

2965
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,000
the plasma exchange and was it with with

2966
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,239
a matter

2967
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:42,960
right well because um

2968
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,320
because

2969
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:48,559
they had this idea that uh

2970
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,560
they had they had this they had this

2971
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,960
idea that inflammation

2972
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:55,600
you know was the core of a lot of these

2973
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,440
catastrophic the core of a lot of the

2974
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,719
symptoms when you when you look at

2975
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:00,880
depression and you look at

2976
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,960
psychiatric disorders people often get

2977
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,000
wrapped up in the um sensory experience

2978
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,199
and the um

2979
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,560
and the cognitive experience you know

2980
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,119
people say things that are so crazy

2981
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:12,159
you know

2982
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:13,679
and the thing is why would you say that

2983
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,440
why are they so irrational

2984
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,280
you know and people start at that level

2985
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,119
and they talk to them and they say

2986
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:20,800
try and understand their life experience

2987
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,800
and all this or whatever

2988
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,960
but the view of these uh guys in mexico

2989
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,800
was look you know look look at the other

2990
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,239
symptoms

2991
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:28,680
um

2992
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,760
[Music]

2993
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,360
look what's happening you know

2994
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,239
the guy is pissing his pants

2995
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:36,639
 himself hasn't been to sleep

2996
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,639
for three days and then he sleeps for

2997
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,560
two weeks

2998
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,920
and he doesn't want to eat anything he

2999
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,920
hasn't eaten for a week you know so this

3000
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,800
is like really basic

3001
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,040
it's really basic functioning is out of

3002
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,360
control now um

3003
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,440
and that looks like it maybe that's a

3004
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,960
kind of and we know that uh you know

3005
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,360
inflammation does affect homeostasis

3006
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,639
really badly

3007
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:00,239
so that was their thought you know let's

3008
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:01,280
um

3009
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,880
and then let's test them for all these

3010
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,480
you know

3011
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,159
antibodies for encephalitis and they

3012
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:09,280
find it so plasma exchange is the um the

3013
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,000
treatment for that

3014
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,159
and then of course you might think oh

3015
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:17,040
well all right but

3016
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:18,719
that's not something you're going to

3017
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,400
repair straight away

3018
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,840
you know when you've gone from

3019
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,280
homeostatic catastrophe

3020
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,960
to uh

3021
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,119
a bit of reintegration

3022
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:30,320
you know you're still going to be left

3023
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,320
with the cognitive level has to get back

3024
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,600
in touch with

3025
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,040
you know if you're thinking of those

3026
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,639
kind of levels of organization and

3027
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:38,400
systematic functioning and interaction

3028
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,600
well okay

3029
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,360
you change the molecular level function

3030
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,719
you don't change everything straight

3031
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:45,280
away which is why um

3032
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,360
it's a very nice study by katherine

3033
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,960
harmer you know give people

3034
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,119
antidepressants

3035
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:52,320
or anything like they give people

3036
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,239
antidepressants or you've changed their

3037
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,800
serotonin levels within an hour

3038
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,400
right so you brought their serotonin

3039
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,920
level across the brain back to now why

3040
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,040
don't why if sir

3041
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,119
the serotonin theory of anti-depression

3042
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:07,280
is right why don't they feel better why

3043
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:08,320
don't they change their pattern of

3044
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,840
thinking

3045
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,360
it does affect

3046
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,199
it does affect some very kind of low

3047
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,040
level perceptual processing though so

3048
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,280
they're patterns of gaze

3049
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:20,800
you know depressive people their circads

3050
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,400
are very avoidant you know if you show

3051
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,239
them emotional faces or something they

3052
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:26,480
don't look at the the nose the eyes the

3053
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,440
mouth

3054
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:30,080
their eyes automatically avert and

3055
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,560
people with anxiety and so on so they're

3056
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,239
not getting any positive uh you know

3057
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:35,920
emotional feedback from their social

3058
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,520
world

3059
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,119
but if you give people antidepressants

3060
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:41,040
that pattern of cicadas changes within a

3061
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,520
few hours

3062
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,440
so it's almost like you're giving them

3063
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,520
the ability now to um

3064
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,000
do some active inference and reacquire

3065
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,719
some some some new information about

3066
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,400
about their world

3067
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,920
so if they go around the world luckily

3068
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,600
and they people smile at them and laugh

3069
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,199
and talk with them then they they're

3070
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:01,040
getting some new information but

3071
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,040
that's not going to disrupt

3072
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,719
straight away all the high level models

3073
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:06,800
that they've built

3074
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,320
to um you know you're not going to

3075
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,239
change their that's not going to happen

3076
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:11,440
straight away

3077
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:12,719
and that

3078
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:17,440
um story about the serotonin story i've

3079
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:18,880
personally felt

3080
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,199
is that disciplinary hierarchy it's like

3081
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:23,280
well we know how this drug works look at

3082
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,880
my simulation of how it binds to the

3083
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,440
receptor you bring up but then if it did

3084
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,360
that and that's simply how it worked if

3085
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,440
it weren't just um you know changing a

3086
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,679
complex biological system

3087
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,520
then wouldn't the time course of action

3088
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,880
be very different

3089
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,440
and exactly it's a it's a um

3090
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,440
looking where the light is because we

3091
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,119
can make these simulations with a

3092
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:45,199
docking of a molecule

3093
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:46,960
but as yet

3094
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:50,880
we lack some of these layers in between

3095
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,119
absolutely the vibrating molecule and

3096
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:55,520
our own phenomenology which is sort of

3097
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,360
that fog of uh

3098
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,760
experience that we're exploring

3099
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,360
together

3100
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,560
yeah i know i i absolutely 100 agree and

3101
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,119
i think um

3102
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:09,360
you know yeah but

3103
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,199
most of my practicing psychiatrists

3104
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:13,119
colleagues and you know collaborators

3105
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:14,880
they would agree too

3106
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,199
but there's a big uh pharmaceutical

3107
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:18,320
industrial

3108
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,840
complex

3109
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:23,280
you know that has that has a interest in

3110
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,440
thinking you know persuading people

3111
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,320
otherwise and also people are desperate

3112
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:29,760
yeah yeah

3113
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,239
can't wait till we have big prior

3114
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:34,159
and big precision

3115
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:36,880
yeah yeah exactly

3116
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:39,040
you you brought up the um

3117
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,600
australian philosopher colin klein

3118
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,480
who

3119
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,719
i was familiar with because of the

3120
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:47,280
collaboration with andy barron

3121
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,600
actually about basil experience in

3122
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,159
honeybees and in insects

3123
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:54,960
so just was an interesting connection

3124
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,880
with thinking about okay if we're going

3125
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,560
to take this sort of bottom-up

3126
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,360
computational approach then

3127
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,280
where we take that in not just the

3128
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:06,639
clinical but in the evolutionary context

3129
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:08,480
yeah no he's a great he's a great uh

3130
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,480
philosopher for sure and he's really got

3131
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,960
his finger on the pulse of all the um

3132
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:13,960
i think

3133
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:15,840
cross-disciplinary

3134
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,199
um

3135
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,800
yeah material that you need to do that

3136
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,400
kind of thing well he's really good like

3137
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:21,520
that

3138
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,360
here's another just in these last few

3139
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,520
minutes a question from the chat

3140
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,760
cb wrote

3141
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,840
any thoughts about the role of

3142
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,560
non-synaptic information transmission

3143
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,080
across the brain

3144
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,199
especially

3145
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:39,759
emphatic coupling thank you kindly

3146
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,360
um

3147
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,830
honestly

3148
01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:44,080
[Applause]

3149
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:47,840
i don't really know um

3150
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,400
yeah i don't because uh

3151
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,320
clearly it's got to have

3152
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,400
there's no reason within say active

3153
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,159
inference framework or actually any

3154
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:58,239
computational framework

3155
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:01,119
to think that um

3156
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:03,040
you know the the fundamental mechanism

3157
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,040
has to be synaptic

3158
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:05,920
uh

3159
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,040
although

3160
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,360
it could it could be anything right

3161
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:11,119
how the brain

3162
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:12,880
is organizing

3163
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,199
uh the body to get through the world to

3164
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:17,360
survive could be anything it could help

3165
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,960
itself to any mechanism you know

3166
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,280
astrocytes glial cells whatever the hell

3167
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,239
you know

3168
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:23,760
but we have got

3169
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,760
we bought into this idea that it's uh

3170
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,440
synaptic

3171
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,119
probably going back to heb and people

3172
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:32,159
like that and a neural network theory is

3173
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:34,000
that it's a synaptic theory right you've

3174
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
got these units

3175
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,840
uh interconnected units with weights

3176
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,599
which are supposed to model some

3177
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:41,679
abstract levels synaptic functioning

3178
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:42,560
right

3179
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:45,280
we might be off we might be off um off

3180
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,040
track there

3181
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:47,840
but

3182
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,599
so maybe this is a kind of a good

3183
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:51,280
advantage good advantage of active

3184
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,880
inference it's like

3185
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:55,679
at the moment uh computational theory is

3186
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:57,840
hung up on the synaptic model because

3187
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,199
that's what deep learning and neural

3188
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:01,119
networks are

3189
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:02,719
right setting of setting weights across

3190
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:04,719
the brain but that's a very abstract

3191
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:06,239
idea of um

3192
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:08,159
heavy and you know it's a very abstract

3193
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:11,040
idea of what ed was on he was on about

3194
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,360
and most neuroscientists like i had a

3195
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:14,800
guy talking in my class the other day

3196
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,159
invited him to give a lecture he works

3197
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:17,840
on dragonfly vision

3198
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,440
and he was just talking about the

3199
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,679
neurons in in the eyes of dragonflies he

3200
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:23,040
was saying there is all this stuff in

3201
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:26,159
there that we don't know

3202
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:28,159
glial cells astrocytes what the hell

3203
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:29,199
that you know what they're doing what

3204
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:31,199
they're encoding how they're encoding it

3205
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:32,719
but it says if you mess with their

3206
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:34,239
function

3207
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:35,760
then you mess with the ability of the

3208
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:39,040
dragonflies to to

3209
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,040
do their incredibly accurate flying and

3210
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:44,080
landing and sensory representation so

3211
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:48,239
yeah so maybe the synaptic model is um

3212
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:49,840
once again it's a case of looking where

3213
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,440
the light is you know

3214
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,520
artificial neural networks

3215
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:54,800
they're great they can do a lot of

3216
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,159
things

3217
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:57,520
um but

3218
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,800
they are a kind of high level

3219
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,400
abstraction

3220
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,719
then again bayesian models are an even

3221
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:05,119
higher level abstraction

3222
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:06,320
if you if you want to put it that way

3223
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,920
because the bayesian mod the bayesian

3224
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,920
models just say okay you've got a system

3225
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,520
interacting with its environment and

3226
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,679
i've got a function

3227
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:15,840
a function that tells you

3228
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,280
how the system's going to interact with

3229
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,679
its environment

3230
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:21,920
and i can devolve that into a lot of if

3231
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,360
you like i can devolve that into a lot

3232
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:25,360
of subsidiary

3233
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:26,480
uh

3234
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,080
levels of

3235
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,239
of bayesian

3236
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:33,360
bayesian inference all the way down but

3237
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,440
how do they how do they glom how do they

3238
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,360
glom onto

3239
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,840
the actual molecular soup

3240
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:40,960
uh

3241
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,480
i don't know but i mean that's the

3242
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:43,840
that's the job of it isn't you know

3243
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,440
that's you know that's why i i guess

3244
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,840
still

3245
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:50,080
uh dopaminergic uh functioning in the

3246
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:51,679
brain is still a bit of a triumph

3247
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:52,560
because

3248
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,239
sorry understanding the dopamine system

3249
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:56,639
is because you have

3250
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:59,440
a system whose properties

3251
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:01,199
map pretty well to the predictions of

3252
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:02,880
formal theory

3253
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,320
you know of temporal difference learning

3254
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,000
and reward learning not perfectly but

3255
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,960
you know

3256
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,360
it does fit

3257
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:11,520
so that's good so that's good you know

3258
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,280
that's good it seemed to seem to say

3259
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:16,400
we're in the ballpark

3260
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:19,280
a paper on the dopamine signaling about

3261
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,960
explanatory pluralism from a

3262
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:23,119
philosophical perspective about

3263
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:24,719
the way in which the dopaminergic

3264
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:28,000
signaling um in in different ways can be

3265
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,960
seen as consistent with the precision

3266
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,920
account the reward account or other

3267
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:36,000
accounts and so it's like

3268
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,920
maybe let's um you know wait a few

3269
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:40,000
decades yeah

3270
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
before we um you know give out the

3271
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,119
trophies let's yeah yeah yeah absolutely

3272
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,639
absolutely so

3273
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:48,800
i'll just very good yeah because that's

3274
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,440
right why why can't it doesn't fristen

3275
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,800
have a paper on that

3276
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,320
even you know and actually there are a

3277
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,560
couple of good papers on that now

3278
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:57,840
yeah with the within the active

3279
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,920
inference framework we can conceptualize

3280
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,239
the um the dopamine system as you know

3281
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,239
fine-tuning fine-tuning patterns of

3282
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:05,599
active inference

3283
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:07,440
rather than back propagating a reward

3284
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:08,480
signal

3285
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:10,159
exactly

3286
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,560
exactly yeah so i'll just close with

3287
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,800
this sort of um this diptych of

3288
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,040
questions a little high road in a low

3289
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,480
road one of the paths would be what

3290
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,719
research directions do you think are

3291
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:24,639
exciting for people to pursue and the

3292
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:28,000
other side is um how do you think for

3293
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,159
potentially non-researchers

3294
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:32,960
what you've spoken to today might

3295
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,790
change the way that they think or act

3296
01:53:35,790 --> 01:53:37,199
[Music]

3297
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:38,840
i think for

3298
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:41,199
researchers i think i think any

3299
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:42,800
researchers should still keep

3300
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,080
researching you know what they're

3301
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,520
interested in

3302
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,920
like if you've got a fascination or an

3303
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,400
interest there's dragonfly vision

3304
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,560
dopaminergic signaling whatever i think

3305
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,480
you should just keep going for it

3306
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:57,280
and incorporate uh

3307
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:59,199
active inference or any framework that

3308
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:00,960
that is is

3309
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,280
is helping you know i don't think

3310
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:06,800
jumping on a bandwagon or any researcher

3311
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:07,599
is

3312
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:08,480
helpful

3313
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,520
although

3314
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:10,639
you've got a bit you've got to bear in

3315
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:12,000
mind that if you're trying to function

3316
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,760
in an institutional environment you're

3317
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,119
going to be on some bandwagon right

3318
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:16,960
you're going to be in some lab or some

3319
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,639
in a school of thought but

3320
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:20,239
i think you still should you've still

3321
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:21,840
got to do what you're interested in

3322
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,520
rather than promote

3323
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,639
you know

3324
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:26,480
someone else's program so i don't have a

3325
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,280
kind of

3326
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,360
i would love to see

3327
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:32,719
i would love to see that um

3328
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,960
that you know kind of fristonian ideas

3329
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:36,800
and everything could

3330
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,480
be put in a

3331
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,639
intuitive way

3332
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:43,280
that made them more accessible

3333
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,280
for people who were looking for a kind

3334
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,520
of a kind of recipe or something like

3335
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,320
that

3336
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,159
because they're so technical and they're

3337
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:51,920
so formal

3338
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:56,080
and uh it's hard to extract um

3339
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,760
how to extract the gold you know if you

3340
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,360
know what i mean it's it and that's why

3341
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:00,560
yeah so

3342
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:01,599
i think

3343
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:04,480
so a good suite of examples would be

3344
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:05,599
really helpful

3345
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:08,080
like you know standard cases that people

3346
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:10,159
use to explain it

3347
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:11,760
um

3348
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,520
would be good you know just as you know

3349
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,199
often these examples the examples are

3350
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:16,800
wrong right so

3351
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,599
you think of mars theory of vision

3352
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:21,440
okay probably wrong

3353
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,599
but at least it kind of gave you a way

3354
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,679
to understand

3355
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:27,280
you know what's going on in the visual

3356
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,280
system and then you can fine-tune it and

3357
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:30,480
change it and argue with it and

3358
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,119
everything like that but he gave people

3359
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:35,440
a way of taking the understanding of

3360
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:38,960
perception out of this out of you know

3361
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,400
out of a really kind of technical

3362
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:41,840
specialized

3363
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,760
framework and now philosophers talk

3364
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,840
about it psychologists

3365
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,599
it's probably become a little bit of a

3366
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:50,800
um an albatross around the neck of

3367
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,080
because but no one's come up with no

3368
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,920
one's come up with like a

3369
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:55,599
that one it would be nice if um someone

3370
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:56,880
could

3371
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,280
i mean because the ma framework is so um

3372
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,920
so so clear right and and it works for

3373
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:05,840
active inference too you can say well

3374
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:06,639
look

3375
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:08,880
the mind is in the business is what holy

3376
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,679
says of um

3377
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,520
reconstructing the causal structure of

3378
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,119
the world you know inferring the causal

3379
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:16,480
structure of the world outside beyond

3380
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,159
its boundaries so it's very internalist

3381
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:19,280
view

3382
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:22,080
but that's a very um plausible way of

3383
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,159
doing it you know i think yeah i get it

3384
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:25,599
you know you can explain that to

3385
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:27,280
students and to people look

3386
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,280
the brain is stuck inside its skull it

3387
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,960
can't it can't engage with the world it

3388
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,679
can only ever do it by proxy indirectly

3389
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:35,840
and what does it have photons sensory

3390
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,599
receptors

3391
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:39,920
it's got to build the picture okay and

3392
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,159
you know that's what ma said and and how

3393
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:44,159
he put it in the predictive processing

3394
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:45,599
framework

3395
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:47,840
something like that would be helpful if

3396
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:49,840
you get that idea across you can do it

3397
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,119
for other modalities of course

3398
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:53,679
interoception you know whatever

3399
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:56,000
sorry what was the the other question oh

3400
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,880
on the non-research frontier is um just

3401
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,719
in the day-to-day how does this

3402
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:03,760
influence how we might think or act just

3403
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:07,360
in our day-to-day experiences

3404
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,400
i think it makes a big difference if you

3405
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,719
think of yourself as um you think of

3406
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:14,560
your behavior

3407
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:18,000
as uh confirming a model

3408
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,360
you know i think it makes a really

3409
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,880
really big difference you know if you're

3410
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,040
arguing like you're arguing with your

3411
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,400
partner or

3412
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:26,880
you know stuck in

3413
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,040
a way of life or ways of especially

3414
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,960
especially social interaction you can

3415
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:32,960
think of social interactions you know

3416
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,239
i've got a thought i've got to try and

3417
01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:36,000
get a point across or i've got a goal i

3418
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,440
want to achieve the goal

3419
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,360
right i want to make friends with this

3420
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:40,880
person i want to do this i want to do

3421
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:41,840
that

3422
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,960
um

3423
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,480
and then you can get pissed off or

3424
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:45,920
whatever if you're if it's working or

3425
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,760
not but maybe the right way to think of

3426
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,199
it is you know

3427
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:50,880
i've got a model of how i function in

3428
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,639
the world

3429
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:54,560
and uh you know my brain has built this

3430
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,639
picture of how i function in the world

3431
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:58,400
and i'm just now

3432
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,159
i'm bungling around the world trying to

3433
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:02,799
optimize it

3434
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:05,520
you know so what i think what i think of

3435
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:07,119
as this kind of you know

3436
01:58:07,119 --> 01:58:09,199
autonomous engagements of this um you

3437
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:10,400
know

3438
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,000
individual who's above it all and

3439
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,599
choosing and whatever and you know

3440
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:15,599
making decisions and

3441
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:17,280
not really maybe what i'm doing is

3442
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:18,639
bungling around the world trying to

3443
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:21,199
optimize my model

3444
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:23,920
and um maybe i've got i can get stuck in

3445
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,440
a local minima

3446
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,440
and i can get stuck in a

3447
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,440
you know all my models my model's not

3448
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:32,159
working we had this discussion maybe i

3449
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:33,920
don't know if you know this philosopher

3450
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:35,440
dominic murphy

3451
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,599
he's a fantastic philosopher of uh

3452
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:40,639
science uh science and psychology

3453
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:41,920
but we would think of you know this

3454
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,840
national model and you know

3455
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,360
a lot of the time what you're doing is

3456
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:48,639
uh brand management you know yourself

3457
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:50,080
who you are

3458
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:51,920
is this model that you've made that

3459
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:54,000
works for you in your environment your

3460
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,360
family as you're growing up or high

3461
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,480
school or whatever like this and you've

3462
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:59,280
got this brand now and unfortunately

3463
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,360
or fortunately that's how other people

3464
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,480
see you

3465
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:05,280
your actions are really about

3466
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:06,880
getting your brand out there brand new

3467
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,880
brand management and if you identify

3468
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,159
with your brand

3469
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:11,599
great you know

3470
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:13,599
but if the brand if your brand isn't

3471
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:15,119
working for you

3472
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:17,119
and if you and if you just see your

3473
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:19,280
actions as oh god

3474
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,199
i am just what i'm doing is kind of

3475
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:23,520
finessing and thought and reinforcing

3476
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,280
and fortifying

3477
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:29,199
this model of how i act in the world

3478
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:31,119
does it have to be like that

3479
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:33,440
you know

3480
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,480
very

3481
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:37,119
nice point that instead of um social

3482
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:39,760
interactions maximizing my reward your

3483
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,199
reward our shared reward zero sum

3484
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:45,040
we can actually think about well what if

3485
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,880
we were both reducing our uncertainty

3486
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:49,550
about a positive social interaction

3487
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:50,639
[Music]

3488
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:52,480
what might be known as win-win in the

3489
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:55,199
reward paradigm but here yeah that's a

3490
01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:56,480
really good way to it's a really good

3491
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,639
way to think of it that's a really good

3492
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:01,360
way yeah exactly

3493
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,920
thank you for this awesome visit it was

3494
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:06,719
really uh fascinating talk and one of in

3495
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:08,960
the chat brilliant practical advice

3496
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,119
thanks daniel and thanks for your guest

3497
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:12,400
so yeah

3498
