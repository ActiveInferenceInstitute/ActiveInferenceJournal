00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,008
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,043
Welcome to the Active Inference Lab.

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:14,881
Today it's September
9th, 2021 for Gueststream

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,818
number 10.1 double digits
or double digits for the decimal.

5
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,790
And we're really honored and appreciative
to have Professor Philip Gerrans today

6
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:28,928
coming in from Austrialia, and also Dave
joining us on stream.

7
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:32,599
We're going to have
a presentation from Philip

8
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,269
and then we're going to have some time
for discussion and dialog.

9
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,706
So if you're watching live,
please feel free to leave questions

10
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,409
in the live chat
and we will address those on the stream

11
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,278
and we're just really looking forward
to this.

12
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,914
And again, appreciative
that you're coming on our stream.

13
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,716
So thanks and take it away.

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,751
Philip.

15
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,220
Okay, great.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,055
Thank you very much.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,090
Thank you very much for the invitation.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,027
I spoke to Anna Ciaunica, who told me
that she had a great experience

19
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,830
with you guys.
So I'm very, very happy to be able to

20
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,132
present and

21
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,568
to tell you a little bit
about the background to this talk.

22
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,938
I was originally a philosopher of mind

23
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,642
and of cognitive science,
and I'm very interested in the

24
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,813
use of of models and techniques
in cognitive science

25
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,382
to understand psychiatric disorder.

26
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,552
And I found predictive processing

27
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,121
very helpful when I was writing a book
on this a few years ago.

28
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,989
But looking back at

29
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:33,393
some other psychiatric disorders
like the Cotard Delusion and so on,

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,163
I think it's really great to kind of go
a little bit deeper and more,

31
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,198
more fundamental.

32
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:42,268
If you think of predictive processing
as kind of like a computational structure

33
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,270
at the level of representation
of an algorithm,

34
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,941
but of course
a lot of psychiatric disorders.

35
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,644
I think we've got a very bottom
up genesis.

36
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:55,115
We really need to know about how
the brain is working to control the body

37
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,017
and even how the body is working
in its social world.

38
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,222
So the active inference framework for me
has been very helpful

39
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,792
in rethinking this in this book
that I'm writing right now.

40
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,696
And also, I think it's it's
actually crucial to understanding

41
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,433
a phenomenon that I'm talking about
right now that the Cotard delusion.

42
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,603
Cotard delusion is so interesting
because.

43
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,572
Well, it's interesting in itself,
as you'll see.

44
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:24,043
It's fascinating phenomenon, but
it points us to some really interesting,

45
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,447
interesting facts or

46
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,250
interesting evidence
about the way the mind is.

47
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:34,654
Mind is working at a really basic level
and how that remedies

48
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,558
and cascades upwards
throughout cognition and behavior.

49
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:42,962
So let's go I'll just tell you
what the cocktail delusion is.

50
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,931
It's the delusion of sometimes

51
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:49,669
people think of it in the folk world
as the delusion that you're dead.

52
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,439
I was discovered in 1882,
as usual cutoff, but

53
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,512
we described it more accurately,
I think, as the delusion of in existence.

54
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,549
So here is someone who has a
she had the experience of having

55
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,219
no identity or self
and being only a body with that content.

56
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:10,723
She convinced it her brain to disappeared
and the whole body was translucent.

57
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,992
Another one more recent one.

58
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,528
I speak and breathe
and eat, but I'm dead.

59
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,665
Okay, so this classic

60
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:23,036
examples, but here is a really recent one
published in the last couple of years.

61
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,306
This is fascinating cases
coming from Mexico.

62
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,142
There's a really good group there
that works on this.

63
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:30,543
So Mr.

64
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,546
A was referred
to the National Institute of Neurology.

65
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,917
Because of psychotic and catatonic
symptoms, his appetite diminished.

66
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:38,785
He barely slept.

67
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,555
He stayed withdrawn and silent
and complained that his body sitting,

68
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,191
his tendons dried up
and his organs were getting bigger.

69
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,794
Speak of an internal hemorrhage.

70
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,531
His organs have been torn apart
and he began to insist that he was dead.

71
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,733
I can't feel the blood flowing
through my veins.

72
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,970
Didn't
deprive him of looking for sharp objects

73
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,006
to cut his neck and forearms.

74
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,741
Then he gradually improved.

75
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:06,212
Or first he became mute, began to urinate
on his clothes, refused to eat, and

76
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,481
then speak.

77
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,919
Finally, you know, after some treatment,
he said he's improved slightly,

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,588
but he said,
I don't have feelings because I'm dead.

79
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,391
He had a right sided heart
and that had stopped.

80
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,762
And then he kept on saying,
even after persisting treatment is near

81
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,098
holistic delusions,
as they're accurately called,

82
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,634
you know, delusions
of in existence of nothingness.

83
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,570
I am data among other human beings.

84
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,839
It's like a program where I'm dead.

85
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,240
And he said, who is a dead person

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,377
among the corpses under the earthquake,
debris? Now,

87
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,748
the genesis of this case of Cotard
delusion is

88
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,084
encephalitis, a form of encephalitis,

89
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,321
which an autoimmune reaction
against proteins in the brain.

90
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:53,626
So it's one of the most basic things
that can go wrong at the cellular level.

91
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,964
And if the protein is in methods
per type, the condition is called

92
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,668
NMDA antibody encephalitis. Okay.

93
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,870
So that's what. Mr.. Ahead.

94
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,872
But of course,
our interesting question is

95
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,042
if we know what's happening

96
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,278
at the molecular level, at the level
of kind of membranes and receptors,

97
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,449
why on earth would that make
you think that it didn't exist?

98
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,451
So they were address
that they were in the

99
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,219
in the field of addressing the question,
you know,

100
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,223
how does the brain
enable experience and cognition?

101
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,093
That's that's the questions
of cognitive neuroscience

102
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,831
and psychology
and anyone else who wants to get involved

103
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,600
in that topic, phenomenology, philosophy.

104
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:35,435
Okay.

105
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,371
But it's a really pertinent question.

106
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,639
So here's the outline of the talk.

107
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,642
I just told you about the delusion,
and then I'm going to tell you about

108
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,545
some of the classic attempts
to explain it.

109
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,148
Just run through those

110
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,651
and point to a problem with those.

111
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,221
And then in discussing
one of the most recent

112
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,891
and persuasive
and really interesting explanations

113
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,794
that we owe to Alexandre Billon,

114
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,865
I'm going to introduce
the active inference approach,

115
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:11,404
and I'm going to show how the active
inference approach can rectify a problem

116
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,741
we saw beyond the account,
but also point to point to some other

117
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,477
deep sort of unifying themes

118
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,881
across
cognitive science and across disorders.

119
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,784
So the active inference framework,
I think it's an elegant

120
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,787
and persuasive

121
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,390
way to explain not just cases like Mr.

122
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,893
AI, but a lot of other
these other disorders

123
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,264
and pathologies
where our experience of our self

124
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,666
goes astray.

125
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,736
So things like pain, Somalia,
where people say that

126
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,472
they experiencing pain, but also

127
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,709
that their body is experiencing pain,
but it's not happening to them.

128
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,913
But it feels as though
it's not their pain or depersonalization

129
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,950
disorders in which people will say
not just that pain, it's not theirs,

130
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,788
but they feel it outside of a detach
from their whole experience.

131
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,158
Okay, so
and the solution that I'll propose,

132
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:10,196
I'll give you the short
summary right now is that as part of the

133
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,365
project or

134
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,301
process of active inference, the body,

135
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:20,740
the brain makes hierarchical
models of itself and the world of deep

136
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,844
the deep structure of the world
as is populated with objects

137
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,680
and properties that the external world
with which it interacts.

138
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,317
But of course the brain
also has to make a model of its own

139
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,352
internal

140
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,122
functioning.

141
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,992
The processes that that keep
it keep us alive and functioning.

142
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,561
And in order to do that,

143
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,397
it makes a model of itself
as a unified, persisting entity.

144
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,965
And that's what we feel the self.

145
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:50,470
That's what we feel when we feel like,
like persisting people,

146
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,673
when we feel like a self,
we are the model.

147
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,843
That's what we've, we're
experiencing activity in the circuitry

148
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,079
that makes that self model okay.

149
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,483
And in a cotard
delusion this, the self model

150
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,318
goes wrong

151
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,421
in a certain way or that process of self
modeling goes wrong in a certain way.

152
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:13,259
But we can see other disorders in which
that process of self modeling goes wrong.

153
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:18,698
And I think that theory makes it maps
really nicely

154
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,834
to the the neural substrates
of all these disorders.

155
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,003
It explains the symptoms and so on.

156
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,471
So let's go.

157
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,040
So of course, as we saw,

158
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,978
it's such an interesting disorder,
the Cotard delusion, because,

159
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:32,445
you know, there's

160
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:37,083
there's questions in sort of philosophy
and about rational belief fixation.

161
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:37,884
And so,

162
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,687
I mean, how could someone coherently say
I've died or I don't exist?

163
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,458
And there's a question about rationality
there and the nature of reasoning

164
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,061
and so on, on the basis of experience,
which is interesting in itself,

165
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,199
which is that's part of
the philosophy of delusions, I guess, or

166
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,570
the philosophy of psychiatric disorder,
where I came into this topic a while ago.

167
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,406
But of course, it's
also very interesting in

168
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,776
how can you also have
the experience of not existing, you know,

169
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,380
so it points us to the question
of what is going on

170
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,117
when you actually feel like a self, okay?

171
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:15,087
And of course, it's also
a great test case for theories that try

172
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,691
and explain experience and cognition
in terms of underlying

173
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,861
neural functioning.

174
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:25,464
So here's the kind of broad brush
of the kind of classic approaches

175
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,568
to these topics
that you get in a series of delusions.

176
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:33,306
And so I guess it's the early nineties
which tried to weight

177
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,842
philosophy of belief,
rational belief, fixation

178
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:41,714
to the neuroscience
of delusion formation, and that the most

179
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:46,419
top level abstract by putting it is
there's two stages in delusion formation.

180
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,390
The first one is an unusual
or anomalous, as they say, sensory

181
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,593
experience.

182
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,229
So it's something goes wrong
at the level of sensory motor functioning

183
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,266
gives you an unusual experience.

184
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,169
And then the second stage is

185
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,271
a metacognitive response
to that experience.

186
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:10,109
And so this is why someone, for example,
who lost control

187
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,312
or is unable to feel,

188
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,781
unable to feel
that they are the agent of their actions

189
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,783
when they're picking up things
and moving around the world.

190
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:18,451
Okay.

191
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,521
That's the loss of,
as they call, sense of agency due to

192
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,392
normally problems in the

193
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,095
parietal lobe,
your inferior parietal lobe,

194
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,230
something goes wrong there
with the kind of sensory motor

195
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,000
and action of agency.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,637
And then the people person will say
to explain that we had experience

197
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,538
of moving around the world

198
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,140
but not feeling like they are the person

199
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,442
who initiated the movement
or controlling it.

200
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,845
Let's say someone else is controlling me

201
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,080
in that said delusions of control
as that state.

202
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,415
That would be a classic case.

203
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,550
We have an anomalous experience

204
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,420
at the first stage
and then the delusion is a belief

205
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,191
or some kind of cognitive rationalization
or story that the person tells.

206
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,731
Okay, now there's two implications of the
the two stage theory.

207
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,434
One is that, well,
if the patient doesn't have

208
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,469
a problem

209
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,506
with higher order processing,
then she won't develop a delusion

210
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,542
because the delusion
is a medical response, right?

211
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,846
So in that case, the person should have
an anomalous experience.

212
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,717
She should feel like
she's making movements that aren't hers.

213
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,851
For example.

214
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,221
Or you might feel like you're
hearing voice, you feel like you're

215
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,224
hearing voices,
and the person will just report that

216
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,295
having an unusual,
weird, distressing experience.

217
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,364
But they wouldn't
go on to have a delusion

218
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,934
because the delusion is the result
of a problem at this stage of

219
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,371
they cycle belief
fixation or metacognition.

220
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,038
Okay.

221
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,376
And if this is really right, then
there should be cases in which people

222
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,880
have the unusual experience,
but they don't go on to have a delusion.

223
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,683
And of course, we are all familiar
with this in everyday life.

224
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,451
If you think about it,

225
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,152
you've probably

226
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:04,023
had feelings of deja vu or Gemini vu,
you know, in déja vu.

227
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,491
You think I've been here before,

228
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,961
I've had this experience before,
even though you know that you haven't.

229
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,832
And this is the point that, you know,
you can have an experience

230
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,736
that is completely anomalous or weird,

231
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,871
then go on to have a delusion about it.

232
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,308
But in this case you say, Well,
it feels as if I've been here before,

233
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,411
or in the opposite case,
my view, you know,

234
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,481
you walk into your bedroom
and it feels like you sleep every night.

235
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,650
You just have this fleeting instant of

236
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,952
what this is new.

237
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,121
This feels like a duplicate
of my bedroom or something.

238
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:40,659
But you don't go on to form a delusion
because rational insight is retained.

239
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,897
Unlike the classic case of delusions
of misidentification, which I spend

240
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:45,498
my time on

241
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,834
in a delusion,
a miss, a misidentification

242
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,505
person will say something like

243
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,173
They'll see their wife
or see their husband

244
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,208
or a boyfriend or something
and say that they're a stranger.

245
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,310
Say and you say.

246
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,912
Why do you say that?

247
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,182
They look the same as their appearance
and then they look identical.

248
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:08,521
But they are like a replica or duplicate
or an imposter in the classic delusion.

249
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,258
And the story is what has gone wrong here
is there's a problem

250
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,059
at the level of sensory processing.

251
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:18,230
So the thought is that normally
when we see a familiar face,

252
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,733
we get an effective response
to that face,

253
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,405
which is part of a signal that that's
a familiar person I see you see my sister

254
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,542
or my partner, and then it's like,
oh yeah, that's that's her.

255
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,478
So it's a feeling of familiarity
that's based in fact.

256
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,849
But when that goes missing, then all the
other perceptual information is intact.

257
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,251
I recognize the face,
the shape of the face and so on.

258
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,453
But I don't they don't feel familiar.

259
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,757
And in the case of delusions
of misidentification,

260
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:48,494
the person rationalizes
these losses or alterations to the sense

261
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:54,200
of familiarity by saying, oh, you know,
my wife's been replaced with an impostor.

262
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,703
Amazing delusions, but there you go.

263
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,172
But that's just an example
of the kind of two stage

264
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:04,343
theory of delusion formation,
which was developed for delusions of

265
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,846
misidentification.

266
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,582
Now, in turning to the Cotard delusion,

267
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,819
what is the first stage
in this framework?

268
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,856
Well, Alexandre Billon

269
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,958
says that it's the loss

270
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,327
of what people call
the sense of mind illness

271
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,731
or a subjective presence
is what Neil Smith calls

272
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,934
this and people from Sussex
who work on defense notation.

273
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,071
The basic idea is that

274
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:35,674
something that philosophers
and many people have remarked on or

275
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,712
thought about
is that when you have experiences,

276
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,816
part of that experience is an awareness
that you are the person

277
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,652
who's having experience,
as your spouse said,

278
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,956
every psychic manifestation,
perception, bodily memory,

279
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,260
it carries with it
this feeling of being mind,

280
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,863
having an online quality
of personally belonging.

281
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,867
It's been termed personalization.

282
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,002
And so the thought is,

283
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,971
just as when you see familiar people,
there's this kind of subtle,

284
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,974
just a subtle, subtle
feeling of familiarity,

285
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,944
which you don't even notice
that it's there until it goes missing.

286
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,679
And so it's the case

287
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,649
that with your everyday experience,
it feels like it's yours.

288
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,017
I mean, who else?

289
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,453
So there's this kind of aspect
of subjectivity or subjective presence

290
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,424
that you wouldn't even become aware of
until it went missing.

291
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,762
We only see it as we only even notice
that this is an experience,

292
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:34,433
a kind of a subtle accompaniment
to all of life until

293
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,903
we are confronted with experiences

294
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:41,307
exceptional in pathological cases,
and then if it goes missing, it

295
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,942
really in trouble.

296
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,010
So for example,

297
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,714
in the case of pain, a symbolic

298
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,851
what can happen is that someone can have

299
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,422
a pain
that can have the experience of pain

300
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:01,593
and they can report that experience
of pain saying, yeah, you know,

301
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,331
I mean, yeah, I'm in pain,
but it doesn't feel like it's my pain.

302
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,734
Know, detach
like it's not happening to me.

303
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,638
It's not interrogation, you say,
Yeah, yeah, you know, it feels hot.

304
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,540
I feel kind of pressure.
It feels intense.

305
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,511
In other words,
they can be still able to detect

306
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:24,183
and represent bodily damage
through the process of, as it's called,

307
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:28,320
you know, deception, the primary
representation of pain stimuli.

308
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:29,288
Okay.

309
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:34,126
But something else has gone
missing, involved in this knots.

310
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,063
And there's two theories about pain,
symbolism.

311
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,166
One is that what's gone
missing is an emotional response to pain.

312
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,869
So that would be the thought that

313
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:48,040
in the normal case of pain,
you have no deception.

314
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,576
You know that detection
and representation of bodily damage.

315
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,644
And then there's,
if you like, an effective

316
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,114
or an emotional response
or interpretation to that

317
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,485
and the resultant pain experience
is like a merger

318
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,487
or a combination bodily damage, plus

319
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,856
the stress.

320
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,923
And that's what you report.

321
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,091
But when you take the distress

322
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,061
part out, you just get the representation
of bodily damage.

323
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,864
That's one theory of pain.

324
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,666
But Collin Klein had a different account.

325
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,201
Now Colin finds you.

326
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,736
It's not a loss of affect.

327
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,638
This is not the loss of effect.

328
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,408
It's a loss of the sense of minus.

329
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,811
So a symbolic on his view

330
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:31,417
is a localized version
of depersonalization experience.

331
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,386
A symbolic is if like a restricted case,

332
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,623
just just to the pain processing

333
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,592
where the connection between

334
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,629
the processing of bodily damage,
most deception, as it's called,

335
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:49,268
and it's subtle feeling that the
experience belongs to you, comes apart.

336
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,804
So as he says, this
sort of unity may fail.

337
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,272
Okay.

338
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:57,609
And this leads to what he calls
depersonalization or pain,

339
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:04,083
as opposed to depersonalization
in the general case,

340
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:09,121
where the loss of the sense of minus
is not just for pain,

341
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,191
but for everything.

342
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,893
So someone with severe personalization
disorder

343
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,763
will move through life,

344
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:22,935
you know, having sensations,
sensations of movement, you know,

345
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,838
perceptual sensations,
bodily experiences,

346
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:30,275
but feeling as if those things
don't belong to them.

347
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,076
As someone says,

348
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,813
he it feels almost like I have died,
but no one's thought to tell me.

349
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:40,252
So I'm living in a shell
that I don't recognize.

350
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,522
I felt my brain was somewhere else
and just watching me, I couldn't

351
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,625
tell whether I was present or whether
I was the part that it was gone.

352
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,027
There was the one watching and the other.

353
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,231
It's like seeing life as if it were
played in a film or a movie.

354
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,566
But in that case,
who is watching the film?

355
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,703
I find myself regaining existence.

356
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,507
And so from beyond the tomb,
I'm outside my own body

357
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,309
and individuality, I'm depersonalized.

358
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:09,081
So just to recap, Guy
Klein gives us the idea that in a pain

359
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,951
symbolic, you lose the sense of minus
or belonging to me

360
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:17,823
for one particular channel of bodily
processing that some notes, etc.

361
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,391
and what pain signaling.

362
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,027
But in depersonalization,
this loss is global.

363
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:27,533
And when the loss is global, the person
reports depersonalization for everything

364
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:32,237
and the feeling there is like, well,
they say it feels as if I don't exist.

365
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,840
It feels like I'm not there. Right.

366
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,043
And so how should we explain
what's going on here?

367
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,312
Well, it's different theories

368
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,882
Billon has one
I had 120 years ago spit out of date

369
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,953
now I think I'm updating it today
even as we speak.

370
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,822
And then we have the one
I will be talking about today, which

371
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,960
we owe to the active inference
guys like Seth's accused so

372
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:56,361
but his

373
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,630
Beyonce
take on it which is very interestingly

374
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,868
so don't know

375
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,538
what Beyonce is
is that depersonalization?

376
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:11,743
Is this case of an anomalous experience
and the anomalous or strange experience

377
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:17,883
is the feeling that the self is unreal
and it's not there.

378
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,019
And so if we go back to the Cotard
delusion, remember

379
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,890
the two stage theory of delusion
is that a delusion arises

380
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,862
when you have an anomalous experience
and then you have some problem

381
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:34,900
at a higher level
of rational interpretation, narrative

382
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,403
organization or metacognition,
so that you,

383
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,207
you have no rational insight
into the experience

384
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:47,579
or are unable to explain it, for
you end up just taking it for granted.

385
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,415
And that's beyond the idea
about depersonalization.

386
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,718
It's the first stage of Cotard delusion.

387
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,021
So it's
when someone with depersonalization says

388
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,723
it feels as if I don't exist.

389
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,057
It feels as if I'm not here.

390
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:03,629
It feels as if experience is outside
me or I'm not involved in it.

391
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,298
That's because they're having

392
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,801
the same experience as the Cotard person
the Catalan patient has,

393
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,538
but they have rational insight,
an intact metacognition.

394
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,842
So they can look
they can look at that experience and say

395
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,245
it feels as if I don't exist.

396
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,781
It feels as if experience isn't mine.

397
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,517
But I know that's not true.

398
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,819
So I report it
just saying it feels that way.

399
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,188
But I don't.
They don't develop the delusion.

400
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,425
So what differentiates Cotard
and depersonalized delusions

401
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:37,896
is that the Cotard
patient has the same experience as as a

402
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,932
as a patient with depersonalization,

403
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,869
but they have intact, rational insight.

404
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,441
Okay, now that's the philosophical angle.

405
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:53,278
But recently, this very interesting

406
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:58,350
group of guys in Mexico
have a neuropsychiatric version

407
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,588
of Alexandra Beyonce to stage a count,
which is they explain Mr.

408
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,423
A's case.

409
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,859
You know, the man who thought that his organs have dried up and that he was dead,

410
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,363
he has insular cortex dysfunction.

411
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,966
And that insular cortex
dysfunction is the first factor.

412
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:15,901
Okay.

413
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,870
So the insular cortex
dysfunction produces

414
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,873
the experience

415
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:26,044
of depersonalization,
the feeling that that one sensory

416
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,714
experiences and cognitions that belong

417
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,817
to to the subject or that.

418
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,687
And then there's a prefrontal cortex
dysfunction

419
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,124
that produces a second
for the second factor.

420
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,361
So this is the story.

421
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,797
Look on the left,
you've got the the first stage

422
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:51,303
insular cortex produces
this anomalous, subjecting feeling state.

423
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,806
So you have hyperactive insular cortex
or maybe lesion or

424
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:59,077
neurochemical disruption, then you're
going to have insular cortex problems.

425
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,815
And that's going to lead to the feeling
that experiences are not yours

426
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:04,716
in some way.

427
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,320
That could manifest as pain,
a symbolic depersonalization,

428
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,257
or it's also in Alexa thymine,
which we didn't talk about today.

429
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,660
But in any case, that gives rise to this

430
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,765
abnormal sensory state,
or if they call it abnormal perception.

431
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,700
So something has gone
wrong with your ability

432
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,470
to feel that experiences belong to you,
thanks to your

433
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,606
insular cortex dysfunction.

434
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,075
And then if you also have

435
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:34,713
prefrontal cortical dysfunction,
then you can't explain that.

436
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,782
You have no rational insight into that.

437
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,017
And so you end up with the delusion.

438
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,888
Now, just to recap the

439
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,223
assumption here that's shared by Bill

440
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:50,328
and by Ramirez Bermudez
and his collaborators

441
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,466
is that the first stage
is essentially the same

442
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:58,136
or similar between depersonalization
experiences and cotard delusion.

443
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,707
Okay, so the anomalous experience
of depersonalization

444
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,844
with rational insight,

445
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,346
well, that's depersonalization.

446
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,483
But if you have an anomalous experience
of depersonalization

447
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,920
with no rational insight,
then you get the cotard delusion.

448
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:20,192
But and the result,
and this is because of hypo activity

449
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,161
or lesion, maybe in your insula cortex.

450
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,832
But this is
this is where I want to go today.

451
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:27,833
This is wrong.

452
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,836
This doesn't fit
with a phenomenology of Cotard syndrome

453
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,439
or the neurosis of Cotard syndrome,
which is typically

454
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,375
a profound and catastrophic

455
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,946
reconfiguration of the bodily
and effective lifeworld of the patient.

456
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:44,249
It's not a restrict
it course I perceptual deficit,

457
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:48,053
and it's not just
insular cortical dysfunction

458
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,121
because look look at

459
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:54,059
the variety of conditions
in which you see Cotard vision

460
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,262
just some affective disorder

461
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,866
schizophrenia, syphilis,
several encephalitis hemorrhage

462
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,902
malformation, brain neoplasm of cancer

463
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,271
migraine Parkinson's disease dementia.

464
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,574
This widespread

465
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,376
catastrophic

466
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,713
conditions of,
you know, neural malfunction.

467
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,682
And then you see

468
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,750
cotard delusion.

469
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,253
It's not just in just the insular cortex

470
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,556
and hypoactive. Okay.

471
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,359
And not only that, it's not just cotard
delusion.

472
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,663
It doesn't look like a just like, oh,
it feels as if I'm not here.

473
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,833
If you go back to the initial

474
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,502
description of the symptom
symptomology, it's not just

475
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:41,840
I feel like I have intact perception
and cognition,

476
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,510
but just feels like it's not mine
or I feel detached from it.

477
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:50,282
I mean, typically some of Cotard
delusion undergoes completely profound

478
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,485
and quite catastrophic

479
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,254
reconfiguration of their whole life
experience.

480
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:59,024
They feel like their body is expanding
or constricting or,

481
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,693
you know, that guy felt
as though his organs had dried up.

482
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,161
They can't sleep.

483
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:08,300
They state urination and sexual function
and everything goes to crazy.

484
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,502
Their appetite is out of whack.

485
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,471
It's a complete catastrophic breakdown.

486
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,908
Often it's progressive,
but there's no doubt about it.

487
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,743
That's a catastrophic breakdown.

488
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,880
Okay, so there's a first when

489
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,215
we can disagree
with the foundational assumption.

490
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:28,119
But at the same token
but at the same time, at that same point,

491
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,356
it is true that insula malfunction is

492
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,193
associated with Cotard
with depersonalization.

493
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,028
I beg your pardon.

494
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,730
So let's look at that first.

495
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,232
And it's also true
that insula malfunction,

496
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:45,537
among other things, is
profoundly involved in cotard delusion.

497
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,706
And I think we can see why.

498
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:50,408
And this is where active inference

499
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,811
makes its appearance and enter stage,
right?

500
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:57,482
Active inference theory, active inference
and predictive processing provide

501
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:01,586
this really nice framework to tie
all these ideas together

502
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,154
to explain depersonalization.

503
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:07,759
Cotard is symbolic and to fit together
the kind of neural correlates,

504
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,562
the phenomenology
and the symptom analogy symptomology.

505
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,463
Okay,

506
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,199
well, first,
let's let's start with the kind of

507
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,468
the restricted thing.

508
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,604
Let's talk about depersonalization.

509
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:23,341
Why would insulin
damage lead to depersonalization?

510
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,646
Why would it be the case that if you had
hypo activity in your insular cortex,

511
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,483
you would feel like your experience
wasn't happening to you?

512
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,451
It's pretty interesting.

513
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,720
An amazing sensation.

514
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:40,992
Well, the reason is that the
insular cortex, it does a lot of things.

515
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,728
You know, as they say, it's an enigmatic

516
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:48,133
and ubiquitously involved
neural structure.

517
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,267
It's very kind of deep.

518
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,537
It's kind of it receives afferents
from almost everywhere.

519
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,973
It communicates with almost
every every part of the brain.

520
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:56,041
Okay.

521
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,244
And you'll see
it involved in in so many things.

522
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,112
So it's hard to it's always
been very hard

523
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:04,916
to work out a particular function
that the insular cortex does.

524
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:05,083
Right.

525
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:09,120
It's not like, for example, looking at
part of the visual cortex that, you know,

526
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:13,425
processes wavelength information
or something like that or is involved in

527
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:15,360
this.

528
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,327
These neural circuits

529
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:19,397
are involved in determining movement
or trajectory or something like that.

530
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,098
It's not like that.

531
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:23,868
The insular cortex somehow
seems to contribute to so many things

532
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,572
as a as an integrative

533
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,908
device of integration,
and I would say as a device

534
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,776
of organization and coordination.

535
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,580
It's like a relay station actually
between all these other different things.

536
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,150
But the posterior
insular cortex is very important

537
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,320
in some out of sensory
vestibular and motor integration.

538
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,125
Okay, so that the posterior
insular cortex is basically involved,

539
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,927
I would say, in integrating

540
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,397
all the information
about what's happening in your body.

541
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,131
Right.

542
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,534
While the anterior insular cortex,
which is our real culprit

543
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:01,873
here, has present projections,
the limbic regions, which are nervous,

544
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,309
that's one of the substrates
of emotional processes

545
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:09,214
and is associated with integrating
autonomic and visceral information.

546
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,984
In other words, the basic information
about how your body is functioning.

547
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,255
My my
blood pressure, my blood acidification,

548
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,892
oxygenation, you know, state of my organs
and so forth.

549
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,530
This kind of really basic
keeping you alive, kind of information,

550
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,234
integrating that with emotional,
cognitive and motivational functions,

551
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,436
in other words, and here's the killer.

552
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,105
It brings internal signals
into consciousness and emotion,

553
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,208
interpretations
supporting the neural constructions of

554
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,979
subjective feelings.

555
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,681
So just to go

556
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,050
study for a moment.

557
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,921
So the thought that we get with people
like Budd, Craig and everything like that

558
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:55,126
is that the anterior insular cortex
basically takes all these signals

559
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,896
about what's happening on the inside,
on the inside of your body.

560
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,031
You know, my blood pressure's up.

561
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,432
My heart is beating, whatever.

562
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:07,238
My organs are functioning well or not,
and integrates that with all the other

563
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,441
cognitive systems that are telling you
what's going on outside.

564
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,677
You know, what you see,
what you hear, what you smell.

565
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,978
And the higher cognition,

566
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,447
what you remember, what you mentioned,
what thinking about.

567
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:17,315
Okay.

568
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:21,719
And it creates it integrates all this, in
other words, to kind of to allow you to

569
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:26,491
to create if you like, a representation
of how what is happening in the world

570
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,662
is interacting
with what's happening inside my body

571
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:35,133
to enable me to function
adaptively in context.

572
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,168
And as they say, well, what is that?

573
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,438
Except a sense of self,
the sense of the sense of self

574
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:44,442
or representation of the self is I'm
the thing that has to manipulate

575
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:48,046
my body around the world to interact
and engage adaptively with it.

576
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,080
And to do that,

577
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,684
I need to integrate all the information
that's relevant to that task.

578
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:53,852
That's what we need

579
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,322
a sense of self for,
and that's what the anterior insula does.

580
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,692
Anterior insula
looks down at the bodily processing,

581
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:04,329
looks out to the world
and integrates them to give you a sense

582
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:08,099
of, as I say,
subjective feeling in the moment now.

583
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,903
So with that
in place, we can see why when

584
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,206
anterior insula goes wrong

585
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:19,611
or malfunctions,
you might get a the sense

586
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,779
of not being involved in experience.

587
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,915
Now, the most

588
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,785
persuasive, I think, explanation
of how this might go wrong

589
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:31,022
is that it's a dissociative response
to trauma.

590
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,659
This comes from Medford Square and David
and the people that work on it,

591
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,729
but they explain it
in kind of emotional terms.

592
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,465
So they call it they call the result
this emotional numbing.

593
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,768
So the thought is you're having
a traumatic experience.

594
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:48,072
You're being raped or being bashed,
or maybe you're in a destructive,

595
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,575
abusive environment and

596
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,445
as a way of coping, you know, your

597
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:59,717
your your brain shuts down the anterior
cingulate cortex.

598
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,786
It just turn it it's turns it off.

599
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:02,954
And what is the result?

600
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:08,459
You still end up you still end up seeing,
feeling, thinking and so on.

601
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:12,330
But you don't have the kind of affective,
as I say, effective response or this,

602
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:18,269
as Sierra puts it, you no longer have
the emotional coloring of experience.

603
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,540
So it leads to a qualitative change
of conscious awareness,

604
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,677
which is reported by the subject
as unreal or detached.

605
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:29,681
So the basic idea is you shut down
affective processing

606
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,885
so that you can cope with extreme
distress or trauma.

607
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,021
And to shut that down,
you shut off the anterior

608
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:40,892
insular cortex so you no longer feel
that it's happening to you.

609
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,527
So you can see what you have here

610
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,530
is really an effective
or an emotional theory of

611
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:47,532
self awareness.

612
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:51,903
A basic idea is self awareness
is really created by the emotional

613
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,406
coloring of experience,
and when that is gone,

614
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,745
you end up in a emotionally monochrome
world, so to speak.

615
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:04,148
And there's some evidence
that lack of interior insulate insulates

616
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,618
related to diminished
emotional responsiveness seen in DPD,

617
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,155
and that when the insula
comes back online,

618
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:17,095
not only they restore
the affective responses, you know,

619
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,463
then they start to feel

620
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,933
that they are this feeling of detachment
and disengagement disappears.

621
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:25,670
I just made the point that this theory of

622
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,775
this theory, this inhibitory theory of

623
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,312
depersonalization is dissociative,
is actually

624
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,548
it really requires
a predictive processing framework,

625
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,485
because it's not just the fact,
for example, that

626
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,988
the subject doesn't
feel effective responses.

627
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:49,560
It is the fact that it doesn't
feel effective responses in context.

628
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,430
So conditions where they are predicted,
where they should occur

629
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,833
in a said depersonalization arises
when, you know,

630
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,971
I don't know, take take a mother
who's just given birth and then someone

631
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:05,243
gives her the child to cuddle or nurse
and she doesn't feel anything right.

632
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:09,113
Or you come home from a long trip there,
children run up and jump into your arms

633
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,481
and give you a big hug.

634
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:14,252
You don't feel anything or you know,
you hear bad news.

635
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,286
You do terrible news.

636
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,655
Someone has died or whatever.

637
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,123
Don't feel anything now.

638
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,491
It's not just that
you don't feel anything.

639
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,592
That's the problem.

640
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:22,760
It's that your mind predicts

641
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,164
that you should
your mind has this kind of ongoing model

642
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:31,102
of the world and you and you in the world
that your progress through the world

643
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,439
and your interactions with the world
will be, as I say, emotionally colored,

644
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,942
and there's emotional colorings
or affective responses

645
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,577
which get you around the world.

646
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,314
And when that's gone, right, it's
not just that it's gone.

647
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,851
So you you know,
because we have plenty of experiences

648
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,421
that are emotionally
neutral walking down the street,

649
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:54,058
you know, I don't know,
doing a tax return, reading a book.

650
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:57,962
You're not especially interested in all
that kind of jazz, listening to a talk,

651
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,797
you know, going
going to the parliament meeting

652
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,833
or that is a slightly distressing
experience.

653
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,434
But, you know you know what I mean?

654
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,602
The mere fact that there's

655
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,338
no effective response
doesn't make you feel depersonalized.

656
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:12,243
It's the loss of effective response in
a condition where your mind predicts it.

657
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,312
It's that it's the

658
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,582
it's the disjunction between or the
the contradiction

659
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,718
between there should be an effect,
and now there isn't.

660
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,623
And that's reported by and that's
that's always I feel like I'm not here.

661
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:26,824
Okay.

662
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:32,163
And so the hypothesized mechanism
is that the you in a traumatic situation

663
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,332
and it's too much for your

664
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:38,402
brain to deal with
so these inhibitory processes kick in

665
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,540
to shut down the affect your response
in the moment as a dissociative

666
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:47,645
and it's an inhibition of the anterior
insular cortex

667
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,847
by these inhibitory structures like

668
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,686
and this is exactly what I just said
why that produces

669
00:35:55,686 --> 00:36:00,024
depersonalization is because affective
experience is important in

670
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,561
in getting around life.

671
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,497
And also it's predicted
in your mind's model of

672
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,234
you acting in the world
is that you will have it

673
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,571
have affective responses to the world.

674
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,509
But here's where the affective inference
starts to kick in.

675
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:18,976
Okay.

676
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:23,381
So then the question is
how does the mind predict

677
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,083
that your progress through
the world will have

678
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,188
it will give rise
to affective experiences?

679
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,289
And how does it do that?

680
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,591
Well, I think it does

681
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,360
so in a process of what is called

682
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,530
inactive inference framework,

683
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,633
predictive processing
framework, hierarchical self modeling.

684
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,335
Okay.

685
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,705
And basically hierarchical self modeling

686
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,308
is, as I said before briefly, that

687
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,178
just as the mind

688
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:58,049
makes models
or representations of the external world,

689
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:02,687
the world out there
in terms of its causal structure

690
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,358
in the mind has to make a model of what's
going on inside the body

691
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,394
in terms of its causal structure.

692
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,563
And the way the mind does this is

693
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,466
by integrating all the properties
and features of the world

694
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:19,570
and attributing them to unified,
persisting causes.

695
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,738
Well, that's objects.

696
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:26,210
In the case of the external world, that
unified assisting causes are objects.

697
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,214
You know, you don't see smears of colors
and movements and changes.

698
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,717
You see cars driving down the railway.

699
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,853
You don't see these kind of weird
interacting shapes and properties.

700
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,656
You see people's faces smiling and so on.

701
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:43,227
So it's kind of obligatory strategy
for the mind to integrate

702
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:46,063
properties and features

703
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,599
by attributing them to underlying

704
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,602
objects or in the case of substances,

705
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,538
if you want to call it
that unified, persisting things.

706
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:55,740
Right.

707
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,142
And that's what
that's what we do in outward.

708
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:02,046
And the idea of the idea of the self
modeling framework is that's what we do

709
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,080
inward as well.

710
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,151
The mind's obligatory strategy
is to unify

711
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,755
and integrate
when there are regular, coherent,

712
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,591
predictable

713
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,893
flows and sequences

714
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,497
of experiences or sensory information.

715
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,701
The mind explains that,
if you like, interprets it predicted

716
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,405
by attributing it to the same object.

717
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,041
This happens at multiple levels, right?

718
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,709
At the most basic level,

719
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,945
you know, you have to integrate
all these different, different

720
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,082
I mean, esthetic functioning,
you know, blood pressure,

721
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,686
visceral dilation,
you know, vascular dilation,

722
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,921
all this kind of stuff
that keeps you going.

723
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:47,158
Well, actually, you don't
that is actually integrated

724
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:51,896
into by attributing all of those things
as occurring in the same entity.

725
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:56,100
And we feel the result in what
in an introspective state

726
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,537
introspection
being the internal analog of perception.

727
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:03,374
So example
which makes this point well I think is

728
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,243
fatigue, right?

729
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,279
Well, when you are fatigued.

730
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,714
Right. What do you feel?

731
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,482
You feel like I'm fatigued.

732
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,518
The thing, you know,
the embodied thing feels depleted.

733
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,121
But you don't feel

734
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,890
all these individual streams of,
you know, glycogen

735
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,461
depletion, adenosine
depletion, slow metabolism and all that,

736
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,430
you just get the kind of overall vibe of,
I'm tired

737
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,600
and that's good
because then you can go to sleep.

738
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,736
You don't have to fine tune anyway.

739
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:32,970
You can't you can't get in there

740
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,406
and change your glycogen levels
or anything like that.

741
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,540
You can just eat.

742
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,111
So hunger is another example of the kind
of introspective sensation that is,

743
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,682
you know, this does this kind of
aggregate of an integrative thing and

744
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,452
this kind of type of self modeling.

745
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,554
This is very familiar
from the predictive process

746
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,058
from from
that takes place at multiple levels

747
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,129
given the kind of imperatives
that we have to survive.

748
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,365
So let
me just spend a little bit it's okay

749
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:06,070
at the most within the act of inference
framework.

750
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:07,371
Okay.

751
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:12,810
The most basic task of any organism
self-organizing system is to

752
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,011
is to survive.

753
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,380
It has to maintain its

754
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,649
source, maintain its physical integrity,

755
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,652
you know, its boundary with the world.

756
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,854
It has to take in energy from the world.

757
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:27,391
It has to and so on has to engage with
the world, taking energy from the world.

758
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,961
And then it has to do something
with that energy to maintain itself

759
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,431
to keep all its components interacting.

760
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,833
So that's at the most basic
physical level.

761
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,372
Organisms avoid this inevitable tendency
to thermodynamic decay

762
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:46,677
that we all face, and the probabilistic
and analog of that is they avoid entropy.

763
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:50,614
They have to keep themselves
in a state far, far

764
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,984
from entropy
by taking in energy and using it.

765
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,954
And of course, at the biological level,
what does that actually mean?

766
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,658
That means staying alive, surviving,
prospering in the world.

767
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,561
And the most
when we look at the physiology

768
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,596
and then

769
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,799
obviously we're talking
about homeostatic mechanisms,

770
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,402
we're talking about mechanisms of self
maintenance

771
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,571
for a

772
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:18,843
for a discrete, unique individual,
so to speak.

773
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,812
Now, they can be able to see cases where

774
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:25,783
borderline case

775
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:29,186
of promise homeostasis, where, you know,

776
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,655
where organisms are dependent
on other organisms.

777
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,558
For example, there are lots of cases
where there's a kind of, you know,

778
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:35,926
crisscrossing of boundaries.

779
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,496
But let's keep it simple for the moment.

780
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,699
Think of a cell or think of an organism.

781
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:45,069
Got to maintain their
their basic functioning.

782
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,972
And that's what we refer
to as homeostasis, or at least this

783
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,643
slightly larger,
more sophisticated concept.

784
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,079
So these are the kind of basic
physical imperatives.

785
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,516
But of course, to do that,
there has to be a lot of signaling

786
00:41:58,749 --> 00:41:59,683
within the system.

787
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,721
You know, the levels of levels
of endocrine function, levels of blood

788
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,690
pressure, levels of blood oxygenation,
they are signaled

789
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,462
to a brain or proto brain or mind,
if you want to call it that.

790
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:15,266
And that signaling, okay, that signaling

791
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,968
requires that the organism

792
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:23,340
in some sense implement or maintain the
model which predicts what is

793
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:25,743
what is

794
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,680
optimal for
it, how far it's departing from optimal,

795
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,816
and whether the actions
that it's taking to get back into

796
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,787
optimal range are successful.

797
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:41,592
And when it can do that,
when it can successfully model itself,

798
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:44,762
then it's minimizing
what they call variational free energy.

799
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,233
And the surprise here
just refers to the departure from

800
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,971
the predicted optimal state,
given the organisms action.

801
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:58,409
Now, if that sounds too abstract,
just think, you know, here's your brain

802
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:03,747
and you're writing up your saying to ride
your bike up a hill or walk up stairs,

803
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,850
and you have a kind of good optimal

804
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,587
range of heartbeat function and blood
oxygenation.

805
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,090
Okay, but that needs to change now
because you're walking upstairs, right?

806
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,492
You need to
you need more oxygen in your blood.

807
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,795
You need to work harder
and raise your heartbeat.

808
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,297
So your mind sense, if you like.

809
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,833
Brain sends instructions, right? Happy.

810
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,604
This is all at the kind of signaling
level that's quite dynamic.

811
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,273
If your heartbeat goes up, that's good.

812
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,508
It should be up
when you're going upstairs

813
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,510
and it should be up
if you're riding a bike up a hill.

814
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,913
So you've minimized know free energy.

815
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,015
You've stayed within your optimal bound.

816
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:41,151
Okay, in not getting in the information
that's out of

817
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,989
out of the kind of predicted

818
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:48,392
and that violates a prediction model
for that situation.

819
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:52,196
But let's say that
you come back downstairs and you sit down

820
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:57,001
and you're resting and having a drink
and your heartbeat is still rising.

821
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,236
Well, that's outside optimal range.

822
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,171
That's not what your

823
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,642
body and mind,
you know, predict for that situation.

824
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,077
Your brain
thinking your brain doesn't do well.

825
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,512
Your brain doesn't think that.

826
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,681
And now are signals saying
this is out of kilter.

827
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:14,118
I'm sitting on my couch and I have
it is 200 or under.

828
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,821
I'm sweating, sweating furiously,
but I'm not riding my bike.

829
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,391
Okay. And it's not 40 degrees outside.

830
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:21,692
What's going on?

831
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,828
I've got a lot of signaling
going on all the time

832
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:29,133
about whether and how you are optimizing
your bodily function.

833
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:32,169
And so that just at the level
of signaling and some

834
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,539
that's very, very dynamic and leads
these kind of automatic adjustments.

835
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,609
But of course at a higher
level when you talk about

836
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,979
cognition, well, what

837
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,581
they can think of the mind
or as what we call cognition

838
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:49,186
as a construction of sort
of representational computation systems

839
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,223
that exploit
these informational properties

840
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:57,127
or that organized states, intimate,
emotional and signaling properties

841
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,797
so that we end up
with a representational architecture.

842
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:04,868
That's how we get perception, memory,
sensory, motor control and so on.

843
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,370
And what

844
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,574
that's what the theory of computation
gives us for understanding the mind.

845
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:14,078
It gives us what
the theory of computation basically is

846
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:19,383
and its most abstract is turning
information information and signaling

847
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:23,454
into representation
representations that can be manipulated.

848
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,490
Okay, translate these abstract ideas

849
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,594
into the idea of self modeling.

850
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:36,533
And we get something like this,
we get at the very basic level

851
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,870
of organismic function.

852
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,106
Then you have
an esthetic or a homeostatic

853
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,041
integration.

854
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,777
Your mind is kind of,
you know, your brain is looking around,

855
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,514
am I in or out of
am I in or out of optimal functioning?

856
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:54,084
All this signaling is going on
and what we call into reception

857
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,421
is the integration of those processes,

858
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,491
okay, which attributes them to the thing

859
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,527
which is being regulated
the same, which is being managed.

860
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,830
Okay. The thing in which all of these

861
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:10,768
processes have to cohere
to enable adaptive functioning.

862
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,903
And then we get a readout of that.

863
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,438
And the readout is your intercept.

864
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,673
You feel fatigue,
you know, if you feel tired,

865
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:21,311
that's because, you know, glycogen
depletion, adenosine levels

866
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:24,581
have changed, your metabolism is slow,
blah, blah, blah.

867
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,684
Muscles are weaker
and not contracting as fast.

868
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:32,856
And you feel that as fatigue,
as it's integration of all of those

869
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,992
allosteric variables.

870
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,861
And that happens
basically the job of the posterior

871
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:41,732
insular cortex written
there API is to do that.

872
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,500
That's all that stuff coheres, right?

873
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,004
That's where all of that stuff coheres.

874
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,306
Then of course
there's not just the issue of

875
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,277
how is my body functioning?

876
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,078
That's one thing.

877
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:58,148
It's my body just, well, yeah,
that's important to note.

878
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:02,553
But then there's a separate
kind of what we might call

879
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:05,355
high level
issue of the meaning and signifier sense

880
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:10,260
of those bodily processes
for you in context, right?

881
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,865
So if your heart is racing
and you are riding a bike up a hill

882
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,502
or going forward in the gym,
that's a good thing.

883
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:19,970
But that shouldn't cause you

884
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,539
any particular distress
you'll feel that is exhaustion.

885
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:27,544
But if your heartbeat is racing
because you're waiting for your cancer

886
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:30,948
test, you know,
and the doctor has just come back,

887
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,784
just come out of his office
and he's looking at the

888
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:37,120
he's looking at your chart
and he's looking at your

889
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:38,822
is looking at your

890
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:42,426
ultrasound
with a look of concern and worry.

891
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,895
Now your heart is racing, right?

892
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:45,662
Why is it racing?

893
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,098
Because you're worried that you've got
worried that you might have cancer.

894
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:49,399
That's a different thing.

895
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,501
But the point is
that the feeling is different.

896
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:55,906
The feeling of worry, distress,
anticipatory anxiety.

897
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,910
Well,
that is characterized by racing heartbeat

898
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,246
and and feelings of tension and so on.

899
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,982
But that's the same bodily signature
that you can get

900
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:08,051
when you're powering uphill on your bike
or, you know, or something like that.

901
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,990
So the level of copy in itself
is, as it were, you know, effectively

902
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:17,094
or emotionally neutral,
what that level of heartbeat depends on

903
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:20,497
and how it
and how you should react to it.

904
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,934
Well, that's a product of that kind
of emotional context.

905
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,738
And to understand the emotional context,
that's when you need to bring in

906
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,308
the rest of your perceptual memory
and so on, faculties

907
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:36,280
and indeed your self representation,
how I am functioning in the world.

908
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:41,551
And so to do that you need to interpret

909
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:45,055
or I put it here, transcribe
those bodily feelings

910
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:50,060
into emotional feelings of sadness
or anxiety or whatever they are.

911
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,364
I've given the example here of fatigue
because it comes up later,

912
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,566
but it's also a good one, right?

913
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:59,503
If you're fatigued, you know,
if you're just tired

914
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,638
or that is a certain bodily feeling,
no doubt about it.

915
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:05,642
But If you're depressed, you know
someone who's got persistent depression.

916
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,144
They also feel fatigued.

917
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:12,482
They feel tired, lethargic, apathetic,
unmotivated, energetic,

918
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:16,620
but fatigue in an episode or sorry,
the energy bodily.

919
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,191
Deanna Judge the bodily energy ization
in an episode of

920
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:25,529
sadness is experienced differently
to just fatigue.

921
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:27,831
That's the point. Right. And why is that?

922
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,800
Because in an episode of Sadness

923
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,769
The World and your prospects

924
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:36,640
in it have been appraised or evaluated
or colonized.

925
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,875
Choose your term.

926
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,245
That is because your
your mind has basically determined

927
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:47,517
that the world for you is a sort of
irretrievable dis consolation.

928
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:50,554
You know, there's losses in there
that you can't recover or recapture.

929
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,223
And of course, so

930
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,994
that produces the feelings of sadness.

931
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:58,829
Okay. So

932
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,499
why does this so

933
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:06,870
when we translate it into self modeling,
you've got the kind of physical level

934
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,507
of bodily functioning and that kind of
homeostatic and signaling stuff.

935
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:14,578
But then in order to interpret
the significance of all of those changes,

936
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,545
you need a model.

937
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:19,616
The mind needs a model of your organism
and how it's functioning in the world

938
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,218
and what it should expect from the world

939
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:24,121
and the kind of affective consequences
that it should get from the world.

940
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:25,489
And so it makes

941
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:28,291
multilevel

942
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,660
self model at the most basic level,

943
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,731
at the most basic level
that the mind models itself

944
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:39,636
as an as a unified entity

945
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,273
in which
all of these bodily signals cohere.

946
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,643
And then it can use that model
to regulate the body.

947
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:50,447
You can go to sleep if you're tired
at a higher level, slightly.

948
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:56,253
The mind models itself as the entity
that has these feelings, these feelings

949
00:50:56,253 --> 00:51:00,090
of these affective feelings,
these feelings of sadness, anxiety,

950
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,959
or these feelings of happiness,
pleasure, resentment,

951
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,263
you know, all these subtle feelings
that are modulated by your actions

952
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,964
as you go through the world.

953
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:11,568
So just as you need a model of the
the bodily functioning

954
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,304
to model the body at a basic level,

955
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,040
to control once, to cut,
to get through the world

956
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,043
while we get through the world
by acting to manipulate our feelings. So

957
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:25,982
we need a higher level model of our self
as the subject of affective states.

958
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:27,884
And here's

959
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:31,254
to at the higher that's still higher
level still,

960
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:35,125
we report those feelings
in a kind of verbal narrative way.

961
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,561
You know, I'm late for work.

962
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:41,965
I'm studying,
I'm studying, I'm practicing gymnastics.

963
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,834
You know, I'm married, etc.,
all these things.

964
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:47,404
Well, this is just the kind
of the high level narrative self model

965
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,873
that we use to report our feeling.

966
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,142
We used to report our states
and communicate them

967
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:53,543
and engage with other people.

968
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,378
And so we engage at this narrative level.

969
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:58,281
There's a narrative level, self model
that's kind of linguistic,

970
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,586
but the narrative level self model
is supported by a affective

971
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:06,523
or emotional level because as we engage
with other people and report our states,

972
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:07,124
what we're doing

973
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:11,027
is doing that to change how it changes
the way we feel, feel better

974
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,398
and at a still lower level,
those affective feelings, what are they?

975
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,634
They are transcribed bodily feelings.

976
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,004
That is to say, I emotionally interpreted
bodily feelings.

977
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:26,443
So the the self model is a hierarchies
hierarchical basic level.

978
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:30,547
It's it's understood at a higher level
it's bodily as interpreted

979
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:33,683
for its emotional significance
and at the highest level, it's narrative.

980
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,786
Now here's your here's the hypothesis

981
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:40,223
about all these disorders

982
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:44,494
in a cotard delusion, the self model
just disintegrates from the bottom up.

983
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,697
It just falls to bits,
it falls to bits at the

984
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,700
physical level right.

985
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,037
And in other words, this
the system becomes

986
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:58,808
unregulated and unpredictable,
but the mind is sending

987
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:03,747
is mind is sending signals control, sleep
control, appetite control, metabolism

988
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,950
control movement in a get up to. But

989
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,152
they're not getting any traction.

990
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,921
They're not getting any feedback.

991
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:14,357
They the whole kind of modeling
structure is disintegrated

992
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:18,361
so that what the mind learns
so that the mind actually

993
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,232
can't make and model, which predicts
the functioning of the organism.

994
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:26,203
It still has this kind of sensations
of organism function, but they're not

995
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,873
integrated, unified and model
as belonging to a continuum thing

996
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:34,077
because and that's precisely
because that model is made

997
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,379
for the purposes of regulation, right?

998
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,749
And when the mind
and when the body becomes

999
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:44,287
whole, the mind learns that there is no

1000
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,591
there is no model that's going to predict
and regulate its behavior.

1001
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,995
And so, in other words, if you think of
the self as a model that the

1002
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:56,433
the mind makes at the most basic level
for regulatory purposes,

1003
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,970
then when it's,
when it's completely unregulated,

1004
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,072
the mind learns that there is
no model that can do the job.

1005
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:03,807
Okay.

1006
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:08,979
We won't say, oh, it's yep.

1007
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,481
So that's the
that's my explanation of Cotard.

1008
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,415
Okay.

1009
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,652
Well, but in depersonalization, it's
not quite like that

1010
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:19,422
because in depersonalization, basically
the model is intact.

1011
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,925
Okay, the model is intact.

1012
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,426
You've got kind of

1013
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,595
control over bodily functioning,

1014
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,565
you've got cognition, perception
and so on or working.

1015
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:34,537
But the only thing is that the affective
processes have been inhibited.

1016
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,641
So this kind of you're seeing the world
failing the world

1017
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,709
touching and engaging with the world.

1018
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:43,113
But there's no
effective responses to the world

1019
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:47,350
because they've been shut down
for as a dissociative response.

1020
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:51,454
So now you've got an intact self model,
but you can't annex

1021
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,758
or incorporate affective states into it.

1022
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:59,963
So that's why independent physician
people feel as though they feel as though

1023
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,400
their bodies the same, their perceptual
and sensory motor states are the same,

1024
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,270
and their narrative ability
to report that think about that.

1025
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,041
You know, the high level of cognitive
states and narrative reportage,

1026
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:15,011
they are intact, but effect is missing.

1027
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,213
Effect has been, if you like,

1028
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:20,016
detached or taken out of this model
that's otherwise intact.

1029
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:24,721
And that feels as if they don't they feel
detached on the outside of experience.

1030
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:28,558
That's why they they say they report
they feel as if they don't exist,

1031
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,461
but they don't say they don't exist
because the models, still

1032
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:35,732
the model is basically intact
just with this subtraction

1033
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:39,235
of its affective component ability
now pain.

1034
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:44,541
And that is as a result of unpredicted
deactivation of the anterior insula

1035
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:48,078
because anterior insulates precisely
the structure that it integrates,

1036
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:53,249
all the processing that does
the evaluative emotional processes

1037
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,720
and produces affective responses

1038
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,621
in pain symbolic,

1039
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,025
which is reported
as a kind of restricted depersonalization

1040
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:04,027
that is actually a problem
at the lower level

1041
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:08,231
because pain symbolic is a problem at the
the lower level of the posterior

1042
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:11,634
insular cortex,
which is more at the level of the sensory

1043
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,604
integration,
not the emotional interpretation.

1044
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:18,675
So in pain I symbolic nociceptive signals

1045
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:22,846
are not incorporated in the bodily self,
incorporated in the bodily self model.

1046
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:24,848
So that's a kind of early process.

1047
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:28,918
So once again, in pain symbolically
you've got an intact self model,

1048
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,188
bodily
self model, affective and narrative,

1049
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:36,726
but somehow nociceptive signals aren't
being incorporated into that model.

1050
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:40,096
So and since they're not incorporated
into the model at all,

1051
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,699
then they won't be transcribed.

1052
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:45,602
Effective levels of self
modeling and then and then

1053
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,472
the mind is left with, well,

1054
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:52,475
I'm experiencing nice deceptive signals,

1055
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:54,644
but I'm not.

1056
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:58,248
They're not incorporated in the kind
of bodily self model at the basic level.

1057
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,518
So they're not mine, so to speak.

1058
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,920
I'm anthropomorphizing
on behalf of the brain here

1059
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:07,090
and then, since they're not incorporated
in the bodily self model,

1060
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,692
they're not going to be effectively
interpreted,

1061
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,896
interpreted at higher levels
of emotional self modeling.

1062
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,533
And once again, the subject is left
at this kind of narrative level,

1063
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,669
just reporting
on the subsequent experience.

1064
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,838
It feels like the pain is not happening.

1065
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,374
To me. Okay.

1066
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,509
And so is this self modeling theory.

1067
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:29,279
Well, this self
modeling theory comes from, of course,

1068
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:33,650
effective, sorry, active inference
and predictive processing theories.

1069
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,317
Right.

1070
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,220
And this is from Seth and Friston.

1071
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,123
You know, they say that on
this theory of introspective

1072
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:45,261
slide here, we're going to really

1073
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,064
this theory of

1074
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,999
things are generated at the bottom level

1075
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:53,970
by this kind of successive interpretation
in terms of models

1076
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,673
which are ultimately top down
and within this framework.

1077
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,378
And so, as I said, the anterior
insular cortex is specialized to allow us

1078
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:06,115
to integrate information about body
state, to feel its significance.

1079
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:11,087
And the point about the self modeling
theory is those feelings of significance

1080
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:15,692
or fictive feelings are attributed
to a unified, persisting entity.

1081
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,495
The self just the self model.

1082
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,164
I'm just rehearsing, repeating here
what I've said.

1083
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,434
Okay.

1084
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:27,003
And as I say,
this is another way to put it.

1085
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:30,039
What I've just said, emotion
and embodied selfhood are grounded

1086
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,075
in active inference of those signals.

1087
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,309
Most likely to be made.

1088
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,446
In other
words, as you go through the world,

1089
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:41,117
your mind needs to model
the consequences of your actions

1090
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:46,222
and the consequences of those actions
are going to be, you know, introspective,

1091
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:50,126
internal, bodily, and also
they're going to be emotional and affect.

1092
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,763
And so at any given time,
we have a self model

1093
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:59,602
which is predicting how our actions
with the world will make us feel

1094
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:03,473
and what the kind of sensory
consequences of those actions will be

1095
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:09,178
at all levels from homeostasis, body
integrity, body integrity and so forth.

1096
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:12,315
And as they say, the metacognitive
cognitive and narrative.

1097
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:16,819
Right, or as I've put it, to simplify,
you've got kind of basic bodily self

1098
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:20,957
you've got and that gets transcribed,
interpreted as a

1099
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,260
fictive or emotional self.

1100
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,264
And then at the top level, we report
and communicate that with the narrative.

1101
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:32,502
So basically the self
is there to serve as to

1102
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:36,272
to represent the source of endogenous
signals arising from inside

1103
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,242
and to be the target
of internal regulation.

1104
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,112
And this, this goes back into
Craig's papers in the early

1105
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:45,882
2000.

1106
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:49,452
That put it this way, that, you know,
within the posterior insula that does

1107
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:54,223
the basic bodily stuff, you know,
heartbeat, oxygenation, energy depletion,

1108
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,860
and then those representations of basic
body state

1109
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,864
get progressively and progressively
remapped at higher levels

1110
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:06,569
exploding more, more, higher
and a modal cognitive processes.

1111
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:10,907
Until we get to the anterior insula,
the anterior insula has to communicate

1112
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:14,310
with these other systems of perception,
memory, inference, imagination

1113
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:18,615
to tell you the experience,
to tell you what to tell you sorry.

1114
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,685
What the the meaning, the significance
of all these bodily changes is

1115
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:27,090
and should these bodily changes,
are they adaptive in this situation?

1116
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,491
I'm riding my bike uphill.

1117
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:31,928
I had been on my heart's racing when I'm

1118
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:34,530
when I'm having a conversation
with my wife, this is bad.

1119
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,600
This is kind of anxiety and so forth.

1120
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:39,936
Okay, I can skip that.

1121
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:44,273
This is just, you know, to say
that the anterior and posterior insula,

1122
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,877
you know, they are hubs,
they are not a place where

1123
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,980
they are not the kind of
there's not like a self module,

1124
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,950
a bodily self module in a affective self
module.

1125
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,953
It's more
that they are kind of integrative hubs

1126
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,156
that basically direct
traffic is a good way to put on it.

1127
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:03,159
Or another way to think of it
is they like the read write head on a

1128
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:04,994
on a cheering machine. Right.

1129
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,563
They're coordinating and doing stuff.

1130
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:11,768
They're integrating stuff across them,
across the brain to this particular task.

1131
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:12,669
All right.

1132
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:17,106
And and they communicate with other hubs,
the prefrontal and amygdala,

1133
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,541
which are very important

1134
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:22,979
for collecting for the evaluation,
you know, the prefrontal cortex,

1135
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,849
more about collecting information
for at the kind of conceptual level,

1136
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:30,953
you know, thinking about, you know, is
my have I have

1137
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:35,091
I offended someone is that why they said
why the angry or ignoring with me?

1138
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,493
Is that because of that kind of thing?

1139
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,263
Whereas the amygdala
is more like coordinating information

1140
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:44,167
about basic perceptually driven stuff,
you know, someone raises their voice or

1141
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:45,935
puts on an angry expression, and

1142
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:49,572
within a couple of hundred milliseconds,
I feel a response to that.

1143
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,873
So all right.

1144
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:55,278
So so we're going to summarize, right?

1145
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:59,048
These are just a couple of quotations
about the insula from various things

1146
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,251
can. Let's just read one.

1147
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,153
Right,
the convergence of multimodal sensory

1148
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:07,890
information and ability
to read out subjective states explains

1149
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,860
the insula is intimately involved
in affective processing.

1150
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,928
Correct.

1151
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:12,328
Okay.

1152
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,664
It's functionally important
for further treatment.

1153
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:15,732
Certainly an information

1154
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,402
and interfacing between physiology
and higher order cognitive systems.

1155
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:22,538
And that's
why it's so functionally ubiquitous

1156
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,540
and connected with so many things.

1157
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,609
To form a silence detection network.

1158
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,412
It allows us to feel how things matter,

1159
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:33,483
like they're done within the predictive
processing and active inference.

1160
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,451
It's not just you feel salience.

1161
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:38,454
Salience means salient to me,

1162
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,624
relevant to the organism
and its prospects.

1163
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,660
But it's something can be salient

1164
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,830
unless it's relevant to a goal, relevant,

1165
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,501
relevant to a goal of survival
or of salient to a goal of, you know,

1166
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:55,238
maintaining social relationships
or achieving some ambition.

1167
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:58,274
So salience is not something in itself.

1168
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,844
Salience is relative to particular goals
of organismic survival

1169
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:04,480
or organism clustering at various levels.

1170
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:08,518
And in order to do that, my needs,
the model itself

1171
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:12,688
as the bearer of the goals
as the thing is, is prospering or not.

1172
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,190
Is it affected by its actions?

1173
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:18,227
Now he's the thought that is ethic.

1174
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:21,297
If you have just like
you have bodily states like interception,

1175
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:26,169
you have affected
states like anxiety or depression.

1176
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:30,439
And what they what those states do
is they tell you

1177
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,409
how your prospering, they tell you
how you're prospering bodily

1178
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:37,680
and they tell you how you prospering
emotionally, which is great.

1179
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,449
And the good thing about that is

1180
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:44,253
then you can act like you can perform
your active inference

1181
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,456
of arguing the world
for solutions, of moving around

1182
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:50,827
and sampling sensations
and trying out activities and so forth.

1183
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:55,464
All this kind of ways of engaging
with the world that is going to optimize

1184
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,402
your ability to build a model of yourself
as a functioning system,

1185
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,739
but you don't actually have to fine tune

1186
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,076
all that kind of the mechanisms
and low level systems.

1187
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,645
And that's good because we count, right?

1188
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:13,950
So if you think about fatigue,
I cannot go in and change the metabolism

1189
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:14,851
of all my cells.

1190
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,955
I can't go in and change adenosine levels
and I can't change the balance

1191
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:21,858
of serotonin and acetylcholine
across my brain.

1192
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,293
But I can go to sleep.

1193
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,196
So I manage the feeling of exhaustion

1194
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:31,133
and then I wake up feeling better,
having optimized my optimize

1195
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:35,371
my organism, optimize
my organism by manage my feelings.

1196
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:39,609
And similarly, at a sort of higher level
of the emotional functioning,

1197
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:44,914
I optimize my organism by managing
affective or emotional feelings.

1198
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,917
So, you know,
if I actually said I was full of life

1199
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:51,854
and I need to avoid the context
that makes me sad.

1200
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,424
If I feel happy,
then I'll keep doing what I'm doing,

1201
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:56,492
you know,

1202
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,828
if I feel amused or interested
or engaged,

1203
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:02,665
then that'll lead me to kind of pursue
and keep performing the actions

1204
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:05,001
that are rewarding and so on and so on.

1205
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:08,204
And so life then becomes

1206
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,773
a matter of acting to regulate effect

1207
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,542
by active inference as a proxy

1208
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,980
for minimizing predictive error or in
other words, optimizing organism function

1209
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,149
across the

1210
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:22,318
functioning of the organism.

1211
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,788
So in other words and the self here is
the thing is

1212
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:29,091
the self is modeled as the thing
which sustains these feelings.

1213
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:33,996
And the thing is feelings can be changed
by active inference or action.

1214
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:36,032
Then that's the role of the self.

1215
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:40,202
The role of the self is to be the entity
that we can manipulate.

1216
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:48,811
Okay, so in this sense, active inference

1217
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,748
is like a proxy
for overall organismic regulation.

1218
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:54,116
Okay.

1219
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:58,955
So the self, the feeling of being the
feeling of being a unified, persisting

1220
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:03,326
self allows us to get through the world
by manipulating our feelings.

1221
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:06,529
So the self model, it's like the airplane

1222
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:09,632
icon on a control panel on a plane

1223
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:14,937
or a pilot flight, a Boeing 737
or four seven or whatever.

1224
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:19,208
But manipulating the controls
and I can see on his panel

1225
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:23,779
now the little model of the plane
banking or going up and down.

1226
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:24,981
Well, that's great,

1227
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,617
because the pilot has no access
to the electronics, the software,

1228
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,886
the hydraulics,
you know, all the mechanisms. Right.

1229
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,090
Pilot and pilots are going to go back
down to the tail

1230
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:37,126
and try and change the ailerons
or anything like that.

1231
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:39,028
And the pilot's
not going to go in there and,

1232
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:43,332
you know, mess around with the software
of the computer that controls the system.

1233
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,800
That's all delegated, right?

1234
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:49,105
That's the way them all the pilot has
to do is manipulate the icon.

1235
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:51,040
And that's what we have to do.

1236
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,676
We have to just act to make ourself
feel better.

1237
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,948
And the self is just the target
that regulatory actions.

1238
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:00,750
Let's get

1239
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,918
this now because I think I'm actually

1240
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,389
finished. I'm really running out of time.

1241
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:09,592
So to sum up for our case of the art of

1242
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:12,528
the Cotard Delusion,
and these are the things

1243
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,098
well, in the Cotard delusion,
what happens is you have a version

1244
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:20,102
of what these theorists step
on an alcohol catastrophic dysregulation.

1245
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:24,473
So in the case of MDMA, encephalitis,
right,

1246
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,144
cellular metabolic function,
the whole thing is kind of

1247
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:32,048
out of whack because of this pervasive
inflammation across the brain.

1248
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:36,085
And so there can't be any kind of low
level signaling that's working.

1249
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,421
And at the time
a representation of levels.

1250
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:43,359
You won't getting any kind of consistent,
accurate representations

1251
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,228
when it's kind of converted
into computational language.

1252
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:51,700
So the brain is distributable,
the body is distributable.

1253
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:57,406
So the system learns the system learns
that as a regulatory system,

1254
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:02,044
as a target of regulation,
it doesn't exist.

1255
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:04,814
Of course it's that
is that just to say this

1256
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:08,350
model disappears,
but you can still feel your body.

1257
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:12,922
It's just that those feelings
want integrated into or model

1258
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:17,593
of something that you can change
and regulate and predict and anticipate.

1259
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,896
Okay, so let's call it dysregulation.

1260
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:25,234
So I thought about that, my final slide,
and it's got a typo on it.

1261
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,269
So I'll change that after this. But

1262
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:32,441
just to remind you and I'll close up now
because we need to talk about Descartes

1263
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,377
famously said
that it's like hunger and thirst.

1264
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:39,448
They teach us that we're not present
in our bodies as a sailor, his ship,

1265
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,018
but we are closely
joined and intermingled with it.

1266
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:46,589
So I compose a single thing with my body.

1267
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,657
In my body, I feel like I in my body,

1268
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,495
we might say within predictive
processing, that the experience

1269
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,865
of being the subject of introspective
and effective experiences

1270
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:59,101
produces the feeling of the inference

1271
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:02,171
that those experiences
belong to a simple, unified thing.

1272
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:06,075
And the more that I succeed
in controlling myself

1273
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:09,979
by regulating my experiences,
introspective and effective experiences,

1274
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,781
the more I learn that I am that thing.

1275
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,283
You know, when I eat, I'm satiated.

1276
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:18,354
When I achieve a goal, I'm happy
and I'm worried and I result my worries.

1277
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:22,892
But states of intractable
dis homeostasis teach us the reverse.

1278
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,862
In severe
cases like in the case of lettuce,

1279
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:32,034
the mind has to end up learns
that there's no viable regulatory target

1280
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,104
because experience is chaotic
and unpredictable.

1281
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:37,706
So you can't keep entropy at bay

1282
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,043
right now

1283
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,280
and keep entropy at bay
at the most basic level.

1284
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,316
By having a kind of model that works,

1285
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,419
then your biological functioning

1286
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:53,389
messed up
and you've got no physiological control.

1287
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:55,391
All the signaling goes to pieces.

1288
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:55,891
You can't

1289
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:59,862
minimize variational free energy, and
that is at the representational level.

1290
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,764
The self model disintegrates.

1291
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:05,734
There's no kind of self model
that predictably enables you

1292
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:10,472
to regulate yourself, and you're
just with this kind of chaotic experience

1293
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:14,243
and the cotard delusion which you report
with the kind of the shadow

1294
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:18,380
that's all you've got
left, is a linguistic functioning

1295
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,453
you've just got linguistic functioning.

1296
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:30,859
Looks like
you just got the reporting talking.

1297
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,729
So that one Cotard patient famously said,

1298
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,534
I'm just a voice,
and if that goes, I won't be anything.

1299
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:42,037
If my voice goes, I'll be lost
and I won't know where I've gone.

1300
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:45,541
So the patients,
this is the patient's only response

1301
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:49,578
to this intractable sense
of bodily affective entropy.

1302
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:51,447
The center, the narrative.

1303
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:55,651
I completely disconnected
from the structure of bodily ineffective

1304
01:10:55,651 --> 01:11:00,256
experiences that normally anchor it
because this model has fallen to pieces.

1305
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,459
And I should stop there because

1306
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:07,096
I've been going for a long time.

1307
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:07,563
Thank you.

1308
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:12,334
I did read and we can talk a little bit.

1309
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:15,504
It's just as long as you'd like.

1310
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:16,171
Yeah, sure.

1311
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:21,810
Same buttons to share
and then you a cool.

1312
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,978
I wrote down a ton of stuff.

1313
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:26,682
There were some questions in the chat,
so thanks for the awesome talk.

1314
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,852
I'll start with one of Dave's.

1315
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,954
So Dave had written

1316
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:37,259
does your evolutionary and neurological
exploration of delusion especially of the

1317
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:40,963
pathologies of the prefrontal cortex,
functional connectivity

1318
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:44,300
preclude the validity
of psychological approaches.

1319
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,470
Or how do psychological
and psychosocial approaches

1320
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:52,241
benefit from a corporate incorporating
these kinds of methods and findings?

1321
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,511
Okay. Well, that's a very good question.

1322
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,913
I don't think they preclude at all right.

1323
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,849
I think the I think they're vital
to psychological approach.

1324
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:05,587
I mean, I did write a chapter in a book
I wrote a while about this, but

1325
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:10,826
I don't there's a bad tendency
in psychiatry in the world

1326
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:13,062
to think, okay,
you've got psychological approaches,

1327
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:16,532
you've got people's thoughts, experiences
and feelings, and then you have

1328
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,335
the kind of things
that biological psychiatry does,

1329
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,905
you know, molecular level interventions
with receptors and serotonin,

1330
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,874
and that they never
they never talk to each other.

1331
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:26,141
Right.

1332
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,811
And so you have a disease
model of mental illness

1333
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:32,815
and you have a psychosocial model
of mental illness in all this.

1334
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:35,517
But clearly, that's wrong. Right.

1335
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:39,188
And it's got to be wrong
because if you think of think of a

1336
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:42,391
just an example like astigmatism or,

1337
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:45,094
you know, macular degeneration,

1338
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,564
that's something that you experience
at a personal

1339
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:52,534
and experiential level as, you know,
loss of part of your visual field.

1340
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:56,638
If you've got a black spot in your visual
field, that affects how you experience

1341
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:59,174
the world, how you get around it,
how you interact with other people.

1342
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:03,879
And there's a mechanical explanation
there, which is in terms of,

1343
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:08,250
you know, the visual visual cortex
or the retina or

1344
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,387
and the capillaries and all that in that.

1345
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,154
Okay.

1346
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:15,023
Well, why why would it be the case?

1347
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:19,261
And if someone said to you, oh, well,
look, you know, we could only have

1348
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,830
like a personal level and

1349
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:24,500
experiential, phenomenological account of

1350
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:28,270
of visual experience.

1351
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,205
You'd say that was mad.

1352
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:33,542
So I want to go to the eye specialist
and he knows all about, you know,

1353
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,010
how diabetes produces.

1354
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,846
It's because we have a mechanical thing,
but not only that

1355
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,016
the mechanical explanation

1356
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:44,353
depends on a computational explanation
of how a vision works.

1357
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,157
These cells in the retina
get bombarded by photons.

1358
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,927
They forget in the mind,
progressively reconstructs

1359
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:56,432
an image of the image
of the causes of that bombardment.

1360
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,734
And that's how visual experience.

1361
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:02,571
So I can tell you why
macular degeneration at any level, at the

1362
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:05,974
level of the retina or why visual cortex
is going to affect your experience.

1363
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,010
And we think that's all in order.

1364
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,078
And we think that's
exactly the way to do it.

1365
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,314
Why wouldn't we think

1366
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:14,983
of that for the Cotard delusion or for

1367
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,720
or for,

1368
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,423
you know, any psychiatric disorder,
anxiety or whatever?

1369
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:25,627
It's not that you've got
this kind of autonomous level of

1370
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:31,433
autonomous level of, you know, molecular
level interventions, and then you've got

1371
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:34,203
some phenomenological level of experience
and thinking.

1372
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:37,439
I mean, one depends on one,
it depends on the other.

1373
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,609
I just think that's like that. Yes.

1374
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:43,579
So in my view,
the right what we're trying to do is

1375
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,182
is try and understand what's happening
in the intervening level.

1376
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,250
And that's what

1377
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:52,221
areas of visual processing do you know
are you got artificial theories

1378
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:55,123
and you've got neurological theories
and they come together

1379
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:59,461
and that's what the active inference
self modeling theory is supposed to do.

1380
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:03,098
In these cases
of pathologies, of self-awareness,

1381
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:05,801
you have a kind of experience
of your self has changed,

1382
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:10,272
and we know that that's because something
is happening in your body and brain.

1383
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,342
How are we supposed to explain that?

1384
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,446
We're not just correlate the change
in experience with the low level cold?

1385
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:20,883
We want to say that's
because these changes in your body

1386
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:24,753
and brain are organized
to do this information processing.

1387
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,756
The computational
representational functions.

1388
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:32,895
And when you get these low level changes,
they compromise this functioning,

1389
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:36,932
this computational level,
working with the result

1390
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:38,600
that you have these experiences.

1391
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,735
And it goes the other way.

1392
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:42,070
You know, when someone
you get information from the world,

1393
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,240
it has to filter all the way down

1394
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,442
by being represented process somehow.

1395
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,912
You know, we have to take a

1396
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:53,982
stand on the nature of the the nature
of the computation, whether it's wide,

1397
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:58,921
narrow, symbolic neural network,
whatever that's ongoing project.

1398
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,456
So that's my it's
my thoughts on that topic.

1399
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:03,525
Thank you

1400
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,862
so the next question is from Dean,
who wrote,

1401
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:11,266
does this
does the disassociation of feelings

1402
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,503
leave the person not able to make plan

1403
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:18,240
because in some way their predictive
model has been compromised?

1404
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:22,711
So how do these people, you know,
do they grasp objects appropriately?

1405
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,680
Could they get across town on the bus?

1406
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,482
What level or in what ways

1407
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:29,918
is their action prediction changed?

1408
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:33,488
Yeah, well, I think you know,
I think people

1409
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:36,892
who are very effectively
flattened and depersonalized,

1410
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,361
I think planning is an issue.

1411
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:43,131
Planning is an issue for them
precisely because, you know,

1412
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:47,169
of the of the idea that, you know,
if you're trying to decide

1413
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:50,606
where to go for holidays
or whether to get married

1414
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,009
or whether to quit your job, it's
not just to sort

1415
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:57,245
of called cognitive process
of weighing the costs and benefits.

1416
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,083
Those things have to be felt right.

1417
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,052
Know, you decide
who am I going to go to Hawaii where it's

1418
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,288
warm and pleasant,
or am I going to go to Alaskan Rescue?

1419
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:10,225
Well, how does you mentally rehearse
those options

1420
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,161
and how that makes you feel determines
the decision, you know?

1421
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:18,600
And if you decide to get divorced
or get married, it's not just all, yeah,

1422
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,802
you know, if I get married, this
and this and this will happen.

1423
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,938
And if I get divorced,
the likelihood of this,

1424
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,173
it's more like
that makes you feel a certain way.

1425
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:29,611
So your life becomes
effectively flattened.

1426
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:34,149
So that perception and cognition
of all the various

1427
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,720
options for action
are now effectively neutral.

1428
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:42,791
It does make it very hard to
to plan and engage.

1429
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:46,328
And in the end, I think what you find in
depersonalization is

1430
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:50,432
people just kind of go through
the motions with their habitual actions,

1431
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:51,867
you know?

1432
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:54,836
So if you're a bus driver
or a university lecturer

1433
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:58,573
or a husband and parents,
then then you feel depersonalized.

1434
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:01,677
Then you just
you keep doing what you're doing,

1435
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:06,114
but you feel like just an empty shell
going through the motions.

1436
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:08,917
But those people have a lot of difficulty

1437
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:13,689
coming up with a coherent
alternative plan.

1438
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,157
It's like,
why don't you do something else?

1439
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,858
Why don't you you know?

1440
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,027
But but we see this actually,
you know, even in

1441
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:23,432
an everyday case of life, you know,
you might know that it would be good

1442
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:28,537
if you took up exercise, but would be
as a objective piece of knowledge.

1443
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:32,974
It would be great if I took up, you know,
bike riding or if I went on a diet

1444
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:36,011
or if, you know,
whatever, if I moved cities. But

1445
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:37,512
but you just

1446
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:41,083
know that as a kind of, you know,
piece of information, it won't make

1447
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:45,921
you do it unless that somehow can click
in to your affective self model.

1448
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,789
It's like, Yeah, it's me.

1449
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:50,692
Oh, I can kind of imagine myself

1450
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:53,795
as, you know, whatever
it is riding up the hill, walking up,

1451
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:57,866
you know, having some future
that I can actually inhabit,

1452
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,204
not just intellectually,
but also emotionally and personally.

1453
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:07,209
Well, just one on that
and then I'll read a question from Dave.

1454
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:10,779
It's like in a way,
society is a big top down.

1455
01:19:10,812 --> 01:19:12,047
Like in active inference.

1456
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,682
We talk a lot about nested systems

1457
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:17,986
and you focused on sort of the level
of bodily integrity and the brain body.

1458
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:23,191
But in a sense
the social structure are niche scaffolds.

1459
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,726
Our behavior, whether it's

1460
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:27,729
hey, it doesn't matter if you don't like
broccoli, you're going to put

1461
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:33,502
that fork in your mouth or whether it's
some other type of decision there,

1462
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:38,073
top down priors that actually structure
our decision making and planning

1463
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,910
in the absence of precision or of

1464
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:44,613
a good way to plan.

1465
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,748
So just really interesting there.

1466
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:47,983
I think that's exactly right.

1467
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:48,850
And, you know,

1468
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,753
I think this is really your point.

1469
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:52,420
Exactly.

1470
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,056
Applies really, really well to addiction.

1471
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,327
There's a woman called Hanna Pickard
who writes extensively on addiction.

1472
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:02,464
And what she points out is that an addict

1473
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,801
can know that if they stop taking drugs,
it would be better for them.

1474
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:09,938
But so what they need to be able to do
is project themself

1475
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:13,742
into the non addicted future where
they're living, engaging in the world

1476
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:15,944
and they're getting positive feedback
from the world.

1477
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:18,647
But she says to her, to pick up
your point,

1478
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:22,250
that's very hard
to have a model of yourself like that

1479
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:28,490
without social scaffolding without social
structure, without a kind of positive

1480
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:32,594
or without a kind of positive feedback
and structure from a world around you.

1481
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:35,597
So the thought is
that the self that you are, is,

1482
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,433
is, as you say, your priors,
your predictions.

1483
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,102
They're not just about internal modeling.

1484
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:45,907
They're also about the priors
expected nations and plans and plans

1485
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:50,645
and reinforcement that you get from being
immersed in a sort of social milieu.

1486
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:52,848
And for addicts, that's not there.

1487
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,817
They can't imagine that they have
no model of themself as functioning

1488
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:57,419
in an alternative social media.

1489
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:00,021
So when they get out
of jail or get out of rehab,

1490
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,792
unfortunately,
they get back in their old social milieu,

1491
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:08,163
the familiar triggering situations
in the familiar social environment,

1492
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:10,832
and that kind of activates
their self model.

1493
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:14,870
As someone who who does
does that and they're

1494
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:17,806
and she says
when you ask them to reflect on

1495
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:22,878
what it's like as a non addict,
imagine they can't.

1496
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:26,681
There's a kind, she said it induces
in them a kind of existential terror

1497
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:30,151
because they really can't

1498
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:34,623
imagine themself as a non
non addicted life.

1499
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:38,560
It's kind of it's an empty future
for them, partly because she says there's

1500
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,531
no viable social scaffolding to support
their they're like in that world.

1501
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:48,203
So your point is, I think plays really
well into that, that literature, that.

1502
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:50,105
And what you said there.

1503
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:53,775
What is it like to be,
you know, in that case, not addicted to

1504
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,377
a substance or a behavior?

1505
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:58,613
It's kind of a subtle allusion
to the famous

1506
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:02,484
philosophical tradition of what is it
like to be a bat to be an ant colony.

1507
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:03,385
Right.

1508
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:07,022
And when you brought up,
I think even at the beginning,

1509
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,925
you said,
what is it like to feel you don't exist?

1510
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:13,261
That this idea of negative space

1511
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:17,432
and of negation came up in such
interesting ways in the talk?

1512
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,701
Like if you ask somebody,
what does it feel like to exist?

1513
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:24,072
It's like, that's 99% of the discourse
or, you know, that's the mystery.

1514
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:28,443
But then by drawing our attention,
what would it feel like?

1515
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:31,012
Counterfactual import for argument?

1516
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:34,916
What would it feel like to not exist
as I know, I'm not feeling that.

1517
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:36,785
So what is that one?

1518
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,688
And then what's the other side of the
coin of feeling like I don't exist?

1519
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:40,155
It's like.

1520
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:43,458
It's like feeling like I am in control,
like I am steering.

1521
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:44,292
Exactly.

1522
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:46,394
So that was so such a cool connection.

1523
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:48,930
That's that. Yeah,
I think that's the point.

1524
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:53,034
I want to, I wanted to get at the what
why I like the active inference framework

1525
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:54,002
for this is because

1526
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:55,737
the feeling

1527
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:58,740
of being me, you know, a lot of people
tell you,

1528
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:02,010
oh, well, if you have a perceptual,
then someone's having it.

1529
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,380
You know,
an experience has to have an experience

1530
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:09,217
or something like that
or how can you not feel like you're me?

1531
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,853
If you have a body, you can
your body touch your body and feel it.

1532
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:14,422
But that's not what we're talking about.

1533
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:18,760
The feeling of being me
is the feeling of being in charge.

1534
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:23,131
The feeling of being the thing
that I can manipulate

1535
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:26,301
in order
to bring about all these experiences.

1536
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:30,338
And you can still have experiences.

1537
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,540
You can see plenty of experiences,

1538
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:35,677
but if you lose the feeling
that those experiences

1539
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:41,149
are things that you can change
and manipulate dependent on your,

1540
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:43,351
then you lose
the experience of being you.

1541
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,086
And that's at a high level,
but the same thing.

1542
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:47,222
Imagine the thing going right down
really low.

1543
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:51,026
Your hypothalamus is sending
to raise your heartbeat and

1544
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,127
not getting any feedback.

1545
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,229
Your heartbeat stays

1546
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:58,033
low, stays obstinately low
or obstinately high.

1547
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,734
It's the same thing.

1548
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:02,103
I'm not I'm not getting any traction
here.

1549
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:04,472
Obviously,
a hypothalamus doesn't think that.

1550
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:07,909
But, you know, or,
you know, imagine a bacterium

1551
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:13,114
that's trying to contract membranes
to turn left to pursue a sugar gradient.

1552
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:15,283
And nothing's happening.

1553
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,219
It's getting, keeping,
getting this kind of obstinate feeling

1554
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:21,790
that I'm not in charge anymore
and I've got no moral

1555
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:25,226
I've got no model on myself
that's working to

1556
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:28,263
the to give me the feeling of being me.

1557
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:33,268
And that's in such a case,
the system still has sensory experience,

1558
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:37,172
so an activity at its receptors
and stuff is happening, but it's just not

1559
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:41,342
a regulatory target anymore.

1560
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:44,946
And that makes me think about
when you talked about

1561
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:48,983
the people who are suffering from pain,
but they're disassociated from it.

1562
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:51,019
It feels like it's not their pain.

1563
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,487
It's little wordplay.

1564
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:56,758
So it's not a philosophical argument,
but gnosis and no deception.

1565
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,427
It's like, yep,
there's the knowledge of pain,

1566
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:03,798
but actually it's almost inseparable
from the suffering.

1567
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:04,799
Right?

1568
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:10,238
And so this is an extreme case
where the gnosis of no deception

1569
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:13,441
has been entirely separated
from the narrative of the self.

1570
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:15,810
It's like,
yeah, there is pain in the arm.

1571
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,946
But exactly. It's
not part of my narrative.

1572
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:20,315
And so there's
the person psychologically.

1573
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,951
That's exactly right.

1574
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,587
There's damage.
There's damage to the body

1575
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:28,490
that I inhabit,
especially what the brain is saying.

1576
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,092
The body,
this body that I live in is damaged,

1577
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:35,930
but it's not my damage. No.

1578
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:39,767
Do they ever ask whose is it
or does it just not seem to be like, oh,

1579
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,203
just like know someone's car,
someone's parked outside?

1580
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:44,772
Or is it like I'm it's like.

1581
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:46,241
No, no.

1582
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:49,110
The really interesting thing,
I mean, the early cases,

1583
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:51,980
the really interesting thing
about pain symbolic is that

1584
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:58,386
they don't take any action to avoid pain.

1585
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,722
So that in that sense,
you know, that's really bad.

1586
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:04,292
And so but it's not quite
the same as congenital

1587
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:07,862
insensitivity to pain, which is a problem
with the receptor level right?

1588
01:26:07,862 --> 01:26:10,064
Those people don't detect pain.

1589
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:12,634
And so, you know, they're in a bad way.

1590
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:16,371
They put their hand on a burning stove,
they break their legs and they don't

1591
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:19,340
they just don't feel don't
even have the bodily sensation.

1592
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:21,409
But pain is symbolic.

1593
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:26,047
They have the bodily sensation,
but they don't annex it to themself.

1594
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:30,084
Or it points to different roles
for different receptors.

1595
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:33,855
So I wanted to ask about
the NMDA receptor, which you kind of

1596
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:34,923
brought up in the beginning.

1597
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:37,559
What does the NMDA receptor do

1598
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,962
neurologically or
why is it associated with that phenotype?

1599
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:42,564
Right.

1600
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:45,066
Well, now you're now you're now, now,

1601
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:47,635
now about a month
now I'm out of my league.

1602
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:51,539
But it I think that

1603
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,542
that kind of encephalitis
is a inflammatory thing.

1604
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:58,146
Right. It's an inflammatory response.

1605
01:26:58,146 --> 01:27:02,016
And so when it hits those receptors,
I think it's just because

1606
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,053
MDMA is like it's
so widespread throughout the brain.

1607
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:09,290
I think it's like a
I'm talking out of turn here.

1608
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:09,524
Right.

1609
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:12,527
So it's it's not my
my field so canceled this but

1610
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,630
I think it's like like a like a catalyst

1611
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:18,199
or modulator
for so many metabolic functions.

1612
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:19,234
Right.

1613
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,136
It's involved in everything
as a kind of very fundamental thing.

1614
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:26,074
So when you mess with it,
you pretty much you.

1615
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:29,911
That's why you get this kind
of catastrophic dysregulation

1616
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,414
across the brain.

1617
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:36,351
Yeah, that's that's the thought.
It's one of these. It's like

1618
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:39,887
adenosine or something like

1619
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:42,991
that, you know,
that these metabolism depends on that.

1620
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:47,595
And if you mess that up
or what's another one, the ketones,

1621
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,732
you know, if you if you get a buildup

1622
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:55,069
of ketone in the brain,
you know, it's it's tiny chemical.

1623
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:59,073
But if tiny levels of this chemical
can just destroy everything, produce

1624
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:04,245
mental retardation, mutism, motor
disorders, it's a catastrophe,

1625
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,782
an absolute catastrophe,
because, you know,

1626
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:12,954
the cellular level of functioning
is so dependent on these nano nano level

1627
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,356
adjustments of these basic things.

1628
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,927
That speaks
to two dimensions of the challenge,

1629
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:21,663
which is the multi scale systems.

1630
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:24,899
There's little things like molecules
and big things like people,

1631
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:29,871
and then also the trans disciplinary
and it's like we should have one story

1632
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:33,374
for one level from one discipline
and then a separate discipline.

1633
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:37,779
In a separate story, we need something
like an integrated approach.

1634
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:39,047
What's that going to be?

1635
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:41,616
That's exactly right.

1636
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:44,519
And so where I suppose,
where I came into this when I was

1637
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:47,288
when I got into philosophy,
most people thought, well,

1638
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:49,557
what's the integrative story going to be?

1639
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:53,928
Well, you know, it's some kind of
computational story, you know, top down

1640
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:59,200
classical computational modeling, CPU,
modular inputs, modular outputs.

1641
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,368
That's one way.

1642
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:02,370
It's a kind of broad brush approach.

1643
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:06,007
Then you have neural network stories

1644
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:08,142
and then you have,
you know, deep learning stories

1645
01:29:08,142 --> 01:29:10,144
and all these different architectures.

1646
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:13,981
And now you have it
and I have active inference and depends

1647
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:19,020
what you think active inference
is going to how it's going to play out.

1648
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,556
I mean,
if you think of active inference as

1649
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:27,762
you know at the biophysical level,
it sounds right, but it's very abstract,

1650
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:29,063
right?

1651
01:29:29,063 --> 01:29:33,835
It treats like a human organism
as like a physical system in space.

1652
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:37,872
It's like a self-organizing asteroid
or something like that.

1653
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,841
It's really the same.

1654
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:43,911
The same laws of physics apply,

1655
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:47,482
and then you have the kind of Bayesian
implementations of

1656
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,952
active inference.

1657
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:52,420
It's an interesting question.

1658
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:55,022
You Know whether you think
the brain is actually

1659
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,926
Bayesian, you know,

1660
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,462
because a lot of psychologists
will tell you that

1661
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:06,801
the brain departs from Bayesian optimal
reasoning almost everywhere.

1662
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:09,570
In almost all and almost always,
you know.

1663
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:11,472
So yeah.

1664
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:15,076
Who the inference.

1665
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,411
Welcome back, Dave.

1666
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:20,882
So one of the questions from Dave was

1667
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:24,786
have you looked at functional delusions,
socialized

1668
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:27,722
as in mobs or depth psychological?

1669
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:31,959
No, no, I'm just I'm still on the

1670
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:34,862
I'm still on the standard curriculum of

1671
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:37,899
delusions of misidentification.

1672
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,835
Cotard delusions,
schizophrenic, schizophrenic delusions.

1673
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:43,971
I haven't talked about mass psychology
in that psychology.

1674
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:44,972
I have some thoughts.

1675
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:48,910
But I mean, clearly,
like self modeling applies, right?

1676
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:52,814
If you're talking about how ideas
propagate, propagate

1677
01:30:53,815 --> 01:30:56,083
in populations,

1678
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:58,352
then I guess you could say

1679
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:02,690
those those ideas
which are most consistent with a self

1680
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:06,661
model,
are going to be more easily absorbed and

1681
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:10,064
they've not stabilized,
you know, within the individual.

1682
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:11,799
So it's going to be very hard

1683
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:15,303
to get traction for an idea
or an ideology that doesn't

1684
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:20,174
fit with a self model
and probably self models

1685
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:24,479
since they're constructed to

1686
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,848
regulate affective states.

1687
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,183
That tells you that the ideas
which propagate

1688
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:31,853
and stabilize are going to be those which

1689
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:36,123
get traction with people's affective

1690
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:37,892
self model.

1691
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:38,826
You know what?

1692
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:44,499
That make them feel a certain way rather
than a kind of intellectual argument.

1693
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:48,903
You're not going to persuade
an anti-vaxxer by giving them statistics,

1694
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:53,741
and you're not going to get a kind
of propagation, a wave of something

1695
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:58,279
across social media on the basis of,
you know, an irrational inference.

1696
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:02,283
But that's I don't have anything
super much to say about that.

1697
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:05,520
Very true that we see

1698
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,091
sharing and activation patterns
in the sort of global brain

1699
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:13,394
based upon affect not veracity

1700
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:16,464
or accuracy or and yet feature.

1701
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:20,568
And maybe that speaks to another one
of Dave's questions, which was

1702
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:25,973
how your work illuminate the notion
of cognitive dissonance or consonance.

1703
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:31,546
Even in his technical work, Leon Festinger
seems not to succeed in building

1704
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:36,284
a credible dynamics of compatibility
and incompatibility among psychic atoms.

1705
01:32:36,817 --> 01:32:39,787
Relevant passages of Gregory
Watson's essays

1706
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:43,891
in steps towards an ecology of Mind
seems similarly limited.

1707
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:46,694
So whether or not you've read
those specific texts.

1708
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:50,464
I have written specific things,
but I suppose one way of thinking of it

1709
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:54,101
is within the kind of active
inference or within the

1710
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:58,005
predictive processing framework is

1711
01:32:58,005 --> 01:33:01,342
if you get some discrepant
information that

1712
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,545
contradicts or contradicts or self model

1713
01:33:04,545 --> 01:33:07,315
or contradicts a predictive model,
you have some choices.

1714
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:09,617
You can revise the model.

1715
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:11,852
That's the perceptual inference to say,

1716
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:14,889
or you can explore the world
and try and get some

1717
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:17,425
you get some further information
to confirm your model

1718
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:21,195
that that seems to be
the active inference approach.

1719
01:33:21,195 --> 01:33:22,863
And obviously life is a balance, right?

1720
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:25,266
Life is a balance between the two.

1721
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,868
Keep your model
or get some more information.

1722
01:33:27,868 --> 01:33:30,404
But it seems like if you
if we take the scientific

1723
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:36,010
analogy of hypothetical inference, often

1724
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:39,780
what people do with discrepant inference
in sort of discrepant

1725
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:44,352
information is just compartmentalize it.

1726
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:48,189
They just put it away.

1727
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:51,459
And scientists have science, you know,
knowing that through it, no one throws

1728
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:56,130
out a good scientific theory
just because of some discrepant evidence,

1729
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:58,766
even if that can't be reconciled.

1730
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:01,335
You know, right now no one's
checking out the theory of evolution

1731
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:05,072
because someone came up
with a wacky organism or wacky function.

1732
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:07,942
You know, it's like they must
there's got to be some explanation.

1733
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:11,145
I don't know what it is,
but let's just we'll just doing our thing

1734
01:34:11,612 --> 01:34:14,515
and hope that eventually
it'll be realized, you know.

1735
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:16,884
So I don't think people

1736
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:19,754
is these ideas of kind of

1737
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:25,092
updating or upgrading hypotheses in
the face of the flux of new information.

1738
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:27,728
That's actually not true
because we can't be that sensitive

1739
01:34:28,396 --> 01:34:31,399
to information that would be mad.

1740
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:31,999
Right.

1741
01:34:32,433 --> 01:34:36,270
So and I guess if you have a self model
that's getting around the world

1742
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:37,738
and functioning,

1743
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:38,773
you know, if your religion,

1744
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:41,142
if you are highly religious person
or something like that

1745
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:44,645
and you live in a religious community
and you go to college and, you know,

1746
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:49,150
Ray Dawkins or something like that, well,
I mean, you have a choice.

1747
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,585
You can throw out your whole self,
modeling your whole worldview.

1748
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:53,254
Or you might

1749
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:58,926
just think, like many surgeons,
scientists and otherwise rational people

1750
01:34:58,926 --> 01:35:01,729
like I, this is my life in the hospital

1751
01:35:01,996 --> 01:35:04,498
where I'm a neuroscientist or whatever.

1752
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:09,403
And this is my life at home
where I'm a preacher and a family

1753
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:12,940
patriarch of a religious community

1754
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:15,276
because complete consistency

1755
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:17,745
across all the levels
and all the functions

1756
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:20,614
is too much.

1757
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:24,752
But I would say because it threatens a
kind of self model, it's not because it's

1758
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:28,189
you know,
that kind of compartmentalization

1759
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:31,092
is not so much
a matter of intellectual consistency,

1760
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:34,295
so much as consistency
with the self model.

1761
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,832
And very importantly that the self model

1762
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,935
includes the sensory evidence
and that meta model.

1763
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:44,271
So even though my background
is in evolutionary biology

1764
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:48,075
very early,
I realized that people who believe

1765
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:51,512
in evolution, people who believe
in creation, every other flavor

1766
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:55,049
look at tree
and see evidence for their world model.

1767
01:35:55,349 --> 01:35:57,585
So that's the starting point
for the discussion,

1768
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,320
not that you see the evidence,

1769
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,056
but that everybody sees evidence
confirming their view.

1770
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:05,626
And that's a very different discussion
than the dogma tests.

1771
01:36:05,626 --> 01:36:07,762
Who might be on any side?

1772
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:09,830
Not a side. Right. And yes.

1773
01:36:09,864 --> 01:36:12,399
And no one is going to come.
No one's going to come to the top.

1774
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:15,102
No one's going to come to the topic
with no model

1775
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:17,438
that's going to say,
put aside your preconceptions.

1776
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:18,572
Well, there's no such thing.

1777
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:21,542
But so yeah. Yes definitely.

1778
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:24,712
And that is relevant
for the cognitive bias

1779
01:36:24,712 --> 01:36:28,682
and bias discussion
in these future systems.

1780
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:31,318
Or we'll have an unbiased system.

1781
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:33,888
What is that even going to mean?

1782
01:36:33,888 --> 01:36:34,555
Yeah, exactly.

1783
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:37,825
And that is, you know, the strength
weakness of the Bayesian thing, isn't it?

1784
01:36:37,825 --> 01:36:41,929
Because the Bayesian ideas,
you know, start ab initio

1785
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:44,131
and then you get some evidence
and you update your model,

1786
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,167
you get more evidence
and you update your model

1787
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,836
that's on,
but you've got to start from somewhere.

1788
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:53,007
And so much of the action in Bayesian
theory is in the Prius,

1789
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:56,744
but there's no theory internal to base

1790
01:36:57,144 --> 01:37:00,548
which will tell you where your prior
assumptions about much weight

1791
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:03,951
to give incoming
evidence is going to come from it.

1792
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:07,121
It's a little bit more like blockchain

1793
01:37:07,121 --> 01:37:10,558
with the way
that we can make our priors explicit.

1794
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:14,595
You don't step around this issue
by using frequentist statistics

1795
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:18,399
or by casting t ruts,
so at least we can have a discussion.

1796
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:19,800
Hey, I use different priors,

1797
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:23,170
but for an answer versus
we use radically different families

1798
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:27,608
of priors and hyper priors
and we're converging on a similar action.

1799
01:37:28,142 --> 01:37:31,946
So maybe that speaks to at least
this action being appropriate,

1800
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:33,714
if not it being the old.

1801
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:36,016
Yeah, that's a yeah,
that's a very good point.

1802
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:37,651
It's not as though yeah.

1803
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:42,089
It's not as though
anyone else has a solution to,

1804
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,425
to where do we start from, you know,

1805
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:47,261
what are our foundation,
what are our foundational assumptions.

1806
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:48,662
Yeah.

1807
01:37:48,662 --> 01:37:52,700
So it's a bit rude to criticize,
but Bayesian is for saying

1808
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:55,035
that there has to be a
lot of action in the priors.

1809
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:56,437
Right, though

1810
01:37:56,437 --> 01:38:01,675
there has to be a lot of information
in the prize to get the off the ground.

1811
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:02,343
True.

1812
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:06,480
But you know, that's an assignment
anyone get from Skins or anyone.

1813
01:38:07,147 --> 01:38:08,115
They just.

1814
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:11,218
Yeah, exactly.

1815
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:13,621
So what other

1816
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:16,190
phrase or piece that came to mind

1817
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:19,159
was almost like parametric hysteresis.

1818
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:24,632
The idea that although most sensory
evidence is sort of just off,

1819
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:27,868
kind of like Teflon on our mind,
you look away, it's just totally gone.

1820
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:30,771
There are traumatic experiences.

1821
01:38:30,771 --> 01:38:34,541
And then on the other side,
there are healing modalities,

1822
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:38,545
whether it's a healing experience
or a biochemical intervention, right?

1823
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:44,051
There's interventions that restructure

1824
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:49,023
are models and we can think about that,
an active inference perspective.

1825
01:38:49,023 --> 01:38:52,526
So I just wondered like philosophically
or from any view,

1826
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:57,932
how do we think these kinds
of changing events, whether kind of

1827
01:38:58,198 --> 01:39:01,669
changing in a negative way, like a trauma
or in a positive way, like healing,

1828
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:06,140
how do we scaffold for that?

1829
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,108
Well,
that is actually a really good question

1830
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:12,313
because, you know, in this
in the case of psychiatry, it seems like

1831
01:39:14,014 --> 01:39:16,617
almost all therapies are equally
and equally bad.

1832
01:39:17,451 --> 01:39:20,654
No, none of them really
none of them really work in a way

1833
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:22,489
that we can kind of predict or explain.

1834
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:26,293
That's only statistical
you know, statistical correlations.

1835
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:30,064
So people took their antidepressants
and, you know, so in proportion

1836
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:31,865
get better, but then they relapse.

1837
01:39:31,865 --> 01:39:35,903
Some people went to a therapist
or cognitive CBT,

1838
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:38,072
some get better
and some relapse, you know.

1839
01:39:38,172 --> 01:39:42,977
So what kind of what kind of
interventions work is really interesting

1840
01:39:42,977 --> 01:39:45,079
in the kind of restructuring, you know,
and that's the

1841
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:50,884
that's part of the motivation,
I think for psychedelic approaches

1842
01:39:50,884 --> 01:39:53,954
to psychiatry, we're like, okay,

1843
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:58,459
one for my look, I can't really, can't
really have a successful intervention

1844
01:39:58,459 --> 01:40:02,196
because that would require
you to rebuild or remodel

1845
01:40:03,464 --> 01:40:04,231
yourself.

1846
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:06,734
It's not just changing a perception
and changing our experience.

1847
01:40:06,734 --> 01:40:10,637
It's the way you incorporate that in
your whole kind of regulatory framework.

1848
01:40:10,637 --> 01:40:12,306
How are we going to do that?

1849
01:40:12,706 --> 01:40:16,577
Well, maybe with ten years of therapy,
you know, lots of patient

1850
01:40:17,244 --> 01:40:20,280
reconstruction or, well,
sometimes a life changing event.

1851
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:24,518
People give up drugs
because, you know, for

1852
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:27,921
some reason it's a life changing event
or they just grow out of it.

1853
01:40:27,921 --> 01:40:29,757
People say that it's hard.

1854
01:40:29,757 --> 01:40:32,793
It's hard to have to systematize
that, isn't it?

1855
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:34,328
That was psychedelics.

1856
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:38,799
What people are saying
is, well, let's disrupt this self model.

1857
01:40:38,799 --> 01:40:43,470
Let's kind of for a while, let's
introduce maximum entropy into the system

1858
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:48,008
again, you know,
so that they experience life

1859
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:51,178
briefly, hopefully safely

1860
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:55,549
with a lot of their
self model disintegrated

1861
01:40:57,017 --> 01:40:59,053
yet. And so they get to see

1862
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:03,157
life for once unfiltered in a normally
everything is filtered.

1863
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:07,594
How does this matter to me in relation
to me in relation to my history, my plans

1864
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:11,131
you know that people admitted
matter to me all of life is

1865
01:41:11,331 --> 01:41:13,467
just being filtered
at every level like that

1866
01:41:14,101 --> 01:41:17,671
and that's very hard to use
to experience life without that filter.

1867
01:41:19,306 --> 01:41:22,676
And psychedelics give you a

1868
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:27,114
a brief, immersive, very destabilizing

1869
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:30,751
experience of life unfiltered

1870
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:33,921
and maybe from that can be a starting
point for something that's good.

1871
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:38,425
Classic William Blake Doors of Perception

1872
01:41:39,693 --> 01:41:44,565
idea, and also the REBUS work
by Friston and

1873
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:48,902
and Carhart-Harris as well as this offer
on and actually asking like

1874
01:41:49,169 --> 01:41:53,307
maybe there are certain aspects
that these neurochemical interventions

1875
01:41:53,307 --> 01:41:54,074
may strengthen.

1876
01:41:54,074 --> 01:41:57,611
Maybe it's not just this across the board
weakening of our world,

1877
01:41:57,611 --> 01:42:01,515
but there are certain levels of analysis
in which things might be strengthened.

1878
01:42:01,849 --> 01:42:03,150
And. Right, right.

1879
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:05,786
On this note of the treatment
and the recovery,

1880
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:08,288
one of the very early slides,
I think it was Mr.

1881
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:10,390
A was the patient.

1882
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:13,794
And then right came in initially
presenting

1883
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:17,764
some phenotypes
and then there was plasma.

1884
01:42:17,764 --> 01:42:20,834
And instead after a few plasma exchanges,
you know,

1885
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:24,271
he had improved
and then he had this other thing.

1886
01:42:24,571 --> 01:42:25,639
And so I thought

1887
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:28,942
interesting treatments.

1888
01:42:28,942 --> 01:42:32,579
What does it say about the body
and the brain or what made

1889
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:35,749
these doctors go for the plasma exchange?

1890
01:42:35,749 --> 01:42:38,485
And was it with with the white matter?

1891
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:40,587
Right.

1892
01:42:40,587 --> 01:42:42,122
Well, because

1893
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:46,293
because they had this idea that

1894
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:49,429
they had

1895
01:42:49,429 --> 01:42:51,932
they had this
they had this idea that inflammation,

1896
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:56,303
you know, was the core
of a lot of these catastrophic

1897
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:57,871
the core of a lot of the symptoms.

1898
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:02,009
And when you when you look at depression
and you look at psychiatric disorders,

1899
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:06,346
people often get wrapped up
in the sensory experience and the

1900
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:08,348
and the cognitive experience.

1901
01:43:08,348 --> 01:43:11,185
You know,
people say things that are so crazy,

1902
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:13,654
you know, and the thing is,
why would you say that?

1903
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:15,489
Why are they so irrational?

1904
01:43:15,489 --> 01:43:18,525
You know, and people start at that level
and they talk to them and they say,

1905
01:43:19,159 --> 01:43:22,029
try and understand their life experience
and all this or whatever.

1906
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:27,434
But the view of these guys in Mexico is,
look, look, look at the other symptoms

1907
01:43:29,803 --> 01:43:30,604
look what's happening.

1908
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:35,075
You know, the guy pissing
his pants is shitting himself,

1909
01:43:35,642 --> 01:43:39,213
hasn't been to sleep for three days
and then he sleeps for two weeks

1910
01:43:40,614 --> 01:43:43,383
and he doesn't want to eat anything,
hasn't eaten for a week, you know.

1911
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:45,619
So this is like really basic.

1912
01:43:46,653 --> 01:43:47,788
It's really basic.

1913
01:43:47,788 --> 01:43:51,325
Functioning is out of control now

1914
01:43:51,325 --> 01:43:52,960
and that looks like it.

1915
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,762
Maybe that's a kind of
and we know that, you know, inflammation

1916
01:43:55,963 --> 01:43:58,065
does affect homeostasis
this really badly.

1917
01:43:58,665 --> 01:44:01,268
And so that was they thought,
you know, let's

1918
01:44:01,268 --> 01:44:03,270
and then let's test them for all these,
you know,

1919
01:44:04,504 --> 01:44:07,574
antibodies for encephalitis
and they find it so plasma

1920
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:10,010
exchange is the treatment for that.

1921
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:13,547
And then, of course,

1922
01:44:13,547 --> 01:44:17,384
you might think, oh, well,
all right, but up

1923
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:19,920
that's not something
you're going to repair straight away.

1924
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:23,690
When you when you've gone
from homeostatic catastrophe

1925
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:28,262
to a bit of reintegration,

1926
01:44:29,162 --> 01:44:29,463
you know,

1927
01:44:29,463 --> 01:44:30,497
you're still going to be left with

1928
01:44:30,497 --> 01:44:33,834
the cognitive level
has to get back in touch with you know

1929
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:36,436
if you're thinking
of those kind of levels of organization

1930
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:38,472
and systematic
functioning and interaction.

1931
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:41,375
Well okay
you change the molecular level function.

1932
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,944
You don't change everything
straight away, which is why

1933
01:44:45,345 --> 01:44:47,781
it's very nice study by Catherine Harmer.

1934
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,950
You know, give people antidepressants

1935
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:53,186
or anything
like I give people antidepressants

1936
01:44:53,553 --> 01:44:57,758
or you've changed their serotonin levels
within an hour, I'd say you report

1937
01:44:57,758 --> 01:45:01,595
their serotonin level across the brain
back to now why that why it's if if that

1938
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:05,799
if the serotonin
theory of anti-depression is right,

1939
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:07,501
don't they feel better?

1940
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:09,836
They change their pattern of thinking.

1941
01:45:09,836 --> 01:45:11,371
It does affect

1942
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:14,841
it does affect some very kind of low
level perceptual processing, though.

1943
01:45:14,875 --> 01:45:16,443
So their patterns of gaze

1944
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:19,012
depressive people

1945
01:45:19,012 --> 01:45:21,848
that cycads are very avoidant.

1946
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:25,152
You know if you show them emotional faces
or something they don't look at the

1947
01:45:25,352 --> 01:45:29,022
the nose, the eyes,
the mouth, the eyes automatically avert

1948
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:32,292
people with anxiety and so on.

1949
01:45:32,292 --> 01:45:34,061
So they're not getting any positive,

1950
01:45:34,061 --> 01:45:36,163
you know, emotional feedback
from their social world.

1951
01:45:37,564 --> 01:45:40,300
But if you give people antidepressants,
that pattern of seconds

1952
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,136
changes within a few hours.

1953
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:46,073
So it's almost like you're giving them
the ability

1954
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:50,444
now to do some active inference
and reacquire some

1955
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:53,513
some some new information
about about their world.

1956
01:45:54,448 --> 01:45:57,184
So If they go around the world, luckily,
and they people smile at them

1957
01:45:57,184 --> 01:46:00,253
and laugh and talk with them, then
they're getting some new information.

1958
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:02,389
But that's not going to disrupt

1959
01:46:03,023 --> 01:46:05,325
straightaway all the high level
models that they've built

1960
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:07,461
to them.

1961
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:09,429
You know, you're not going to change
that.

1962
01:46:09,429 --> 01:46:11,398
That's not going to happen straight away.

1963
01:46:11,398 --> 01:46:13,900
And that story

1964
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:18,271
about, the serotonin story
I've personally felt,

1965
01:46:18,839 --> 01:46:22,909
is that disciplinary hierarchy, it's
like, well, we know how this drug works.

1966
01:46:22,909 --> 01:46:26,279
Look at my simulation of how it binds
the receptors you bring up.

1967
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:30,083
But then if it did that and that's simply
how it worked, if it weren't just,

1968
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:33,053
you know,
changing a complex biological system

1969
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:36,423
that wouldn't a time
course of action be very different.

1970
01:46:36,823 --> 01:46:40,660
And it's a it's a looking
where the light is

1971
01:46:40,827 --> 01:46:44,531
because we can make these simulations
with a docking of a molecule,

1972
01:46:45,165 --> 01:46:47,768
but as yet we lack

1973
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:50,036
some of these layers in between.

1974
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:51,571
Absolutely.

1975
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:54,574
The vibrating molecule
and our phenomenology,

1976
01:46:54,574 --> 01:47:00,313
which is sort of that fog of experience
that we're exploring together.

1977
01:47:01,381 --> 01:47:04,418
Yeah, no, I absolutely 100% agree.

1978
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:05,519
And I think

1979
01:47:07,654 --> 01:47:10,490
again, but most of my practicing

1980
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:14,127
psychiatrist, colleagues
and collaborators, they would agree too.

1981
01:47:14,928 --> 01:47:16,830
But there's a big

1982
01:47:17,164 --> 01:47:20,801
industrial complex, you know, that has

1983
01:47:21,902 --> 01:47:25,939
that has an interest in thinking,
you know, persuading people otherwise.

1984
01:47:25,939 --> 01:47:28,275
And also people are desperate.

1985
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,843
Yeah, yeah.

1986
01:47:29,843 --> 01:47:33,213
Can't wait till we have big Pryor
and big precision.

1987
01:47:34,014 --> 01:47:36,883
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

1988
01:47:36,883 --> 01:47:41,988
You brought up the Australian philosopher
Colin Klein, who

1989
01:47:42,422 --> 01:47:46,193
I was familiar with
because of the collaboration with Andy

1990
01:47:46,193 --> 01:47:51,364
Baron, actually, about basil experience
in honeybees and in insects.

1991
01:47:52,232 --> 01:47:54,668
So it just was an interesting connection

1992
01:47:54,968 --> 01:47:57,671
with thinking about, okay,
if we're going to take this sort of

1993
01:47:57,671 --> 01:48:02,542
bottom up computational approach,
then where we take that in

1994
01:48:02,809 --> 01:48:05,912
not just the clinic
but in the evolutionary context.

1995
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:09,483
Yeah, he's a great
he's a great force for sure.

1996
01:48:09,683 --> 01:48:11,718
And he's really got his
finger on the pulse of all,

1997
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:14,988
I think that cross-disciplinary

1998
01:48:17,224 --> 01:48:19,292
the material that you need to do that
kind of thing.

1999
01:48:19,292 --> 01:48:21,595
Well, he's really good like that.

2000
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:24,731
Here's another just in these last
few minutes, a question from the chat

2001
01:48:25,632 --> 01:48:27,501
he wrote.

2002
01:48:27,701 --> 01:48:31,771
Any thoughts about the role of nonsense,
haptic information

2003
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:36,776
transmission across the brain,
especially at static coupling?

2004
01:48:36,943 --> 01:48:41,381
Thank you kindly.

2005
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:45,151
Honestly, I don't really know

2006
01:48:47,354 --> 01:48:48,054
that.

2007
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:49,890
I don't as

2008
01:48:50,423 --> 01:48:53,393
clearly it's
got to have there's no reason

2009
01:48:53,393 --> 01:48:56,796
within, say, active inference framework
or actually any computational

2010
01:48:58,231 --> 01:49:01,434
to think that, you know,

2011
01:49:01,635 --> 01:49:03,970
the fundamental mechanism
has to be synaptic,

2012
01:49:05,906 --> 01:49:08,441
although it could it could be anything.

2013
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:09,075
Right.

2014
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:12,546
How the brain is organizing

2015
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:15,682
the body
to get through the world to survive

2016
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:18,919
could be anything could help itself
to any mechanism, you know,

2017
01:49:18,919 --> 01:49:21,555
astrocytes, glial cells,
whatever the hell, you know.

2018
01:49:22,322 --> 01:49:26,359
But we have got we bought into
this idea that it's synaptic

2019
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:28,161
probably going back

2020
01:49:28,161 --> 01:49:31,831
to Hebb and people like that
and neural network theory

2021
01:49:31,898 --> 01:49:34,868
is that it's a synaptic theory
of these units,

2022
01:49:36,336 --> 01:49:37,904
interconnected units with weights

2023
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:41,207
which are supposed to model
some abstract level synaptic functioning.

2024
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:42,375
Right.

2025
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:45,779
We might be off
we might be off of track there,

2026
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:50,216
but so
maybe this is a kind of a good advantage,

2027
01:49:50,216 --> 01:49:51,685
good advantage of active inference.

2028
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:57,390
It's like at the moment, computational
theory is hung up with a synthetic model

2029
01:49:57,591 --> 01:50:00,026
because that's what deep learning
and neural networks are.

2030
01:50:01,227 --> 01:50:03,430
Right setting of sitting awaits
across the brain.

2031
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,465
But that's a very abstract idea of

2032
01:50:06,499 --> 01:50:10,637
and you know, it's a very abstract idea
of what it was on it was on about.

2033
01:50:11,071 --> 01:50:14,374
And most neuroscientists,
like I had a guy talk in my class

2034
01:50:14,374 --> 01:50:15,842
the other day, invited him
to give a lecture.

2035
01:50:15,842 --> 01:50:17,911
He works on Dragonfly Vision

2036
01:50:17,911 --> 01:50:21,615
and he was just talking about the neurons
in the eyes of dragonflies.

2037
01:50:21,648 --> 01:50:25,452
You're saying there is all this stuff
in there that we don't know?

2038
01:50:26,252 --> 01:50:27,721
Glial cells, astrocytes.

2039
01:50:27,721 --> 01:50:29,255
What the hell is that?
What they're doing?

2040
01:50:29,255 --> 01:50:31,224
They're encoding other encoding it.

2041
01:50:31,224 --> 01:50:33,259
But he says if
you mess with their function,

2042
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:34,628
then you

2043
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:36,930
mess with the ability
of the dragonflies to

2044
01:50:37,831 --> 01:50:42,902
to do their incredibly accurate flying
and landing and sensory representations.

2045
01:50:42,902 --> 01:50:46,806
So yeah, so maybe the synthetic model is

2046
01:50:48,274 --> 01:50:50,810
once it's a case of looking
where the light is, you know,

2047
01:50:51,511 --> 01:50:55,215
artificial neural networks, they're great
and they can do a lot of things,

2048
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:59,519
but they are kind of level abstraction.

2049
01:51:00,453 --> 01:51:03,923
Then again, Bayesian models
are an even higher level abstraction

2050
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:07,894
if you if you want to put it that way,
because the Bayesian model, the Bayesian

2051
01:51:07,894 --> 01:51:11,364
models say, okay, you've got a system
interacting with its environment.

2052
01:51:11,364 --> 01:51:13,700
And I've got a function,

2053
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,902
a function that tells you

2054
01:51:15,902 --> 01:51:19,706
how the system's going to interact
with its environment.

2055
01:51:19,706 --> 01:51:21,808
And I can devolve that into a loop of,

2056
01:51:21,808 --> 01:51:24,577
if you like, I can devolve
that into a lot of subsidiary

2057
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:29,049
levels of a Bayesian

2058
01:51:30,316 --> 01:51:32,352
Bayesian inference all the way down.

2059
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:36,356
But how do they want how do they
how do they glom onto

2060
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:40,627
the actual molecular soup?

2061
01:51:40,627 --> 01:51:41,728
I don't know.

2062
01:51:41,728 --> 01:51:43,830
But I mean, that's the
that's the job of it, isn't it? Yeah.

2063
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:45,899
That's that's why I guess still

2064
01:51:47,934 --> 01:51:49,436
dopaminergic

2065
01:51:49,436 --> 01:51:52,238
functioning in the brain
is still a bit of a triumph because

2066
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:55,241
sorry, understanding the document system,
because you have

2067
01:51:56,676 --> 01:51:59,045
a system whose properties

2068
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:01,915
map pretty
well the predictions of formal theory

2069
01:52:02,916 --> 01:52:05,185
you know, of temple difference
learning and reward learning

2070
01:52:05,185 --> 01:52:07,854
not perfectly, but you know it does fit.

2071
01:52:09,422 --> 01:52:11,524
So that's good. So that's good.

2072
01:52:11,524 --> 01:52:12,058
That's good.

2073
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:14,427
And the same does seem to say
we're in the ballpark.

2074
01:52:15,929 --> 01:52:16,429
Matteo.

2075
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:19,999
Guillermo has a paper on the dopamine
signaling about explanatory

2076
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:24,704
from a philosophical perspective
about the way in which the dopaminergic

2077
01:52:24,704 --> 01:52:29,476
signaling in in different ways
can be seen as consistent

2078
01:52:29,476 --> 01:52:34,447
with precision account,
the reward account or other accounts.

2079
01:52:34,447 --> 01:52:38,785
And so it's like maybe let's
wait a few decades.

2080
01:52:39,052 --> 01:52:39,986
Yeah.

2081
01:52:39,986 --> 01:52:42,756
Before we,
you know, give out the trophies.

2082
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:45,091
Let's yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2083
01:52:45,091 --> 01:52:45,892
Absolutely.

2084
01:52:45,892 --> 01:52:48,461
So I'll just very good because.

2085
01:52:48,661 --> 01:52:52,265
That's right why can it nascent
friston have a paper on that

2086
01:52:52,832 --> 01:52:55,735
even you know and actually there are
a couple of good papers on that now.

2087
01:52:56,669 --> 01:52:58,738
Yeah, it would be within the active
inference framework

2088
01:52:58,738 --> 01:53:01,808
we can conceptualize that
the domain system

2089
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:05,011
as you know fine tuning fine
tuning patterns of active inference

2090
01:53:05,578 --> 01:53:08,481
rather than back
propagating a reward signal.

2091
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:09,149
Exactly.

2092
01:53:10,116 --> 01:53:10,650
Exactly.

2093
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:10,917
Yeah.

2094
01:53:10,917 --> 01:53:15,421
So I'll just close with this sort
of this diptych of questions,

2095
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:19,592
a little high road in a low road,
one of the paths would be

2096
01:53:19,826 --> 01:53:24,130
what research directions do you think
are exciting for people to pursue?

2097
01:53:24,364 --> 01:53:29,736
And the other side is
how do you think for non researchers

2098
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:33,573
what you've spoken to today
might change the way

2099
01:53:33,573 --> 01:53:37,343
that they think or act?

2100
01:53:37,343 --> 01:53:41,848
I think for researchers,
I think I think any researcher

2101
01:53:41,848 --> 01:53:44,684
should still keep researching
what they're interested in.

2102
01:53:45,518 --> 01:53:49,956
Like if you've got a fascination
or an interest in Dragonfly vision,

2103
01:53:50,456 --> 01:53:53,927
dopaminergic signaling, whatever,
I think you should just keep going for it

2104
01:53:54,427 --> 01:53:56,462
and incorporate

2105
01:53:57,230 --> 01:54:01,601
active inference or any framework
that that is, is, is helping.

2106
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:04,771
You know,
I don't think jumping on the bandwagon

2107
01:54:05,371 --> 01:54:09,042
for any research is helpful, although

2108
01:54:10,109 --> 01:54:12,011
you've got to bear
in mind that if you're trying to function

2109
01:54:12,011 --> 01:54:14,948
in an institutional environment,
you're going to be on some bandwagon,

2110
01:54:15,148 --> 01:54:17,884
you're going to be in some lab,
some in a school of thought.

2111
01:54:17,884 --> 01:54:21,554
But I think it still should get
still got to do what you're interested

2112
01:54:21,554 --> 01:54:25,859
in rather than promote,
you know, someone else's program.

2113
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:28,795
So I don't have a kind of
I would love to see

2114
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:31,564
I would love to see that

2115
01:54:32,932 --> 01:54:33,766
that kind

2116
01:54:33,766 --> 01:54:37,036
of bristolian ideas
and everything could be

2117
01:54:37,036 --> 01:54:39,606
put in a intuitive way

2118
01:54:40,673 --> 01:54:43,343
that made them more accessible

2119
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:47,380
for people who are looking for a kind
of a kind of recipe offs or something

2120
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:50,850
like that, because they're so technical
and they're so formal

2121
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:54,387
and it's hard to extract

2122
01:54:56,189 --> 01:54:58,291
how to extract the gold, you know,
if you know what I mean.

2123
01:54:58,591 --> 01:54:59,659
And that's why. Yeah.

2124
01:54:59,659 --> 01:55:05,164
So I think it's a good suite of examples
would be really helpful.

2125
01:55:05,632 --> 01:55:09,035
But you know, standard cases
that people use to explain it

2126
01:55:11,604 --> 01:55:12,372
would be good.

2127
01:55:12,372 --> 01:55:15,842
You know, just as often these examples,
the examples are wrong, right?

2128
01:55:15,842 --> 01:55:21,481
So you think of Mars theory,
vision, okay, probably wrong.

2129
01:55:21,481 --> 01:55:24,651
But at least
it kind of gave you a way to understand,

2130
01:55:25,685 --> 01:55:27,720
you know,
what's going on in the visual system.

2131
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:28,955
And then you can fine tune

2132
01:55:28,955 --> 01:55:30,990
it and change it and argue with it
and everything like that.

2133
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:35,261
But he gave people a way
of taking the understanding

2134
01:55:35,261 --> 01:55:37,563
of perception out of this, out of

2135
01:55:38,998 --> 01:55:42,502
out of a really kind of technical
specialized framework.

2136
01:55:42,502 --> 01:55:45,171
And now philosophers
talk about it, psychologists, everyone.

2137
01:55:45,571 --> 01:55:49,776
And it's probably become a little bit
of an albatross around the neck of

2138
01:55:50,677 --> 01:55:54,280
the picture, but no one's come up with
no one's come up with it like a good one.

2139
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:55,848
It would be nice if someone could

2140
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:58,017
mean that because the Maas

2141
01:55:58,017 --> 01:56:01,921
framework is so, so, so

2142
01:56:01,921 --> 01:56:05,191
clear on it and and it works for active
inference too.

2143
01:56:05,191 --> 01:56:08,261
You can say, well, look,
the mind is in the business sense

2144
01:56:08,294 --> 01:56:10,730
about how he says of re

2145
01:56:11,764 --> 01:56:14,000
reconstructing
the causal structure of the world,

2146
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,435
you know, inferring the causal structure

2147
01:56:15,435 --> 01:56:17,103
of the world
outside, beyond its boundaries.

2148
01:56:17,103 --> 01:56:22,475
So it's very internalized view, but
that's a very plausible way of doing it.

2149
01:56:23,376 --> 01:56:24,177
Yeah, I get it.

2150
01:56:24,177 --> 01:56:26,546
You know, you can explain it to students
and to people.

2151
01:56:26,546 --> 01:56:30,917
Look, the brain is stuck inside its skull
it can't it can engage with the world.

2152
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:33,152
It can only ever do it
by proxy indirectly.

2153
01:56:33,753 --> 01:56:34,620
And what does it have?

2154
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:37,757
Photons, sensory receptors.

2155
01:56:37,757 --> 01:56:39,592
It's got to build a picture.

2156
01:56:39,592 --> 01:56:40,626
And, you know,

2157
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:44,664
that's what maps it and how you put it
in the predictive processing framework.

2158
01:56:45,598 --> 01:56:49,435
Something like that would be helpful
to get that idea across.

2159
01:56:49,435 --> 01:56:52,672
You can do it for other modalities,
of course, contraception, know whatever.

2160
01:56:53,773 --> 01:56:53,973
Sorry.

2161
01:56:53,973 --> 01:56:55,875
What what was the other question.

2162
01:56:55,875 --> 01:56:59,612
Though on the non research
frontier is just in the day to day,

2163
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:03,483
how is this influence
how we might think or act

2164
01:57:03,483 --> 01:57:08,955
just in our day to day experiences?

2165
01:57:08,955 --> 01:57:10,123
I think it makes a big difference

2166
01:57:10,123 --> 01:57:13,593
if you think of yourself
as you think of your behavior

2167
01:57:14,494 --> 01:57:17,997
as confirming a moral,

2168
01:57:17,997 --> 01:57:20,133
you know, I think it makes a really,
really big difference.

2169
01:57:20,133 --> 01:57:23,770
You know, if you're arguing
like you're arguing with your partner or,

2170
01:57:24,437 --> 01:57:26,973
you know, stuck in

2171
01:57:26,973 --> 01:57:30,376
a way of life or visiting
especially especially social interaction.

2172
01:57:30,843 --> 01:57:33,713
And think of social interaction
as you know, I've got a thought.

2173
01:57:33,713 --> 01:57:36,015
I'm going to try and get a point across
or I've got a goal.

2174
01:57:36,015 --> 01:57:39,786
I to equate the goal, but
I want to make friends with this person.

2175
01:57:39,786 --> 01:57:41,087
I want to do this, I want to do that,

2176
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:46,159
and then you can get pissed off
or whatever you do if it's working not.

2177
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:48,461
But maybe the right way to think of it
is, you know,

2178
01:57:49,228 --> 01:57:51,297
I've got a model
of how I function in the world

2179
01:57:52,665 --> 01:57:56,002
and my brain has built this picture
of how I function in the world.

2180
01:57:56,702 --> 01:57:58,471
And I'm just now

2181
01:57:58,471 --> 01:58:03,242
I'm bungling around the world
trying to optimize it, you know?

2182
01:58:03,276 --> 01:58:06,646
So what I think what I think of
as this kind of, you know,

2183
01:58:07,113 --> 01:58:11,784
autonomous engagement of this,
you know, individual who is above it all

2184
01:58:11,784 --> 01:58:14,620
and choosing and whatever and, you know,
making decisions and

2185
01:58:15,655 --> 01:58:18,558
not really maybe what I'm doing
is bungling around the world, trying

2186
01:58:18,558 --> 01:58:25,631
to optimize my model and maybe I've got
I can get stuck in a local minima, right?

2187
01:58:25,665 --> 01:58:29,802
I can get stuck in a, you know,
all my models, my model is not working.

2188
01:58:29,902 --> 01:58:33,239
We had this discussion
maybe I don't know if you know,

2189
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:37,009
this philosopher Dominic
Murphy is a fantastic philosopher of

2190
01:58:38,177 --> 01:58:40,446
science and psychology

2191
01:58:40,713 --> 01:58:42,315
that we have to think of,
you know, this notion.

2192
01:58:42,315 --> 01:58:46,619
But a lot of the time
what you're doing is brand management

2193
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:50,123
yourself, that you are

2194
01:58:50,123 --> 01:58:54,327
is this model that you made that works
for you in your environment, your family,

2195
01:58:54,327 --> 01:58:56,229
as you're growing up or high school
or whatever, like this.

2196
01:58:56,229 --> 01:59:00,299
And you've got this brand now,
and unfortunately or fortunately,

2197
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:04,270
that's how other people see
your actions are really about

2198
01:59:05,271 --> 01:59:07,673
getting a brand out
there, brand brand management.

2199
01:59:08,007 --> 01:59:10,943
And if you identify
with your brand right, you know,

2200
01:59:11,711 --> 01:59:14,413
but if the brand
if your brand isn't working for you

2201
01:59:15,114 --> 01:59:18,317
and if you and
if you just see your actions as, oh, God,

2202
01:59:19,352 --> 01:59:22,488
I am just what I'm doing, it's
kind of finessing and sort of

2203
01:59:22,522 --> 01:59:27,293
and reinforcing and fortifying this model
of how I act in the world.

2204
01:59:29,228 --> 01:59:31,164
Does it have to be like that?

2205
01:59:31,164 --> 01:59:33,432
You know, oh.

2206
01:59:33,432 --> 01:59:37,904
Very nice point
that instead of social interactions

2207
01:59:37,904 --> 01:59:42,375
maximizing my reward, reward
or shared reward zero sum,

2208
01:59:43,242 --> 01:59:45,611
we can actually think about
what if we were both

2209
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:49,682
reducing our uncertainty
about a positive social interaction

2210
01:59:49,682 --> 01:59:53,486
and what might be known as win
win in the reward paradigm?

2211
01:59:53,486 --> 01:59:54,220
But here.

2212
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:55,922
Yeah, that's a really good way.

2213
01:59:55,922 --> 01:59:58,024
That's a really good way to think of it.

2214
01:59:58,024 --> 01:59:59,258
That's a really good way.

2215
01:59:59,258 --> 02:00:01,360
Yeah, exactly.

2216
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,663
Thank you for this awesome visit.

2217
02:00:03,663 --> 02:00:07,233
It was really a fascinating talk
and one of in the chat.

2218
02:00:07,466 --> 02:00:08,935
Brilliant practical advice.

2219
02:00:08,935 --> 02:00:11,103
Thanks, Daniel,
and thanks for your guest.

2220
02:00:11,103 --> 02:00:12,438
So yeah, thanks.

2221
02:00:12,438 --> 02:00:13,439
Thanks a lot from our lab

2222
02:00:13,439 --> 02:00:16,442
and you and anyone else
are always welcome to join anytime.

2223
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:18,211
Thank you very much.

2224
02:00:18,211 --> 02:00:19,245
Has a really great experience.

2225
02:00:19,245 --> 02:00:19,812
Nice to try.

2226
02:00:19,812 --> 02:00:24,283
These ideas out in this discussion was
really helpful and informed, you know.

2227
02:00:24,317 --> 02:00:26,485
So thank you very much for the chance.

2228
02:00:26,485 --> 02:00:30,389
And I'll be propagating you know,
I'll be spreading the news about the lab.

2229
02:00:30,389 --> 02:00:32,391
So thank you. Thanks a lot.

2230
02:00:32,391 --> 02:00:32,992
Thanks a lot.

2231
02:00:32,992 --> 02:00:36,162
By the way, everyone, by

2232
02:00:39,632 --> 02:00:40,766
nice talk.

2233
02:00:40,766 --> 02:00:42,001
Pretty cool.
