it is march 9th 2022

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,679
we're here in actin flab guest stream

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,560
number 17.1 with mao abrasion and mao is

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,039
a product director at game addict

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,600
a researcher at versus computational

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
phenomenology lab and finishing a phd in

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,760
cognitive computing at uq am

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
we'll have a fun discussion today feel

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,559
free to write any questions in the chat

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,360
during the presentation and we'll

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
have a great time learning so thanks a

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,239
lot

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,480
for joining this guest stream and really

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,520
looking forward to what you have to

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,200
share

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
yeah thanks for having me i'm really

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
glad to be able to present this paper

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,440
we've uh we've submitted it and we're in

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760
the process of reviewing it so it's a

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
really exciting paper that i'm hoping we

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,440
can get out

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,559
soon

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,440
so

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,680
today i'm going to try to go through a

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
lot of big concepts and how they apply

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,519
an active inference and then i'm going

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,960
to try to explain

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,760
um the nitty gritty of a generative

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,080
model how to make a simulation and then

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,320
what are the takeaways and limitations

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
i'm going to try to keep this quick if

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,000
you have any questions feel free to ask

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,080
them and i'll take anything as it goes

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,759
so

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,320
let's uh begin with the main concept

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,280
here which is uh confirmation bias and

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
conformity

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,960
this uh this was the the starting point

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,320
of our research

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,799
we were we were thinking with my

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,000
co-authors

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
which are connor hines

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,200
and daphne demacus and maxwell ramstead

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
we were trying to think through

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,000
what leads people to see the world in

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
such a way that they

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
have a hard time then reconciling their

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
view of the world with other people

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,840
and so it went back to the practice of

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,079
exchanging ideas sharing concepts and

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,719
values uh between different minds which

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
is a fundamental process

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
it really allows humans and

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,318
other living agents to coordinate and

56
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,160
basically operate socially

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
by sharing ideas uh individuals

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
communities

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,879
can really pursue their pragmatic goals

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,560
so basically um

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,319
you know get food is one of the

62
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,080
permanent goals you might want to

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
optimize for

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,200
um they improve their understanding of

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,319
the world

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,920
and then

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,640
we notice that humans are compulsory

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
co-operators

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
human individuals

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,000
and

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,879
survive based on the predication that

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,720
they have access and they can leverage

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,640
the bodies of accumulated cultural

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,319
knowledge

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,640
over the course of evolutionary history

76
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,239
humans have developed an

77
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,080
exquisitely sensitive capacity to

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
discriminate between reliable sources of

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
information from unreliable ones which

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
seems counterintuitive in the age that

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,680
we're at but you have to understand how

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
far we've come

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
before we got to the to the arms race

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,560
towards misinformation

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
so

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,280
the epistemic process as i just said

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
it's really not without flaws

88
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
humans are not

89
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
computing machines they're not perfect

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,200
they mostly use heuristics

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,599
they process information by reasoning to

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,280
limit the consumption of energy and

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,760
facilitate rapid decision making that's

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
that's the basis of

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,799
survival

96
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,519
for example confirmation bias

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,840
uh implies that all other things being

98
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
equal individuals who prefer sticking to

99
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,840
their own beliefs over changing their

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,519
minds it's

101
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,080
easier for them to potentially um

102
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,799
change their model less than if they had

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,440
to really all the time constantly deal

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,239
with the volatile model of the world

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
there's a lot of research about

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,319
confirmation bias and its relation to

107
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,080
cognitive dissonance we really don't

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
like cognitive dissonance we don't like

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
feeling like the world is not what we

110
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,480
understand it to be

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
and when we're faced with information

112
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
that conflicts with our core beliefs we

113
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
do in fact

114
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,360
experience cognitive dissonance

115
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,199
the tolerance for cognitive dissonance

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,959
tends to vary across individuals but

117
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,199
there's people who can really tolerate a

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,840
wildly volatile world and they accept

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,520
that they don't know things and they

120
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,120
said that they could be wrong and then

121
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,199
there's personality types who are

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
much less likely to take this dissonance

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
and and are more

124
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,240
likely to try to avoid this dissonance

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
and so confirmation bias in this way has

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,720
a social influence

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,800
individuals will prefer sampling data

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
from their in-group and will seek to

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,880
confirm their own ideas by foraging for

130
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
confirmatory information from their

131
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
in-group

132
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,880
this allows ensures that they have

133
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
access to like-minded allies

134
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,000
and they choose to belong to communities

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
where their deeply held beliefs are

136
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
promoted and shared this limits the

137
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,440
cognitive effort that is already

138
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,560
expended in the forging of information

139
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,479
this in-group delivery

140
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,720
um also influences how strongly

141
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,680
information is integrated so if a group

142
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,039
membership is important for the

143
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,560
individual

144
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,199
uh they'll tend to integrate

145
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,720
way more information that comes from

146
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,639
someone they believe believes the same

147
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,560
things as them

148
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
for instance you can think of news

149
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,960
sources and fox news so people it's not

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,520
like people from different aisles don't

151
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
know what the others are saying they

152
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,360
just tend to

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,000
take what their preferred channel says

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
and completely ignore what other

155
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,560
channels are saying even if they've

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,880
heard it

157
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,198
so

158
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
the confirmation bias is echoed by

159
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
another

160
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
uh heuristic and we're talking about

161
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,199
conformity so that's the need to cohere

162
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,280
with the beliefs of one's in groups so

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,560
it's kind of a

164
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
push and pull right i want to be

165
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,759
in a group of people who are like-minded

166
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
and i want to believe the same things

167
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
that i believe therefore going in a

168
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,039
group of people who are like-minded is

169
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,039
the best way to do so

170
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,560
i also don't want to be kicked out from

171
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
the group because the group has access

172
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
to a lot of resources that is very good

173
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
for me right

174
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,400
um

175
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,319
it limits how much information any one

176
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,479
agent has to gather to be part of a

177
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,680
group

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,479
uh it also increases how much each agent

179
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,759
is trusted

180
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
um

181
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,759
in-group agents can be way more

182
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,680
precisely predicted

183
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
by their their the other members of

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,960
their group

185
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
uh this is in part due by

186
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,919
norms and behaviors scripts we wrote

187
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,919
another paper about this

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,600
and generally these scripts tend to

189
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
benefit the members of the group right

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,560
um that's why they also want to uphold

191
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
these um these scripts

192
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,120
so being able to sample from the group

193
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
entails a continued relationship to

194
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
other members

195
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
if i lose access to this i can lose

196
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
access to information food shelter and

197
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,560
you know

198
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,680
it leads to difficulties

199
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
if you want to read more i can

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,199
eventually give you all the resources

201
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,479
so

202
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,639
this is a natural stopping point if you

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,160
want if you have any questions if you

204
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
have any notes you can share them now

205
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,400
it was really

206
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
powerful what you said about the losing

207
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
access

208
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,520
to the group benefits especially from

209
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
just the evolutionary and ecological

210
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,880
point of view

211
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,960
what are the scripts

212
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
and how does this current work that

213
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
you're sharing relate to the work that

214
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,240
you had done with narrative and scripts

215
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,120
yeah

216
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
so i mean the definition of scripts is

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,280
not

218
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,120
perfectly shared across the board

219
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,840
there's a lot of fields that use it but

220
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,759
the way that we've reviewed the

221
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,120
literature and brought together we have

222
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
weak scripts and strong scripts so we

223
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
weak scripts are like

224
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,800
clusters of connected uh concepts that

225
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,440
tend to exist with one another in a sort

226
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,520
of um

227
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
it's like it's like the building of a

228
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,879
context with naturally co-occurring

229
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,319
concepts and then the strong scripts is

230
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,960
how these concepts tend to

231
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
uh sequence over time so like for

232
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
instance um there is going to be a

233
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,080
natural entailment to certain events

234
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,479
that they gather the concepts together

235
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,000
and then you're going to be able to to

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
exist in a space like this

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,039
um

238
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
and that's that's how you

239
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,080
you norm not only how people behave in a

240
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
group but how they coordinate that is

241
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,559
how you norm how they uh sample reality

242
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,200
because let's let's imagine my script in

243
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,279
this place says that i must do this this

244
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
and that so i'm going to do this this

245
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,080
and that which means i'm not going to

246
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
have access to all the other things i

247
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,279
might have done if my script had been a

248
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,279
little different so that's one way that

249
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,640
we um we force people to only look at a

250
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
subset of the of the available

251
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,519
information in a given space

252
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
cool and then how did it

253
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,399
relate or how does this research build

254
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,880
upon what you had done

255
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,040
[Music]

256
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
those few months ago

257
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
right so the the previous paper had

258
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,279
formalized what a script means in terms

259
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,760
of active inference and basically

260
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,880
um

261
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,080
you with

262
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
you as an agent with your niche

263
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
um

264
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,680
predict

265
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,320
what you're um what you're supposed to

266
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,279
do next so it it it puts a strong

267
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,360
emphasis on your on on your available

268
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,200
policies and the way that your policies

269
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
are shaped and then

270
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
you're going to

271
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
tailor your prediction error on the

272
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
response of the nation so then you're

273
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,880
going to get to this sort of

274
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,160
um sequenced patterns of synchronization

275
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,880
that reinforce each other right so the

276
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,680
more

277
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,480
i get the right pattern the more i'm

278
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
likely to get good reinforcement and

279
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
therefore i'm going to you know

280
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
think that this is the right pattern for

281
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,959
this group and this is going to shape

282
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,200
the niche so much so that if anyone even

283
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,279
wants to or tries to enact something

284
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,360
different they may just get so much

285
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,279
prediction error that you know people

286
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,000
just

287
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,760
will will push back on it and you're

288
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,839
gonna stay within this sort of manifold

289
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,440
that has you know

290
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,760
the center points that that

291
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,399
gets all the states in but

292
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,920
the way that we're using this research

293
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,720
to build on the previous one is that

294
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
we understand that a script takes many

295
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,600
forms right the weak version of the

296
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
script is really

297
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,600
something you could call an ideology

298
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,920
right so if you take all of my weak

299
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,120
scripts

300
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
really what this is is

301
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,600
how do i map my observations to my

302
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
states it's really what it is right

303
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,880
and so this new research is saying well

304
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,040
agents are going to map things

305
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,320
differently

306
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,120
and thus they're going to end up into

307
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
different groups by simple virtue of

308
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,120
mapping

309
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,360
so differently that eventually it makes

310
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
no sense for them to try to interact

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,720
with one another because they couldn't

312
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
synchronize anyway so that's

313
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
um that's that's where that's how this

314
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,560
builds upon the previous research

315
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,120
cool does that make sense

316
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,160
yeah

317
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,959
please carry on

318
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,160
okay so we've discussed confirmation

319
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,120
bias and conformity and we've discussed

320
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,360
how they mutually reinforce each other

321
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,760
so to save energy confirmation bias

322
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,640
leads

323
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
to agents being drawn to groups that

324
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,920
validate their opinion and increase the

325
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
probability of behavioral and epistemic

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,880
conformity right believe the same things

327
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
and they form the basis of information

328
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,279
spread so agents spread information

329
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,880
through media and through connections to

330
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,519
one another given a network structure

331
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,639
right

332
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
um and the spread of ideas and behaviors

333
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,399
serves local

334
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,720
and larger scale coordination this is

335
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
very much based on the work of maxwell

336
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,680
who has effectively um discussed how

337
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,360
active inference

338
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,720
works across scale in nested

339
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
markov blankets that eventually build

340
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,519
and become one another

341
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,880
so

342
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
similar norms and coordination can be

343
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,560
understood as synchronization

344
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,240
which lowers the cost of information

345
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,440
flow

346
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
this increases the certainty of the

347
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,279
message being spread as well as the

348
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,040
quality of its reception so just right

349
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
there this increased certainty the

350
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,079
capacity to spread messages this uh

351
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,760
quality of reception you can see already

352
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
how this might lead towards better

353
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,240
synchronization right because um more

354
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
certainty means you may have less

355
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,079
attention to give to one thing

356
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,600
in order for it to happen and you can

357
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
start thinking about other things and

358
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,680
and start specializing in in other areas

359
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,800
with this certainty staying up right

360
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
uh the message will be more intelligible

361
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
to group members who share the common

362
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
set of codes uh and agents who are more

363
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
likely to integrate new information if

364
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,519
it fits better with their understanding

365
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,120
of the world

366
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,839
so

367
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,160
one example of optimization of message

368
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,800
passing includes hashtags

369
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
they have been known to be heavy

370
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,040
carriers of information in echo chambers

371
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
they they're used in partisan ways to

372
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
reach people of similar mindsets who

373
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,519
understand what the hashtag means and

374
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
understand that this is a signal for

375
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,839
them to interpret what's being said in

376
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,639
the life they want to interpret

377
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,160
so the spread of information is

378
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,200
optimized through hashtags as

379
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,920
pseudo-meta-linguistic categorization

380
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
markers that was those a lot of words

381
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,160
but really really what it means is just

382
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,800
that uh we see a hashtag

383
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,399
we know what it means we know it has a

384
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,639
lot of meaning without having to have a

385
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,240
whole text for it which is great for

386
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,160
twitter right

387
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,360
um

388
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
so

389
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
we labeled our communities in this study

390
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,800
um

391
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,959
formed in the process of belief sharing

392
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,760
as

393
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,600
epistemic communities now this term

394
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,839
already exists it was already used by

395
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,880
other um other fields but we've tailored

396
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
it a little bit to mean specifically

397
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,399
that our communities that share and

398
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,920
spread a worldview

399
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
or a paradigm or normalized sampling

400
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
behaviors

401
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,519
individuals in the community are tied

402
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,680
together by these practices which

403
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
reinforce the social signals acting as

404
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,839
evidence for the shared model of the

405
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,760
world so hashtags

406
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,880
the echo chamber formation is an extreme

407
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,720
example of epistemic communities echo

408
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,560
chambers type people with similar views

409
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,120
together and they tend to actively work

410
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
against the engagement with external

411
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,639
sources

412
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
they become very epistemically

413
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,639
vulnerable when members can really no

414
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
longer assess when an information is

415
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,959
true or not

416
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,040
only having access to a few sources

417
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
limits how much information can be

418
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,160
gathered and relevant sources of

419
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,120
evidence really fall through the gaps

420
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,680
and error will be propagated because it

421
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,760
goes really well really fast and is

422
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,839
integrated really strongly and so if the

423
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,519
people can no longer tell whether it's

424
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,320
false or not then the the

425
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,959
the system is much likely to to be more

426
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,600
vulnerable to misinformation and errors

427
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
they'll have a difficult time to check

428
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,519
errors against anything and um most

429
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,600
mines in the echo chambers will become

430
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
more and more synchronized and thus

431
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,880
poised to make the same mistakes

432
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
um so that's a pretty uh that's pretty

433
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,120
chunk right there

434
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,519
if you want we can like take a beat

435
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,560
yeah

436
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,839
i had a question

437
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,959
what does a healthy usage of hashtags

438
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,079
look like

439
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,959
or how do we

440
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,079
compress

441
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,440
information and context and perspective

442
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
in a way that might not have some of

443
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,040
these like threats or failures that

444
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,680
you're talking about

445
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,399
so for the first parts i

446
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,000
i have an idea but i've never read

447
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
anything that specifically said this is

448
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,519
a healthy you saw i'll venture a guess

449
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,519
but i'll start with the second part of

450
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,120
the question that will give you a good

451
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,000
sense the way to keep communities

452
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,199
healthy is to force them to be exposed

453
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,240
to viewpoints they may not agree with

454
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,519
sources that they're not um

455
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,000
necessarily familiar with

456
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,560
and that have

457
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,440
more

458
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,079
nuanced takes so the more you expose

459
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,519
people to

460
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,600
different kinds of people different

461
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,160
kinds of beliefs the more likely they

462
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,279
are to

463
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,839
depolarize and be more open to

464
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,160
possibilities

465
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,639
that's just a fact like we may think

466
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,240
through experience no you know what when

467
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
i see my uh

468
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,399
my conservative uncle

469
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,959
my racist homophobic conservative uncle

470
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,320
when he talks

471
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,639
my teeth grit and i stop listening

472
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,839
yes that's true

473
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,480
but you still are exposed to him

474
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,560
you still have to engage with his

475
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,360
thoughts to some degree and so your

476
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,920
reaction to push him away

477
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,639
that's a natural reaction and you know

478
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,039
you might actually do it but

479
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,119
if you're never ever exposed to his

480
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,439
thoughts you will never be able to

481
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,439
actually first of all really know

482
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,760
whether they're not true because you

483
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,640
you've never engaged with them right

484
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,679
so

485
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,240
that's one thing so the the guess about

486
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,359
the hashtags is

487
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,839
maybe try to

488
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,760
research hashtags that are not part of

489
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,440
your community

490
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,679
and try to reach people

491
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,480
who

492
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
may not normally listen to you in a

493
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,919
language that is potentially less

494
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,280
polarized

495
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,520
so if you really want someone the best

496
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,240
example of this is um

497
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
oh so she's a youtuber she's amazing

498
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,000
natalie

499
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,799
wynne do you know her

500
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,640
not familiar right now

501
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
uh i i just the thing is just i don't

502
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,520
remember the name of her channel but

503
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,480
uh

504
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,240
she basically specialized in

505
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,000
philosophically deconstructing

506
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
um conservative talking points in a way

507
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
that um

508
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,799
steel manned them

509
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,039
and didn't just destroy them on a sort

510
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,559
of

511
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,559
you know

512
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,200
value-based basis it was more like let's

513
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
take these points let's remove

514
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,039
everything that actually really isn't

515
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,799
true and take the kernel of truth in

516
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,039
there and understand it through their

517
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,039
eyes and reinterpret why this might

518
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,880
actually still be wrong but not in a way

519
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,840
that was demeaning and she reached a lot

520
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
of people this way she reached a lot of

521
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,679
conservatives who were like

522
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,679
wow okay no you know what i get it and

523
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,240
and it was very effective so

524
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,760
i think that's the answer to your

525
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,600
question

526
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
cool carry on

527
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,559
maybe

528
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
i'm sure we'll be able to bring active

529
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
inference in but it's awesome to be just

530
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,520
building the context and seeing how

531
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
there was motivation um and the

532
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,000
perspective on the work

533
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,039
awesome

534
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,400
so yeah so

535
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,160
one of the elements that

536
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,400
maybe will in fact give you a good sense

537
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
of how we're bringing active inferences

538
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,919
is the concept of volatility and habit

539
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,840
formation so

540
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,320
stability in the group is not guaranteed

541
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
optimal inference in a changing world

542
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,360
requires integrating sensory data right

543
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,960
with beliefs about the intrinsic

544
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,799
volatility of the environment

545
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,520
so

546
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,120
environments with higher quality

547
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
volatility change more often and thus

548
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,679
have shorter intrinsic time scales

549
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,840
at which the agent has to keep updating

550
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,559
their beliefs and conversely

551
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,000
environments with lower volatility

552
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
require you know longer time scale to

553
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,480
start updating your beliefs

554
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,799
um on the other hand

555
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,360
so um

556
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,880
having a better ability to track

557
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,840
potentially important fluctuations in

558
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,039
information requires to pay attention to

559
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,679
smaller changes but increased attention

560
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,840
to environmental fluctuations will

561
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,039
potentially lead to increased

562
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,760
sensitivity to random non-informative

563
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,159
changes in the environment so that might

564
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,400
be called a higher false positive rate

565
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,520
right so

566
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,240
it's important for agents to is to have

567
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,159
the right step um understanding of the

568
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,960
volatility in their environment

569
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,720
one way to cope with volatility is to

570
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
use the copic mechanism

571
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,480
to constrain the uncertainty related to

572
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
their own behaviors via habit formation

573
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,760
so

574
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,840
um here we're going to model habit as a

575
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,159
form of behavioral reinforcement where

576
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,080
behaviors become more probable as a

577
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,799
function of how often they are engaged

578
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,360
so an agent has engaged in a given

579
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,760
behavior enough a habit can then be

580
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,159
formed and become hard to unlearn and

581
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,880
this is important as we understand both

582
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,720
how parameters are set in our generative

583
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
model but also how echo chambers can

584
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,360
form by habit formation

585
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,840
so in our model behavior is driven by

586
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
information seeking

587
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,559
which drives uh it's a drive that leads

588
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,799
agent to preferentially sample

589
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,640
information from other agents with

590
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
beliefs that they believe are similar to

591
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,360
their own so this um

592
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,520
the way that i'm saying this believe

593
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,440
that they believe is important in active

594
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
inference because the inactive inference

595
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
we're starting from the assumption that

596
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,440
we don't ever really know things are

597
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,600
kind of hidden from us and we have to

598
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,799
infer what things might be so i never

599
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,480
really have access to what the other

600
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,919
person believes

601
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,120
i think

602
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,200
they might think this and i'm going to

603
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,440
try to infer their beliefs based on some

604
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
observations they're putting out into

605
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,200
the world

606
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,559
okay

607
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,520
now we've

608
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,320
point that down

609
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,559
let's start with

610
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,799
doing friends so we're getting to the

611
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,600
meat of it i'm gonna do a very uh short

612
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,840
introductory inference if you already

613
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,440
know great if you don't then this is

614
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,760
gonna be very informative

615
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,240
it's a biologically motivated framework

616
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,159
that rests on first principles of

617
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,159
self-organization in complex adaptive

618
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,440
systems

619
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,480
so

620
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,559
self-organization part is probably the

621
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,640
most important part here because active

622
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,919
inference is potentially less

623
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,240
interesting for rocks for instance

624
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
because they they tend to self-organize

625
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
a little less um i'm pretty sure we

626
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,799
could effectively use it for larger

627
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,080
models of um astrology but in uh sorry

628
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,600
astronomy but effectively what you

629
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,760
really care here is for things that tend

630
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,520
to fight entropy

631
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,039
so it's focused on the notion that

632
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,080
internal states of any biological system

633
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,880
are statistically insulated from the

634
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
environment that generates sensory

635
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,120
observations so basically they have an

636
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,919
inside and they have an outside

637
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,360
um

638
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,240
and so they engage in inference about

639
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
the the causes of what gives them

640
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,000
sensory states to really behave

641
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,960
optimally to keep fighting entropy

642
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,240
so biological systems entertain a

643
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,640
generative model of the latent

644
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,480
environmental causes of their sensory

645
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,679
input so latent because i don't know

646
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,640
really what causes it i can only infer

647
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,080
so it's a little different from

648
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,480
reinforcement learning or reflexive

649
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,080
behavioral algorithms um because actions

650
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,960
taken under active inference are guided

651
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
by these internal beliefs

652
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,799
and themselves they are optimized with

653
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,280
respect to an internal world model or a

654
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,679
representation of the world's causal and

655
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,520
data-generative structure we call the

656
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,240
generative model

657
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,240
agents in active inference represent

658
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,720
their own actions in their generative

659
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,000
model

660
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
by performing inference on both

661
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,120
hidden environment states of the world

662
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,840
and the consequences of their own

663
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,039
actions

664
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,480
they can select behavior which first

665
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400
achieves their goal or fulfills

666
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
preferences

667
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,360
and second

668
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,600
reduces uncertainty in the age and world

669
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,039
model so this is where we get to the

670
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,600
epistemic part right i don't

671
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,679
i want a certain the world to be a

672
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,039
certain way

673
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,200
and i also want to be less uncertain

674
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,080
about

675
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,919
my uncertainty of the world being the

676
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,520
certain way right

677
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,679
so an agent's main objective is to

678
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
increase their model evidence

679
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,679
and to reduce suppress

680
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,000
surprised that like

681
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,919
a consider an agent which is in the

682
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,600
world um

683
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,400
if

684
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,520
i want to predict myself surviving i

685
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
want to see things which are likely to

686
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,120
make me survive

687
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,760
if i'm surprised by something it's

688
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,880
probably not likely to make me sir

689
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,320
survive and therefore it's probably

690
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
something i should avoid like for right

691
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,640
now i'm in my room i expect the room to

692
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,880
stay where it is as it is this is good

693
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,559
if we're there were to appear on my

694
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,760
right

695
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
would be very surprising and probably

696
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,799
very bad for me

697
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,000
so

698
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
processes like learning perception

699
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,080
planning and goal-directed behavior

700
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,840
emerge from this single drive to

701
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,760
increase evidence for the agent's

702
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,559
generative model of the world

703
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,840
so far

704
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,080
still good

705
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,200
so the agents never directly act on

706
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,039
sensory data but they change their

707
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,760
belief about what causes that data

708
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,240
this is a core step in active inference

709
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,559
it consists in optimizing these beliefs

710
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,880
using a generative model

711
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
it's also known as bayesian inference or

712
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,960
bayesian model inversion

713
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,440
this inference answers the question

714
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,039
what is my best guess about the state of

715
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,080
the world

716
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,799
given my sensory data and my prior

717
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,960
beliefs i don't come into the world not

718
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
knowing anything

719
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,840
i have some

720
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,159
basic beliefs about how what's what's

721
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,159
going to happen and then i'm getting

722
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,600
observations and i make predictions

723
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,279
about what might happen and then i act

724
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,960
on those predictions

725
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,360
this follows bayes rule

726
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,000
where the optimal belief about hidden or

727
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,279
latent variable

728
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,120
given some sensory data is called the

729
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,559
posterior distribution

730
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,240
um if you want

731
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,000
and keep going into that or i can skip

732
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
that automatically

733
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,480
but

734
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,720
but basically um

735
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,279
you you you basically calculate uh the

736
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,279
probability of something given something

737
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,480
else active inference perception

738
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,000
uh the generation of the best guess

739
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
about the current hidden states of the

740
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,240
world

741
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,120
is formalized as the computation of a

742
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,000
posterior distribution over some hidden

743
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,360
states

744
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,520
and action so the active part of active

745
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,559
inference

746
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,799
is the computation of a posterior

747
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,080
distribution over policies policies are

748
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,360
just a sequence of um of potential

749
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,440
states of the world

750
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,600
okay

751
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,960
so

752
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,320
now we introduce the actual model

753
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,480
is it is it clear so far is the active

754
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
inference part pretty clear

755
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
that's awesome you

756
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,600
hit on many great active

757
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,279
pieces

758
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,400
um

759
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,559
the only piece that really

760
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,600
i wanted to mention was the difference

761
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,520
between the observations like what was

762
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,400
said

763
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
and then the hidden

764
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,960
hypothesized cognitive states

765
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,279
it opens up a space between what

766
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,360
happened and why

767
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,400
somebody

768
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,240
said that

769
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,039
and

770
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,880
so that comes up all the time in

771
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,039
epistemic communities what did the

772
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,880
author mean by those words or what did

773
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,039
the person mean by saying that and so

774
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,120
that's why the context is so important

775
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
and active gives a framework that might

776
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
help us model that kind of a scenario

777
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,320
exactly and i mean this is this is

778
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,760
exactly where we're trying to go with

779
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,000
this research is that what right now we

780
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,919
want to model how

781
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,880
people tend to

782
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,559
have different views of the world but

783
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,279
the underlying phenomenon here and we're

784
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,279
going to try to dig more into that is

785
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,960
that

786
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,440
or the hypothesis anyway is that there

787
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,320
is a literal different mapping between

788
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,919
an observation

789
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,240
and a state which means for the same

790
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,360
thing being seen by two different people

791
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,600
we're going to infer two very different

792
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,039
things

793
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,320
and

794
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
the funny thing is

795
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,480
then you come into the world of values

796
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,960
where it's it's a whole other

797
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,559
scale and stuff

798
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,679
where

799
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,000
we may be interpreting the same thing

800
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,080
but we'll have a spin on it

801
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,240
and that spin being like

802
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,159
no no i know what he meant i just

803
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,760
fundamentally disagree with it and this

804
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,919
is how we get into the web these these

805
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,960
scripted webs of conceptual spaces where

806
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,840
um

807
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,320
you see these these graphs of concepts

808
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,760
being connected but at some point

809
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,120
there's a rift

810
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,840
and and that rift makes it so that i

811
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,919
value this and you do not and we're

812
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,399
still and so we can converge towards

813
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,559
understanding

814
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,200
without necessarily being able to

815
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,840
converge towards um acceptance

816
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,279
so this is still very hypothetical

817
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,440
though

818
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,159
one other note on on what you just said

819
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,840
there it's like the difference between

820
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,200
an orthodoxy and orthopraxis

821
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,840
so what is the similarity between

822
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
conformity of thought

823
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,720
and

824
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,799
latitude on action

825
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,159
vice versa

826
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,480
and then in what way are the

827
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,640
systems around us like aligned or not

828
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,480
with our preference about those features

829
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,279
of systems

830
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,559
yeah absolutely absolutely i mean i feel

831
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
like this could all be encased in c

832
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,440
right like we can interpret the same

833
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,840
thing but my fee is way over

834
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,159
there over here

835
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,840
so

836
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
i'll explain see later

837
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,760
this made very little sense a lot of

838
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,880
people

839
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,320
um

840
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,840
so let's introduce the model a little

841
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,200
more

842
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,799
um

843
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,279
we have individuals agents who share

844
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,039
information with one another and they

845
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,960
come to form beliefs about their local

846
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,039
environment and about the beliefs of

847
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,520
other agents in their community so to

848
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
understand this phenomenon we leverage

849
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,760
thus the active framework

850
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,000
here the organisms tend to

851
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,679
minimize a quantity called variational

852
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,520
free energy which quantifies the

853
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,159
divergence between the expected and the

854
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,559
sense data as explained before

855
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,559
from this point of view to select an

856
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,360
action is to infer what i must be doing

857
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,640
given what i believe and what i sense

858
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,320
so there's been a lot of work done in

859
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
this field on active inference to study

860
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,000
social systems i'm not going to go over

861
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,399
all of it but um there's really cool

862
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,600
studies i've just highlighted a few here

863
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,840
where basically um

864
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,960
systems uh minimize free energy give

865
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,799
rise to large-scale behavioral

866
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,240
coordination

867
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,360
much of the work though is still

868
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,679
theoretical so it'll be interesting to

869
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,760
see how experimental work can delve into

870
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,399
this um i know jonas mago

871
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,000
uh uh rudy pitia and maxwell ramsey are

872
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,320
doing a lot of work on this i think uh

873
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,159
lars senzvet as well as doing some cool

874
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,760
work on this

875
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,879
i'm just throwing on me

876
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,760
so um at first glance it might appear

877
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,440
difficult to model a phenomenon like

878
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,039
confirmation bias

879
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,480
using active inference formulation why

880
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,000
because

881
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,640
remember our agents are supposed to be

882
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,120
guided by the principle of maximizing

883
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,080
beijing surprise or earth silence which

884
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,919
requires to constantly seek out

885
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,679
information that is expected to

886
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,000
challenge one's world right because the

887
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,919
more surprised that consumed now the

888
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,320
less likely i am to be surprised later

889
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,519
right

890
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,960
but

891
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,840
information gain is subjective

892
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,799
um

893
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,559
epistemic value

894
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,960
or the the basin surprise or information

895
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,399
gain is always an expected surprise from

896
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,120
the point of view of the agent

897
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,200
it's in relation to the agent's set of

898
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,279
beliefs or genetic model

899
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,600
and because of this subjectivity

900
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,399
the informativeness of epistemic value

901
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,799
or or epistemic value of an action can

902
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,559
be

903
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,000
arbitrarily far from the agent's

904
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,519
expectation

905
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,600
so taking advantage of this

906
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,399
we gave agents what we refer to as

907
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,039
epistemic confirmation bias by building

908
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,720
a prior belief into the degenerative

909
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,919
model

910
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,840
that agents are more likely to sample

911
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
informative information from agents with

912
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,880
whom they agree a priori

913
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,600
and this a priori notion is important so

914
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,679
agents will sample agents with whom they

915
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,240
agree under the belief

916
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,919
that the agents are more likely to

917
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,080
provide higher quality information

918
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,279
there you go

919
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,080
um

920
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,440
this has a key difference with some

921
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,039
traditional opinion model so there's

922
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,600
been a lot of opinion models out there

923
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,039
not a lot with active inference but

924
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,880
definitely a lot with traditional

925
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,080
approaches

926
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,840
and so the implementation of bounded

927
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,279
confidence to motivate polarization is

928
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,519
usually hard-coded in the agent's

929
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,679
ability to perceive and thus update

930
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,120
their beliefs

931
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
in our model

932
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,279
polarization is motivated by the

933
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,000
positive effect of confirmation bias and

934
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,840
is thus directly

935
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,720
in the agent's model of the world

936
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,640
this allows agents to get more evidence

937
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,399
about their environment

938
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,080
if the information comes from another

939
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,159
agent that shares the same worldview

940
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,080
they're implicitly motivated in their

941
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,840
generative models

942
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,159
to gain more evidence about the world if

943
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,799
it confirms their pre-existing beliefs

944
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,440
also agents normally in traditional

945
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,919
models can directly perceive the belief

946
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,679
state of other agents right directly

947
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,760
perceived that's the key here

948
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,720
um

949
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,880
but in our model this is pretty we

950
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,120
believe this is unrealistic because we

951
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,840
we only infer the beliefs of others and

952
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
thus

953
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,000
um agents do not have direct access to

954
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,840
each other's belief states they they

955
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,640
infer the belief states and change them

956
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,600
through observation

957
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,440
um there's been a few recent

958
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,919
papers on that begin to build bayesian

959
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,239
models of opinion dynamics

960
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,760
which are motivated by the bayesian

961
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,320
brain hypothesis

962
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,000
a crucial point that distinguishes

963
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,839
approaches like active inference and

964
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,839
planning as inference from the genitive

965
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,440
bayesian approach is the notion that

966
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,320
actions themselves are inferred

967
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
behavior is cast as the result of

968
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,960
inference specifically by sampling

969
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,040
actions from a posterior distribution

970
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,960
over actions

971
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,079
so actions are selected in order to

972
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,239
achieve goals that minimize future

973
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,480
uncertainty and to maximize a lower

974
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,040
bound on bayesian model evidence

975
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,719
so um

976
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,399
we're using this to supplement the

977
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,960
goal-directed aspect of policy inference

978
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,560
which is driven by the expected free

979
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,599
energy

980
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,719
um and this becomes habits when the

981
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,800
prior over the actions becomes

982
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,359
inflexible right so if the prior over

983
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,440
action becomes so strong

984
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,400
it's just always going to be that right

985
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,440
um this prior is learned over time

986
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,839
and in the context of opinion dynamics

987
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,160
it can lead to a propensity to continue

988
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,000
sampling agents that have been sampled

989
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,640
previously so it's this idea of choosing

990
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
action through inference in accordance

991
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,800
with the minimization of uncertainty

992
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,599
it's a powerful modeling technique

993
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,960
because through the choice of policy

994
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,040
inference one can encode

995
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,200
various social behaviors like conformity

996
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,880
habit formation hostility and

997
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,400
indifference here we really only did um

998
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,720
habit formation because we had to focus

999
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,599
but eventually this could lead to very

1000
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,280
very powerful

1001
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,599
modeling tools for social uh

1002
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,320
so

1003
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,400
i can stop here before i launch into the

1004
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,040
hypothesis

1005
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,640
awesome with active inference let's keep

1006
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,640
going

1007
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
so we have three hypotheses

1008
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,800
the first one is uh that we cast

1009
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,560
confirmation bison actor inference as a

1010
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,119
form of biased curiosity in which agents

1011
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,560
selectively gather information from

1012
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,520
other agents with whom they agree

1013
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,520
um epistemic confirmation can mediate

1014
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,760
the formation of echo chambers

1015
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,320
uh and polarization in social networks

1016
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
but we also believe that uh

1017
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,640
confirmation bias episode confirmation

1018
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,800
bias and network connectivity will will

1019
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,359
mod and modulate the formation of

1020
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,760
polarized epistemic communities

1021
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,560
um hypothesis number two is we consider

1022
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,720
the effect of agents beliefs about the

1023
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,440
volatility of their social environments

1024
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,040
so we try to see how beliefs about

1025
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,440
social volatility impact their sampling

1026
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,800
behaviors

1027
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,240
and which itself may interact with

1028
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,400
epistemic confirmation bias so we

1029
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,240
hypothesize that beliefs about less

1030
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,079
quickly changing social environments

1031
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,280
will increase the likelihood of

1032
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
polarization

1033
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,640
and hypothesis tree

1034
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,839
uh we hypothesize that we can model uh

1035
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,920
selective exposure effects and

1036
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,240
conformity through habit formation which

1037
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,400
emerges through bayes optimal learning

1038
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,640
so we show that agents will begin to

1039
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,160
sample only those who belong to a

1040
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,480
particular epistemic community

1041
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,000
a greater learning rate for habit

1042
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,760
formation will lead to clusters within

1043
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,920
the network amplifying and quickening

1044
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,280
the formation of echo chambers

1045
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,800
so

1046
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
the model

1047
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,560
this is a multi-agent active inference

1048
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,520
model

1049
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,760
uh a group of agents

1050
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,599
update their beliefs about an abstract

1051
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,599
binary state that represents two

1052
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,920
conflicting ideas and the opinion states

1053
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,079
about these ideas

1054
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,000
each agent also generates an action that

1055
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,920
is observable

1056
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
to other agents in the context of

1057
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,200
digital social network we're using the

1058
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,240
twitter linguistics but this was um we

1059
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,440
basically tried to replicate

1060
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,880
distributions that were fine in previous

1061
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,119
studies on twitter

1062
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,320
over time

1063
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
each agent updates

1064
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
posterior distribution or beliefs about

1065
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,119
which idea is true

1066
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,720
and as well as a belief about what a

1067
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,079
connected set of other agents in the

1068
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,760
network believes so basically what do

1069
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,440
their neighbors believe

1070
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,599
and uh both of these inferences are

1071
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,520
achieved by observing the behavior of

1072
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
other agents

1073
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,200
agents can only observe the behavior of

1074
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,960
one agent at a time so they have to they

1075
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,680
have to um specific

1076
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,400
pick who they want to uh look at

1077
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,079
all right

1078
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,280
the generator model

1079
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,400
um i can go into detail if you want but

1080
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,640
um this is pretty

1081
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,680
i know it looks like a lot but it's

1082
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,040
actually pretty simple

1083
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,400
um these

1084
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,280
encapsulate observations right so this

1085
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,599
is the observation about uh what i'm

1086
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,920
tweeting who i'm looking at and what

1087
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,440
they're tweeting right

1088
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,599
and then the a matrix

1089
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,040
is mapping the probability of a state

1090
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,960
having caused this observation so we

1091
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,119
have states about like what is

1092
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,680
um is the id true or not is it id1 is it

1093
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,599
id2 um this is a bit blurry but uh

1094
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,520
basically like uh which neighbor am i

1095
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,920
looking at and

1096
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,280
this one is who we're looking at what do

1097
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,960
they believe right so it's it's it's

1098
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,880
pretty simple mapping

1099
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,200
here you have d which is the priors

1100
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,760
um so what do i believe about the world

1101
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,440
before having any observation about the

1102
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,640
world then b is the transitions right so

1103
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,599
how are the states likely to succeed one

1104
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,040
another

1105
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,680
here you have the the policies so uh

1106
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,520
what kinds of actions am i likely to

1107
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,680
take to bring about this uh this

1108
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,839
exception of um

1109
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,680
of of states

1110
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,760
and c are my preferences

1111
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,440
so then there are other terms but

1112
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,640
they're a bit more complicated so i'm

1113
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,160
not going to go into them but basically

1114
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,720
these are the main um these are the main

1115
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,680
things you have to know about a

1116
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,359
generative model

1117
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,520
so i'm going to skip real fast because

1118
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
there were little arrows and i could

1119
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,440
explain more but man

1120
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,839
just yep

1121
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:57,200
uh here

1122
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,640
each agent's

1123
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,240
each active reference agent in the

1124
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,000
multi-agent simulation is equipped with

1125
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,880
the same generative model

1126
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,440
a single agent observes the action of

1127
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,800
other agents

1128
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,280
um they form beliefs about an abstract

1129
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,359
binary environmental states and then

1130
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,040
they choose actions which themselves are

1131
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,440
observing observable to other actions

1132
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,119
the focal agent consists of two

1133
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,200
simultaneous choices

1134
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,280
an expression and an observation so

1135
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,000
basically what am i tweeting

1136
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,160
and who am i looking at

1137
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
an agent can only observe one neighbor

1138
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,640
at a time so at each time step a vocal

1139
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,960
agent both tweets its own hashtag and

1140
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,560
chooses to read a hashtag tweeted by

1141
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,920
another single agent so here we're

1142
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,599
saying hashtag again this is just

1143
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,040
linguistics right we could have said

1144
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,119
anything basically these are numbers in

1145
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,400
a matrix um effectively in a much more

1146
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,880
complex model we could have had them um

1147
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
read a hashtag and a sentence and then

1148
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,640
try to infer what the sentence really

1149
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,839
says like that we could have done

1150
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,440
something much more complex but for now

1151
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,760
the point was just to make them try to

1152
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,119
infer a belief based on

1153
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,599
hmm

1154
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,680
i hope mal will rejoin and then we'll

1155
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,680
continue

1156
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,240
hey

1157
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,560
are you there yep

1158
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,880
so sorry i don't know what happened

1159
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,599
oh we get all kinds of of surprises we

1160
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,079
we prefer surprises here you can reshare

1161
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,359
and just continue it was only a few

1162
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,119
seconds but it was

1163
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,640
it was great you know when you say the

1164
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,160
right keywords

1165
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,839
and then the internet short circuits it

1166
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,000
happens

1167
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,040
all right

1168
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,240
well

1169
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,960
i don't see you anymore oh yeah i'm here

1170
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,240
no no i'm here

1171
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,599
don't worry

1172
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,200
i'll share my screen again

1173
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,160
awesome actually can i no let's just go

1174
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,720
with this okay can you see my screen

1175
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,599
again and i'm back is everything cool

1176
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,839
great great wonderful

1177
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,599
we're back now where did you cut off

1178
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,359
because i don't know if we kept talking

1179
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,400
for a minute

1180
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,040
um we heard observing one neighbor at a

1181
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,400
time like and then how you could have

1182
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,640
modeled more complex interaction effects

1183
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,760
with uh like multiple artifacts yeah

1184
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,599
right okay

1185
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,119
awesome okay cool yeah

1186
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,160
so

1187
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,800
um now let's explain the hidden states

1188
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,000
so what are the states they're trying to

1189
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,880
infer

1190
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,599
s idea so it's basically a binary

1191
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,160
variable id one id two is id one true is

1192
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,000
id two true

1193
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,400
meta belief which is um

1194
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,160
the particular neighbors beliefs about

1195
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,839
which of the id is true so does my

1196
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,359
neighbor believe this or not that

1197
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,800
the tweet so

1198
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,240
what am i tweeting

1199
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,920
and who should i attend to which

1200
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,240
neighbor am i attending to so um this

1201
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,000
was actually very complex uh

1202
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,079
daphne and connor did an amazing job

1203
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,280
here because

1204
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,200
we wanted to change the number of

1205
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,680
neighbors and so the the matrices had to

1206
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,480
grow in relation to how many neighbors

1207
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,160
there were and they did it was it was

1208
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,200
beautiful

1209
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,040
the way that they did this so shout out

1210
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,200
to connor who's obviously a genius and

1211
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,480
daphne as well

1212
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,760
um so

1213
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,839
i'll discuss control sticks so control

1214
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,280
states are

1215
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,040
which of the states can my agents

1216
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,440
actually act upon

1217
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,640
so here it was um the tweet so i can

1218
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
decide to tweet you know hashtag one or

1219
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,040
hashtag two and i can decide to look at

1220
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,000
neighbor

1221
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,560
you know one through k

1222
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,359
now

1223
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,520
observation modalities what can they see

1224
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,599
they can see their own tweets and this

1225
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,200
is important because the thing is

1226
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,440
oftentimes you have to have a sort of

1227
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,800
identity mapping between your

1228
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,560
observations and your states so that the

1229
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,400
states can be taken into consideration

1230
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,680
in the actions um so here you have to

1231
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,400
know

1232
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,079
what you're tweeting you have to know

1233
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,079
what your neighbor is tweeting

1234
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,119
and you have to know who you're

1235
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,800
attending to right pretty simple

1236
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,839
now for likelihood so

1237
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,800
um you know in a palm dp in a generative

1238
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
model we have to describe the

1239
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,720
likelihoods that determine how hidden

1240
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,040
states relate to observations right

1241
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,000
um

1242
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,599
so the entire a array is a set of

1243
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,760
tensors with one sub-tensor per

1244
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,359
observation modality each

1245
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,760
modality-specific likelihood tensor is a

1246
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,560
potentially multi-dimensional array that

1247
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,319
encodes the conditional dependencies

1248
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,760
between each combination of hidden

1249
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,280
states and observations for that

1250
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,720
modality

1251
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,760
so we also have a transition model so

1252
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
the transition likelihood uh the

1253
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
dynamical likelihood uh in b that i

1254
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,680
explained earlier the environmental

1255
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,160
dynamics so um how are things likely to

1256
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,720
change a higher value means the same

1257
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,800
idea remains valid over time a lower

1258
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,839
value means the same idea is less likely

1259
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,040
to be true over time so more

1260
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,319
environmental volatility and then um the

1261
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,680
dynamics of

1262
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,520
whether my neighbors are likely to

1263
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,880
change their ideas of the world

1264
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,319
then

1265
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,839
the next component here is

1266
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,000
the degenerative models the priors over

1267
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,760
the observations

1268
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,359
so in discrete

1269
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,480
in discrete active inference we

1270
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,480
represented these as vector c d and e so

1271
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,720
um goal directed action is motivated by

1272
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,520
appealing to a baseline prior

1273
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,000
um over observations so that specifies

1274
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,079
the agent's preferences so that's the c

1275
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,240
i was talking about earlier what do i

1276
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,839
want to encounter in the world what are

1277
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,000
the outcomes i'd like to see and those

1278
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,640
usually act as kinds of rewards

1279
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,560
then there's the prime over hidden

1280
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,319
states at the initial time step which is

1281
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,720
the d vector it encodes the agent's

1282
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,160
beliefs about the initial state of the

1283
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
world before having made any

1284
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,599
observations and um in the current model

1285
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,599
we make the prior over control states an

1286
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,119
empirical prior

1287
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,880
parameterized by the link function

1288
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,040
denoted by the et vector so i'm not

1289
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,800
going to go too much into this but

1290
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,400
basically this implies that the prior

1291
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,000
over those control states corresponding

1292
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,240
to tweet actions depending on the

1293
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,480
posterior of the idea so basically your

1294
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,720
agents are always going to tweet exactly

1295
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,240
the same as they believed they're not

1296
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,160
lying but they could but we could change

1297
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,920
that

1298
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,079
so habit learning under active inference

1299
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,760
uh learning also emerges as a form of

1300
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,560
variational inference so um it's not an

1301
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,960
inference uh over hidden states but

1302
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,400
rather over model

1303
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,599
parameters

1304
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,599
so the parameter inference is referred

1305
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,599
to as learning because it is often

1306
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,520
assumed to occur on a fundamentally way

1307
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,000
slower time scale than hidden state and

1308
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,359
policy inference

1309
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,599
in this model we use habit learning to

1310
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,440
model the development of epistemic

1311
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,880
habits so as i said the the the tendency

1312
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,119
to resample the same people

1313
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,160
and so

1314
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,720
um they simultaneously infer which

1315
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,240
neighbor to attend to based on the

1316
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,920
prerogative to minimize expected free

1317
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,520
energy

1318
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,599
and they also continuously learn the

1319
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,520
habit based on the frequency with which

1320
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,920
they tend to ask our neighbor

1321
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,800
all right the actual simulation so

1322
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,839
in a given simulation we had

1323
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,839
several agents but we didn't always use

1324
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,079
the same number of agents we were very

1325
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,480
limited by computational constraints we

1326
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,079
would have wanted to make something much

1327
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,079
larger much bigger to really model an

1328
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,839
actual social media but this is very

1329
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,079
computational heavy in the future

1330
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,079
studies we may try to increase the

1331
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,920
number of agents but for now we tried to

1332
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,319
stay between 12 and 30 agents

1333
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,720
again same model for each agent at each

1334
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,119
time step agents simultaneously update

1335
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,480
their belief

1336
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,800
and take an action each agent's

1337
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,240
observation or a function of its own

1338
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,920
actions at the previous time step as

1339
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
well as the actions of a selected

1340
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,200
set of neighbors at the previous time

1341
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,440
set so not everyone is connected to

1342
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,520
everyone so i don't need to see everyone

1343
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,960
all the time

1344
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,040
each agent has a fixed set of neighbors

1345
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,160
where the particular neighbors are

1346
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,160
determined by a randomly chosen network

1347
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,240
topology

1348
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,480
okay

1349
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,160
all right so

1350
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,559
so focal agents with a higher ecb

1351
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,319
believes that tweets are more reliable

1352
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,760
if they come from neighboring agents

1353
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
that believe to share the same opinion

1354
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,640
right to like-minded people

1355
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,119
uh the inverse social volatility is a

1356
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,280
parameterized focal agent's beliefs

1357
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,880
about the stochasticity of the social

1358
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,000
dynamics the learning rate is associated

1359
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,599
with updating the habit vector over

1360
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,440
neighbor attendance and network

1361
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,359
connectivity um

1362
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,160
is the number the way that individuals

1363
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,590
um

1364
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:45,839
[Music]

1365
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,200
are connected to one another it's pretty

1366
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,640
simple so these are the parameters that

1367
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,040
we tweaked uh during the

1368
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,280
during the simulations um you'll see

1369
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,520
that um they tend to enter in interact

1370
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,040
with one another and they're related to

1371
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,640
the hypotheses we formed initially

1372
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,520
so

1373
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,720
this figure

1374
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,760
um

1375
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,760
is really cool

1376
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,079
it visualizes opinion formation in a

1377
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,319
single active inference agent and shed

1378
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:11,520
light on the relationship between

1379
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,920
inverse volatility and epistemic

1380
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,680
confirmation

1381
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,480
um

1382
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,319
we use a simplified three agent setup

1383
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,079
here so we just were trying to test

1384
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,559
something at each time step the focal

1385
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,480
agent chooses to read a hashtag from one

1386
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,160
of its two neighbors and the two

1387
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,920
neighbors are not actually

1388
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,520
active inference agents here they're

1389
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,960
just uh they're just part of the

1390
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,200
generative process they're sources of

1391
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,800
sequence of distinct hashtags and who

1392
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,280
tweet hashtag one or hashtag two

1393
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,800
and as you can see

1394
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,200
a higher epistemic confirmation bias

1395
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
induces a positive feedback effect where

1396
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,200
the focal agent comes to agree with one

1397
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,400
of its two neighbors with a higher

1398
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,599
certainty

1399
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,839
as you know it

1400
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,240
it tweets the thing that it believes

1401
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,440
um

1402
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,359
even if it's exposed to a sequence of

1403
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,599
hashtag over 100 time steps

1404
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,160
the agent receives the observation and

1405
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,520
um

1406
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,359
here below each subplot the heat map

1407
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,960
shows that the temporal evolution of the

1408
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,960
probability of sampling uh neighbor one

1409
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,720
versus neighbor two over time shows that

1410
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,119
it's clearly it clearly goes towards the

1411
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,520
one he started at prior with

1412
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,559
um

1413
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,359
the

1414
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,520
beliefs in more metabolic volatility

1415
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,839
lead to higher posteriors uncertainty

1416
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,040
about the idea but it still eventually

1417
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,559
leads to um

1418
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,000
you know

1419
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
believing in the same idea you initially

1420
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,839
started

1421
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,200
so

1422
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,319
okay

1423
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,558
now

1424
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,359
this is much much more informative as to

1425
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,920
the actual uh phenomenon and you can see

1426
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,839
here that we have two very interesting

1427
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,960
phenomenon

1428
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,000
consensus and polarization

1429
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,960
um

1430
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,040
they emerge when simulating uh the

1431
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,400
network

1432
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
we can see that every agent is generated

1433
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,559
by the action uh

1434
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,480
the observations of every agent is

1435
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,800
generated by the actions of other agents

1436
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,200
um and so collective belief dynamics

1437
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,079
here

1438
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,359
under different generative

1439
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,040
parameterization

1440
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,200
really show um

1441
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,440
the the evolving beliefs of all agents

1442
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,559
about idea one or about idea two

1443
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,200
in panel a and d we see polarization

1444
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,960
where two subset of agents end up

1445
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,720
believing in two different levels of the

1446
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,200
idea of the idea hidden states with a

1447
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,720
high certainty so you can really see

1448
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,720
like they go very far it goes

1449
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,520
one or zero it's not it's not like

1450
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,520
0.6 no it's really one or zero they're

1451
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,960
really certain

1452
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,280
and panels b and c on the other hand

1453
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,960
shows consensus where the whole network

1454
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,960
converges on the same opinion by the end

1455
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,480
of the simulation

1456
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,920
this really showcases the rich

1457
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,000
phenomenology uh displayed by

1458
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,079
collectives of active inference agents

1459
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,839
which validates our model really

1460
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,079
alongside known opinion dynamics model

1461
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,760
and that was really able to replicate um

1462
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,240
distributions that we were trying to uh

1463
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,200
to converge doors

1464
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,599
do you have any questions

1465
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,920
yeah um maybe go back to the slides

1466
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,640
what kind of dynamics might result in

1467
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,559
persistent diversity

1468
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,920
or not just the absolute consensus or

1469
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,319
absolute bifurcation but like you did

1470
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,400
mention you said you didn't see

1471
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,720
there to be a continuum of like people

1472
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,160
who aren't sure

1473
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,319
so what kind of parameters or what kind

1474
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,079
of cognitive mechanisms

1475
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,640
would facilitate that

1476
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,680
so um lower epistemic confirmation bias

1477
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,200
for sure

1478
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,440
would would potentially lead to more

1479
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,280
variety

1480
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,359
we would look it to network structure

1481
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,000
eventually uh lower habit formation

1482
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,160
would definitely help as well as you can

1483
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,319
see here it's uh

1484
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,960
and and also higher belief in volatility

1485
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,119
so if you believe that volatility is

1486
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,880
high you're going to keep sampling a lot

1487
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,640
of people because you do believe that

1488
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,559
uncertainty is going to continue arising

1489
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,160
right so these are three parameters that

1490
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,640
really lead to more diverse and less

1491
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,480
polarized beliefs and some ideas

1492
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,640
because it's so interesting how you you

1493
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,640
captured like the two things you can do

1494
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,760
on

1495
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,240
a classic social media platform which is

1496
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,280
decide who to follow and then kind of at

1497
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,760
a finer scale who to pay attention to

1498
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,760
even though it's also partially like put

1499
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,800
in front of you with a feed in the

1500
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,480
algorithm but also it's a little bit of

1501
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,559
agency in like what you pay attention to

1502
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,000
and who you follow at a slower time

1503
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,720
scale and then how you act

1504
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,640
and how that modifies the epistemic

1505
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,680
niche and some people follow a lot and

1506
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,319
act little and vice versa and different

1507
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,160
people's cognitive models get updated in

1508
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,599
a different way

1509
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,280
despite having access to similar

1510
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,359
platform affordances

1511
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,520
so these are really great points in

1512
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,839
future studies one you might want to see

1513
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,599
how the niche responds so right now that

1514
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,280
they're they're crafting their niches

1515
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,720
simply as a function of who they're

1516
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,880
talking to right but you could also

1517
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,000
model the algorithm

1518
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,079
screwing with you right so the algorithm

1519
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,480
knows you're looking for this so it's

1520
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,200
going to cut some things from you

1521
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,839
and so you you like for instance um one

1522
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,839
way we could have done this is the niche

1523
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,440
could have determined well okay well

1524
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,680
you're listening less to this so

1525
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,240
i'm not going to cut that connection i'm

1526
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,920
just not going to let it be broadcasted

1527
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,760
to you right now

1528
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,280
so that's one way that the algorithm

1529
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,119
works right it basically selects things

1530
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,400
it puts in your feed even though the

1531
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,079
people aren't gone they're still there

1532
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,920
you just see them less so that's that's

1533
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,680
one way we could have done like a

1534
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,760
relationship with the niche and as you

1535
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,960
said yeah we could have modeled

1536
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,559
different kinds of behaviors for people

1537
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,559
who are more lurkers right how do their

1538
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,880
beliefs change if they're not showing so

1539
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,160
that's one way that eventually we're

1540
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,440
going to be able to model like

1541
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,720
influencers

1542
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,799
if they're people who potentially

1543
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,200
broadcast to a lot of people and a lot

1544
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,880
of the other people don't broadcast as

1545
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,200
much so the beliefs of these people are

1546
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,119
going to be super influential as opposed

1547
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,480
to the beliefs of these smaller people

1548
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,720
who are much less influenced so that's i

1549
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,559
mean there's a lot that can be done it's

1550
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,920
really cool uh but yeah

1551
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,079
i'm excited about this the only problem

1552
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,160
in life is there's not enough time but

1553
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,640
yeah it's really cool

1554
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,319
so anyway i'm gonna i'm

1555
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,000
gonna keep going because we're going

1556
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,440
towards the um

1557
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,960
the cool plot

1558
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,599
um so

1559
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,119
there was an interaction between episode

1560
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,559
confirmation bias and network

1561
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,079
connectivity

1562
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,640
here you can see a heat map of the

1563
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,000
mean polarization index across like

1564
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,920
100

1565
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,680
independent realizations of the

1566
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,119
multi-agent opinion dynamic simulations

1567
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,960
for unique combinations of network

1568
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,359
connectivity and epistemic confirmation

1569
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,599
bias so in the bottom

1570
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,760
the selected plot lines show extreme

1571
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,280
settings of p

1572
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,079
so

1573
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,559
p02 and p08

1574
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,240
and uh

1575
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,760
y which is uh

1576
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,400
yeah so shaded areas around each line

1577
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,000
represent the standard deviation of the

1578
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,200
polarization

1579
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,520
index across independent realizations so

1580
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,480
this is hypothesis one

1581
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,559
we investigated hypothesis one or how

1582
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,960
episomic confirmation bias so why and

1583
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,799
network connectivity p determine

1584
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,480
collective formation of epistemic

1585
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,440
communities we systematically vary both

1586
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,559
epistemic conformation bias so 15 values

1587
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,480
for epistemic confirmation bias tilling

1588
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,960
the range three and nine and network

1589
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,520
connectivity so 15 values for p tilling

1590
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,079
the range 0.2 to 0.8

1591
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,280
in networks of 15 agents and over 100

1592
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,559
different realizations of each

1593
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,079
conditions for a hundred times steps so

1594
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,720
it's really a lot it's really a lot but

1595
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,960
the results are beautiful

1596
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,880
and so we were trying to see how higher

1597
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,200
epistemic confirmation bites in sparse

1598
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,680
network might drive the emergence of

1599
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,480
epistemic community uh through the the

1600
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,240
formation of belief clusters that are

1601
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,040
both dense and far apart in belief space

1602
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,319
right so they really believe different

1603
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,760
things

1604
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,160
um to assess the emergence of epistemic

1605
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,160
communities or clusters we define the

1606
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,079
polarization index which measures the

1607
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,040
degree of epistemic spread in a system

1608
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,079
and so a high value of p so close to one

1609
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,160
indicates more spread out beliefs and

1610
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,839
implies clustering in echo chamber

1611
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,160
formation whereas a low p

1612
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,839
implies the network agents have similar

1613
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,160
beliefs about an idea or you know less

1614
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,280
um

1615
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,680
less diversity or less polarization so

1616
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,760
it shows the effects of varying

1617
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,079
epistemic confirmation bias and network

1618
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,400
connectivity on polarization

1619
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,559
it is clear in the first column of the

1620
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,880
heat map that highly spread out beliefs

1621
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,920
can offer it can occur at all values of

1622
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,760
epistemic confirmation bias in the

1623
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,720
presence of a sparse connectivity

1624
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,079
denser networks in general uh reduce the

1625
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,079
risk of polarization

1626
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,960
as seen by the by the drop-off

1627
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,760
so

1628
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,079
how increased episodic confirmation bias

1629
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,920
can still counteract this effect to some

1630
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,400
extent by marginally bumping up the risk

1631
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,400
of polarization so this is a really

1632
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,920
interesting result but it comes back to

1633
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,000
what we were saying earlier a dense

1634
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,319
network means there's a lot of people

1635
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,559
who you can see the opinion of and who

1636
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,559
may not agree with you so you have more

1637
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,880
access to people's beliefs

1638
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,599
sparser networks means you're very

1639
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,680
quickly going to fall into an echo

1640
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,920
chambers because you're going to cut off

1641
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,200
some some people you don't want to

1642
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,880
listen to and then boom

1643
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,160
you have no more connection with these

1644
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,559
people

1645
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,720
there we go

1646
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,920
so in this one um you see another heat

1647
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,799
map

1648
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,280
so these are really noisy we're sorry

1649
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,160
about that uh we redid them

1650
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,079
for the for the reviewers but they're

1651
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,280
not ready

1652
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,319
so

1653
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,680
they're pretty noisy but i'm going to

1654
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,160
help you uh make a little sense of them

1655
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,000
so here you have a heat map of the

1656
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,760
polarization index for 225 combinations

1657
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,920
of inverse believe volatility so that's

1658
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,520
hypothesis two

1659
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,520
and epistemic confirmation bias

1660
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,160
precision so the above right

1661
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,760
heat map i don't know if i'm pointing to

1662
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,920
the right i

1663
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,920
yeah

1664
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,079
the heat map of the re-attendance rate

1665
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,440
for 225 combinations of inverse believe

1666
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,280
volatility and epistemic confirmation

1667
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,480
bias and below left it's a line plot of

1668
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,400
the most extreme rows of the

1669
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,559
polarization heat map so

1670
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,480
below right is the plot line of the most

1671
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,200
extreme columns of the reattendance heat

1672
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,280
map

1673
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,440
so for hypothesis two we modeled

1674
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,040
behavior under different values of

1675
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,040
inverse social volatility

1676
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,040
to see how it would interact with

1677
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,119
epistemic confirmation bias

1678
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,200
we swept over epistemic

1679
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,359
conformation bias and social volatility

1680
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,440
and we measured the reattendance rate

1681
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,200
and polarization index for each

1682
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,359
configuration

1683
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,839
it portrays a complex picture of the

1684
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,000
relationship between ecb and inverse

1685
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,160
social volatility

1686
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,720
in the case of high volatility over meta

1687
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,079
beliefs

1688
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,319
agents are driven to periodically

1689
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,559
re-attend to neighbors in order to

1690
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,480
resolve growing uncertainty about their

1691
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,760
beliefs

1692
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,200
you can see a higher average

1693
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,880
re-attendance rate

1694
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,400
interestingly

1695
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,079
there seems to be an interaction between

1696
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,599
re-attendance rate and epistemic

1697
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,760
confirmation bias such that in the

1698
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,400
presence of both high volatility and low

1699
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,319
epistemic confirmation bias the

1700
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,200
reattendance rate is maximized so

1701
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,079
they'll

1702
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,640
they'll reattend the same people even if

1703
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,640
they have low epistemic confirmation

1704
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,760
bias

1705
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,040
because you know

1706
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,520
there is they oh sorry

1707
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,119
they have high volatility they

1708
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,559
constantly think that people are likely

1709
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,040
to change their mind so they're going to

1710
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,240
continue to keep attending these people

1711
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,599
with um

1712
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,440
a little bit of a lower of all

1713
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,640
volatility they're it's not the lowest

1714
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,160
though because if if you have the lowest

1715
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,799
setting of volatility you're just you

1716
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:51,839
know not

1717
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,000
going to care so much what other people

1718
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,160
think you're just gonna keep reattending

1719
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,640
so we speculate that the absence of ecb

1720
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,200
makes the epidemic value of attending to

1721
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,240
every neighbor pretty much equally high

1722
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,799
and thus agents are going to continue

1723
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,440
revisiting neighbors uh sequentially

1724
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,040
with the attendance preference for any

1725
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,119
given neighbor solely dependent on the

1726
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,640
time lapse between the last reading of

1727
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,400
their last hashtag

1728
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,440
um

1729
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,319
so

1730
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,400
this is interesting it will lead to

1731
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
diverse social attendance patterns such

1732
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,000
that agents will prefer to constantly

1733
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,920
sample either new neighbors with no

1734
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,559
particular neighbor left or uh

1735
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,640
uncertainty driven resampling so they

1736
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,079
can either

1737
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,319
sample everyone for example the same

1738
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,640
people but they but they'll they'll try

1739
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:40,160
to attend to their neighbors a lot

1740
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,520
okay so here we have

1741
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,240
uh the last hypothesis hypothesis tree

1742
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,599
we got there

1743
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,200
it's a heat map of the polarization

1744
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,000
index for all 225 combinations of

1745
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,839
learning rate and epistemic confirmation

1746
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,200
bias precision

1747
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,039
so above right you have a heat map of

1748
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,200
the re-attendance rate for 225

1749
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,480
combinations

1750
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,799
and epistemic confirmation bias so the

1751
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,880
parameters represent the centers of the

1752
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,799
normal distribution sampled from across

1753
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,200
trials for each configuration

1754
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,039
below left the most extreme row of the

1755
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,960
polarization index heat map and below

1756
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,559
right the most extreme column of the

1757
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,359
reattendency map

1758
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,559
so here we're trying to see if the

1759
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,720
polarization of networks via habit

1760
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,720
formation

1761
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,640
follows hypothesis three

1762
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,400
we swept over ecb so 15 values uh tiling

1763
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,920
the range three to nine and learning

1764
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,440
rates

1765
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,039
so 15 values

1766
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,960
tilling from zero to nine

1767
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,799
and the networks were pretty small 15

1768
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,799
agents with a connection probability of

1769
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,160
0.4

1770
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,880
and an inverse social volatility of uh

1771
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,240
you know six

1772
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,039
and as before the the same idea so nine

1773
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,559
so

1774
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,720
etb was again normally distributed with

1775
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,319
a fixed mean

1776
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:55,359
uh and a variance of one so we we we um

1777
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,760
we sampled from a normal distribution

1778
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,720
and we

1779
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,359
eventually we lowered uh the the

1780
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,240
variance and it it gave us much better

1781
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,000
results but

1782
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,280
um

1783
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,960
the learning rate was fixed for the

1784
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,720
condition to really understand what the

1785
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,039
effect of it was

1786
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,359
the learning rate incentivizes agents to

1787
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,760
to the same neighbor by forming a habit

1788
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,760
this competes with the epistemic value

1789
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,039
of attending to a new neighbor with

1790
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,960
unknown beliefs this tested the

1791
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,119
hypothesis that a higher learning rate

1792
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,559
stronger habit formation increased

1793
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,559
polarization and here we can demonstrate

1794
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,400
that a higher learning rate and

1795
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,640
epistemic confirmation bias interact to

1796
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,480
influence outcomes at the collective

1797
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,559
level so a higher learning rate induces

1798
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,400
more polarization implying the formation

1799
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,240
of more stubborn epistemic communities

1800
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,799
in the network

1801
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,480
okay

1802
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,799
so

1803
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,079
do you want me to go into the takeaways

1804
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,720
that'd be awesome

1805
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,000
okay

1806
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,520
so um

1807
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,799
here

1808
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,440
we showed a confirmation bias as an

1809
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,839
epidemic phenomenon our agents have wise

1810
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,359
beliefs

1811
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,319
um

1812
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:05,920
we

1813
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,160
saw that ecb confers a higher weight to

1814
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,480
information that comes from peers and

1815
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,359
that can lead to a bad bootstrap

1816
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,400
um

1817
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,559
we find that opinion dynamics heavily

1818
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,039
depend on network density this was not

1819
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:20,720
counter-intuitive but the way that it

1820
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,680
happens was a little bit

1821
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,359
counter-intuitive

1822
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,119
uh the clustering phenomenon is

1823
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:27,039
exacerbated by adding the capacity to

1824
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,319
form habits so this is important

1825
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,720
we found that east tb

1826
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,520
the presence of rabbit formation

1827
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,160
exacerbated polarization due to the

1828
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,200
formation of echo chambers or tight

1829
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,799
communities of agents that only read

1830
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,559
each other's hashtag

1831
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:45,520
and

1832
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,119
the contributing influence of beliefs

1833
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:49,680
about social volatility to exploratory

1834
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,039
social sampling

1835
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,799
leads us to consider the role of norms

1836
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,400
and social settings

1837
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,280
if an agent is incentivized via

1838
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,520
epistemic value or curiosity to pay

1839
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,039
attention to neighbors whom they are

1840
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,720
uncertain about their social group could

1841
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,200
be a source of constant surprise as long

1842
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,640
as their beliefs about the neighbors are

1843
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,200
constantly fickle so in other words

1844
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,880
even in the presence of a group of

1845
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,039
like-minded peers

1846
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,440
thank you

1847
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,400
good burritos i guess um

1848
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,359
burritos modification uh the best kind

1849
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:25,599
of niche modification i know right

1850
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:28,559
ghost brings me peruse um

1851
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,400
so we we expect that increased beliefs

1852
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,079
about social volatility leads to

1853
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,160
repeated retentive peers amongst one

1854
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,280
another

1855
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,880
um

1856
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,359
okay we have limitations in this work as

1857
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,960
i said a very low number of people

1858
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,000
uh we only modeled beliefs of two

1859
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
believe two exclusive ideas it would

1860
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,520
have been maybe more interesting to have

1861
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,400
more and we would have wanted to um

1862
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,880
to notice the emergence of similar but

1863
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,000
distant sub communities as well um even

1864
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,119
if they're not already uh connected

1865
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,079
so yeah that was that was all of it that

1866
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,640
was all of it

1867
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,039
cool work

1868
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:10,079
really

1869
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,480
fun to hear about

1870
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,520
um

1871
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,720
nice

1872
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,240
well if anyone's

1873
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,880
watching live they can uh ask any

1874
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,880
questions

1875
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,559
otherwise what would you like to start

1876
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,240
off by talking like when you present

1877
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,240
that for what audience what do people

1878
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,359
often ask about

1879
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,119
um they ask the same questions you ask

1880
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,599
really they ask um what can we do about

1881
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,839
social media how do we factor in the

1882
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:39,280
algorithm

1883
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,039
uh what this can

1884
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,000
how this ties into misinformation

1885
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,599
um i guess this question we haven't

1886
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,119
really talked about the notion of

1887
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,559
misinformation

1888
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,079
so that's something you're interested in

1889
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,680
let's hear about it

1890
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,880
yeah

1891
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,039
so

1892
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,359
this is this information is kind of a

1893
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:58,720
tricky question right because you'd

1894
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,039
think um

1895
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,400
you'd think that misinformation would be

1896
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,160
if it doesn't agree with us if it's

1897
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,160
about something we don't agree with

1898
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,240
we cast it instantly as misinformation

1899
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,440
and in fact

1900
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,400
um

1901
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,839
we tend to fall very heavily for most

1902
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,480
sources of misinformation the only thing

1903
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,440
is

1904
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,319
uh

1905
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,559
we fall for misinformation that tends to

1906
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,599
reinforce our view of the world so

1907
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,599
even if it's part of a sort of

1908
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,039
conservative

1909
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,960
if you're if you're um

1910
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,640
more liberal more um

1911
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,119
i forgot the word for not conservative

1912
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,440
but if you're more left

1913
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,440
um if you're seeing some piece that's

1914
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,400
been crafted by the right but it kind of

1915
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,839
confirms your view of the world you're

1916
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,839
more likely to integrate it

1917
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,839
and this is this is pretty important

1918
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,839
especially when we're trying to think

1919
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:54,640
about

1920
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,130
the q and on people and and

1921
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:58,960
[Music]

1922
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,920
people whose views aren't necessarily

1923
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,440
completely polarized but who want to

1924
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,480
view the world as something they

1925
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,680
um

1926
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,920
they can unfold right something they

1927
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,599
have

1928
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,359
they have control over the epistemic

1929
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,279
value that they can gather

1930
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,399
um

1931
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,359
and so

1932
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,359
they're being fed information which

1933
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:24,319
feeds into that sort of meta view of the

1934
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,238
world that they

1935
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,040
they can understand the hidden truth

1936
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,960
about the world and so

1937
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,520
this becomes a sort of pool

1938
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,759
you know where it doesn't really matter

1939
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,279
when i pitch at you

1940
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,960
so long as it gives you this sort of

1941
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,359
sensation that you have access to

1942
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,679
something that others really don't and

1943
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,439
therefore you now understand the

1944
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,359
structure of the world a little better

1945
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,040
even if

1946
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,960
when you take the whole thing together

1947
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,839
when you look at the entire structure

1948
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,158
of um

1949
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:59,520
you know conspiracy beliefs

1950
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,359
they're extremely unlikely extremely

1951
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,479
complex

1952
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,560
and one way that we've noticed that we

1953
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,399
can um

1954
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,839
identify these conspiracy theories

1955
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,600
compared to you know

1956
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,839
true facts they tend to have a really

1957
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,679
interesting structure which is

1958
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,040
they're very sparsely connected to very

1959
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,198
large elements but like

1960
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,679
normally in a true in a true story and

1961
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,359
something that's real even if there's a

1962
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,920
lot of elements or or fields that are

1963
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,759
combined there's a lot of connections

1964
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,439
amongst things right because because

1965
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,880
it's real so you can really you can see

1966
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,960
from a lot of directions these real

1967
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,040
connections if you lose one connection

1968
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,040
everything doesn't fall apart

1969
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,198
in conspiracy beliefs

1970
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,120
those connections are so sparse that if

1971
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,359
you lose one the entire theory doesn't

1972
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,120
make sense anymore

1973
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:49,839
so

1974
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,359
it's it's that's that's the kind of

1975
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,040
structure that we see

1976
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,360
so it's kind of sort of

1977
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,880
you can see how this would have

1978
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,840
epistemic value right because everything

1979
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,960
is so surprising and uncertain that

1980
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,840
people

1981
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,320
would like feel a lot of value from

1982
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,600
accruing all this information right so

1983
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,960
i think that's where we fall into the

1984
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,880
bad bootstrap but there are other kinds

1985
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,480
of bad bootstraps like

1986
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,280
um

1987
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,719
let's say um

1988
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,400
so i don't want to i don't want to make

1989
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,759
any community feel like they're

1990
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,840
being targeted or that

1991
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,400
or or that i'm being negative towards it

1992
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,320
but

1993
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,080
there are communities like let's talk

1994
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,239
about a cult right let's think about it

1995
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,480
called who who starts believing a very

1996
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,480
niche set of beliefs

1997
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,880
and they the way that they do this is by

1998
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,040
cutting off contact to everybody else

1999
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,360
right so it's much easier for me to

2000
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,120
instill a belief in you there's nobody

2001
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,719
else to tell you this is this crazy this

2002
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:48,560
 like what are you doing

2003
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,840
so one of the first thing is they tell

2004
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,440
you to cut off contact with a lot of

2005
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,640
people

2006
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,960
they reinforce the beliefs constantly

2007
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,120
they punish anyone who who dissents

2008
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,640
because that's how you reinforce a

2009
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,000
belief

2010
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,480
and then you find them in these sort of

2011
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,880
communities which are like

2012
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,520
very only locally functional

2013
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,120
and if you take someone out of that

2014
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,120
community afterwards and you put them

2015
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,520
somewhere else they're like

2016
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,440
kind of lost because

2017
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,440
well

2018
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,239
that's not how the world works so like

2019
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,640
they they they're they need to re-learn

2020
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,000
a lot of things they need to um

2021
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,560
develop behaviors that are distinct from

2022
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,560
their previous belief systems that allow

2023
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,520
them to exist and and you know be humans

2024
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,000
in a already pretty complex civilization

2025
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
system

2026
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,560
that was very interesting about the

2027
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,080
resilience of the meta view so

2028
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,080
how do we

2029
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,480
use active inference to

2030
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,719
study these different phenomena like how

2031
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,440
do you connect the nodes and edges from

2032
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,000
the graph the generative model the

2033
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,920
cognitive model

2034
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,440
how does that

2035
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,360
visualization representation connect

2036
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,880
with like the phenomena that we want to

2037
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,840
model

2038
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,239
i mean that's the

2039
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,320
that's the question isn't it that's what

2040
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,760
we're working on at the computational

2041
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,280
phenomenology lab

2042
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,480
i have a theory um but it's not like

2043
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,159
it's still being developed but my sense

2044
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,120
is

2045
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,440
um

2046
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,040
you're gonna start treating

2047
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,000
events as observations right and you're

2048
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,040
gonna start treating

2049
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,800
so you're a node you're here in the

2050
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,400
graph

2051
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,800
and everything around you is a sort of

2052
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,400
observation

2053
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,159
and you're you're trying to determine

2054
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,480
layers in the graph which becomes states

2055
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,880
right so you're going to move across the

2056
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,159
graph by trying to predict uh

2057
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,239
effectively what is the next state and

2058
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:57,920
trying to see if this new thing that

2059
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,360
you're going to observe matches with the

2060
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,920
state you're trying to see so um

2061
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,600
so that's just how you move in the graph

2062
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,960
and then

2063
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,440
the way that you're going to establish

2064
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,040
what is

2065
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,040
true or not so that's one way to do it

2066
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,480
there are other ways right there's also

2067
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,440
swarm um beliefs and stuff but like

2068
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,639
one way to do it is well

2069
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,679
how much can i predict from this node

2070
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,679
how much is actually connected to this

2071
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,480
node and if if we take this structure

2072
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,640
again of like the

2073
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,880
the graphs which are sparsely connected

2074
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,280
and don't allow for any connection to be

2075
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,040
lost

2076
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,560
you're going to start seeing that

2077
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,080
there's going to be a lot of dense

2078
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,320
connections between concepts

2079
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,000
and it's going to be very easy for you

2080
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,480
to sort of find your way through the

2081
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,480
graph and be like well i can go there

2082
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,159
and i can go there and i can go there

2083
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,080
and and and try to make

2084
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,760
predictions about the next potential

2085
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,760
nodes given these two that you or these

2086
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,080
three that you already have right i have

2087
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,600
these three things and i know

2088
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,040
everything's sparse it's densely

2089
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,120
connected i can go there it's easy and

2090
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,040
and if i go there i don't lose any

2091
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,239
connection to anything else so that's

2092
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:10,239
one way another way to do this is

2093
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,920
agents are going to start forming

2094
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,400
beliefs by observing real life or

2095
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,679
reality

2096
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,400
and agents who

2097
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,080
have a lot of observations about the

2098
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,400
world

2099
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,480
are likely to you know have a more

2100
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,800
accurate model of the world so the more

2101
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,800
they make predictions about things that

2102
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,560
eventually happen the more we can give

2103
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,040
them a reliability rating right so like

2104
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,480
this person

2105
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,360
sees a lot of things one and two when

2106
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,360
they say something it tends to happen so

2107
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,199
we give them a high rating

2108
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,679
and then you know the agents talk to one

2109
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,159
another and sort of like uh coordinate

2110
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,080
their beliefs and eventually there's

2111
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,920
gonna be this dude over there that you

2112
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,679
know says green and everybody else says

2113
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:53,600
right it says red and it's like well you

2114
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,480
know

2115
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,239
the probability of this green being true

2116
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:01,120
like there's a high surprisal there

2117
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,880
the kicker is

2118
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,320
there's a high surprise though so we're

2119
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,120
giving it a lower reliability rating but

2120
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,280
if it does end up happening well then

2121
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,120
the value is

2122
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,719
you know it is much higher as well right

2123
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:15,120
because we reduced a lot of variational

2124
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,880
free energy here so like

2125
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,640
like i think that's that's how we're

2126
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,640
going to get to these two things

2127
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,120
combined with the the graph

2128
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,560
leading to the nodes that you can

2129
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,400
connect together and

2130
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,040
the agents with reliability ratings that

2131
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,520
swarm towards a true belief are ways

2132
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,960
that we can integrate these things i

2133
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,120
think

2134
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,520
cool the first mode you had i kind of

2135
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,560
wrote down it was like dense connections

2136
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,199
ideas that have grounding you know good

2137
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,520
maps for territories

2138
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,600
more stable territory

2139
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,520
more effective map

2140
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,520
it's like in a family if you went to

2141
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,679
someone else's family reunion you

2142
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,440
shouldn't be too surprised that any

2143
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,920
given two people know each other

2144
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,520
because there's kind of a coherence or

2145
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,360
there's a prior about the density of

2146
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,239
that network whereas if the network's

2147
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:07,600
very sparse

2148
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,400
then

2149
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,199
um

2150
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,199
the coherence of it is susceptible to

2151
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,360
single facts being wrong so you kind of

2152
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,560
point it to like where a thread will be

2153
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,400
tied well this person knew that person

2154
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,560
that this money was sent here and then

2155
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,000
it's like if even one of those things

2156
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,880
weren't true then the whole contraption

2157
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,400
is fallacious

2158
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,199
um

2159
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,440
and then and then like the dense

2160
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,920
connections

2161
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,719
have an element of conformity to them

2162
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,239
because you have an intrinsically

2163
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,159
validating world model like the

2164
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,960
epistemic network of epicycles

2165
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,320
and that way of predicting how the

2166
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,520
planets moved and then you have

2167
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,239
insight from outside that goes against

2168
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,800
the conformity bias the prior

2169
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,840
but that can be how the community can

2170
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,360
move into a new

2171
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,560
space

2172
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,159
so we can't have like just novelty

2173
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,719
driven like simply different is better

2174
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,960
but we can't have simply the same is

2175
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,480
better

2176
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,199
puts us in this active inference

2177
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,360
situation which is why it's so cool to

2178
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,800
see

2179
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,560
epistemic modeling like you have all

2180
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,719
done

2181
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:17,760
there's something really interesting

2182
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,520
here about

2183
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,320
the optimal space um

2184
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,679
around which

2185
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,440
you start

2186
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,800
you know

2187
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,239
computing the right amount of

2188
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:29,520
information so

2189
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,199
mark miller is working on this alex

2190
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,760
kiefer is working on this as well um i

2191
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,920
know that we're working on it with also

2192
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,880
alejandra syria bruno lara so there's

2193
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,640
this whole group we're working on like

2194
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,199
what is the optimal computation space

2195
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,120
right um

2196
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,640
and so

2197
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,320
this is this is truly the question you

2198
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,440
just posed should i stay exactly where i

2199
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,880
am or should i try consuming error and i

2200
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,880
think that's the beauty of groups and

2201
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,440
this is where we sort of fall into what

2202
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,960
what a group is in terms of a market

2203
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,320
blanket right

2204
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,120
so

2205
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,199
in the inner spaces of a group you'll

2206
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,920
have people who are less likely to start

2207
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,600
consuming error

2208
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,760
they're just like you know they're just

2209
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,640
staying within what's being done and and

2210
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,719
and that's stability right and then

2211
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,640
towards the external parts of the group

2212
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,560
there are people who are more

2213
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,800
connected to other groups right and then

2214
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,320
who can start consuming error and this

2215
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,480
because the internal parts of the group

2216
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,560
are very densely connected to one

2217
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,920
another because you know they're an

2218
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,440
in-group

2219
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,440
this error can be passed in like um it

2220
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,440
can be consumed in a way that is

2221
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,640
efficient for the group to deal with

2222
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,400
through this like sort of um

2223
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,400
blanket

2224
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,560
so the the real question becomes like

2225
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,800
what's an active state what's a sensory

2226
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,600
like

2227
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,760
yeah a state at the level of a blanket

2228
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,000
for a group but you can start you can

2229
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,400
start to conceptualize it as like

2230
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,760
you know your influencers and your

2231
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,840
lurkers right like the lurker is

2232
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,440
consuming information and the

2233
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,080
influencers promote information and then

2234
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,560
this whole thing becomes sort of like

2235
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,640
there are people who

2236
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,199
just consume what this one do says and

2237
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,080
there are people who just like

2238
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:18,960
um

2239
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,520
push out information and then maybe they

2240
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,800
take a little bit of information but

2241
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,480
they have like you know this

2242
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,480
this sparse network of people who are

2243
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,000
like like you know people who are like

2244
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,920
90 000 followers but they themselves

2245
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,120
follow three

2246
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,239
so

2247
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:34,640
so so then there's this like sort of

2248
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,040
layering of people who listen to others

2249
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,199
and so the the smaller people who have

2250
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,040
less followers they're still connected

2251
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,960
to one another and there's degrees of

2252
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,840
through which um i think information is

2253
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,840
passed and consumed and so

2254
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,760
what mark miller is trying to say is

2255
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,040
that

2256
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,400
the computational optimal is where

2257
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,719
you compute enough error

2258
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,800
that you continue to

2259
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,719
uh

2260
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,320
to grow in your sort of fitness

2261
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,239
landscape so you're still learning about

2262
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:05,520
things you're still

2263
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,440
discovering

2264
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,760
but you're still stable enough that no

2265
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,639
error is going to topple you right

2266
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,560
so because you have all these other

2267
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,840
people here

2268
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,080
who keep your group relatively stable

2269
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,679
you know that consuming a little bit

2270
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,600
isn't gonna like destroy your group

2271
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,000
right it's like

2272
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,800
it's like think of um of a polycule like

2273
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,120
we're we know we're in love this new

2274
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,360
metamorph is not gonna like

2275
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,960
break our up

2276
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,239
so it's good right um

2277
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:37,280
so

2278
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,280
that's that's i think what allows like

2279
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,360
this sort of large-scale coordination

2280
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,800
among groups is that there are people

2281
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,560
who are like specialized in consuming

2282
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,320
the error and who can only do this

2283
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,760
because there are other people who

2284
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,000
ensure there's resources being produced

2285
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,520
for them

2286
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,239
yeah

2287
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,880
well um two thoughts so

2288
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,239
one the core to periphery or fringe

2289
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:01,840
continuum it also happens like in ant

2290
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,560
colonies where there might be a brood

2291
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,679
chamber

2292
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,000
that is the most homeostatically

2293
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,440
controlled and then there's like a

2294
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,840
periphery out to like kind of a lobby or

2295
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,159
an anti-chamber where there is a lot

2296
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,719
more like in and out and then of course

2297
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:18,000
that's the interface like with the

2298
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,520
external world

2299
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,239
and so then there's um analyses with

2300
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,560
tracking of like where the ants go

2301
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,639
and so there'll be some who's continue

2302
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:28,639
whose distribution spatially is more

2303
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,719
like the top parts of the nest or just

2304
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,360
the entry room and a little bit in and

2305
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,639
there might be another one that spends

2306
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,159
more of its time

2307
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,000
towards the core and spends then it goes

2308
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,400
a little bit out um

2309
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,199
but that last piece you said like

2310
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,159
what roles

2311
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,360
contribute to colony or epistemic

2312
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,960
community

2313
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,920
stability or collective open-mindedness

2314
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,560
or resilience like those are such

2315
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,120
critical questions that people frame

2316
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,960
qualitatively

2317
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,320
every day

2318
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,440
and so

2319
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,000
it's just really cool to

2320
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
have the conversation

2321
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,360
and open it up to many different

2322
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,920
perspectives about what roles do play in

2323
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,000
communities and then

2324
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,440
try to

2325
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,440
use the model

2326
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,480
to follow up and

2327
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,600
describe

2328
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,199
complex situations rather than like

2329
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:25,920
constraining to what

2330
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,920
communities can be or how they can

2331
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,840
regulate

2332
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:30,719
yeah

2333
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:31,760
and there's something beautiful about

2334
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:32,960
active inference here right because we

2335
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,159
could like we can literally potentially

2336
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:39,760
measure or predict

2337
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,320
what might be an optimal state for a

2338
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,520
group given the free energy that the

2339
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,000
group can consume right so if we can

2340
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,400
understand how this consumption of error

2341
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,159
can be distributed over the group or at

2342
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:55,120
least can be absorbed um we can say well

2343
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,159
listen

2344
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:58,159
we don't need to destroy your your q

2345
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,440
anon group all we need to do is

2346
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,040
give you a little bit

2347
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,560
you know like enough in the right

2348
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,800
distributed areas so that you guys

2349
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,199
integrated on your own and potentially

2350
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,520
shift without us having to

2351
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,760
uh further push and and potentially even

2352
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,199
polarized like one of the worst things

2353
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,880
you can do with one of your q and on

2354
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,520
family members is antagonize them

2355
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,199
because then they isolate and they're

2356
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:22,719
gone you're never finding them again

2357
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,639
like they will they will be lost to that

2358
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,800
thing which will consume them

2359
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,199
and this is and it's it's not just true

2360
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:30,239
for for

2361
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:31,840
for fringe groups it's it's true for a

2362
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,760
lot of groups where we're like

2363
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,239
we rely on that community for survival

2364
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,760
as we said like there's a lot of

2365
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,440
communities out there who need to stay

2366
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,440
tight-knit because well it's beneficial

2367
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,120
for them to be tight-knit

2368
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,719
so um

2369
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,040
let's say we're like a city right and

2370
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,120
and there's nothing wrong inherently

2371
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,040
about being a city and what you want to

2372
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,080
do is to try to prevent a catastrophe

2373
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,360
right

2374
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,040
but we can't

2375
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,600
we can't all be researching

2376
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,040
the types of catastrophes that might

2377
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,280
happen and like someone's gotta you know

2378
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,320
make bread

2379
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,880
right so so you start having these

2380
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,400
people who

2381
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,440
you can predict over time that i don't

2382
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,199
have to think about this i don't have to

2383
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,520
pay attention to this scale

2384
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,920
because i'm paying attention to this and

2385
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,199
i know that

2386
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:22,000
they can rely on that so my model of the

2387
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,800
scales makes it so that my role is super

2388
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,239
clear

2389
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,239
and allows for others to make these

2390
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,560
predictions right so

2391
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,880
i think i mean it's not fully um it's

2392
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,719
not fully realized yet and there's a lot

2393
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,320
of work

2394
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:39,040
to be done still but i feel like we you

2395
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,040
know we have it's right there it's right

2396
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,199
there

2397
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,440
here's something that kind of makes me

2398
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,679
think about like the city

2399
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:50,560
is enabled by specialization and all

2400
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,239
these other features

2401
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:53,520
um

2402
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,440
what are

2403
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,960
epistemic infrastructure projects

2404
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,800
like what are the

2405
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,800
thankless or

2406
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,120
thankful jobs

2407
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:07,679
that people do like moderation

2408
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:08,960
governance

2409
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,480
care for themselves and for other

2410
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,880
participants like what are those

2411
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,520
infrastructure tier

2412
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,600
roles where it's like this is building

2413
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,199
the road

2414
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,480
so we we have to contextualize how well

2415
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,280
this shop does in light of

2416
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,800
the effort to build the road and the

2417
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,120
community that contributed there and so

2418
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,880
it kind of like opens up the idea of

2419
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,239
attribution

2420
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:34,320
and community and it's like very

2421
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,199
generative space

2422
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,840
yes i feel like they um

2423
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,080
it would be

2424
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,560
would be difficult to say that there is

2425
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,880
a very clear distinction in any given

2426
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,239
infrastructure right so like

2427
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,199
every field

2428
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,560
has

2429
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,280
people who innovate every field has

2430
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,600
people who just stay on tradition every

2431
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,080
field has people who just provide like

2432
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,320
it's not it's not just like bakers just

2433
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,520
provide right there are people who

2434
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,159
innovate in bread there are people who

2435
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:12,400
think of new recipes or think of new

2436
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,360
ways or try to bring the same recipes to

2437
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,199
different parts of the world so like

2438
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:19,840
it's it's more distributed than that

2439
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,960
but

2440
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,600
um i i really

2441
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,920
i really do think that these structures

2442
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,600
kind of self-emerge

2443
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,159
right so like

2444
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,920
we all kind of have not i'm not gonna

2445
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,440
make that

2446
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,679
but i do believe that there's um a

2447
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,320
natural instinct to

2448
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,199
um to try something new

2449
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,440
once you have

2450
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,040
the certainty

2451
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,600
that isn't gonna fall under you

2452
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,480
right

2453
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,920
and because we have this sort of

2454
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,880
distribution of like uh people who have

2455
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,120
more or less money and people who have

2456
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,280
had past experiences of having more or

2457
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,320
less money

2458
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,560
they kind of tend to focus and so it

2459
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,760
naturally sort of synchronizes into well

2460
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,120
you know what i was poor my whole life

2461
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,520
i'm gonna be careful i'm not gonna go

2462
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,440
crazy and that's why you know that the

2463
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,520
fallacy of the entrepreneur who had like

2464
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,080
nothing and he became something like

2465
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,120
that that is bull like it is so easy to

2466
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,960
be an entrepreneur when you have barely

2467
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,360
anything to lose you know the notion of

2468
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,560
risk

2469
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,000
and capitalism

2470
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,520
isn't true

2471
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,880
you

2472
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,679
they can do it because to them the risk

2473
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,639
is minimal if i lose everything tomorrow

2474
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,080
i can do it again

2475
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,199
so there isn't really a risk whereas if

2476
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,760
if little lady over there who has like

2477
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,480
20 000 in her bank account decides to

2478
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,120
put everything in a business is a real

2479
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,400
risk it's a real risk and

2480
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,679
like

2481
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:56,239
obviously she's less likely to do it

2482
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:57,600
because like

2483
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,960
what happens to her children if she

2484
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,280
loses everything you know i mean like so

2485
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,880
there's going to naturally be these

2486
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,600
tears of people who because of the the

2487
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,679
their states faced right so the

2488
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:12,159
probability of them continuing accessing

2489
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:16,400
resources over time is is less

2490
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,760
spread out

2491
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,400
they they have to stay con concentrate

2492
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,320
on this and by virtue of doing this they

2493
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:25,679
also you know keep producing um

2494
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,639
value and resources for people who

2495
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,480
tend to accrue this

2496
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,679
and thus have more way to you know trash

2497
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,960
it out and innovate i mean

2498
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,000
there's a reason that it's so easy to go

2499
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,480
to university when your parents are rich

2500
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,120
like obviously if you if you parents

2501
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,719
have the means to support you you're

2502
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,560
going to try and continue studying

2503
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,320
longer and longer and it's much harder

2504
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,840
if you have to support yourself it's not

2505
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,840
impossible but it's so much harder so

2506
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,719
anyway

2507
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,639
yeah capitalism

2508
01:28:58,639 --> 01:28:59,520
well

2509
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,239
to connect it to active inference you

2510
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,960
kind of brought up the situational

2511
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,600
risk sensitivity and how that relates to

2512
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,320
someone's experience and their situation

2513
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,360
and then

2514
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,080
in

2515
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,159
active inference the policy selection

2516
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,800
for whether the binary decision

2517
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,920
go to this

2518
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,760
university or go to

2519
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,280
some other path or a continuous policy

2520
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,239
it's broken down into that pragmatic or

2521
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:28,639
kind of outcome or goal reward

2522
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:31,520
orientation as well as the epistemic

2523
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,040
and so

2524
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,280
what happens when people

2525
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,360
don't have to

2526
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,159
have anxiety or find out epistemically

2527
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,840
about how they're going to get pragmatic

2528
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,639
reward for their action

2529
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:45,440
and

2530
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,560
how does that

2531
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,600
move us beyond the sort of like

2532
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,460
web 2 engagement maximization

2533
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,480
[Music]

2534
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,840
relationship with platforms where

2535
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,760
there's a very specific generative model

2536
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,000
generative process relationship

2537
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,679
and it's based around like behavioral

2538
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:05,520
summaries of the person's time spent on

2539
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,880
the site or like their spending or

2540
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,600
something like that versus like taking

2541
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,440
the cognitive rains

2542
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,679
and saying we want to have

2543
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,239
lower anxiety and we want people to be

2544
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,159
exposed to different perspectives or

2545
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:19,679
some other

2546
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,840
preference for platforms that's

2547
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,520
specified using an active inference

2548
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,920
framework

2549
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,400
there's a lot in there

2550
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,520
ah

2551
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,080
so i'm going to try to

2552
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,800
so think of a think of

2553
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,600
the generative model always like

2554
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,080
generative models aren't

2555
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,719
one scale right there's scales on scales

2556
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,320
on scales and scales on scales and what

2557
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,920
happens when you when you go across

2558
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,000
scales is that your your state's at one

2559
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,440
level becomes the observation at the

2560
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,280
next level and then it embeds and embeds

2561
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,639
it in beds

2562
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,320
okay and then

2563
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,560
the embeddings can sort of like again

2564
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,679
track into one another so i'm here and

2565
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:00,560
um

2566
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,320
there's the bear so i'm gonna stop

2567
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,000
focusing on you which is a higher level

2568
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,440
i'm gonna focus on directly this right

2569
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:06,880
now and there's the bear and i'm gonna

2570
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,400
focus on the bear but eventually the

2571
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,679
bear goes away because then you know i

2572
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,480
was having a hallucination and

2573
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,040
suddenly i can go back to a higher level

2574
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,960
and start monitoring other things and

2575
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,400
notice okay well you know what this

2576
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,400
lasted a long time and maybe i should be

2577
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,000
cooking because i'm gonna get hungry so

2578
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,400
i'm gonna you know slowly navigate the

2579
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,719
scales of where where i'm supposed to

2580
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:29,520
put attention based on how the free

2581
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,239
energy is is rising at a given point in

2582
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,799
this form

2583
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,320
all this is to say

2584
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,199
um

2585
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:40,719
for the web or for monitoring

2586
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,800
or for resource attribution

2587
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,719
what am i really trying to do what i'm

2588
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:48,400
trying to do is to make sure that a

2589
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,080
person

2590
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,239
never has to feel like they're

2591
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,719
constantly putting out fires

2592
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:57,760
so anxiety is that right anxiety is the

2593
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,159
constant belief that you're like peaking

2594
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,560
everywhere and you have to pay attention

2595
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,280
to everything you're hyper sensitive so

2596
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,760
let's let's lower that let's feel like

2597
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,320
you can start like giving a little bit

2598
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,440
more attention to a longer time frame or

2599
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,040
even a shorter one but just on the

2600
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,239
moment

2601
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,159
because like all of the parts of your

2602
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:20,159
model are pretty certain like there's

2603
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:21,600
not going to be a fire

2604
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,120
so like

2605
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,600
i have certainty across all my scales

2606
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,960
and i'm going to start paying attention

2607
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,000
to just this now and then like

2608
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,600
i don't need to like you know give too

2609
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,360
much to my model

2610
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,800
how do you do this with monitoring well

2611
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,960
with monitoring you're like well look

2612
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,880
given this trajectory right now and

2613
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,880
given this personality type and given

2614
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,159
like what we know already about her

2615
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:43,600
she's gonna freak out in about five

2616
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,239
minutes about x and i'm monitoring this

2617
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:49,840
so before she freaks out let's

2618
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,440
give a little reminder about this or

2619
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,360
like um

2620
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,840
actually through iot or whatever let's

2621
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,800
start something like my dream is like

2622
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,880
in the morning i wake up my breakfast is

2623
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,600
like started like nobody's starting it

2624
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,719
for me it's just starting so

2625
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,360
you know i do my my house

2626
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,920
predicts the kinds of things i'm likely

2627
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,400
to need so that eventually i i never

2628
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,120
like

2629
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,040
ever have to feel like i need to pay

2630
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,600
attention to anything with too much like

2631
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,120
which too much uncertainty is going to

2632
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,040
rise anymore i'm not sure i answered

2633
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,480
your question exactly but i feel like

2634
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,199
i'm going in that direction

2635
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:30,239
there's the um

2636
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,120
preparing your breakfast when you wake

2637
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,719
up and there's sort of the

2638
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:37,760
cybernetics 1.0 version which is we have

2639
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,040
a prediction about what time you're

2640
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,239
going to wake up and then we're just

2641
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,080
going to do it like setting the

2642
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,080
thermostat we're going to just prepare

2643
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,159
it for it to be ready at this time

2644
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:47,600
then this is kind of

2645
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,679
taking that

2646
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,199
physical

2647
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:54,239
biofeedback layer to another level but

2648
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,120
also

2649
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,520
what should we epistemically forage for

2650
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,000
in the morning how do we

2651
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,360
experience

2652
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,840
that sleep-wake

2653
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,679
transition in a way where like we wake

2654
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:07,440
up and sort of like

2655
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,199
sharpen or

2656
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,040
become more vigilant

2657
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:12,800
and focus on the things that matter and

2658
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,560
that have impact and at the end of the

2659
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,880
day sort of

2660
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,600
have some unwind or some sort of

2661
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,159
relaxing process so that we can move

2662
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,800
into a healthy sleep

2663
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,000
there was um

2664
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,480
ah there was this

2665
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:32,000
i'm watching a lot of youtube lately

2666
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,400
it's like um

2667
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,400
there's this one dude who tried to

2668
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,679
replicate

2669
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,400
a billionaire morning right

2670
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,320
it was it was striking what the

2671
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,000
billionaire does in the morning and

2672
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,679
which is basically like

2673
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,159
i'm doing all this to make my body

2674
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:52,560
feel better and all that great and then

2675
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,679
he did this stuff to think about who he

2676
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:58,639
wanted to be today and what kind of

2677
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:00,880
qualities he wanted to embody and it's

2678
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,480
like

2679
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,600
yo

2680
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,600
i gotta think about not missing my bus

2681
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,960
or whether i'm gonna freeze my house

2682
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,199
outside or whether you know i might get

2683
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,880
fired if i get laid like you see what i

2684
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,520
mean like my concerns my direct

2685
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,520
epistemic concerns in the morning are

2686
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,440
fastly different from what that dude has

2687
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,760
to care about because everything that

2688
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,600
i'm talking about he's certain about

2689
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,000
like he has no qualm about it he does

2690
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,760
not care like

2691
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,199
so

2692
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:30,639
how might one sort of shift this well i

2693
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,159
feel like there could be structures that

2694
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,520
we could put in place in order for

2695
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,119
someone to not feel like they have to

2696
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,920
you know feel that but also

2697
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,920
maybe a focus

2698
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,560
i know it seems hard to say but maybe a

2699
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,040
focus on the things that he has to focus

2700
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:45,920
on

2701
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,480
would potentially limit the sort of

2702
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,199
you know

2703
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,080
constant need to feel like you need to

2704
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,239
put out fires

2705
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,880
so let's say that i'm a smart interface

2706
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,400
and i'm like well

2707
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,400
this person needs to be certain about

2708
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,239
these things because their life has x

2709
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,560
constraints well maybe we're going to do

2710
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,119
is give you x report and look you don't

2711
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:12,960
need to worry about it it's there you

2712
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,199
have that information now what about you

2713
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:16,639
tried to think about things that are

2714
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,239
longer scale what about you tried to

2715
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,280
think about

2716
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,119
things that if you had nothing else to

2717
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:24,080
care about you'd start thinking about so

2718
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,440
you know maybe these are the sort of

2719
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,280
epistemic foraging that

2720
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:30,400
would lead people to a slightly more

2721
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,080
peaceful life but maybe i'm coming from

2722
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,600
a very privileged place and maybe this

2723
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,040
is completely unrealistic so you'd have

2724
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,119
to ask people who

2725
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:39,360
are much less privileged might have a

2726
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:43,440
different view on this on this question

2727
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,520
awesome

2728
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,719
points

2729
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,560
um

2730
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,679
just in our last few minutes like

2731
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:53,600
what are you going to continue to work

2732
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,440
on or what are you excited about or what

2733
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,360
do you want to talk about or ask

2734
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,119
anything you want to talk about

2735
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,560
well i mean you did you mentioned your

2736
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,960
paper but we never got to it

2737
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,400
we have time or

2738
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,119
sure

2739
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:09,119
so with um a handful of co-authors

2740
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:12,960
we wrote a paper about um

2741
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,119
using active imprints to study

2742
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:18,000
specifically the epistemic community of

2743
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,600
science and so we as a group read and

2744
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,800
shared

2745
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,080
your paper on epistemic communities and

2746
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,480
then took the idea of like this

2747
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,119
epistemic entity and now we've seen

2748
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,360
active inference entities be at

2749
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,119
different scales

2750
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:35,920
that's

2751
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,560
several years and many like um

2752
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,840
different things we've talked about

2753
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,719
there

2754
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,560
including the narrative scale

2755
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,280
and so we thought well

2756
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,000
how could we model the scientific

2757
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,320
epistemic ecosystem

2758
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,840
how can we do

2759
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,760
a systems description

2760
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,239
of the scientific ecosystem so like the

2761
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,440
entities

2762
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,920
like the person but also the lab the

2763
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,560
university the dao in the case of

2764
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,880
decentralized science or like web 3 or

2765
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,239
open science

2766
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:09,040
how do we model the active entities

2767
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:09,760
and

2768
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,600
for the active entities

2769
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,400
eventually flesh out a cognitive model

2770
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,199
like

2771
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,880
you've presented today

2772
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,800
but also include

2773
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,520
the informational entities which map not

2774
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,000
on to the adaptive active inference

2775
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,760
agents but the

2776
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,239
mere active inference agents so we can

2777
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:29,600
still model

2778
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,040
the paper as like an entity but it

2779
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,719
doesn't have any policy selection that

2780
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:36,239
it can engage in

2781
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,320
where or like a code can engage in

2782
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,639
limited policy selection um when it's

2783
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:42,960
used by computer system and so the goal

2784
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,560
was to

2785
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,159
develop

2786
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:48,880
an ontology the eos the active entity

2787
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,639
ontology for science

2788
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,400
that would be able to

2789
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,199
link up natural language descriptions

2790
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:56,719
like i

2791
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:00,080
sent a message to my friend

2792
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:03,840
person friend sent a message so have the

2793
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,239
natural language representation with the

2794
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,719
graphical flowchart representation kind

2795
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:11,280
of like a social network

2796
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,199
of different kinds of entities including

2797
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:15,119
the informational ones and then be able

2798
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:16,880
to connect that to a simulation

2799
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,520
architecture

2800
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,560
so sorry you cut off what i think oh so

2801
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,600
okay so

2802
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,040
you were going to try and simulate

2803
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,840
agents using your ontology so basically

2804
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,280
like

2805
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:37,360
so the first eos paper from last week

2806
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,480
we focused a little bit more on the

2807
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,800
conceptual and the history of

2808
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,440
decentralized sense making

2809
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,280
and history of science

2810
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:50,239
and an introduction to web 3 and dsi

2811
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:52,000
decentralized science

2812
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,960
and then

2813
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,480
some of our ongoing

2814
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,679
work and collaborations are to

2815
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,760
go from the

2816
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,920
flow charts that we kind of sketched out

2817
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,080
in some of the figures like a funding

2818
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,600
motif or an information sharing motif or

2819
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,760
communications motif

2820
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:10,880
into

2821
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,400
a simulation

2822
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,800
that uses the active inference entity

2823
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,040
model

2824
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,639
okay wow you really need to talk to

2825
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,719
maxwell about this like he's been trying

2826
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:23,040
to think about how

2827
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,239
communities

2828
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:27,280
react to active inference specifically

2829
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,040
and this this makes me feel this makes

2830
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,880
me think of lactose right like how

2831
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,880
there's this like core and then people

2832
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,119
test out the the external hypotheses

2833
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:36,400
until they reach the core or if they

2834
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:39,679
don't reach the core then expands and so

2835
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:42,000
there's something really cool there i

2836
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,119
can't wait to

2837
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:46,320
see more of this work

2838
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,639
awesome um yeah i hope that we can

2839
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,880
continue

2840
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,520
strangely attracting and intertwining

2841
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,840
and including

2842
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,119
just collaborators from different

2843
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:59,840
backgrounds in the discussion as

2844
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,280
some people who are listening might be

2845
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,440
hearing about active inference for the

2846
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,560
first time

2847
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,679
and

2848
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,440
might be connecting with like a

2849
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,920
community in us

2850
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,600
that likes to do this kind of modeling

2851
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,400
and framing and also there's people who

2852
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,480
might be more familiar with the active

2853
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,560
inference modeling and hopefully this

2854
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,159
like brought their attention to a really

2855
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:21,440
important

2856
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,360
