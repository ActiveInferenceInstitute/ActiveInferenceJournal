1
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,108
Hello.

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,744
It is March 9th, 2022.

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:14,014
We're here in Acton Flab Gas Stream
number

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,750
17.1 with Mao production.

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:22,022
And Mao is a product director
at Game Addict, a researcher

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,292
at versus computational phenomenology lab
and finishing a Ph.D.

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,228
in cognitive computing at U.

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,062
Q a.m.

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,664
So we'll have a fun discussion today.

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,969
Feel free to write any questions
in the chat during the presentation.

11
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,671
And we'll have a great time learning.

12
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:42,142
So thanks a lot for joining
this guest stream

13
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:45,245
and really looking forward
to what you have to share.

14
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,280
Yeah, thanks for having me.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,582
I'm really glad to be able
to present this paper.

16
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:53,186
We've we've submitted it
and we're in the process of reviewing it.

17
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:57,857
So it's, it's a really exciting paper
that I'm hoping we can get out soon.

18
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,960
So today I'm going to try to go

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,931
through a lot of big concepts
and how they apply in active inference.

20
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:10,270
And then I'm going to try to explain
the nitty gritty of a generative model,

21
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,873
how to make a simulation, and then
what are the takeaways, limitations?

22
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,242
I'm going to try to keep this quick.

23
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,410
If you have any questions,

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,447
feel free to ask them
and I'll take anything as it goes.

25
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,719
So let's
begin with the main concept here,

26
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,923
which is confirmation
bias and conformity.

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,927
This this was the starting point
of our research

28
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,730
era we were
we were thinking with my coauthors,

29
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,669
which are Connor Hines, and definitely
to make us and Max Olmstead,

30
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:48,007
we were trying to think through
what leads people to see the world

31
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,144
in such a way that they are part
time, then

32
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,180
reconciling their view of the world
with other people.

33
00:01:55,014 --> 00:02:00,053
And so we went back to the practice
of exchanging ideas, sharing concepts

34
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,090
and values between different minds,
which is the fundamental process.

35
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,627
It really allows humans
and then other living agents

36
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,498
to coordinate and basically operate
socially by sharing ideas.

37
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:16,636
Individuals communities can really pursue
their pragmatic goals.

38
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,571
So basically,

39
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,742
you know, get from is one of the goals
you might want to optimize for

40
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,346
they improve
their understanding of the world.

41
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,583
And then we notice
that humans are compulsory

42
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,452
cooperators

43
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,256
human individuals

44
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:41,895
and survive based on the predication
that they have access

45
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,064
and they can leverage the bodies
of accumulated cultural knowledge.

46
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,170
Over the course of evolutionary
history, humans have developed an

47
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,042
exquisite li sensitive capacity
to discriminate between reliable sources

48
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,879
of information from unreliable ones,
which seems counterintuitive in the age

49
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,413
that we're at.

50
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:04,651
But you have to understand
how far we've come before we got to the

51
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,555
to the arms race for this information.

52
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,925
So the epistemic process

53
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,460
as I just said,
it's really not real fluff.

54
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,097
Humans are not computing machines.

55
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:18,932
They're not perfect.

56
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,967
They're mostly use your

57
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,003
the process information
by reasoning to limit

58
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,540
the consumption of energy and facilitate
rapid decision making.

59
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,043
That's that's the basis of survival.

60
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,146
For example, confirmation bias

61
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,183
implies that all other things
being equal, individuals

62
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,220
would prefer sticking to their own
beliefs over changing their minds.

63
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,357
It's easier for them to potentially

64
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,693
change their

65
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,530
model less
than if they had to really all the time,

66
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,966
constantly deal with the volatile
moral of the world.

67
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,070
There's a lot of research
about confirmation bias

68
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,372
and its relation to cognitive dissonance.

69
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:03,209
We really don't like cognitive dissonance
we don't like feeling like

70
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,478
the world
is not what we understand it to be.

71
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,782
And when we're faced with information
that conflicts with our core beliefs,

72
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,319
we do in fact experience
cognitive dissonance

73
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,925
the tolerance for cognitive dissonance
tends to vary across individuals

74
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,492
that there are people

75
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:23,863
who can really tolerate
a wildly volatile world, and they accept

76
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,766
that they don't know things,
and they accept that they could be wrong.

77
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,737
And then there's personality types
who are much less likely to take

78
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:35,375
this dissonance and are more likely
to try to avoid this dissonance.

79
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,046
And so confirmation bias in this way
has a social influence.

80
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,616
Individuals will prefer sampling data
from their anger

81
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:48,288
and will seek to confirm their own ideas
by foraging for confirmatory information

82
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,489
from their in-group.

83
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,392
This ensures that

84
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,794
they have access to likeminded allies,

85
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,097
and they choose to belong to communities

86
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,000
where their deeply held
beliefs are promoted and shared.

87
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,002
This limits the kind of effort

88
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,305
that is already expended
in the forging of information.

89
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,075
This in-group delivery

90
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,412
also influences
how strongly information is integrated.

91
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,682
So if a group membership is important
for the individual,

92
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,286
they'll tend to integrate
way more information

93
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,289
that comes from someone they believe
believes the same things as them.

94
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,193
For instance, you can think of news
sources and Fox News,

95
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,930
so people it's not like people
from different islands

96
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,199
don't know what the others are saying.

97
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,770
They just tend to take
what their preferred channel says

98
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,907
and completely ignore what other channels
are saying, even if they've heard it

99
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,312
so the

100
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:50,083
confirmation bias is echoed
by another heuristic.

101
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,818
Now we're talking about conformity.

102
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,286
So that's the need to cohere

103
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:57,490
with the beliefs of one's in-group
so it's kind of a push and pull, right?

104
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,360
I want to be in a group of people.

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,131
We're like minded and I want to believe
the same things that I believe therefore,

106
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,334
going in a group of people who are like
minded is the best way to do so.

107
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,037
I also don't want to be kicked out
from the group

108
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,172
because the group has access
to a lot of resources.

109
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,340
That is very good.

110
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,575
For me, right?

111
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,479
It limits how much information
any one agent has to gather

112
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,781
to be part of a group.

113
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,151
It also increases
how much each agent distrusted

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,221
in group.

115
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:33,593
Agents can be way more precisely
predicted by the other members

116
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,494
of their group.

117
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,399
This is in part due
by Norms and Behavior Scripts.

118
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,369
We wrote another paper about this,
and generally these scripts tend

119
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,571
to benefit
the members of the group, right

120
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,776
that's why
they also want to uphold these scripts.

121
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,246
So being able to sample from the group

122
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,550
entails a continued relationship
to other members if I lose access

123
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,720
to this, I can lose access
to information, food, shelter, and

124
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,324
you know, it leads to difficult

125
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,194
if you want to read more
in the eventually

126
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,596
give you all the resources

127
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:16,035
so this is a natural stopping point
if you want if you have any questions,

128
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,070
if you have any
notes, you can share them.

129
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,475
It was really

130
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:28,014
powerful what you said about
the losing access to the group benefits,

131
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,118
especially from just the evolutionary
and ecological point of view.

132
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:37,223
What are the scripts
and how does this current work

133
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,491
that you're sharing relate

134
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,327
to the work that you had done
with narrative and scripts?

135
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,597
Yeah, so I mean,

136
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,300
the definition of scripts is not

137
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,202
perfectly shared across the board.

138
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,370
There's a lot of fuels that use it,

139
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,941
but the way that we've reviewed
the literature and run together,

140
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,976
we have weeks scripts and strong scripts
a week.

141
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:02,081
Week scripts are like cluster hours
of connected concepts

142
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,751
that tend to exist
with one another in a sort of.

143
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:07,954
Yeah, it's like,

144
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,390
it's like the building of a context
with naturally occurring concepts.

145
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:18,331
And then the strong scripts is how these
concepts tend to sequence over time.

146
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,969
So like for instance,
there is going to be an actual entailment

147
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,405
to certain events that they've gathered
the concepts together,

148
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,208
and then you're going to be able to
exist in a space like this.

149
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,213
And that's, that's how you, you norm

150
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,550
not only how people behave in a group,
but how they coordinate.

151
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,887
That is how you norm
how the simple reality begins.

152
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,221
Let's let's imagine

153
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,825
my script in this place
says that I must do this, this and that.

154
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,426
So I'm going to do this, this and that,

155
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,629
which means I'm not going to have access
to all the other things

156
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,931
I might have done
if my script had been a little different.

157
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:57,270
So that's one way that we we force people
to only look at a subset of,

158
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,572
of the available information
in a given space

159
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,009
Cool.

160
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,178
Then how did it relate
or how does this research

161
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,181
build upon what you had done

162
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,083
those few months ago?

163
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:11,517
All right.

164
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:15,821
So the previous paper had formalized
what a script means in terms of active

165
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,023
inference and basically

166
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,059
you with

167
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,896
you as an agent, with your mission

168
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,565
predict

169
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,001
what your
what you're supposed to do next.

170
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,371
So it puts a strong emphasis on your

171
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,808
on your available policies and the way
that your policies are shaped.

172
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,511
And then you're going to

173
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,815
tailor your prediction
there on the response of the nation.

174
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,419
So then you're going to get to
the sort of sequenced

175
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,022
patterns of synchronization
that reinforce each other, right?

176
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,059
So the more I get the right pattern

177
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:57,029
the more likely
to get good reinforcement.

178
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,699
And therefore, I'm going to,
you know, think that

179
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,502
this is the right pattern for this group
and this is going to shape the niche.

180
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,707
So much so that if anyone even wants to
or tries to enact something different,

181
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,710
they may just get so much prediction
error that, you know,

182
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,512
people just will push back on it.

183
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,949
And you're going to stay within
this sort of manifold that has, you know,

184
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,584
the center points.

185
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,520
Then that gets all the states in. But

186
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:22,855
the way

187
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,625
that we're using this research
to build on the previous one is that

188
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,596
we understand that
a script takes many forms, right?

189
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,064
The weak version of the script,

190
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,901
this really something
you could call an ideology, right?

191
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,371
So if you take all of my script,

192
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,008
really what this is, is

193
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,112
how do I map my observations
to my sticks?

194
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,147
It's really what it is, right?

195
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,950
And so this new research is saying, well,

196
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,621
agents are going to map
things differently

197
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,192
and thus they're going to end up
into different groups

198
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:04,764
by simple virtue of mapping
so differently that eventually

199
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,432
it makes no sense for them

200
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,735
to try to interact with one another
because they couldn't synchronize anyway.

201
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,674
So that's that's that's where this how
this builds upon all of these research

202
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,111
or success.

203
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:19,945
Yeah.

204
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,781
Please carry on.

205
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:24,950
OK, so

206
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,586
we've discussed confirmation
bias and conformity,

207
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,756
and we have discussed
how they mutually reinforce each other

208
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,093
so does this energy confirmation
bias leads

209
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,463
to agents being drawn to groups
that validate their opinion

210
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,597
and increase the probability

211
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,867
of behavioral and epistemic conformity
I believe the same thing,

212
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,171
and they form the basis
of the information spread.

213
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,841
So agents spread information
through media and through connections

214
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:49,742
to one another.

215
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,877
Given the network structure. Right.

216
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:57,249
And the spread of ideas
and behaviors serves local and larger

217
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,250
scale coordination.

218
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,720
This is very much
based on the work of Maxwell,

219
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,590
who has effectively discussed
how active inference

220
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,227
works across scale in nested

221
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,631
Markov blankets that eventually build
and become one another.

222
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,136
So similar norms
and coordination can be understood

223
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,573
as synchronization, which lowers
the cost of information flow.

224
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,677
This increases
the certainty of the message being spread

225
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,412
as well as the quality of its reception.

226
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,048
So just right there,
this increased certainty

227
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,119
the capacity to spread messages,
this quality of reception,

228
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,722
you can see already how this might lead
towards better synchronization, right?

229
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,659
Because more certainty means
you may have less attention

230
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,295
to give to one thing
in order for it to happen.

231
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,030
And you can start thinking
about other things

232
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,401
and start specializing in other areas
with the certainty setting up.

233
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:49,702
Right.

234
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,272
The message will be more intelligible
to group members

235
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,042
share the common set of codes
and agents were more likely to integrate

236
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,045
new information if it fits better
with their understanding of the world.

237
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,749
So one example of optimization

238
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,951
of message passing includes such that

239
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:10,723
they have been known to be heavy
carriers of information in echo chambers.

240
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,693
They were used in partizan weights
to reach people of similar mindsets

241
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:19,098
who understand what the hashtag means
and understand that this is a signal

242
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,368
for them to interpret
what's being said in the light.

243
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,770
They want to interpret it.

244
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,573
So the spread of the information
is optimized through hashtags

245
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,476
as to the mental linguistic
categorization markers.

246
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,978
That was a lot of words.

247
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,915
But really, really what it means is

248
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,752
just that you see a hashtag
we know what it means.

249
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:43,355
We know it has a lot of meaning
without having to have a whole text

250
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,790
for it,
which is great for Twitter, right?

251
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,297
So we
labeled our communities in this study

252
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:57,069
formed in the process of belief
sharing as epistemic communities.

253
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,404
Now, this term already exists.

254
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,607
It was already
used by other other fields,

255
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,677
but we've tailored it
a little bit to mean specifically

256
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,479
that our communities could share
and spread a worldview

257
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,416
or a paradigm
or normalize sampling behaviors.

258
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,588
Individuals in the community
are tied together by these practices

259
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,690
which reinforce the social signals

260
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,226
acting as evidence
for the shared model of the world.

261
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,660
So hashtag

262
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,532
the echo chambers formation is an extreme
example of epistemic communities

263
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,068
echo chambers
type people with similar views together,

264
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:33,939
and they tend to actively work against
the engagement with external sources.

265
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,909
They become very epistemic vulnerable

266
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,847
when members can really no longer assess
when an information is true or not

267
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,352
only having access to a few sources,
it limits how much information

268
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:50,055
can be gathered and relevant
sources of evidence really fall through.

269
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,058
The gaps and error will be propagated

270
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,363
because it goes really well, really fast,
and is integrated really strongly.

271
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:02,368
And so the people can no longer tell
whether it's false or not.

272
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:06,272
Then the the system is much likely to

273
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,174
to be more vulnerable
to misinformation and errors.

274
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:14,079
They'll have a difficult time to check
errors against anything, and most minds

275
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,316
in the echo chambers will become more
and more synchronized and thus

276
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,253
poised to make the same mistakes.

277
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,289
So that's a pretty,
pretty big chunk right there.

278
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,559
If you want, we can take a beat.

279
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,795
Yeah, I had a question.

280
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,631
What is a healthy usage of hashtags

281
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,634
look like or how do we

282
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,037
compress

283
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,875
information and context and perspective
in a way that might not have

284
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,878
some of these like threats or failures
that you're talking about?

285
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,782
So for the first part,

286
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,484
I have an idea,
but I've never read anything

287
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,587
that specifically said this is a health
you so all venture a guess.

288
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,290
But I'll start
with the second part of the question.

289
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,792
It will give you a good sense.

290
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:05,230
The way to keep communities
healthy is to force them to be exposed

291
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,502
to viewpoints they may not agree
with, sources that they're not

292
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,039
necessarily familiar with,

293
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,610
and that have more nuanced text.

294
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,214
So the more you expose people
to different

295
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,850
kinds of people,
different kinds of beliefs,

296
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:30,656
the more likely they are to depolarize
and be more open to possibilities.

297
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,692
That's just a fact.

298
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,095
Like we may think through experience. No,
you know what?

299
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:42,101
When I see my my conservative uncle,
my racist, homophobic

300
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:46,171
conservative uncle, when he talks my kids
grit and I stop listening.

301
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,707
Yes, that's true.

302
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,643
But you still are exposed to him.

303
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,914
You still have to engage
with his thoughts to some degree.

304
00:16:56,315 --> 00:17:01,587
And so your reaction to push him away,
that's a natural reaction.

305
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:06,792
And, you know, you might actually do it
but if you're never, ever exposed

306
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:11,530
to his thoughts, you will never be able
to actually, first of all, really know

307
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,634
whether they're not true
because you've never engaged with them.

308
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,637
Right. So that's one thing.

309
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,540
So the guess about the hashtags is

310
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:28,514
maybe try to research hashtags
that are not part of your community

311
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,750
and try to reach people

312
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,020
who may not normally listen to you

313
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,791
in a language
that is potentially less polarized.

314
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,062
So if you really want someone,
the best example of this is,

315
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,030
oh, I see.

316
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,232
She's a YouTuber. She's amazing.

317
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,136
Natalie, when do you know her?

318
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,240
Not familiar right now.

319
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,142
I just the thing is, I don't remember

320
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,411
the name of her channel, but

321
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,581
she basically specialized

322
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,551
in philosophically deconstructing

323
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,488
conservative talking points in a way that

324
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,825
feel men them

325
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,527
and didn't
just destroy them on a sort of,

326
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,629
you know,

327
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,998
value based basis.

328
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,201
It was more like,
let's take these points.

329
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,370
Let's remove everything
that actually really isn't true

330
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,475
and take the kernel of truth in there
and understand it through their eyes.

331
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,409
And reinterpret

332
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,812
why this might actually still be wrong,
but not in a way that was demeaning.

333
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,015
And she reached a lot of people this way.

334
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,886
She reached a lot of conservatives
who were like, wow, OK, you know what?

335
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,055
I get it. And it was very effective.

336
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,158
So I think that's
the answer to your question.

337
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,728
Oh, carry on.

338
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:50,095
Maybe.

339
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,732
And I'm sure we'll be able to bring
active inference in, but it's awesome

340
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:58,837
to be just building the context
and seeing how there is motivation

341
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,040
and a perspective on the work.

342
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,875
Awesome.

343
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:07,446
So yeah, so one of the elements
that maybe will in fact

344
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,849
give you a good sense of how we're
bringing active influences is the concept

345
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,952
of volatility and habit formation. So

346
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,321
stability of the group is not guarantee

347
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,423
optimal inference in a changing world.

348
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,460
Requires integrating sensory data, right,

349
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,229
with beliefs about the intrinsic
volatility of the environment.

350
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,833
So environments with higher quality
volatility

351
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,236
change more often and thus have shorter
intrinsic timescales

352
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,506
at which the agent
has to keep updating their beliefs.

353
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,642
And conversely,

354
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,412
environments with lower volatility
require, you know, a longer time scale.

355
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,513
Start updating your beliefs

356
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:47,119
on the other hand, so

357
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,021
having a better ability to track

358
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,622
potentially important fluctuations

359
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,992
in information requires
to pay attention to smaller changes,

360
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:58,730
but increased attention to environmental
fluctuations will potentially lead

361
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,901
to increased sensitivity to random non
informative changes in the environment.

362
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,738
So that might be called a higher false
positive rate, right?

363
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,876
So it's important for agents
to to have the right

364
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,912
understanding
of the volatility in their environment.

365
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,518
One way to cope with volatility is to use
the coping mechanism to constrain

366
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,021
the uncertainty related to their own
behaviors via habit formation.

367
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:27,659
So here we are going to model habit
as a form of behavioral reinforcement

368
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,130
where behaviors become more probable as
a function of how often they are engaged.

369
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,301
So an agent has engaged
any given behavior enough

370
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:40,138
a habit can then be formed
and become hard to unlearn.

371
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,209
And this is important as we understand
both how parameters are set

372
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:48,280
in our generative model, but also
how echo chambers can form by habit

373
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,314
formation.

374
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,918
So no model behavior is driven
by information seeking,

375
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,989
which drives it to drive
that leads agents

376
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,259
to preferentially sample information
from other agents

377
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,028
with believes that they believe
are similar to their own.

378
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:03,996
So this

379
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,832
the way that I'm saying this

380
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,901
believe that they believe
is important in active inference,

381
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,236
because in active inference,

382
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:15,140
we're starting from the assumption
that we don't ever really know

383
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,910
things are kind of hidden from us

384
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,147
and we have to infer
what things might be.

385
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,284
So I never really have access to what
the other person believes.

386
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:30,822
I think they might think this,
and I'm going to try and further beliefs

387
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,225
based on some observations
they're putting out into the world

388
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,430
OK, now we connect them

389
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,967
let's start with

390
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,235
their inference.

391
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,337
So we're getting to the meat of it.

392
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:50,542
I'm going to do a very short introduction
inference if you already know, great.

393
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,912
If you don't, then
this is going to be very informative.

394
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,181
It's a biologically motivated framework

395
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,951
that rests on first principles
of self organizing.

396
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,688
And in complex adaptive systems.

397
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,859
So self-organization part
is probably the most important part here

398
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,997
because active inference is potentially
less interesting for rocks, for instance,

399
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,733
because they tend to self-organize
a little less.

400
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,538
I'm pretty sure we could actively use it
for a lot of the models. The

401
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,674
astrology, but in astronomy.

402
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,442
But effectively

403
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,978
what you're really clear here
is for things that tend to fight entropy.

404
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,881
So it's premised on the notion
that internal states

405
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,219
of any biological system
are statistically insulated

406
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,656
from the environment
that generates sensory observations.

407
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,126
So basically they have an inside
and they have an outside

408
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,796
and so they engage

409
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:49,067
in inference about the causes
of what gives them sensory states

410
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,237
to really behave optimally,
to keep fighting entropy

411
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,242
so biological systems entertain
a generative model

412
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:00,812
of the latent environmental causes
of their sensory input.

413
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:05,851
So latent because I don't know
really what causes it, I can only infer.

414
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,121
So it's a little different
from reinforcement learning

415
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,725
or reflexive beta algorithms
because actions

416
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:19,831
taken under active inference are guided
by these internal beliefs and themselves.

417
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:20,699
They are optimized

418
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:24,703
with respect of an internal world model
or a representation of the worlds

419
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:28,240
causal and data generative structure,
what we call the generative model

420
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:32,577
agents in

421
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:37,082
active inference represent their own
actions in their derivative model

422
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,585
by performing inference on both

423
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:45,056
hidden environments, states of the world,
and the consequences

424
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:48,760
of their own actions,
they can select behavior

425
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,131
which first achieves their goal
or fulfills preferences,

426
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,936
and second reduces
uncertainty in the agent world model.

427
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,205
So this is where we get to the epistemic
part, right?

428
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,409
I don't I want a certain
the world to be a certain way.

429
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:09,548
And then I also want to be less uncertain
about my own certainty of the world.

430
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,650
Being the certain way. Right.

431
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,219
So an agent's
main objective is to increase

432
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,457
their model evidence
and to reduce the threat surprises

433
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,394
that like it consider an agent
which is in the world.

434
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:27,132
If I want to predict myself surviving,

435
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,535
I want to see things
which are likely to make me survive.

436
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:35,574
If I'm surprised by something,
it's probably not likely

437
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,442
to make me serve survive.

438
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,511
And therefore it's
probably something I should avoid.

439
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,713
Like for right now, I'm in my room.

440
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,216
I expect the room to stay where it is
as it is.

441
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:44,950
This is good.

442
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,020
If there were to appear on my right
would be very surprising.

443
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,889
Probably very bad for me.

444
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:55,760
So processes like learning, reception,
planning, and goal directed

445
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,731
behavior emerge from this single drive
to increase evidence for the agents

446
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,032
generative model of the world.

447
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:06,104
So far, so good

448
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:10,175
so the agents
never directly act on sensory data,

449
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,811
but they change their belief
about what causes that data.

450
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,348
This is a course step in active inference

451
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,151
it consists in optimizing
these beliefs using a generative model.

452
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,889
It's also known as Bayesian inference,
or Bayesian model inversion.

453
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,425
This inference answers the question

454
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,561
What is my best
guess about the state of the world?

455
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,331
Given my sensory data
and my prior beliefs?

456
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,700
I don't come into the world
not knowing anything.

457
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,972
I have some basic beliefs about what's
what's going to happen.

458
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,742
And then I'm getting observations
and I make predictions

459
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,177
about what might happen
and then I act on those predictions.

460
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,247
This follows Bayes rule

461
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,884
where the optimal belief about hidden
or leading variable,

462
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,221
given some sensory data
is called the posterior distribution

463
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,258
if you want, and keep going into
that or it can skip that.

464
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,729
But but basically

465
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,232
you basically calculate

466
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,601
the probability of something
given something else,

467
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,804
the active inference perception,

468
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,839
the generation of a best guess
about the current

469
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,810
hidden state of the world is formalized
as the computation

470
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,681
of a posterior distribution
over some hidden states

471
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,951
and action
so the active part of active inference

472
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:31,156
is the computation of a posterior
distribution over policies.

473
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:35,760
Policies are just a sequence
of potential states

474
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,896
of the world. OK,

475
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:43,001
so now we introduce the actual model

476
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,937
is it is it clear so far?

477
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,974
Is the active inference part
pretty clear?

478
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,041
That's awesome.

479
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:54,312
You hit on many great active pieces

480
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,683
the only piece that really

481
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:02,988
I wanted to mention was the difference
between the observations

482
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,557
like what was said and then the hidden

483
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,027
hypothesized cognitive states.

484
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,930
It opens up a space between what happened

485
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,033
and why somebody said that

486
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,836
and so that

487
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,438
comes up all the time
in epistemic communities.

488
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,375
What is the author mean by those words,
or what are the person

489
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,809
mean by saying that?

490
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:29,214
And so that's why the context is
so important and active gives a framework

491
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,249
that might help us model
that kind of a scenario.

492
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:32,751
Exactly.

493
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:36,454
And I mean, this is this is exactly where
we're trying to go with this research.

494
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:41,626
Is that what right now
we want to model how people tend to

495
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,362
have different views of the world.

496
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,832
But the underlying phenomenon here
and we're going to try

497
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,102
to dig more into that is that

498
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,873
or the hypothesis
anyway is that there is a literal

499
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:58,843
different mapping between an observation
and a state,

500
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:03,214
which means for the same thing
being seen by two different people,

501
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,151
we're going to infer
two very different things.

502
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,988
And the funny thing is

503
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,925
then you come into the world of values

504
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:20,231
where it's a whole other scale,
so where we may

505
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,401
be interpreted the same thing,
well, we'll have a spin on it

506
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,672
in that spin being like,
No, no, I know what he meant.

507
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,574
I just fundamentally disagree with it.

508
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:33,778
And this is how we get into the web,
these descriptive webs of conceptual

509
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:34,579
spaces where

510
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,084
you see these these graphs of concepts
being connected.

511
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,152
But at some point there's a rift.

512
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,589
And, and that rift makes it
so that I value this.

513
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,557
You do not.

514
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,427
And we're still and so we can converge
towards understanding

515
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,630
without necessarily being able

516
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,834
to converge towards acceptance.

517
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:59,370
So this is the silver hypothetical

518
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,476
so. What one other note on on
what you just said there.

519
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,580
It's like the difference
between an orthodoxy and ortho praxis.

520
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:13,318
So what is the similarity
between conformity of thought

521
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:17,789
and latitude on action, vice versa?

522
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:22,293
And then in what way
are the systems around us like aligned

523
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,263
or not with our preference
about those features of systems.

524
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,600
Yeah, absolutely.

525
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,501
Absolutely.

526
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:33,071
I mean, I feel like
this could all be encased in see, right?

527
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,642
Like we can interpret the same thing,
but my see is way over.

528
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,943
I don't want

529
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,049
so I'll explain to you later.

530
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,852
This made very little sense.

531
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:48,753
You brought

532
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,992
so let's introduce
the model a little more

533
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:55,226
we are

534
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:59,731
individuals, agents who share information
with one another, and they come to form

535
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:03,768
beliefs about their local environment
and about the beliefs of other agents.

536
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:04,936
In their community.

537
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:08,940
So to understand this phenomenon,
we leverage this the active framework

538
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,944
here, the organisms tend to minimize
the quantity

539
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:16,347
called variational free energy,
which quantifies the divergence

540
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,851
between the expected
and the sense data as a claim for

541
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,788
from this point of view, to select
an action is to infer

542
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,725
what I must be doing,
given what I believe and what I sense.

543
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,796
So there's been a lot of work
done in this field on active inference

544
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,231
to study social systems.

545
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,935
I'm not going to go over all of it,
but there's really cool studies

546
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,772
and I've just highlighted
a few here where basically

547
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,475
systems minimize for energy

548
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,545
give rise to large scale
behavioral coordination.

549
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,315
Much of the work,
though, is still theoretical,

550
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:54,152
so it'll be interesting to see how
experimental work and delve into this.

551
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,186
I know you're honest.

552
00:30:55,186 --> 00:31:01,125
Margot are really Pythia and Max Lorenz
that are doing a lot of work on this.

553
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,762
I think Lars sends MIT
as well as doing some cool work on this.

554
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,167
So let me see

555
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,770
so at first glance,
it might appear difficult to model

556
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:17,175
phenomenon like confirmation bias
using active inference formulation. Why

557
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,346
because remember, our agents

558
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:25,650
are supposed to be guided
by the principle of maximizing Bayesian

559
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,821
surprise or silence,
which requires to constantly seek

560
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,957
out information that is expected
to challenge one's world.

561
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:33,258
Right?

562
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,594
Because the more surprises
that consume now, the less likely

563
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,898
I am to be surprised later right. But

564
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,201
information gain is subjective.

565
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:48,973
Epistemic value
or the Bayesian surprise or information

566
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,143
gain is always an expected surprise

567
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,512
from the point of view of the agent.

568
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,616
It's in relation to the agent's
set of beliefs or their model.

569
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,686
And because of this subjectivity,

570
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:06,658
the informative ness of epistemic value
or epistemic value of an action

571
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:10,862
can be argued it's
rarely far from the agent's expectation.

572
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:15,233
So taking advantage of this,
we give agents

573
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,002
what we refer
to as epistemic confirmation bias

574
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:23,341
by building a prior belief into the
to the model that agents are more likely

575
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:27,845
to sample informative information
from agents with whom they agree a priori

576
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,482
and is they
prior interaction is important.

577
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:35,720
So agents will travel agents
with whom they agree under the belief

578
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,924
that the agents are more likely
to provide higher quality information

579
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,831
so this is a key difference
with some stitching up in your models.

580
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,101
There's been a lot of opinion
models out there not allowed

581
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,471
with active inference, but definitely
a lot with traditional approaches.

582
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,607
And so the implementation
of bounded confidence

583
00:32:56,607 --> 00:33:00,578
to motivate
polarization is usually hardcoded

584
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,349
in the agents ability to perceive
and thus update their beliefs.

585
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:10,355
In our model, polarization is motivated
by the positive effect

586
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,458
of confirmation bias and is thus directly

587
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,860
in the agents model of the world.

588
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,497
This allows agents to get more evidence
about their environment

589
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,967
if the information comes
from another agent that shares

590
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,971
the same worldview, they're implicitly
motivated in their generative models

591
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:31,743
to gain more evidence about the world
if it confirms their preexisting voice.

592
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,213
Also, agents normally in traditional

593
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,950
models can directly perceive
the belief state of other agents.

594
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,119
Right
directly perceived. That's the key here.

595
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,789
But in our model, this is pretty.

596
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:48,393
We believe this is unrealistic because we
we only infer

597
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:52,063
the beliefs of others and thus

598
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:56,200
agents do not have direct access
to each other's beliefs that the infer

599
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,670
the belief states
and change them through observation.

600
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:08,546
There's been a few recent papers
on that begin to build Bayesian models

601
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,817
of opinion dynamics which are motivated
by the Bayesian brain hypothesis.

602
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,021
The crucial point
that distinguishes approaches like active

603
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,792
inference and planning is inference
from the genitive Bayesian approaches.

604
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,094
The notion
that actions themselves are inferred

605
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,999
behavior is cast
as the result of inference, specifically

606
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,803
by sampling actions from a posterior
distribution over actions.

607
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,540
So actions are selected

608
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,910
in order to achieve goals
that minimize future uncertainty.

609
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,979
And to maximize a lower
bound on Bayesian model evidence.

610
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:47,552
So we're using this to supplement
the goal directed aspect

611
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,988
of policy inference which is driven
by the expected free energy.

612
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,392
And this becomes habits

613
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,595
when the prior over the actions
becomes inflexible.

614
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:57,962
Right?

615
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:01,065
So if the prior overreaction becomes
so strong,

616
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:04,902
it's just always going to be that, right?

617
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,472
This prior is learned over time

618
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:11,042
and in the context of opinion dynamics,
it can lead to a propensity

619
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,645
to continue sampling agents
that have been sampled previously.

620
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,748
So it's this idea of choosing action
through inference

621
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,384
in accordance
with the minimization of uncertainty.

622
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,721
It's a powerful modeling technique

623
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,625
because through the choice of policy
inference, one can encode various

624
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,529
social behaviors like conformity, habit
formation, hostility and indifference.

625
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,465
Here we really only did

626
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:38,069
habit formation because we had to force,
but eventually

627
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:43,474
this could lead to very, very powerful
modeling tools for social inference

628
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,378
so I can stop here

629
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:50,748
before I launch into the hypothesis

630
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,017
awesome.

631
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:53,985
With active inference.

632
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,020
Let's keep going.

633
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:58,556
Awesome.

634
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,558
So we have three opposites.

635
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:04,061
The first one is that we cast
confirmation bias, and active

636
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:07,231
inference is a form of bias curiosity
in which agents

637
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,601
selectively gather information
from other agents with whom they agree.

638
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,239
Epistemic confirmation can mediate
the formation of echo chambers

639
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,376
and polarization in social networks.

640
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:22,980
But we also believe that confirmation
bias, epistemic confirmation bias

641
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,251
and interconnectivity will will merge
and modulate the formation

642
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:30,388
of polarized epistemic communities.

643
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,324
Hypothesis number two
is we consider the effect

644
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,994
of agents beliefs about the volatility
of their social environments.

645
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,930
So we try to see how beliefs

646
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,099
about social volatility impact
their sampling behaviors

647
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,870
and which itself may interact
with epistemic confirmation bias.

648
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,040
So we hypothesize that beliefs
about less quickly changing

649
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,043
social environments
will increase likelihood of polarization

650
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,012
and hypothesis three

651
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,248
we hypothesize that we can model

652
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,551
selective exposure effects and conformity

653
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,222
through habit formation, which emerges
through Bayes optimal learning.

654
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,624
So we show that agents will begin

655
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,594
to sample only those who belong
to a particular epistemic community.

656
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,531
A greater learning range for information
will lead to clusters

657
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,601
within the network, amplifying
and quickening the formation

658
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,236
of echo chambers.

659
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,405
So the model

660
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,976
this is a multi-agent active
inference model

661
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:30,715
and the group of agents update their
beliefs about an abstract binary states

662
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:34,685
that represent two conflicting ideas,
and the opinion states about these ideas

663
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:39,223
each agent also generates an action
that is observable

664
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,526
to other agents
in the context of digital social network.

665
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,663
We're using the Twitter linguistics,
but this was

666
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,099
we basically tried
to replicate distributions

667
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,934
that were finding
previous studies on Twitter.

668
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,471
Over time, each agent of this

669
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,675
posterior distribution are beliefs
about which idea is true

670
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:02,013
and as well as a belief about what
a connected set of other agents

671
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:02,880
in the network believes.

672
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,551
So basically, what do their neighbors
believe and both of these inferences

673
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,388
are achieved by observing the behavior
of other agents.

674
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,125
Agents can only observe
the behavior of one agent at a time.

675
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,761
So they have to they have to

676
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,498
pick who they want to look at.

677
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,099
All right.

678
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,135
The model.

679
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:30,241
So I can go into detail of one,
but this is pretty

680
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,444
I know it looks like a lot,
but it's actually pretty simple,

681
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,013
these encapsulate observations, right?

682
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,517
So this is the observation about what

683
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,520
I'm tweeting, who I'm looking at
and what they're tweeting.

684
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,020
Right?

685
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,390
And then the Matrix is mapping

686
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,761
the probable ality of a state
having caused this observation.

687
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:54,732
So we have states about
what is is that true or not?

688
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,233
Is it ID one is 92

689
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,570
this is a bit blurry but

690
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,772
basically like which neighbor or I look

691
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,712
at and one is looking at
what do they believe.

692
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:07,945
Right?

693
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,981
So it's, it's,
it's pretty simple mapping.

694
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,784
Here you have D which is the priors

695
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,187
so what do I believe about the world
before

696
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,890
having any observation about the world,
then B is the transitions, right?

697
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,994
So how are the states likely to succeed
one another?

698
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,064
Here you have the policies.

699
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:32,536
So what kinds of actions in my likely to
take to bring about this this section of

700
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:37,241
of abstains and C are my preferences.

701
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,578
So then there are other terms,
but they're a bit more complicated.

702
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,445
So I'm going to go into them.

703
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,215
But basically these are the main

704
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,950
these are the main things
you have to know about agenda.

705
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:47,685
So I'm

706
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,621
going to skip real fast
because there were little arrows.

707
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:55,025
It's really more of a now just step

708
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,861
here.

709
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,798
Each agent, each active inference
agent in the multi-agent

710
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,934
simulation is equipped
with the same generative model.

711
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:08,272
A single agent
observes the action of other agents.

712
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:13,844
They form beliefs about an abstract
binary environment and then they choose

713
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,914
actions with good selves or observe
be observable to other actions.

714
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,317
The focal agent consists
of two simultaneous choices

715
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,220
an expression and an observation.

716
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,158
So basically what am I tweeting
and who am I looking at?

717
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,661
An agent can only observe one neighbor
at a time.

718
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,665
So at each time step of Google agent,
both tweets sits on a hashtag

719
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,401
and chooses to read a hashtag
tweeted by another single agent.

720
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,203
So here we're seeing hashtag again.

721
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,538
This is just linguistics, right?

722
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,472
We could have said anything.

723
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,741
Basically
these are numbers in a in a matrix,

724
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,211
effectively in a much more complex model.

725
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,946
We could have had them

726
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,749
read a hashtag and a sentence
and then try to infer

727
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,250
what the sentence really says.

728
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,319
We could have done something
much more complex before now.

729
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,856
The point was just to make them
try to infer a belief

730
00:40:58,856 --> 00:40:59,924
based on.

731
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,188
I hope now we will rejoin

732
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,591
and then we'll continue.

733
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,530
Hey you there yet.

734
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,933
So sorry. I don't know what happened.

735
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,369
But we get all kinds of of surprises.

736
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,471
We prefer this is here.

737
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:48,873
You can reshare and just continue.

738
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,842
It is only a few seconds, but it was
it was great.

739
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:55,012
You know, when you say the right keywords
and then the Internet

740
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,948
short circuits, it happens.

741
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:01,452
All right, well, I don't see you anymore.

742
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,287
Oh, yeah, I'm here.

743
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,723
I'm here. Dory.

744
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,858
Oh, sure. It's me again.

745
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,526
Oh, yeah.

746
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:10,361
Awesome.

747
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,696
Actually, can I just go with this?

748
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,232
OK, can you see my screen again?

749
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,601
And I'm back. Is everything OK?

750
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,937
Great, great, wonderful.

751
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,739
We're back on. Where do you cut off?

752
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,908
Because I like to get talking
for a minute.

753
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:28,879
We heard observing one neighbor at a time
like Ethan, how you could have modeled

754
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,583
more complex interaction effects
with, like, multiple artifacts.

755
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,719
Yeah. Right. OK,

756
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,021
awesome. OK, cool.

757
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:37,621
Yeah.

758
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:43,594
So now let's explain the hidden stakes
so what are the stakes?

759
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,796
They're trying to infer as the idea.

760
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,165
So it's basically binary verbal.

761
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,001
I do want it to is do one true is 82 true

762
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,505
meta belief which is

763
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,308
the particular neighbors
beliefs about which of the idea is true.

764
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:00,210
So does my neighbor believe this or that?

765
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,012
The tweet

766
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,749
so what am I tweeting
and who should I attend to?

767
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,750
Which neighbor might?

768
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,720
And so this was actually very complex

769
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,391
Daphne and Connor did an amazing job here

770
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,828
because we wanted to change
the number of neighbors.

771
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:21,365
And so the matrices
had to grow in relation

772
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,000
to how many neighbors there were.

773
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,370
And they did it was it was beautiful
the way that they did this.

774
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,007
So shout out to Connor,
who's obviously a genius and me as well.

775
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,277
So I'll discuss control sticks.

776
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,480
So all states are which of the states can

777
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,515
my agents actually act upon?

778
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:44,622
So here it was the tweets,
so I can decide to tweet hashtag one

779
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:49,393
or hashtag two, and then I can decide
to look at neighbor one through ten

780
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,564
now observation
model adults, what can they see?

781
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,466
They can see their own tweets.

782
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,335
And this is important
because the thing is, often times

783
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,505
you have to have a sort of identity
mapping between your observations

784
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:02,172
and your states

785
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:05,175
so that the states can be taken
into consideration in the actions.

786
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,279
So here
you have to know what you're tweeting.

787
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:12,182
You have to know what your neighbor is
tweeting,

788
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,884
and you have to know who you're
attending to.

789
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:14,284
Right.

790
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,552
Pretty simple

791
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,424
now the likelihood so

792
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:23,827
PubMed

793
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,764
key in the generative model,
we have to describe

794
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:30,167
the likelihoods, the determine
how hidden states relate to observation.

795
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:30,701
Right?

796
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,638
So the entire a array

797
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,776
is a set of tensors with one substance
or for observation modality.

798
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:44,081
Each modality specific likelihood tensor
is a potentially multi-dimensional rate

799
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,383
and encodes the conditional dependencies

800
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,820
between each combination of hidden states
and observations for that modality

801
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:53,090
so we also have a transition model.

802
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:57,928
So the transition likelihood,
the dynamical likelihood in B lights

803
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:02,533
earlier the environmental dynamic
so how are things likely to change?

804
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:06,537
A higher value means that same idea
remains valid over time.

805
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:10,774
A lower value means the same idea
is less likely to be true over time.

806
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:16,080
So more environmental volatility
and then the dynamics of weather.

807
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,550
My neighbors are likely to change
their ideas of the world

808
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:24,221
then the next component here is

809
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:29,293
the the genetic models,
the priors over the observations

810
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,429
so in discrete, discrete
acts of inference,

811
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,666
we were presented these as vectors C, D
and E.

812
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,702
So goal directed action is motivated

813
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,804
by appealing to a baseline prior

814
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:42,940
over observations.

815
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,409
So that specifies the agents preferences.

816
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,678
So that is
the CEO was talking about earlier.

817
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,713
What do I want to encounter in the world?

818
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,482
What are the outcomes I'd like to see?

819
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,984
And those usually act
as kinds of rewards.

820
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,088
Then there's the price over
stated the initial time step,

821
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,125
which is the vector
it encodes the agent's beliefs

822
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:05,062
about the initial state of the world
before having made any observations.

823
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:09,633
And in the current model
we make the prior over control states an

824
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:14,838
empirical prior parametrized by the link
function denoted by the E.T vectors.

825
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,908
I'm not going to go too much into this,
but basically this implies

826
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,543
that the prior over those control states

827
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:23,580
corresponding to tweak actions
depending on the posture of the idea.

828
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,150
So basically
your agents are always going to tweet

829
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,718
exactly the same as they believe.

830
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,454
They're not lying but they could,
right? We could change that.

831
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,091
So how is learning under active
inference,

832
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,994
learning also emerges
as a form of variational inference. So

833
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,531
it's not an inference overridden

834
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,167
states, but rather over model parameters.

835
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:48,105
So the parameter inference is referred to
as learning because it is often assumed

836
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:52,810
to occur on a fundamentally way slower
timescale than hints in policy inference.

837
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:57,948
In this model, we use habit learning to
model the development of epistemic habits

838
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:02,586
so as I said, the, the
the tendency to resemble the same people.

839
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:07,124
And so they simultaneously infer
which neighbor

840
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,294
to attend to based on the prerogative
to minimize expected free energy.

841
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,198
And they also continuously
learn the habit

842
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,967
based on the frequency with which
they tend to ask their neighbor

843
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,703
all right, the actual simulation.

844
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:24,775
So in a given simulation,
we had several agents,

845
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,244
but we didn't always use
the same number of agents

846
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,947
we were very limited
by computational constraints.

847
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,951
We would have wanted to make something
much larger, much bigger to really model

848
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:34,918
an actual social media.

849
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:38,522
But this is very computational heavy
in the future studies,

850
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,824
we may try to increase
the number of agents,

851
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,627
but for now we tried to stay between 12
and 30 agents.

852
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,397
Again, same model for each agent
and each time step

853
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:51,335
agents simultaneously update their belief
and take an action,

854
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,671
each agent's observation
or function of its own actions

855
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,206
and the previous time step as well.

856
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,443
As the action to a selected set
of neighbors of the predecessor.

857
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,012
So not everyone is connected to everyone.

858
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:04,014
So I don't need
to see everyone all the time.

859
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:08,218
Each agent has a fixed set of neighbors
where the particular neighbors

860
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,787
are determined by
and let randomly chosen network topology.

861
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,524
OK, look

862
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,127
all right. So now local agents

863
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:20,430
with a higher estimate believes
the treats are more reliable.

864
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,700
They come from neighboring agents
the believe to share the same opinion

865
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,104
right so like minded people.

866
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,574
The inverse social volatility
is a parametrized focal

867
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,510
agents beliefs about the stock of society
of the social dynamics

868
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:37,414
the learning rate is associated
with updating the habit vector

869
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,150
over neighbor attendance and network
productivity

870
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,187
is the number the way that individuals

871
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,491
are connected to one
another is pretty simple.

872
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:52,229
So these are the parameters that we
tweaked during the during the simulation

873
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:56,233
you'll see that they tend
to inter interact with one another

874
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,669
and they're related to the
hypotheses. We formed initial

875
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,774
so this figure

876
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,208
is really cool.

877
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:09,513
It minimizes opinion formation
in a single active inference agent

878
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,783
and shed light on the relationship
between inverse volatility

879
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,520
and epistemic confirmation bias.

880
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,088
We use a simplified three agent

881
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,557
set up here,
so we just were trying to test something.

882
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,125
And each time step

883
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,529
the focal agent chooses to read a hashtag
from one of its two neighbors.

884
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,232
And the two neighbors are not actually
active inference agents here.

885
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:33,103
They're just they're just part of trying
to process their sources

886
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:38,642
of sequence of district hashtags and who
to who we have one or hashtag two.

887
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,546
And as you can see, higher
epistemic confirmation

888
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:46,316
bias induces a positive feedback effect
where the focal agent comes

889
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,052
to agree with one of its two neighbors
with higher certainty

890
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:53,223
as you know it,
it tweets the thing that it believes

891
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,495
even if it's exposed
to a sequence of hashtag over a hundred

892
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:02,199
time steps,
the agent receives the observation and

893
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,870
here below it support the heat
map shows that the temporal illusion

894
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,607
of the probability of sampling neighbor
one versus neighbor two over time shows

895
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:14,644
that it's clearly it clearly goes towards
the one he started it prior with

896
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,881
the new beliefs

897
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:21,885
and more metabolic volatility
meets a higher posture uncertainty

898
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:27,124
about the idea but it's still events
only leads to you know

899
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:32,229
believing in the same idea
you initially start to look

900
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,999
OK now

901
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,101
this is much

902
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:41,004
much more informative
as to the actual phenomena.

903
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,374
And you can see here that we have
two very interesting phenomenon

904
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,010
in census and polarization

905
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,748
they emerge when simulating the network.

906
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,385
We can see that
every agent is generated by the action.

907
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,387
The observations

908
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,257
of every agent is generated
by the actions of other agents

909
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,693
and so collected believe dynamics here

910
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:07,898
under different
narrative parameterization really show

911
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,502
that the evolving beliefs
of all agents about idea one

912
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:17,307
or about idea two in panel eight
and we see polarization

913
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:20,477
where two subset of agents
end up leaving in two different levels

914
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,980
of the idea of the idea
hidden states with a high certainty.

915
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,884
So you can really see like they go
very far, it goes one or zero

916
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:31,455
it's not it's not like point six
and it's really one or zero.

917
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:35,192
They're really certain in panels
being seen on the other hand,

918
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:37,727
shows consensus
where the whole network converges

919
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,796
on the same opinion
by the end of the simulation.

920
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,866
This really showcases
the rich phenomenology

921
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,969
displayed by collectives
or vector inference agents,

922
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:49,906
which validates or model really alongside
known opinion dynamics model.

923
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,875
And that was really able to replicate

924
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,945
distributions that we were

925
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,447
trying to to converge towards

926
00:51:59,416 --> 00:51:59,816
journey.

927
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,651
Questions.

928
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,621
Yeah, maybe go back to the slides.

929
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:10,293
What kind of dynamics
might result in persist in diversity

930
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:15,298
or not just the absolute consensus
or absolute bifurcation.

931
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,902
But like you did mentioned,
you said you didn't see there

932
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,671
to be a continuum
of like people who aren't sure.

933
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,941
So what kind of parameters
or what kind of cognitive

934
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:27,277
mechanisms would facilitate that.

935
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:32,382
So lower epistemic confirmation
bias for sure

936
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,286
would would potentially lead
to more variety.

937
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,091
We would look at two network structure,
eventually lower

938
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:44,761
habit formation would definitely help
as well as you can see here,

939
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,031
and also higher belief

940
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:51,201
in volatility
so if you believe that volatility is

941
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,570
high, you're going to keep sampling
a lot of people

942
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,673
because you do believe that uncertainty
is going to continue arising.

943
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:56,907
Right.

944
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:59,676
So these are three parameters
that really lead to more diverse

945
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:02,579
and less polarized
beliefs and some ideas.

946
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,018
Because it's so interesting
how you captured like the two things

947
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,087
you can do on a classic social media

948
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,557
platform, which is decide who to follow

949
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:17,160
and then kind of at a finer scale,
who to pay attention to.

950
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,663
You know, it's also partially like

951
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,398
put in front of you
with the feed in the algorithm,

952
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:24,634
but also it's a little bit of agency
in like what you pay attention to

953
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:28,171
and who you follow at a slower time scale
and then how you act

954
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,041
and how that modifies
the epistemic niche.

955
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:35,378
And some people follow a lot
and act little and vice versa.

956
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,949
And different people's cognitive models
get up, get it in a different way.

957
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:42,586
Despite having access
to similar platform affordances.

958
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,356
So these are really great points
in future studies.

959
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,992
One, you might want to see
how the niece responds.

960
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:52,262
So right now that they're crafting
their niche is simply as a function

961
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,964
of who they're talking to. Right?

962
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:59,035
But you could also model
the algorithm screwing with you, right?

963
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,638
So the algorithm knows
you're looking for this.

964
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,808
It's going to cut some things from you.

965
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:09,980
And so you like for instance, one way
we could have done this is the niche

966
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,116
could have determined, well, OK, well,
you're listening less to this, so

967
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,119
I'm not going to cut that connection.

968
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,622
I'm just not going to let it be
broadcasted to you right now.

969
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,691
So that's
one way that the algorithm works.

970
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:21,958
Right?

971
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,226
It basically selects things.

972
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:26,029
It puts in your feed, even though the
people aren't gone, they're still there.

973
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,464
You see them less.

974
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:31,001
So that's that's when we we could have
done like a relationship with the niche

975
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,003
and as you said, yeah,
we could have model

976
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,939
different kinds of behaviors
for people who are more lurkers, right?

977
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,475
How do their beliefs change
if they're not showing?

978
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,211
So that's one way that eventually
we're going to be able to model

979
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:45,582
like influencers if they're people
who potentially broadcast

980
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:49,319
to a lot of people in a lot of the other
people don't broadcast as much.

981
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:52,722
So the beliefs of these people
are super influential

982
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:55,759
as opposed to believes that these smaller
people who are much less influence.

983
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,361
So that's
I mean, there's a lot that can be done.

984
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,263
It's really cool. But yeah,

985
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,366
people write about this.

986
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,702
The only problem in life is
there's not enough time.

987
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,705
But yeah, it's really cool.

988
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:11,007
So I'm like, keep going

989
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:14,177
because you're going
towards the cool part.

990
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,581
So there's an interaction

991
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,284
between epistemic confirmation
bias and network connectivity.

992
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:25,088
And here you can see a heat
map of the mean

993
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:28,792
polarization index across like 100

994
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:33,496
independent realizations
of the multi-agent opinion, dynamic

995
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,831
simulations

996
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,734
for unique combinations of network
connectivity

997
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,203
and epistemic confirmation bias.

998
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:44,674
So in the bottom, the selected plot
lines, two extreme settings of P

999
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:49,112
so p 02 and P 08 and

1000
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,148
Y, which is a yeah.

1001
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:55,919
So shaded areas around each line
represent the standard deviation

1002
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:59,189
of the polarization
index across independent realizations.

1003
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,192
So this is hypothesis one.

1004
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:06,096
We investigate hypothesis one
or how epistemic confirmation bias

1005
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,364
or Y and network

1006
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,967
connectivity determine collective
formation of epistemic communities.

1007
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:15,004
We systematically varied
both epistemic confirmation bias.

1008
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,241
So 15 values
for epistemic confirmation bias

1009
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:21,711
telling the range 39 and network
connectivity.

1010
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:27,884
So 15 values for P telling the range
0.20.8 in networks of 15 agents

1011
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:32,155
and over a hundred different realizations
of each conditions for 100 steps.

1012
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:33,289
It's really a lot.

1013
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,691
It's really a lot.

1014
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:37,060
But the b the results are beautiful.

1015
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,463
And so we were trying to see how higher
epistemic confirmation bias

1016
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:44,801
in sports network might drive
the emergence of epistemic community

1017
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:49,239
through the the formation
of belief clusters that are both dense

1018
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,642
and far apart in belief space right
so they really believe different things

1019
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,514
to assess the emergence
of epistemic communities or clusters.

1020
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,416
We defined the polarization index,

1021
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,385
which measures the degree of epistemic
spread in the system.

1022
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:07,457
And so a high value of P so close
to one indicates more spread out

1023
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:10,527
beliefs and implies
clustering an echo chamber formation,

1024
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:15,198
whereas Louis implies the network agents
have similar beliefs about an idea or,

1025
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:19,235
you know, less less diversity
or less polarization.

1026
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,670
So it shows the

1027
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:24,741
effects of varying epistemic confirmation
bias and network connectivity.

1028
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,478
On polarization,
it is clear in the first column

1029
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:33,116
of the heatmap that highly spread out
beliefs can occur it can occur at all

1030
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:37,620
values of epistemic confirmation
bias in the presence of a sparse TV,

1031
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,990
denser networks in general

1032
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,660
reduce the risk of polarization

1033
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,196
as seen by the by the drop off.

1034
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:51,601
So how increased epistemic confirmation
bias can still counteract this effect

1035
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:55,305
to some extent by marginally bumping up
the risk of polarization?

1036
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,173
So this is a really interesting result.

1037
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,175
But it comes back to what we were saying
earlier.

1038
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:02,278
A dense network
means there's a lot of people

1039
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:05,882
who you can see the opinion of
and who may not agree with you.

1040
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,218
So you have more access to people's
beliefs.

1041
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:12,121
Sponsored networks
means you're very quickly

1042
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:16,292
going to fall into an echo chambers
because you're going to turn off some

1043
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,760
some people you don't want to listen to.

1044
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,630
And then you have no more
connection with these people.

1045
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,371
So in this one, you see another heatmap.

1046
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,007
So these are really noisy.

1047
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,308
We're sorry about that.

1048
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,778
We redid them for the for the reviewers,

1049
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,182
but they're not ready,
so they're pretty noisy.

1050
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,384
But I'm going to help
you make a little sense of them.

1051
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:45,221
So here you have a heat
map of the polarization index

1052
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:49,759
for 225 combinations
of inverse belief volatility.

1053
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:54,163
So this hypothesis two and epistemic
confirmation bias precision.

1054
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:58,668
So the above right heatmap,
if I'm pointing to the right, I

1055
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,672
mean, yeah,

1056
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,475
is the map of the Orient

1057
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:09,512
demonstrated for 225 combinations
of inverse belief

1058
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:13,082
volatility and epistemic confirmation
bias and below left

1059
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:17,587
it's aligned plot of the most extreme
rows of the polarization heatmap.

1060
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:21,891
So below right is the plot line
of the most extreme columns of the

1061
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,493
attendance heatmap.

1062
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,029
So for

1063
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,766
hypothesis two, we model behavior
under different values of inverse social

1064
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:34,370
volatility to see how we would interact
with epistemic confirmation bias.

1065
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:40,209
We swept over epistemic confirmation bias
and social volatility, and we measured

1066
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:43,980
the attendance rates and polarization
index for each configuration.

1067
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:49,519
It portrays a complex picture
of the relationship between ECB

1068
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,755
and inverse social volatility in the case

1069
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,325
of high volatility over meta beliefs,

1070
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,228
agents are driven
to periodically re attend

1071
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,932
to neighbors in order to resolve
growing uncertainty about their groups.

1072
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,269
You can see a higher average
re attendance rates.

1073
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,438
Interestingly,

1074
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,641
there seems to be an interaction
between re attendance rate and epistemic

1075
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:15,812
confirmation bias, such that
in the presence of both high volatility

1076
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:20,216
and low epistemic confirmation bias,
the re attendance rate is maximized. So

1077
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,252
they'll they'll return to the

1078
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:27,156
same people even if they have lower
epistemic elevation theories.

1079
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:32,829
Because, you know, there is fear
they have high volatility.

1080
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:35,465
The constantly thing, the people
are likely to change their mind.

1081
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:40,637
So they're going to continue
to keep attending these people with

1082
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,240
a little bit of a allure of volatility.

1083
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:48,544
They're not the lowest, though,
because if if you have the low setting

1084
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:54,283
volatility you're just not going to care
so much what other people think.

1085
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:56,219
Are you just going to keep pretending?

1086
01:00:56,219 --> 01:01:00,123
So we speculate that the absence of ECB
makes the epistemic value

1087
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,559
of attending to every neighbor
pretty much equally high.

1088
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,997
And thus agents are going to continue
revisiting neighbors

1089
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:12,435
sequentially with the attendance
preference for any given neighbor solely

1090
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:15,638
dependent on the time lapsed between
the last reading of their last hashtag

1091
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,642
so this is interesting.

1092
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:20,977
It will lead to diverse

1093
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:24,781
social attendance patterns so that agents
will prefer to constantly sample either

1094
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:30,153
new neighbors with no particular neighbor
left or uncertainty driven resampling

1095
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:34,657
so they can either sample everyone
or the same people.

1096
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,860
But there but they'll
they'll try to attend to their neighbors.

1097
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,695
A lot

1098
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:44,133
OK, so here we have

1099
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,335
the last hypothesis about the street.

1100
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:51,140
We have there is a heat
map of the polarization index for all 225

1101
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,610
combinations of learning rate and
epistemic confirmation bias precision.

1102
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,947
So above right,
you have a heat map of the attendance

1103
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:02,251
rate for 225 combinations
and epistemic confirmation bias.

1104
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:06,289
So the parameters represent the centers
of the normal distribution sampled

1105
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,591
from across trials for each configuration

1106
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:11,794
below left the most extreme rows
the polarization

1107
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:15,565
index heatmap and blue ride
the most extreme column of the region map

1108
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,036
so you are trying
to see of the polarization of networks

1109
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,772
via habits formation

1110
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,707
follows hypothesis three

1111
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:27,376
We slept over ECB for 15 values

1112
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,379
timing the range 39 and learning rates

1113
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,350
so 15 values chilling from 09

1114
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:38,354
and the networks were pretty small
15 agents with a connection probability

1115
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:41,991
of 0.4
and an inverse social volatility of

1116
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:47,363
six and as before the same idea
so nine so

1117
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:51,467
ECB was again
normally distributed with a fixed mean

1118
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:54,937
and a variance of one so we we

1119
01:02:55,338 --> 01:03:00,743
we sampled from a normal distribution
and we eventually we lowered the

1120
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:04,647
the the variance
and it gave us much better results.

1121
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:08,584
But the learning rate was fixed

1122
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,521
for the condition to really understand
what the effect of it was.

1123
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,791
The learning rate incentivizes agents

1124
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,193
to return to the same neighbor
by forming a habit.

1125
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,997
This competes with the epistemic value
attending to a new neighbor

1126
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,298
with a known beliefs.

1127
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,867
This tested the hypothesis
that a higher learning rates

1128
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:28,004
star have information,
increased polarization, and here we can

1129
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:31,641
demonstrate that higher learning rates
and epistemic confirmation

1130
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:35,011
bias interact to influence outcomes
at the collective level.

1131
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,547
So higher learning rate
and this is more polarization,

1132
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,783
implying the formation of more stubborn
epistemic communities in the network

1133
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,489
ok, so

1134
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,159
me you go to the takeaways

1135
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,460
be awesome.

1136
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,063
Let's ok.

1137
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,065
So here

1138
01:03:56,766 --> 01:04:00,636
we showed confirmation
bias as an epidemic phenomenon.

1139
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:06,509
Our agents have bias beliefs
and we saw that

1140
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,946
ECB confers a higher weight
to information that comes from peers

1141
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:14,016
and this can lead to a bad bootstrap

1142
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:17,820
we find that opinion dynamics heavily
depend on that density.

1143
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,922
This was not counterintuitive,

1144
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,458
but the way that it happens
was a little bit counterintuitive.

1145
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:27,830
The clustering phenomenon is exacerbated
by adding the capacity to form habits.

1146
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,166
So this is important.

1147
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,869
We found that ECB,

1148
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,571
the presence of habit formation,

1149
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,506
exacerbated polarization

1150
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,977
due to the formation of echo chambers

1151
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,779
or type communities of agents
that only read each other's hashtag.

1152
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:49,652
And the contributing influence of beliefs
about social volatility to exploratory

1153
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:53,689
social sampling leads us to consider
the role of norms in social settings.

1154
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:58,928
If an agent is incentivized
via epistemic value or curiosity

1155
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,497
to pay attention to neighbors
whom they are uncertain

1156
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:04,500
about their social group
could be a source of constant surprise

1157
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,603
as long as their beliefs about
the neighbors are constantly fickle.

1158
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:12,108
So in other words, even in the presence
of a group of like minded peers,

1159
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:16,646
you got burritos, I guess.

1160
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,850
Pretty dumb modification.

1161
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,885
The best kind of initial modification.

1162
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,353
Yeah, I know, right?

1163
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,056
With those brings moving brands

1164
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:31,961
so we expect that increased beliefs
about social volatility refers

1165
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:34,563
to repeated returns of peers
among one another.

1166
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,135
OK, we have limitations in this work.

1167
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:42,371
As I said, very low number of people.

1168
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:47,743
We only model beliefs to believe
to exclusive ideas.

1169
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:51,180
It would have been maybe more interesting
to have more and we would have wanted

1170
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,216
to to notice the emergence

1171
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,585
of similar
but distant subcommunities as well,

1172
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,222
even if they're not already connected.

1173
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,326
So yeah, that was it was all

1174
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,428
that was all of it.

1175
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:09,065
Cool work,

1176
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,400
really fun to hear about

1177
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:14,570
nice.

1178
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:19,542
Well, if anyone's watching live,
they can ask any questions.

1179
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:22,878
Otherwise,
what would you like to start off by?

1180
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:25,648
Talking like when you present that for
what audience?

1181
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:29,285
What did people often ask about.

1182
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:33,356
And they ask the same questions
you ask them.

1183
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:36,425
They ask,
What can we do about social media?

1184
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,928
How do we factor in the algorithm?

1185
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:43,499
What this can
how this ties into misinformation?

1186
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,569
I guess this question
we haven't really talked about

1187
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:49,805
the notion of misinformation
so that's something you're interested in.

1188
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,842
Let's hear about it. Yeah.

1189
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:57,079
So this is not misinformation.

1190
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,347
It's kind of a tricky question, right?

1191
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,182
Because you'd think

1192
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:04,120
you'd think that misinformation would be

1193
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,390
if it doesn't agree with us,
if it's about something we don't agree

1194
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,292
with,
we cast it instantly as misinformation.

1195
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,660
And in fact,

1196
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,697
we tend to fall very heavily

1197
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,500
for most sources of misinformation.

1198
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:18,901
The only thing is

1199
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:20,970
we fall for

1200
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,573
misinformation that tends
to reinforce our view of the world. So

1201
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:28,544
even if it's part
of a sort of conservative,

1202
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:32,348
if you're if you're more liberal, more

1203
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,152
I forgot the word

1204
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,721
for not conservative in the U.S.,

1205
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:41,957
but you're more left

1206
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,994
if you're seeing some piece
that's been crafted by the right.

1207
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,462
But it kind of

1208
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,231
confirms your view of the world,
you're more likely to integrate it.

1209
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,235
And this is this is pretty important,
especially when we're trying to

1210
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:57,239
think about the Pew Online people and

1211
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:03,212
people whose views aren't necessarily
completely polarized

1212
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:06,348
but who want to view the world

1213
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:09,685
as something they

1214
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,320
they cannot fault. Right.

1215
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,189
Something they have

1216
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,725
they have control over
the epistemic value that they can gather.

1217
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:21,130
And so they're being fed information

1218
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:25,701
which feeds into that sort of meta
view of the world that they

1219
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:29,905
they can understand the hidden truth
about the world.

1220
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:32,641
And so this becomes a sort of tool

1221
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:36,946
you know, where it doesn't really matter
what I picture you,

1222
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:41,217
so long as it gives you this
sort of sensation that you have access

1223
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,319
to something that others really don't.

1224
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,820
And therefore, you now

1225
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,089
understand the structure of the world
a little better.

1226
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:48,090
Even if

1227
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,526
when you take the whole thing

1228
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:54,363
together,
when you look at the entire structure of

1229
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,602
a conspiracy beliefs,

1230
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:02,138
they're extremely unlikely,
extremely complex.

1231
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,274
And one way that we've noticed
that we can

1232
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:11,013
identify these conspiracy
theories compared to, you know,

1233
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,783
true facts, they tend to have
a really interesting structure,

1234
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:20,356
which is they're very sparsely connected
to very large elements.

1235
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:24,693
But like normally in a true in
a true story and something that's real,

1236
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:28,497
even if there's a lot of elements
or fields that are combined,

1237
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,666
there's a lot of connections
among things, right?

1238
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,401
Because because it's real.

1239
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:37,640
So you can really you can see from a lot
of directions these real connections.

1240
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:40,142
If you lose one connection,
everything doesn't fall apart

1241
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:43,279
in conspiracy beliefs.

1242
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,714
Those connections are so sparse
that if you lose

1243
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,617
one, the entire theory
doesn't make sense anymore.

1244
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,454
So it's it's that's
that's the kind of structure that we see.

1245
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:54,423
So it's kind of sort of

1246
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:58,260
you can see how
this would have epistemic value, right?

1247
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:01,530
Because everything is so surprising

1248
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,433
and uncertain that people would like

1249
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:08,237
feel a lot of value
from accruing all this information.

1250
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:08,571
Right.

1251
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:11,840
So I think that's where we fall
into the bad bootstrap.

1252
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:15,277
But there are other kinds
of about bootstrap, like

1253
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:16,545
let's say.

1254
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:19,982
So I don't want to I don't want to make
any community feel like there

1255
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,852
being targeted or that

1256
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:26,422
or that I'm being negative towards it.

1257
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:31,827
But there are is
like let's talk about a cult right let's

1258
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:35,664
think about a cult who started believing
a very niche set of beliefs.

1259
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:41,403
And the the way that they do this is by
cutting off contact everybody else right.

1260
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,640
It's much easier for me
to instill a belief in you.

1261
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:47,109
There's nobody else to tell you
with the screens bullshit.

1262
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,677
Like, what are you doing?

1263
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:49,645
So one of the first thing is

1264
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,947
they tell you to cut off contact
with a lot of people.

1265
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,850
They reinforce the beliefs constantly.

1266
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:59,021
They punish anyone who dissents because
that's how you reinforce a belief.

1267
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:00,856
And then

1268
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:03,826
you find them in
these sort of communities which are like

1269
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,895
very only locally functional.

1270
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,232
And if you take someone out of that
community afterwards,

1271
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:13,636
and you put them somewhere else,
they're like

1272
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,871
kind of lost because, well,

1273
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,308
that's not how the world works.

1274
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:23,545
Like they they're
they need to re learn a lot of things.

1275
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,847
They need to

1276
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:28,417
develop behaviors that are distinct

1277
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:32,388
from their previous belief systems
that allow them to exist and, you know,

1278
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:35,491
be humans in an already pretty complex

1279
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,559
civilization system.

1280
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,166
That was very interesting

1281
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:47,102
about the resilience of the meta view.

1282
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:50,072
So how do we

1283
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:54,076
use active inference
to study these different phenomena?

1284
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:58,647
Like how do you connect the nodes
and edges from the graph,

1285
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,216
the generative model,
the cognitive model?

1286
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:05,487
How does that visualization
representation connect

1287
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,323
with like the phenomena
that we want to model.

1288
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,093
I mean, that's the

1289
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,829
part of the standard question, isn't it?

1290
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:16,799
That's what we're working on
at the Computational Phenomenology Lab.

1291
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:21,570
I have a theory, but it's not like
it's still being developed.

1292
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,405
But my sense is

1293
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:29,278
you're going to start treating

1294
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:31,480
events as observations, right?

1295
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:35,084
And you're going to start treating

1296
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,286
so you're a node,
you're here in the graph,

1297
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:41,657
and everything around
you is a sort of observation.

1298
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:45,260
And you're, you're trying to determine

1299
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:48,797
layers in the graph
which become states, right?

1300
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:53,102
So you're going to move across the graph
by trying to predict

1301
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:57,873
effectively what is the next state
and try to see if this new thing

1302
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:00,709
that you're going to observe matches
with state you're trying to see. So

1303
01:13:02,077 --> 01:13:04,113
so that's just how you
move in the graph and then

1304
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:05,881
the way that you're going

1305
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,950
to establish what is

1306
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:10,052
true or not.

1307
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,987
So that's one way to do it.
There are other ways, right?

1308
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,323
There's also swarm beliefs and stuff.

1309
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,992
But like one way to do it is, well,

1310
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,531
how much can I predict from this note

1311
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,101
how much is actually connected
to this node?

1312
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:31,273
And if if we take this structure again,
like the the graphs

1313
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:35,677
which are sparsely connected and don't
allow for any connection to be lost,

1314
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,847
you're going to start seeing that there's

1315
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,784
going to be a lot of dense connections
between concepts

1316
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:46,955
and it's going to be very easy for you to
sort of find your way through the graph

1317
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,858
and be like, well, I can go there
and I can go there and I can go there

1318
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:54,096
and try to make predictions
about the next potential nodes.

1319
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:58,400
Given these two that you or these three
that you already have right I have these

1320
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,503
three things and I know everything
because it's densely connected.

1321
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:02,371
I can go there.

1322
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,941
It's easy, and if I go there, I don't
lose any connection to anything else.

1323
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:08,377
So that's one
way. Another way to do this is

1324
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,580
agents are going to start

1325
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,050
forming beliefs by observing
real life or reality,

1326
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:20,522
and agents who have a lot of observations
about the world

1327
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:26,028
are likely to, you know,
have a more accurate model of the world.

1328
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:29,798
So the more they make predictions
about things that eventually happen,

1329
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,401
the more we can give them
a reliability rating right?

1330
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:35,604
So like this person sees a lot of things

1331
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:39,241
one and two, when they see something,
it tends to happen.

1332
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:43,078
So we give them a high rating
and then you know, the agents

1333
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:46,882
talk to one another and sort of
like coordinate their beliefs.

1334
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:49,418
And eventually
there's going to be this dude over there

1335
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:52,654
that, you know, says Green and
everybody else says, right, it says red.

1336
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,958
And it's like, well,
you know, the probability

1337
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:59,928
of this green being true,
like there's a high surprise there.

1338
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:04,099
The kicker is there's a high surprises.

1339
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,435
So we're giving it
a lower reliability rating.

1340
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:10,305
But if it does end up happening within
the value is

1341
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,774
you know, is much higher as well, right.

1342
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:15,811
Because we reduce
a lot of their usual free energy here.

1343
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:16,478
So like

1344
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,649
I think that's that's how
we're going to get to these two things.

1345
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:25,487
Combine with the graph leading to
the nodes that you can connect together.

1346
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:28,891
And the agents with reliability ratings

1347
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:32,928
that swarm towards a true belief are ways
that we can integrate these things.

1348
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:33,595
I think

1349
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:41,236
or the first mode you had
I kind of wrote down, it was like dense

1350
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:44,439
connections, ideas that have grounding

1351
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:46,942
you know, good maps for territories,

1352
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:51,013
more stable territory,
more effective map.

1353
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:55,217
It's like in a family, if you went to
someone else's family, reunion,

1354
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:59,221
you should be too surprised
that any given two people know each other

1355
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:03,358
because there's kind of a coherence
or there's a prior about the density

1356
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:04,459
of that network.

1357
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:08,063
Whereas
if the network is very sparse, then

1358
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,935
the coherence of it is susceptible
to single facts being wrong.

1359
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:16,939
So you kind of point out to like
where a thread will be tied,

1360
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:20,042
will this person do that person
that this money was sent here?

1361
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:22,711
And then it's like
if even one of those things weren't true,

1362
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:25,914
then the whole contraption is fallacious.

1363
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:30,352
No. And then
and then like the dense connections

1364
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:34,423
have an element of conformity to them.

1365
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:37,526
Because you have an intrinsically
validating world

1366
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:40,495
model
like the epistemic network of epic cycles

1367
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,165
and that way of predicting
how the planet's moved

1368
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:47,669
and then you have insight from outside

1369
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:52,407
that goes against the conformity
bias, the prior,

1370
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:58,013
but that can be how the community
can move into a new space.

1371
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,351
So we can't have like just novelty
driven, like simply different is better,

1372
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:05,487
but we can't have simply
the same as better

1373
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:10,859
yet puts us in this active
inference situation, which is why it's

1374
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:14,930
so cool to see epistemic
modeling like you have all done.

1375
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:19,568
There's something really interesting here
about

1376
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:22,304
the optimal space

1377
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,573
around which you start.

1378
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,710
You know, computing
the right amount of information.

1379
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,979
So Mark Miller is working on this.

1380
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,115
Alex Keefer is working on this as well.

1381
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:38,353
I know that we're working on it
with also Alexandra, Syria through Lara.

1382
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:39,955
So there's this whole group we're working

1383
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:43,291
on, like what is the optimal computation
space?

1384
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:43,825
Right.

1385
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,364
And so this is this is
really the question you just posed.

1386
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:54,102
Should I stay exactly where I am
or should I try consuming error?

1387
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:56,872
And I think that's the beauty of groups.

1388
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:59,241
And this is where we sort of fall
into what

1389
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,643
what a group is
in terms of the marketplace, right?

1390
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:05,847
So in the inner spaces of a group,
you'll have people

1391
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:09,017
who are less likely
to start consuming error.

1392
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,688
They're just like,
you know, they're just staying within

1393
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,991
what's being done
and that's stability, right?

1394
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:19,394
And then towards the external parts
of the group, there are people

1395
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,631
who are more connected
to other groups, right?

1396
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:24,933
And then who can can start
consuming ever.

1397
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:28,437
And this
because the internal parts of the group

1398
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:32,340
are very densely connected to one another
because, you know, they're an in-group.

1399
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:36,211
This error can be passed in like

1400
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:40,849
it can be consumed
in a way that is efficient for the group

1401
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:47,022
to deal with through this
like sort of blanket.

1402
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,860
So the real question becomes
like what's an active state?

1403
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:53,595
What's the sensory like?

1404
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,565
Yeah, a state
at the level of a blanket for a group.

1405
01:18:56,932 --> 01:18:59,868
But you could start you can start
to conceptualize it as like,

1406
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,939
you know, your influencers
and your lurkers are like the lurkers

1407
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:07,476
consume information
and the influencers promote information.

1408
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:11,546
And then this whole thing becomes
sort of like there are people

1409
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:15,117
who just consume what this one news says,

1410
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:19,020
and there are people who just like

1411
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,156
push out information and then maybe

1412
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,892
they take a little bit of information,
but they're like, you know, there's

1413
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:27,562
this vast network of people
who are like like, you know, people

1414
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:30,632
who are like 90,000 followers,
but they themselves are all three.

1415
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,702
So, so, so then there's this, like,

1416
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:37,105
sort of layering of people
who listen to others.

1417
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:40,142
And so the smaller people
who have less followers,

1418
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:41,743
they're still connected to one another.

1419
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:43,578
And there's degrees of through which

1420
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:46,748
I think
information is passed and consumed.

1421
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:52,854
And so what Mark Miller is trying to say
is that the computational optimal

1422
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:56,291
is where you compute enough error

1423
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,395
that you continue to

1424
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:02,864
to grow
in your sort of fitness landscape.

1425
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:06,434
So you're still learning about things,
you're still discovering,

1426
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:11,239
but you're still stable enough
that no error is going to topple you.

1427
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:12,307
Right?

1428
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:15,310
So because you have
all these other people here

1429
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:18,480
who keep your group relatively stable,
you know,

1430
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,716
that consuming a little bit
isn't going to destroy your group.

1431
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:27,856
It's like if it's like, think of a
republic, you'll like what we know.

1432
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:28,790
We're in love.

1433
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:32,160
This new metamorph
is not going to like break or shut up.

1434
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,030
So it's good, right?

1435
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:37,899
So that's that's

1436
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:41,436
I think what allows like this
sort of large scale coordination

1437
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:44,072
among groups is that
there are people who are less specialized

1438
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,374
in consuming the error
and who can only do this

1439
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:47,642
because there are other people

1440
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:51,446
who ensure there's resources
being produced for them. Yep.

1441
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:54,616
Or two thoughts or

1442
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:58,987
one that core to periphery
or fringe continuum.

1443
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:02,624
It also happens like in colonies

1444
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,260
where there might be a brood chamber

1445
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,797
that is the most homeostatic controls.

1446
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:13,001
And then there's like a periphery out
to like kind of a lobby or an antechamber

1447
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:15,871
where there is a lot
more like in and out.

1448
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:19,074
And then of course, there's
the interfacing with the external world.

1449
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:24,246
And so then there's analysis
with tracking of like where the ants go.

1450
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:27,716
And so there will be some who's
continuum, who's distribution

1451
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:32,020
spatially is more like the top parts
of the nest or just the entry room

1452
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,289
and a little bit in
and there might be another one

1453
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,459
that spends more of its time
towards the core and spends.

1454
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:38,693
Then it goes a little bit out.

1455
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,198
But that last piece you said, like

1456
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:45,634
what roles

1457
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:50,171
contribute to colony
or epistemic community

1458
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:54,976
stability or collective open
mindedness or resilience?

1459
01:21:54,976 --> 01:22:00,348
Like those are such critical questions
that people frame qualitatively

1460
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:02,350
every day.

1461
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:08,823
And so it's just really cool
to have the conversation and open it up

1462
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:12,627
to many different perspectives
about what roles do play in communities.

1463
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:17,065
And then try to use the model

1464
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:20,101
to follow up and

1465
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,737
describe complex situations

1466
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:25,974
rather than like constraining to what

1467
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:28,576
communities can be
or how they can regulate.

1468
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:32,714
Yeah, and there's something beautiful
about active inference here, right?

1469
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:36,084
Because we could like
we can literally potentially

1470
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:41,823
measure or, or predict
what might be an optimal state

1471
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:46,995
for a group given the free energy
that the group can consume.

1472
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:47,462
Right.

1473
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:50,465
So if we can understand
how this consumption of error

1474
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:55,003
can be distributed over the group
or at least can be absorbed we can say,

1475
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:58,974
well, listen, we don't need to destroy
your, your to or not group.

1476
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:02,444
All we need to do
is give you a little bit,

1477
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:05,747
you know, like enough in the right
distributed areas.

1478
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:09,684
So then you guys integrate on wrong
and potentially shift

1479
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:14,222
without us having to further push
and potentially even polarize.

1480
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:17,792
Like one of the worst things you can do
with one of your current family members

1481
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,563
is antagonize them because
then they isolate and they're gone.

1482
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,398
You're never finding them again.
Like they will.

1483
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:26,267
They will be lost to that thing
which will consume them.

1484
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:31,072
And this is and it's not just true
for, for, for, for fringe groups.

1485
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:32,474
It's it's true for a lot of groups.

1486
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:36,277
Where we're like
we rely on that community for survival.

1487
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:40,015
As we said, there's a lot of communities
out there who need to stay tight knit

1488
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:42,517
because it's beneficial
for them to be tight knit.

1489
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:46,788
So let's say we're like a city, right?

1490
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:49,991
And there's nothing wrong
inherently about being a city.

1491
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:53,828
And what you want to do
is to try to prevent a catastrophe.

1492
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:54,462
Right.

1493
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,098
But we can't

1494
01:23:57,098 --> 01:24:01,669
we can't all be researching the types
of catastrophe that might happen

1495
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:04,773
and like, someone's got to,
you know, make bread, right?

1496
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:08,777
So so you start having these people
who you can

1497
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:12,514
predict over time
that I don't have to think about this.

1498
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:14,816
I'm going to have to pay attention
to this scale

1499
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:17,585
because I'm paying attention to this.

1500
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:20,522
And I know that they can rely on that.

1501
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:24,826
So my model of the stable makes it
so that my role is super

1502
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:28,830
clear and allows for others
to make these predictions.

1503
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:29,330
Right.

1504
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:34,102
So I think I mean, it's
not fully, fully realized yet.

1505
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:37,072
And there's a lot of work to be done.

1506
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:40,575
So but I feel like,
you know, we have it's there.

1507
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:41,376
It's right there.

1508
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:44,612
Here's something

1509
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:47,348
that kind of makes me
think about like the city

1510
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:51,886
is enabled by specialization
and all these other features

1511
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:55,356
what are

1512
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,959
epistemic infrastructure projects

1513
01:24:58,993 --> 01:24:59,294
like?

1514
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:04,466
What are the thankless or thankful jobs

1515
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:07,669
that people do like moderation,

1516
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:11,406
governance, care for themselves
and for other participants?

1517
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:14,375
Like what are those infrastructure tier

1518
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:18,313
roles where it's like,
this is building the road?

1519
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:23,918
So we we have to contextualize
how well this shop does

1520
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:28,556
in light of the effort to build the road,
the community that contributed there.

1521
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:32,927
And so it kind of like opens up
the idea of attribution and community.

1522
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:35,430
And it's like very generative space

1523
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:41,002
yes. I feel like the

1524
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:43,138
it would be

1525
01:25:44,072 --> 01:25:45,673
would be difficult to say

1526
01:25:45,673 --> 01:25:49,711
that there is a very clear distinction
in any given infrastructure.

1527
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:50,311
Right? So like

1528
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,215
every

1529
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:56,551
field has

1530
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:59,787
people who innovate,
every field has people who

1531
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:03,691
just stay on tradition
and we feel has people who just provide

1532
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,995
like it's not it's not just like bakers
just provide right?

1533
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,863
There are people who innovated bread.

1534
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:12,934
There are people who think of new recipes
or think of new ways

1535
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:16,504
or try to bring the same recipes
to different parts of the world.

1536
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:20,241
So like it's
more distributed than that, but

1537
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:25,947
I really
I really do think that these structures

1538
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,349
kind of self emerge racial like

1539
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:32,987
we all kind of have it.

1540
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:35,190
Not necessarily I'm going
make that Brooklyn thing,

1541
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:39,561
but I do believe that there's
a natural instinct to

1542
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:43,131
to try something new.

1543
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:46,668
Once you have the certainty

1544
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:49,971
that shit
isn't going to fall under you, right?

1545
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:53,408
And because we have
this sort of distribution of like

1546
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:58,613
people who have more or less money
and people who have had past experiences

1547
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:01,916
of having more or less money,
they kind of tend to focus.

1548
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:05,653
And so it naturally sort of synchronizes
into,

1549
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:07,922
well,
you know what, I was poor my whole life.

1550
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:10,291
I want to be careful.

1551
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:12,260
I'm not going to go crazy.

1552
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:16,197
And that's why, you know, the fallacy
of the entrepreneur who had like nothing

1553
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:19,500
and he became something like that is
that is bull.

1554
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:24,072
Like, it is so easy to being entrepreneur
when you have barely anything to lose.

1555
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:29,043
You know, the notion of risk
in capitalism isn't true.

1556
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:34,282
You know, they can do it because to them
the risk is minimal.

1557
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:37,619
If I lose everything tomorrow,
I can do it again.

1558
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:40,154
So there isn't really a risk.

1559
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:45,760
Whereas if if little lady over there
who has like 20,000 in her bank account

1560
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:49,530
decides to put everything in a business
it's a real risk.

1561
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:51,232
It's a real risk.

1562
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:53,701
And I

1563
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:56,237
obviously she's less likely to do it

1564
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:59,540
because like what happens to her children
if she loses everything,

1565
01:27:59,540 --> 01:27:59,941
you know what I mean?

1566
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:05,947
And so there's going to naturally be
these tiers of people who because of the

1567
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,017
their states face.

1568
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:09,350
Right.

1569
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:15,089
So the probability of them continuing
accessing resources over time is is these

1570
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:17,191
less spread out

1571
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:20,895
they have to stay and concentrate
on this.

1572
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:24,299
And by virtue of doing this
they also keep producing

1573
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:30,104
value and resources
for people who tend to accrue this

1574
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:34,075
and thus have more leeway to, you know,
try it out.

1575
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,010
You know, I mean,

1576
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:38,313
there's a reason

1577
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,883
that it's so easy to go to university
when your parents are rich.

1578
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,920
Like, obviously,
if you if you parents have the means

1579
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,357
to support you you're going to try
and continue studying longer and longer.

1580
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:51,426
And it's much harder
if you have to support yourself.

1581
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:53,895
It's not impossible,
but it's so much harder.

1582
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:54,962
So anyway,

1583
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,666
so yeah, capitalism.

1584
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:01,669
Well, to connect it to active inference,

1585
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:06,107
you kind of brought up
the situational risk sensitivity

1586
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:09,744
and how that relates to someone's
experience and their situation.

1587
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:14,182
And then in active inference,
the policy selection

1588
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:18,686
for whether the binary decision
to go to this university

1589
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:22,590
or go to some other path
or a continuous policy,

1590
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:27,261
it's broken down into that pragmatic
or kind of outcome

1591
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:30,765
or goal reward orientation
as well as the epistemic.

1592
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:35,069
And so what happens when people

1593
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:39,440
don't have to have anxiety or find out

1594
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:43,311
epistemic about how they're going
to get pragmatic reward for their action

1595
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:45,747
and how

1596
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:48,383
does that move us beyond the sort of like

1597
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:52,653
web to engagement maximization

1598
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:57,225
relationship with platforms

1599
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:01,529
where there's a very specific generative
model, generative process relationship,

1600
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:04,232
and it's based around
like a behavioral summaries

1601
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:07,201
of the person's time spent on the site
or like their spending or something

1602
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:11,072
like that, versus
like taking the cognitive reins

1603
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:16,844
and saying we want to have lower anxiety
and we want people to be exposed

1604
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:21,048
to different perspectives
or some other preference for platforms

1605
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:24,118
that's specified
using an active inference framework.

1606
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,022
And there's a lot in there

1607
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,293
so I'm going to try to

1608
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,862
think of a think of

1609
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:37,732
the generative model, always like

1610
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:39,901
generative models aren't

1611
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:41,502
one scale, right?

1612
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:44,138
There is scales and scales
and scales and scales and scales.

1613
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:47,108
And what happens when you when you go
across scales is that you're on

1614
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:50,111
your states at one level becomes
the observation at the next level,

1615
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:53,047
and then it embeds an image,
it embeds OK,

1616
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:57,852
and then the embeddings can sort of
like again track into one another.

1617
01:30:57,852 --> 01:31:01,456
So I'm here and there's the bear.

1618
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:04,091
So I'm going to stop focusing on you,
which is a higher level.

1619
01:31:04,091 --> 01:31:05,960
I'm going to focus on directly
this right now,

1620
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,962
and there's the bear
and I'm going to focus on the bear

1621
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:09,697
but eventually the bear goes away
because, you know,

1622
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:14,702
I was having a hallucination
and suddenly I can go back to a higher

1623
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:18,272
level and start monitoring other things
and notice, OK, well, you know what?

1624
01:31:18,272 --> 01:31:19,540
This lasted a long time

1625
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,676
and maybe I should be cooking
because I'm going to get hungry.

1626
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:25,813
So I'm going to, you know, slowly
navigate the scales of where

1627
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:29,150
where I'm supposed to put attention
based on how

1628
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:32,854
the free energy is
is rising at a given point in this form.

1629
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:36,424
I'll say

1630
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:39,894
for the web or for monitoring

1631
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:44,432
or for resource attribution

1632
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:46,534
what am I really trying to do?

1633
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:49,070
What I'm trying to do
is to make sure that a person

1634
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:53,674
never has to feel
they're constantly putting out fires

1635
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:56,477
so anxiety, is that right?

1636
01:31:56,477 --> 01:32:01,082
Anxiety is the constant belief
that you're like teaching everywhere

1637
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:04,452
and you have to pay attention
to everything you're hypersensitive.

1638
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:06,754
So let's let's lower that.

1639
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:11,158
Let's let's feel like you can start
like giving a little bit more attention

1640
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:14,462
to a longer time frame
or even a shorter one.

1641
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:18,633
But just on the moment, because
like all of the parts of your model,

1642
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:21,168
I'm pretty certain
there's not going to be a foreigner.

1643
01:32:21,636 --> 01:32:24,438
So like I have certainty across

1644
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:27,942
all my scales and I'm going to start
paying attention to just this. No.

1645
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:32,246
And like, I don't need to,
you know, give too much my mouth

1646
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:34,749
how do you do this with monitoring?

1647
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:38,853
Well, with monitoring, you're like,
look, given this trajectory right now

1648
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:42,156
and given this personality type and given
like what we know already about her,

1649
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:44,825
she's going to freak out
in about 5 minutes about X,

1650
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:46,260
and I'm monitoring this.

1651
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,462
So before she freaked out, let's

1652
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:53,334
give a little reminder about this or like

1653
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:56,170
actually through iodine or whatever,
let's start

1654
01:32:56,170 --> 01:33:00,041
something like my dream is like
in the morning, I wake up,

1655
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:04,145
my breakfast is like started
like nobody starting it for me.

1656
01:33:04,378 --> 01:33:05,680
It's just starting.

1657
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:10,051
So, you know, I do my my health predict

1658
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:14,789
the kinds of things I'm likely to need
so that eventually I never, like,

1659
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:19,226
ever have to feel like I need to pay
attention to anything with too much like

1660
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:23,664
which one's uncertainty is going to rise
anywhere try and sort of question.

1661
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:25,733
Exactly. But I feel like
I'm going in that direction.

1662
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:28,669
There's the

1663
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:32,607
preparing your breakfast

1664
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:36,811
when you wake up and there's sort of
the cybernetics 1.0 version,

1665
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:39,747
which is we have a prediction
about what time you're going to wake up,

1666
01:33:39,747 --> 01:33:42,817
and then we're just going to do it
like setting the thermostat.

1667
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,653
We're going to just prepare it for it
to be ready at this time.

1668
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:48,889
And this is kind of taking that

1669
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:53,661
physical biofeedback layer
to another level.

1670
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:58,299
But also, what should we epistemic
we forage for in the morning?

1671
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:03,337
How do we experience that sleep
wake transition

1672
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:08,242
in a way where like we wake up
and sort of like sharpen

1673
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:12,780
or become more vigilant
and focus on the things that matter

1674
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:15,416
and that have impact
and at the end of the day, sort of

1675
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,819
have some unwind

1676
01:34:18,819 --> 01:34:23,491
or some sort of relaxing process
so that we can move into a healthy sleep.

1677
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:26,260
There was a

1678
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:30,164
there was this like, I'm
watching a lot of YouTube lately

1679
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:33,200
and what's YouTube

1680
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:35,469
it's like

1681
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:41,142
there's this one dude who tried
to replicate a Billionaire Morning.

1682
01:34:41,242 --> 01:34:41,776
Right?

1683
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:46,013
It was it was striking with
the billionaire does in the morning

1684
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:50,184
in which is basically like, I'm going,
I'm doing all this shit to make my body

1685
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,786
feel better and all great.

1686
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:57,191
And then he did this stuff
to think about who he wanted to be today

1687
01:34:57,191 --> 01:35:00,661
and what kind of qualities
he wanted to embody.

1688
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:01,796
And it's like,

1689
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:05,733
yeah,
I got to think about not missing my bus

1690
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:09,570
or whether I'm going to freeze my ass
outside or whether I might get fired

1691
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:11,105
if I get late. Like,
do you see what I mean?

1692
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:15,443
Like, my concerns, my direct
epistemic concerns in the morning,

1693
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:16,644
vastly different

1694
01:35:16,644 --> 01:35:20,748
from what that do have to care about
because everything that I'm talking about

1695
01:35:20,748 --> 01:35:24,752
is certain about like he has no qualm
about it does not care. Like

1696
01:35:25,686 --> 01:35:29,657
so how might one sort of shift this?

1697
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:30,424
Well,

1698
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:33,127
I feel like there could be structures
that we could put in place

1699
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:35,830
in order for someone to not feel like
they have to feel that.

1700
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:37,398
But also

1701
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:39,967
maybe a focus.

1702
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:43,938
I know it seems hard to say,
but maybe a focus on the things

1703
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:47,641
that he has to focus on
would potentially limit

1704
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:49,643
the sort of

1705
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:51,846
you know,

1706
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:54,515
constant

1707
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:57,051
need to feel like
you need to put out fires.

1708
01:35:58,252 --> 01:36:01,956
So let's say that I'm a I'm
a smart interface and I'm like, well,

1709
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:03,157
this person

1710
01:36:03,157 --> 01:36:06,927
needs to be certain about these things
because their life has X constraints.

1711
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:10,798
Well, maybe we're going to do
is give you X reports and look,

1712
01:36:10,998 --> 01:36:12,833
you don't need to worry about it.
It's there.

1713
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:13,834
You have that information.

1714
01:36:13,834 --> 01:36:17,471
Now, what about you try to think about
things that are longer scale.

1715
01:36:17,505 --> 01:36:17,972
What about you

1716
01:36:17,972 --> 01:36:21,709
tried to think about things that
if you had nothing else to care about,

1717
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:23,110
you'd start thinking about.

1718
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:26,013
So, you know,
maybe these are the sort of epistemic

1719
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:31,352
foraging that would lead people
to a slightly more peaceful life.

1720
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:33,254
But maybe I'm
coming from a very privileged base

1721
01:36:33,254 --> 01:36:36,090
and maybe this is completely unrealistic.
So you'd have to ask people who

1722
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,126
are much less privileged.

1723
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:41,529
I have a different view
on this on this question.

1724
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:47,668
Awesome points

1725
01:36:48,602 --> 01:36:51,071
just in our last few minutes, like

1726
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:55,276
what are you going to continue
to work on or what are you excited about?

1727
01:36:55,276 --> 01:36:58,179
Or What do you want to talk about or ask
anything you want?

1728
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,115
Well, I mean, you didn't
you mentioned your paper.

1729
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:03,751
We never got to it with time or.

1730
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:05,119
Sure.

1731
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:08,756
So with a handful of coauthors,

1732
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:11,325
we wrote a paper about

1733
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,129
using active inference to study

1734
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:18,632
specifically
the epistemic community of science.

1735
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:22,169
And so we as a group read and shared

1736
01:37:22,803 --> 01:37:25,539
your paper on epistemic communities

1737
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:30,077
and then took the idea
of like this epistemic entity.

1738
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:34,381
And now we've seen act of inference
entities be at different scales.

1739
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:39,253
That's several years
and many like different things

1740
01:37:39,253 --> 01:37:42,056
we've talked about there,
including the narrative scale.

1741
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:46,594
And so we thought, well,
how could we model

1742
01:37:46,794 --> 01:37:49,663
the scientific epistemic ecosystem?

1743
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:55,502
How could we do a systems description
of the scientific ecosystem?

1744
01:37:55,736 --> 01:38:00,841
So like the entities, like the person,
but also the lab, the university,

1745
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:04,712
the Dow, in the case of
decentralized science, are like web three

1746
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:08,349
or open science
how do we model the active entities

1747
01:38:09,016 --> 01:38:13,053
and for the active entities,
eventually flesh out

1748
01:38:13,053 --> 01:38:16,290
a cognitive model
like you've presented today,

1749
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:18,926
but also include

1750
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:23,230
the informational entities
which map not onto the adaptive active

1751
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:27,601
inference agents,
but the mere active inference agents.

1752
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:32,539
So we can still model
the paper as like an entity,

1753
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:36,577
but it doesn't have any policy selection
that it can engage in where

1754
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:39,747
or like a code
can engage in limited policy selection

1755
01:38:40,414 --> 01:38:42,349
when it's used by computer system.

1756
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:43,651
And so the goal was to

1757
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:45,753
develop

1758
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:51,458
an ontology, the IOS, the Active Entity
Ontology for Science that would be able

1759
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:55,229
to link up natural language descriptions

1760
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:58,866
like I sent a message to my friend,

1761
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,603
person friend sent a message.

1762
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:07,007
So have the natural language
representation in with the graphical

1763
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:10,110
flowchart representation
kind of like a social network

1764
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:14,281
of different kinds of entities,
including the informational ones,

1765
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:17,651
and then be able to connect
that to a simulation architecture.

1766
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:25,159
But so sorry you cut off those.

1767
01:39:25,793 --> 01:39:26,927
Oh. So OK.

1768
01:39:26,927 --> 01:39:30,764
So you were going to try
and simulate agents using your ontology.

1769
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:32,499
So basically

1770
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:36,870
so the first AOS paper from last week,

1771
01:39:37,404 --> 01:39:41,342
we focused a little bit
more on the conceptual

1772
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:44,878
and the history of decentralized sense
making

1773
01:39:45,512 --> 01:39:50,250
and history of science
and an introduction to Web three and deci

1774
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:54,922
decentralized science
and then sort of our ongoing work

1775
01:39:54,922 --> 01:39:57,992
and collaborations are to go

1776
01:39:57,992 --> 01:40:03,030
from the flowcharts that we kind
of sketched out in some of the figures,

1777
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,300
like a funding motif or an information
sharing

1778
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:09,136
motif or a communications motif

1779
01:40:09,703 --> 01:40:11,972
into a simulation

1780
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:15,275
that uses
the active inference entity model

1781
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:17,878
you out.

1782
01:40:17,878 --> 01:40:20,781
You're willing to talk to Maxwell
about this like he's been trying

1783
01:40:20,781 --> 01:40:23,851
to think about how communities

1784
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:26,920
react to active inference specifically.

1785
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:28,856
And this this makes me feel

1786
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:30,524
this makes me think of like Atlas
Shrugged,

1787
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:33,761
like how there's this, like, core
and then people test out the,

1788
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,163
the external hypotheses
until they reach the core

1789
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:38,298
or if they don't read the core
and expands.

1790
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:41,502
So there's something really cool there.

1791
01:40:41,969 --> 01:40:44,471
I can't wait to see more of this work.

1792
01:40:46,407 --> 01:40:47,608
Awesome.

1793
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:47,941
Yeah.

1794
01:40:47,941 --> 01:40:50,911
I hope that we can continue

1795
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:54,615
strangely attracting and intertwining
and including

1796
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:58,719
just collaborators from different
backgrounds in the discussion,

1797
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:03,223
as some people who are listening
might be hearing about active inference

1798
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:06,593
for the first time
and might be connecting

1799
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:09,263
with like a community in US

1800
01:41:09,997 --> 01:41:12,800
that likes to do this
kind of modeling and framing.

1801
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,435
And also there's people

1802
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:17,438
who might be more familiar
with the active inference modeling

1803
01:41:17,438 --> 01:41:20,941
and hopefully this like brought
their attention to a really important

1804
01:41:21,442 --> 01:41:26,213
and contemporary case
and of course excellent recent research

1805
01:41:28,982 --> 01:41:30,551
yes. Was doing

1806
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:32,686
interdisciplinary research for the win.

1807
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:36,590
Or anything else you want to add.

1808
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:40,227
On know we've covered a lot of ground.

1809
01:41:40,227 --> 01:41:41,095
I know, I know.

1810
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:45,599
Seriously, the time goes fast,
so thanks a ton for joining.

1811
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:47,634
So you're out

1812
01:41:49,236 --> 01:41:52,172
bye bye.

1813
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:55,175
Bye bye,

1814
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:58,145
bye bye.

1815
01:41:58,145 --> 01:42:01,115
Bye bye.

1816
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:02,883
Bye bye.
