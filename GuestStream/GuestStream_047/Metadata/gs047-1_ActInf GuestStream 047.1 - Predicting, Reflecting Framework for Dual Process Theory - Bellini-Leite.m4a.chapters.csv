37606	1030760	00:37	Professor Conan Frederick is a psychologist philosopher working in cognitive science. He talks about how dual process theory came to be and then some problems that it has that he tries to address. How do we know about human reasoning? It's more interesting to show how humans reason.	So how do we know about human reasoning, which is the subject	Dual-process theory
1031260	1796390	17:11	The literature abandoned classical cognitive science in various ways. But there must be at least something wrong about, something right about this shouldn't be totally abandoned. We have a limited capacity when we use conscious processing or working memory. This is something we should not simply ignore.	Photer argued that we had two types of processes, modular and central	Cognitive Science and the Problem of Classical AI
1798840	2589326	29:58	I tried to invert that power structure by saying that the contextual, predictive processing is a type one reasoning. We only use type two reasoning to fix some minor issues in predictive processing. The idea is that perception is not passive but already comes with predictions.	Simon Newman: Shift in power structure of dual process theory was major thesis problem	Dual Process Theory: The Shift Power Structure
2589438	2854982	43:09	You can have also explanations for automaticity in contrast to working memory. The brain attempts to minimize free energy by getting predictions right. When there are a lot of prediction error, then you need effort. Reports of effort would be related to executing more heuristic searches.	You can have also explanations for automaticity in contrast to working memory	Predictive Processing and Active Inference
2855036	3733120	47:35	Working memory is a widely research topic in psychology, but in predictive processing it's rarely, rarely mentioned. It's actually an issue for predictive processing because well, if you're going to eliminate classical symbolic processing altogether, then we need a predictive processing explanation of working memory.	Working memory is a widely researched topic in psychology but in predictive processing it's rarely mentioned	Predictive Processing and Working Memory
3734660	3940790	1:02:14	Nick Sand: Maybe we could suggest something from psychology for these models to keep growing. executive functioning have these updating abilities in intelligent forgetting. There's also work on thinking dispositions, which could be relevant. And finally, I think the embodiment, you don't have robots or anything like that that do this sort of reasoning.	Sand: Maybe we could suggest something from psychology for these models to keep growing	Inspiring creativity: a psychology perspective
3942200	4140450	1:05:42	Nick Bird: I'm at the Stevens Institute of Technology in the New York City metropolitan area. He says he's also interested in human reasoning. How can we help large language models do the same? Bird: Using chain of thought and tree of thought models to kind of create a reflective system within the models seems valuable.	Nick Bird: Samuel's talk on large language models is very interesting	Cognitive Science and Large Language Models
4140820	4633940	1:09:00	Daniel: I wonder if there's a sense in which both types of responses are somewhat context dependent. And then maybe, Samuel, you can kind of say what you think I should think or clarify the view of the predictive and reflective framework.	Daniel: Both type one and type two reasoning are context dependent	Does Type 1 and 2 Reasoning be Context-dependent?
4641270	5269370	1:17:21	Nick Gillespie: What do you think the epistemological consequences are of taking predictive processing the way that you have approached it here versus alternative or prior approaches to cognitive sciences? He says it could help us think further on on AI. Gillespie: Could save dual process theory from criticism.	Nick: I'm unaware of the working memory research from predictive processing	Predictive Processing and Working Memory
5269870	6052370	1:27:49	As soon as GPT Four was available to be studied and used on these models, it was like performing basically near perfect. How do you think they did this? Obviously we have to speculate because a lot of the data is proprietary.	The AI on Open AI performs near perfect on cognitive reflection tests	Can a Chat Bot Understand?
6052450	6169530	1:40:52	Are you familiar with visual pathways in the human brain? Specifically the dorsal where and ventral. What pathways do you think this maps onto the two systems you describe for problem solving? If we extend it to the whole brain, we lose what we've learned.	Glia maximalist asks: Are you familiar with visual pathways in the human brain	Dual-process theory in the brain
6174290	6253700	1:42:54	Nick: I'm just sad I couldn't go much beyond what I said on the presentation. Most of the stuff you guys asked, I'm not sure I have good answers for that. Basically, what I've done is all I know, and maybe someone in the audience will do. All right, till next time.	Nick: Sam, any closing thoughts? Yeah, I'm just sad	A talk on the science of neuroscience
