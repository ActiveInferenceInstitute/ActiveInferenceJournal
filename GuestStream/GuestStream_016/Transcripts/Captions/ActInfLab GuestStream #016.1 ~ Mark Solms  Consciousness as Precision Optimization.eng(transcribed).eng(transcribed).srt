1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,480
all right

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,360
hello everyone welcome to actin flab

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,080
guest stream number 16.1

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,359
with mark solms it's january 22nd 2022.

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
it's gonna be an awesome discussion we

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,039
really appreciate everyone taking the

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,800
time out to participate in the live

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,439
stream and in the discussion

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,080
we're going to have some intermittent

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,960
presentation intervals by professor

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,680
solms and uh also a period for

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,760
discussion

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,399
alternating with that so we'll each just

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,480
introduce ourselves and then pass it

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,800
directly to the presentation section so

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,559
i'm daniel i'm a researcher in

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,320
california and i'll pass to dave

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,559
i'm dave i'm a software developer and

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
student of psychology i live 200

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,280
kilometers north of manila

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,040
hello i'm stephen i'm based in toronto

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
canada

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,439
and i'm doing a practice-based phd

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,880
around

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,360
social topographies and how people

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,880
engage in community development and

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,119
i'll pass it over to mark now welcome

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
thanks very much

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
so what i propose to do is to

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,960
in a moment i'll share my screen and

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,439
you'll see my slides

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,079
um i'm going to start with the summary

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,799
slide of all the points that

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,680
i

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
propose to cover

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,079
and then i'll take them one by one each

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,439
of those points

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,159
and

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
at the end of each of them i'll stop and

40
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,399
see if anyone wants to comment or ask a

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,640
question and then we slowly plow through

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,960
it like that we've got two hours

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,680
so

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,479
it should be okay but if worse comes to

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,119
worst and we don't get to the end of the

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,719
list of topics

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,240
we will arrange a follow-up meeting to

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,119
to conclude to conclude them

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,038
so i'm very glad to be here thanks for

50
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,720
inviting me and i'm really looking

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,360
forward to this discussion

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,879
here come my slides

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,839
um

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,760
on the screen is the title of my book

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,519
um

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,920
and here is the promised summary of what

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,760
i'm going to cover

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,080
as i said uh i'll i'll cover each of

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,920
these points in turn

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,040
and uh if we don't and then we'll have

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,720
questions and comments

62
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,920
in between

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,680
and if we don't get to the end that's

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,319
fine let's rather let's rather give each

65
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,280
one of the topics the time that it needs

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,959
so i start with the

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
with the um

68
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,920
assertion

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
that affect is the foundational form of

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
consciousness

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,720
and that affect is intrinsically

72
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
conscious

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,680
i then move to

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
make the point that that claim that

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
affect is intrinsically conscious in

76
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,879
other words that you can't have a

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
feeling that you don't feel

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,959
that this is not based on semantic

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,280
arguments but rather on empirical

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
evidence

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,879
and i will summarize the evidence

82
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,879
i'll then make

83
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,040
the point that affect is not synonymous

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
with interceptive inference which is

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,400
widely believed these days

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,879
and i'll tell you why that matters when

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,959
i get there

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,120
and then i'll move on to

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,560
making the point that all of this casts

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,799
new light on the hard problem

91
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,680
particularly if affect is not just an

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,239
intraceptive form of perception because

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,480
there are lots of problems

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,319
about perception

95
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,519
that

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,439
have got us into this heart problem in

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,680
the first place

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,159
i'll argue that affect rather than being

99
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
intraceptive inference that it's an

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,360
extended form of homeostasis

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
i'll tell you what that what i mean by

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
that when we get there and i'll make the

103
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,279
point that complex organisms like

104
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,238
ourselves require multiple homeostats

105
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,240
and that these are to be treated as

106
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,199
categorical variables which matters

107
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,440
and that these variables must be

108
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
prioritized one can't meet all one's

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,919
needs simultaneously

110
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
i'll then uh this is an a large point

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,440
this one is a large point the the the

112
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,400
empirical evidence about affect and this

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,120
one is another large point the mechanism

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,639
of perceptual and cognitive

115
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,520
consciousness is precision modulation of

116
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
allostatic prediction errors

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,000
that's a big claim and so we must spend

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,759
some time on it

119
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,800
i'll then

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,199
talk about the nature of the predictive

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,680
hierarchy i seem to see it a little

122
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,639
differently from most people so i want

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,600
to set out my stall on that score

124
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,000
and explain why i think the predictive

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,880
hierarchy is arranged concentrically

126
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,160
and that this

127
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,360
with

128
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,520
as one moves toward the periphery of the

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,880
hierarchy

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,440
there's progressively increasing

131
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,479
tolerance of uncertainty

132
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,919
and then lastly

133
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,639
i'll say a word or two about why i think

134
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,639
that consciousness can be artificially

135
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,400
engineered

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,320
so even if we don't get to the end of

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,360
all of these topics one way or another

138
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,520
even if we're the second meeting those

139
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
are the topics we will cover

140
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
and we'll see how far we get tonight and

141
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
at least you know what the over what the

142
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,560
overall when i say tonight i'm in berlin

143
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,600
i know it's morning for some of you

144
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,240
but at least you get the overall picture

145
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
from that slide so let's start with

146
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,960
affect is the foundational form of

147
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,199
consciousness and it's intrinsically

148
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,360
conscious

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,520
uh the discoverer

150
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,319
of the unconscious i quote him uh

151
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,360
because freud more than anybody wanted

152
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,639
us to

153
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
realize just how much of mental life is

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
unconscious

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,880
even freud said that it is surely of the

156
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,280
essence of an emotion that we should be

157
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,639
aware of it

158
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,120
that is that it should become known to

159
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
consciousness

160
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,360
thus the possibility of the attribute of

161
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,680
unconsciousness would be completely

162
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
excluded

163
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,080
as far as emotions feelings and affects

164
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
are concerned it's quite a startling

165
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
statement

166
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,479
from as i said the discoverer of the

167
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,720
unconscious to say that the possibility

168
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,039
of the attribute of unconsciousness

169
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,440
would be completely excluded as far as

170
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,680
emotions feelings and affects are

171
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,880
concerned

172
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,840
now i know this is a controversial

173
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
issue

174
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,120
and that there are all sorts of ways in

175
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,960
which people want to argue that there

176
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,759
are such things as unconscious emotions

177
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,039
and what not

178
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,039
um and this has partly to do with the

179
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,639
fact that different people mean

180
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,360
different things by these words

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
uh emotions affects and so on

182
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,639
um and it has

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,919
there are also all kinds of

184
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,840
methodological um

185
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,440
operationalizations of these things

186
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,160
uh i won't go into all of that i'm happy

187
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,639
to if any of you want to discuss it but

188
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,680
i've i've emphasized the word feelings

189
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
to make clear that

190
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,639
um

191
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,880
if anyone wants to argue that

192
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
they think that the word emotion

193
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,599
can apply to unconscious processes or

194
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,000
affects can apply to unconscious

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,360
processes

196
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
that's fine by me

197
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,919
but the word feelings i don't see how

198
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,879
you can ever argue that feelings can be

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,160
unconscious

200
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,479
it just doesn't make any sense that a

201
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,400
feeling

202
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,720
could exist without being felt if it

203
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,520
were not felt it would not be a feeling

204
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,759
and so i'm going to focus

205
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,720
everything that i'm going to say on this

206
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
process this this thing

207
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,919
this this mental state

208
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,919
called feelings

209
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,879
and i'm arguing that feelings

210
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,479
are the foundational form of

211
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
consciousness and that these this form

212
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,759
of consciousness is intrinsically

213
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,440
conscious

214
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,240
um

215
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
so

216
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
that's as a sort of a dogmatic statement

217
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,760
i'm not sure if anyone wants to discuss

218
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,799
that

219
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,360
perhaps you want to hold your horses

220
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,680
but that's the end of my first

221
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
point

222
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,720
so anyone who wants to interrupt here

223
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,959
go ahead otherwise i'll move on

224
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,480
thanks for the

225
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
digestible claim-based format my

226
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,600
question would be what else has been

227
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,839
posited in your view

228
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,240
as a foundational form of consciousness

229
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,519
so what are the counter factuals for

230
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
that first claim what other horses are

231
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,680
in the race

232
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,560
um

233
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,440
the

234
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,640
reason i focus on effort um well i

235
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
shouldn't say the reason i focus on

236
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
effort because that's not quite what

237
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
you're asking you're asking what are the

238
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
other horses in the race so let me say

239
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,720
that the whole

240
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,279
search for a neural correlate of

241
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,040
consciousness which is in a way where

242
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
the trouble began

243
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,920
um

244
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,480
with with francis crick

245
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
it was focused on visual perception

246
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,839
and they're good reasons to focus on

247
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,360
visual perception

248
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,640
uh

249
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,959
mainly because if you

250
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,200
take a look at your you'll excuse the

251
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,120
pun take a look at your consciousness

252
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
right now

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,480
it's probably dominated by visual

254
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
perception uh visual qualia predominates

255
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,320
in our consciousness

256
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
and

257
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
a very large part of our cortex is given

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,120
over to visual processing

259
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
and

260
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,360
everybody's always believed that cortex

261
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,279
is where it's at when it comes to

262
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,200
consciousness and

263
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
we also understand a very great deal

264
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,640
about

265
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
visual cortical mechanisms and visual

266
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,959
mechanisms all together so that was a

267
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,440
perfectly reasonable place to start so

268
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
that's the other main horse that's in

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
the race but vision was thought to be a

270
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,519
good model example not because it is the

271
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,920
totality of consciousness but because it

272
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,079
was assumed that if we can crack the

273
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,000
problem of how visual consciousness

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,240
arises then we can generalize our

275
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,800
conclusions to other forms

276
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,040
and i'm going to argue that there's

277
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,160
something

278
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
profoundly different about visual

279
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
consciousness and affect of

280
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
consciousness

281
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,079
and moreover

282
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,519
that there's something profoundly

283
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,279
different about

284
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,000
cortical consciousness

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,480
and the brain stem mechanisms which

286
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
is

287
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,000
where affect of consciousness arises and

288
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
i know that i'm saying that

289
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
boldly now and i'm about to argue that

290
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,040
point uh

291
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,200
in the second of the of the bullet

292
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160
points uh on the screen uh affect of

293
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,720
consciousness is not a cortical form of

294
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,279
consciousness it's a brainstem form and

295
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,360
that the cortical form of consciousness

296
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
is contingent upon the brain stem form

297
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,680
and

298
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,800
this is this is one of the main reasons

299
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
apart from evolutionary reasons which

300
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,360
sort of interdigitate with and flow from

301
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
that from that anatomical localization

302
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,959
um why i think that affect is the

303
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,600
foundational form so it's really vision

304
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,720
that i'm using as my account my kind of

305
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
foil

306
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,200
to answer the question simply

307
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,680
stephen

308
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,120
one question with feelings is

309
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,360
would you say that feelings are

310
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,920
integrated with proprioception in the

311
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,839
sense that they um are felt sense

312
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,000
of where the body is as well so it

313
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
brings it into kind of an

314
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,519
action-orientated domain

315
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,639
or

316
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,279
is it enough to have um

317
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,839
sort of a sense of how things are going

318
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,560
sort of an overview of just an emotional

319
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,760
state

320
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
and and then whether those two

321
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,040
connecting some way

322
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,079
um

323
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,880
as i'm going to argue when i get to my

324
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,480
third point

325
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,000
i don't think that affect is synonymous

326
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,120
with intraceptive inference altogether

327
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,399
interceptive perception altogether um

328
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,959
and i don't know some people would

329
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
would class proprioception with

330
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,240
interreception uh some people would not

331
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,480
some people would say it's a sort of a

332
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
it's a sort of a hybrid

333
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,760
between intercepted and extraceptive

334
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,200
perception

335
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,519
but to the extent that by the word

336
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,600
proprioception you're referring to a

337
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,440
form of perception

338
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,200
i would disagree with that because i

339
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
don't think that affect is a form of

340
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,839
perception i think that proprioception

341
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,519
follows um

342
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,760
if if by proprioception you mean what

343
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,920
what neurologists normally mean by that

344
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
word it's it's a it's it's part of the

345
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,120
broader category of somatic sensation

346
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,000
um

347
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
and

348
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,440
therefore uh uh that does not uh qualify

349
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,760
uh i think as affective

350
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,560
um

351
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,120
because as i say i'm going to argue that

352
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,920
affect is not a form of perception

353
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,199
there there

354
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,399
i draw a distinction uh as do you know i

355
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,360
think it's it's perfectly uh um

356
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,839
fine to draw a distinction between

357
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,320
extraceptive bodily sensations and

358
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
interceptive bodily sensations but i

359
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,399
think that the interceptive type

360
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,560
is is is nothing other than perception

361
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,040
and not intrinsically different

362
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
so even if you think of proprioception

363
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
as straddling those two domains i still

364
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,959
think that it's a modality of perception

365
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,760
and suffers from all the same problems

366
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
as vision for that reason

367
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,399
i see we have a comment in the chat line

368
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,480
i'm not sure how how we're going to deal

369
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,959
with that if one of yous

370
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,120
i'll read this it was a question in the

371
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,600
live chat from ingrid they wrote

372
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,480
what differentiates affect from feeling

373
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,079
from your perspective

374
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,720
is affect conscious or pre-conscious

375
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,120
thank you

376
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,880
um you know

377
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
this is uh

378
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,279
a perennial problem

379
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,760
we don't all mean the same thing by

380
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
these terms

381
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,519
so that's why

382
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,720
i've focused on the word feeling because

383
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
there can be little doubt what feeling

384
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,839
denotes it denotes something you feel in

385
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,839
other words something that you are

386
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,360
necessarily aware of

387
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
if you were not aware of it you it

388
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,199
wouldn't be called a feeling because you

389
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,040
wouldn't feel it

390
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,399
um

391
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,440
affects and emotions denote many

392
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,560
different things to different people

393
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,440
so

394
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,839
when you ask me is affect pre-conscious

395
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
or conscious and so on it depends what

396
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,120
you mean by affect um to my mind and i

397
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,320
can only say um you know

398
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,320
just make clear how i use these words uh

399
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,560
i use the word feeling

400
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,279
to denote the subjective experience of

401
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,720
affect uh affect is a kind of abstract

402
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,800
term for a function

403
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,839
that we feel um but that doesn't mean

404
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,519
that you all have to use the word in the

405
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,920
same way and it's precisely in order to

406
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,639
not get lost in this kind of semantic

407
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,000
tangle uh that i'm focusing on the word

408
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,120
feeling

409
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,959
and i'll make clear

410
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
in the very point that i'm moving to

411
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
next uh what i mean by feeling in terms

412
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,399
of its um

413
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,800
it's it's physiological and anatomical

414
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,720
and other objective

415
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,759
um

416
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,759
instantiations

417
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
excellent stephen you you have your hand

418
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,560
up

419
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,839
probably just didn't oh is that your

420
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,199
previous hand

421
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,399
so just

422
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,120
go to the second point okay

423
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,680
very good so the second point is

424
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,560
as you saw we've just been talking about

425
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,800
the meaning of the words

426
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,079
um and i've i've um staked my claim

427
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,320
for the word feeling

428
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,079
to make clear that that's what i mean

429
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,720
when i say that affect is intrinsically

430
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,440
conscious i mean that it is necessarily

431
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,399
felt

432
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,360
um i'm also saying it's the foundational

433
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,439
form of consciousness that doesn't flow

434
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,039
from the word

435
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,599
except perhaps from the word in the

436
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,839
sense that the way that nagel and

437
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,959
chalmers

438
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,280
define consciousness and many people

439
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
seem to have sort of

440
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,240
agreed with this way of defining it that

441
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,559
there is something it is like to be

442
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,119
conscious that that this something it is

443
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,880
likeness

444
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,679
it

445
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,919
seems to be more or less the same thing

446
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,400
as feeling it seems to mean the same

447
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,559
thing but feeling in a rather broader

448
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,840
sense of the word than affective feeling

449
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
so i want to be clear now

450
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,559
why other than those other than those

451
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,200
linguistic or semantic points

452
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,600
why i'm making this claim

453
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,000
about feeling it's not by any means

454
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
based in the semantics that you have to

455
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,120
feel a feeling i i want to be clear

456
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,039
why i think

457
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,880
that this is the foundational form of

458
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
consciousness

459
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,280
we've we've all known since

460
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,840
1948

461
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,919
when there was this big surprise that

462
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,240
magoon and mirzi found

463
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,799
that all consciousness is contingent

464
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,480
upon what we subsequently called

465
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
reticular activating arousal in other

466
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,000
words upon the something that's

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
contributed by

468
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,799
these core brain stem structures

469
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,280
which after magoon and maritz's work

470
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
came to be known as the reticular

471
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
activating system

472
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
i want to be clear i'm

473
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,679
not only talking about the reticular

474
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,640
activating system but also about the

475
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,720
periaqueductal gray which is not

476
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
technically part of the reticular

477
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,080
activating system but it is part of

478
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,880
the brain structures

479
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,080
which seem to be fundamental

480
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,280
to the generating of consciousness

481
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,919
um the what magoon and marutzi showed

482
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,240
among other things what was that if you

483
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
make a small lesion above the reticular

484
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,120
activating system thereby severing it

485
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
disconnecting it from the forebrain and

486
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
from the cortex

487
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,520
in particular

488
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
then consciousness

489
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,000
is obliterated entirely

490
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,280
consciousness is 100

491
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,600
dependent upon brain stem arousal

492
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,679
that was a shock

493
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,760
and a shock that i don't think

494
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,559
we have fully come to terms with even

495
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,880
all these years later

496
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
it should have led us to realize that

497
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
we've been looking in the wrong place uh

498
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,480
for

499
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,559
the neural correlate of consciousness if

500
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,919
we're looking to cortex because it's

501
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,799
plain even from just that study

502
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,120
performed in 1948

503
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,280
that cortical consciousness

504
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,679
is derived from elsewhere cortical

505
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,480
conscious consciousness cannot

506
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,840
occur

507
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,600
in the absence of reticular

508
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
arousal

509
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,880
but

510
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,720
the way that magoon and maruzi

511
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,600
fudged it was to say

512
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,840
and everyone more or less

513
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,039
in their wake has said the same

514
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,039
that it turns out they're two kinds of

515
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,559
consciousness

516
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,360
there's the brainstem kind uh which we

517
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
call wakefulness

518
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,240
or the level of consciousness

519
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,679
um and then there's the cortical kind

520
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,240
which we call awareness

521
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,840
or the phenomenal um

522
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,400
contents of consciousness

523
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
so this distinction between a

524
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,200
quantitative level contributed by the

525
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,720
brain stem and qualitative contents

526
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,360
contributed by the cortex

527
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,159
is

528
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,559
the way in which we save the cortical

529
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,120
theory of consciousness

530
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
following magoon and lewis's

531
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
seminal observations in case you're

532
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,880
wondering what this refers to uh it

533
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,840
refers to a more recent study by fisher

534
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
and colleagues which showed that the

535
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,360
smallest lesion necessary to produce

536
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,280
coma in human beings is a two cubic

537
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,960
millimeter

538
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,200
lesion in other words a lesion the size

539
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
of a match head

540
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,039
in the parabrachial complex

541
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,919
so there's no doubt on the basis of

542
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,919
magoon and meruzi studies all those

543
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,799
years ago and on the basis of these

544
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,120
much more recent observations

545
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,159
that

546
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,120
that consciousness cannot exist without

547
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,799
whatever it is that this part of the

548
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,679
brain contributes this this primitive

549
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,720
brainstem call

550
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,280
but this

551
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,480
idea that it's merely a

552
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,960
a level or a or a quantitative dimension

553
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,039
of consciousness is what

554
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,640
i i think is unsustainable

555
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,240
and i'm going to very quickly because

556
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,679
i'm sure many of you have heard me

557
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,200
talking about this before i going to

558
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,840
very quickly whiz through the evidence

559
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,200
for why

560
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,440
this this

561
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000
notion that the brain stem contributes

562
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,960
only a quantitative level a sort of a

563
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,760
wakeful prerequisite uh for

564
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,480
consciousness uh rather than

565
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,880
equality and the content

566
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,039
um but i want to before i do that to

567
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,200
just give you a clear picture

568
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,159
of what is meant by this distinction um

569
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,640
the the the distinction uh is is is

570
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,080
analogous to

571
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,240
uh the difference between a television

572
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,720
set and its power supply

573
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,200
uh the idea that the cortex is

574
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,039
responsible for the contents and

575
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,960
qualities of consciousness for

576
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
phenomenal consciousness the real stuff

577
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,919
the real failure of consciousness where

578
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,640
the

579
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,240
the thing that all the arguments are

580
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,200
about

581
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,760
um it's that this is like the television

582
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,960
set

583
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
and it has to be plugged in

584
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,000
uh of course you can't a television set

585
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,240
can't do its television thing

586
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,720
unless it's powered up uh

587
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,600
but

588
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,320
to claim therefore that the real source

589
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
of television and and all that that word

590
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,080
represents uh is the power supply the

591
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,679
electrical uh source uh in the wall uh

592
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,360
is ludicrous

593
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
and and that's pretty much how we've all

594
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,159
seen until very recently how we've all

595
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,240
seen what the brain stem contributes to

596
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,799
consciousness so nobody's doubting that

597
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,240
it's necessary that it's prerequisite uh

598
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,400
that that without it you can't have

599
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,120
cortical consciousness but it's been

600
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
it's been uh

601
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
reduced to a mere power supply something

602
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,360
which is not actually consciousness

603
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,960
itself in the sense that that we're all

604
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,000
arguing

605
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,279
about

606
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,080
so why do i think that that's not

607
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,039
correct

608
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,640
well uh

609
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,159
i'll start with the most dramatic

610
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
evidence which is patients who have no

611
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
cortex

612
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,039
if the theory that the cortex is

613
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,400
necessary for the contents and qualities

614
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,080
of consciousness

615
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,039
then

616
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,120
patients without cortex should be in a

617
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,159
coma

618
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,640
or at the very least if we claim that

619
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,720
the brain stem produces nothing other

620
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,960
than the sort of background level

621
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,919
then

622
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,640
patients with no cortex should have some

623
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,440
kind of blank wakefulness

624
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,240
i suppose the closest uh

625
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,600
natural

626
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,120
kind of thing

627
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,159
that tallies with blank wakefulness

628
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,279
is the

629
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,200
vegetative state

630
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,080
which is also called non-responsive

631
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,840
wakefulness in other words there's

632
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,559
wakefulness without anybody being there

633
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,400
without it there being anything it is

634
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
like

635
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,720
for

636
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,080
the

637
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,080
organism that has blank wakefulness uh

638
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,559
due to the absence of cortex but when

639
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,679
you look

640
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,960
at cases who who have no cortex and

641
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
here's the scan of a girl

642
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
with hydrant encephali born with no

643
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,360
cortex

644
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,320
and you

645
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,960
examine the girl herself you see that

646
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,279
she's not only conscious in other words

647
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,840
not in a coma she's conscious in the

648
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
sense that she wakes up in the morning

649
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,840
goes to sleep at night

650
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,919
but more interestingly

651
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,960
she is responsive remember my definition

652
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,720
or the definition

653
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,799
of the vegetative state

654
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,039
the state of blank wakefulness

655
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,400
it is non-responsive wakefulness and

656
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,200
clearly this girl is not non-responsive

657
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
here she's responding

658
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,000
to

659
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,240
the placement of her baby brother on her

660
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,720
lap and she responds emotionally in a

661
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,640
way that any kid

662
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,159
any little girl

663
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
place a baby on her lap she'll she'll

664
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
she'll

665
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,559
most will express pleasure most most

666
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,799
kids like their little baby siblings

667
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,720
being placed on their laps

668
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,600
um and it's not just her it's most of

669
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
these kids

670
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,600
if they're if they're raised in

671
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,720
something other than a state of complete

672
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
deprivation

673
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,480
like romanian orphans

674
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,039
who fall into what might look like a

675
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,480
vegetative state

676
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,279
although their cortex is entirely intact

677
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,159
if you actually raise these kids in

678
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,720
in reasonably humane conditions

679
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,000
they are conscious and responsive uh

680
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,559
affectively responsive that's the main

681
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,559
point that they're making these children

682
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,159
with absolutely no

683
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,960
no cortex their consciousness has a

684
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,440
quality and the content

685
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840
that quality we call affect

686
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,320
it feels like something to be these kids

687
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,000
and the content

688
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,720
is not monotonous affect it's all kinds

689
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,880
of effort that he has a summary slide

690
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,320
for extracting

691
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,559
what beyond marco who studied many many

692
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,799
many of these kids what he said about

693
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,120
them they show all of these different

694
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,559
emotions

695
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,960
and most importantly of all they show

696
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,600
them in situationally appropriate ways

697
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,679
in other words they respond with

698
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,399
laughter if they're tickled uh they

699
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,159
respond uh with with arched backs and

700
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,159
and and and and protests uh if something

701
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,120
that they want uh is denied them uh they

702
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,240
respond with a startle uh if there's a

703
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,159
sudden uh unexpected noise and so on

704
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:46,880
so

705
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,760
uh the evidence is that these kids are

706
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,000
not only conscious in the sense of being

707
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,360
awake

708
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,679
which is interesting in itself in fact i

709
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
can't imagine what a state of blank

710
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,480
wakefulness might be like but there you

711
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,919
have it the

712
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,720
the the the the concept uh derived from

713
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,480
lagoon and naruto's work is that there

714
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
is such a theoretical fiction as blank

715
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,360
wakefulness but these kids are not black

716
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,639
uh these kids are emotionally responsive

717
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,799
in exactly the way that you would expect

718
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,120
if they had consciousness at least in

719
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,039
the form of affect

720
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,360
so i'm arguing that

721
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,679
with no cortex at all

722
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,200
these kids

723
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,120
display the content and qualitative

724
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,679
conscious contents and qualities

725
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,600
in the form of affects

726
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
now of course the big methodological

727
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,159
problem is that how do you know what

728
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,080
it's like to be these kids how do you

729
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,760
know if there's anything it's like to be

730
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,080
these kids they can't tell us anything

731
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,240
about what it's like to be them

732
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,200
so uh all you can do um

733
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
in this situation

734
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,840
is is look at other lines of evidence

735
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,039
if we can find multiple converging lines

736
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,200
of evidence converging on the conclusion

737
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,760
that the brain stem is where the affects

738
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,919
are actually generated

739
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,600
then

740
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,840
we can do no better we can do no more we

741
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,760
can do nothing other than that in

742
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,720
science so i want to show you now uh

743
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,200
what happens if we look at cases you can

744
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
speak who've lost

745
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,080
great swathes of cortex

746
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,799
we

747
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,720
they can't have lost all of their cortex

748
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,240
because otherwise they wouldn't be able

749
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,559
to speak to us so i'm wanting to show

750
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,039
you examples of cases who have lost

751
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,399
great swathes of cortex and the cortex

752
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,600
in question is the cortex that has been

753
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,760
that that has been most closely

754
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,159
identified uh with

755
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,640
with with sentient being with with the

756
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,919
subjective

757
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,039
presence

758
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,000
of a mind of a conscious mind

759
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,279
the first

760
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,320
example is of prefrontal cortex

761
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,000
i think that it's fair to say that the

762
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,799
mainstream view is that where all of

763
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,799
this information processing comes

764
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,880
together and is

765
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,080
received by a sentient subject of the

766
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,279
mind the mainstream view is that

767
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,919
would be in the prefrontal cortex

768
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,919
now there are few patients there it's

769
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,240
rare to have a patient with absolutely

770
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,720
no prefrontal cortex but here's one

771
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,039
example and i'm just giving you examples

772
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,080
in in this presentation i'm speaking

773
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,799
about individual cases those individual

774
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,880
hadron and cephalic kids that you just

775
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,399
saw um they are representative

776
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,640
of the class of patient that i'm talking

777
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,000
about here is a patient of my own um who

778
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,279
has no prefrontal cortex but happily uh

779
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,880
has a sliver of language cortex and so

780
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,720
he's able to tell us what it's like to

781
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,840
be him i asked him if he was conscious

782
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,760
of his thoughts and he said yes of

783
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,399
course i am and i explained to him that

784
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,399
according to classical theory he

785
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,519
shouldn't be

786
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,399
so

787
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,320
in order to confirm that he's conscious

788
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,880
of his thoughts i asked him if uh if he

789
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,720
would be willing to solve a problem that

790
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,440
would require him to consciously picture

791
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,399
a situation in his mind and he agreed to

792
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,399
do that so i said

793
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,039
the i want him to picture in his mind i

794
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,480
want him to imagine

795
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,760
that he has two dogs and one chicken

796
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,919
which is which he then says okay he'll

797
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,880
do and then i ask him do you see them in

798
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,840
your mind's eye and he says yes he does

799
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,080
i then ask him to count the legs you

800
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,919
know this is not an everyday task it's

801
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,559
something that's unexpected so there he

802
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,120
has these two dogs in his mind's eye and

803
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,440
a chicken and he has to count the legs

804
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,240
and of course the answer is 10.

805
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,159
i ask him how many legs do you see and

806
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,080
he says to my great disappointment he

807
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
says eight

808
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,200
i say eight and he says yes the dog's at

809
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,720
the chicken

810
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,960
uh which um i think is uh enough

811
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,320
evidence for me that this chap uh is

812
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
there you know that there's there's

813
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,120
there's somebody at home uh who's

814
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,559
looking at these

815
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,240
dogs and the chicken

816
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,200
and imagining perhaps concretely you

817
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,720
know that the dog's actually at the

818
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,679
chicken

819
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,519
or perhaps

820
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,399
he's pulling a fast one he's making it a

821
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,440
joke

822
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,240
and in fact the making of pure oil jokes

823
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,399
is a very common feature

824
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,320
of patients with the frontal lobe

825
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,679
syndrome

826
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,120
and this is linked traditionally with

827
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,679
the commonplace observation that these

828
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,440
patients are

829
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,399
emotionally disinhibited

830
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,720
and why i draw your attention to that is

831
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,000
that if it were true that the cortex and

832
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,720
the prefrontal cortex in particular is

833
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,760
where affects are generated then how

834
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,720
come

835
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,120
if you have an absence of prefrontal

836
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,559
cortex not only is affect preserved but

837
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,080
affect is excessive uh there's

838
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,480
there's more effect than normal there's

839
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,799
there's too much effect

840
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,760
this is

841
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,880
entirely

842
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,120
incompatible with the idea

843
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,279
espoused by many

844
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,519
respectable neuroscientists

845
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,159
joseph ledoux for example who's a

846
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,320
great authority

847
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,399
on affect

848
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,039
joseph ledoux says that of course the

849
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,399
amygdala and other subcortical machinery

850
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,200
for anxiety doesn't actually generate

851
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,760
any feeling at all that the feeling of

852
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,039
anxiety is read out to use his term

853
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,320
labeled by the prefrontal cortex and

854
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
that's when it actually turns into a

855
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,279
conscious experience

856
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,399
so i say again if that were true then

857
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,080
how come

858
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,200
not only my patient this one making this

859
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,559
joke to us uh but all frontal lobe

860
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,080
patients

861
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,159
the the less frontal cortex they have

862
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,159
the more affect they have

863
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,559
so the less capacity they have to read

864
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,679
out and label their feelings somehow it

865
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,918
seems as if they're beset by more

866
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,879
feeling rather than less

867
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,239
um since i'm talking about feelings

868
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,560
the other major candidate

869
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,359
the other major cortical candidate

870
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,440
as being the seat of the sentient self

871
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,199
is the insula

872
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,159
bud craig claims that the insular or

873
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,199
perhaps even just the anterior third of

874
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,399
it is where the sentient subject comes

875
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,000
into being and he links this

876
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,719
particularly with affect he says that

877
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,760
this is the part of the cortex

878
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,000
which registers

879
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,800
the state of the own body

880
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,440
how do you feel now

881
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,520
is registered by

882
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
this part of the cortex

883
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,839
and it's on this basis that he claims

884
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,880
that this is where the sentient subject

885
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
comes

886
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,440
into being

887
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,680
so again

888
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,320
in just one case like marzia who had

889
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
absolutely no insulin bilaterally

890
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,240
obliterated and he interviewed in much

891
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,440
the same way

892
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,599
as i interviewed my patient with no

893
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,160
frontal cortex

894
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
and demarzio asks him if he has a sense

895
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,880
of self and he says yes he does and i

896
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,720
won't go through all of this all of

897
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,680
which is

898
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,400
dimarzio trying to

899
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,520
ascertain whether or not this person

900
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,240
is conscious and in particular whether

901
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,320
or not he possesses selfhood does he

902
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,680
even understand what self food is

903
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,079
and eventually demarzia says what if i

904
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,000
were to tell you that i know you better

905
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,480
than you know yourself patience says i

906
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,000
would think you're wrong

907
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,320
demarzia says what if i were to tell you

908
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,960
that you're aware that i am aware

909
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,440
patient says i'd say you're right the

910
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,920
marzia says you're aware that i'm aware

911
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,079
patient says i am aware that you're

912
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,119
aware that i'm aware please note all

913
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,040
these references to i

914
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,160
uh there is a sentient subject speaking

915
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,440
to us here

916
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,280
with absolutely no

917
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,359
insular cortex

918
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,800
so i think the claim on the basis of

919
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
the hydrant and cephalic children

920
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,520
the claim that the cortex is the seat of

921
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,599
consciousness and of feeling in

922
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,040
particular

923
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,760
has to be dismissed uh but they can't

924
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,720
speak so we look at the other major

925
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
candidates who can speak patients with

926
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,000
no prefrontal cortex they are conscious

927
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
there's a sentient subject there and

928
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,640
they feel like something they tell us

929
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,320
and they show us

930
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,640
and likewise patients with no insulin

931
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,800
cortex

932
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,280
of course the claim can be made well in

933
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,640
these cases

934
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,440
their consciousness arises from the

935
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,680
remnants of the cortex the remainder of

936
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,920
the cortex the quarter the cortex that

937
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,400
is not removed bear in mind the ones who

938
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,800
have no cortex you know who clearly show

939
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,599
behavioral displays of affect

940
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,240
every prediction that you might make

941
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,400
from the hypothesis that it feels like

942
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
something to be these kids is confirmed

943
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,160
by their behavior

944
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,320
by their responses to affective stimuli

945
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,200
and

946
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,960
in that case we say well we don't know

947
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,560
because they can't speak

948
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,800
so then we use these other cases with no

949
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,200
prefrontal cortex no insular cortex who

950
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,520
can speak and then we say well it must

951
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,760
be the the other bits of the cortex that

952
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,920
are generating the consciousness it

953
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,839
seems like a

954
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,680
losing wicket to me

955
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,200
but

956
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,359
let's look at other evidence then lesion

957
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,480
evidence

958
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,720
remember we're looking for converging

959
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,640
lines of evidence converging on the

960
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,560
conclusion that the feelings are

961
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,200
generated in the brainstem

962
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,760
in the brainstem

963
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,000
and so here we look at the case

964
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,240
of a patient in where an entirely

965
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,160
different method is used that is deep

966
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,400
brain stimulation of a part of the

967
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,960
reticular activating system in this case

968
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,359
the substantia

969
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,200
the surgeon was aiming for the

970
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,440
subthalamic nucleus but the

971
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,920
the electrode went into the substantia

972
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,119
 and when he stimulated it the

973
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,640
patient fell into a profound depression

974
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,800
within five seconds again i'm not going

975
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,040
to read all of this to you it'll it

976
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,880
will take more time

977
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,119
than is necessary

978
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,720
if you read it yourself

979
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,040
you'll see this patient within five

980
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,599
seconds felt fell into a profound

981
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,800
depression

982
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,200
as she has no psychiatric history never

983
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,280
been depressed before never had a

984
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,160
diagnosis of any kind led to learn a

985
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,800
diagnosis of major depression and here

986
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,960
within five seconds you can generate

987
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,720
produce cause

988
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,440
a suicidal depressive state

989
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,200
which within 30 seconds of switching off

990
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,400
uh the

991
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,920
uh the the stimulator 90 seconds i mean

992
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,599
after the stimulation will stop the

993
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,400
depression stops

994
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,240
very interestingly

995
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,760
she

996
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,960
agreed or very bravely she agreed to

997
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,359
have the stimulator

998
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,880
switched on and off

999
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,200
either in the subthalamic nucleus or in

1000
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,680
the substantia of the reticular

1001
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,240
activating system where she was blind as

1002
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,000
to where the stimulation was being

1003
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,119
applied and every time it was applied in

1004
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,160
the reticular activating system she fell

1005
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,880
into this severe depressive state again

1006
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,200
so this is you know this is what you

1007
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,160
would expect this is the the prediction

1008
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,400
uh from the hypothesis that ethics are

1009
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,480
actually generated in the brain stem

1010
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,119
the the the prediction would be if you

1011
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,359
stimulate these reticular activating

1012
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,760
nuclei you will generate affects and

1013
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,920
that's exactly what you do

1014
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,720
this is also why i mentioned the

1015
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,319
periaqueductal gray earlier

1016
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,520
because

1017
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,599
if you stimulate reticular activating

1018
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,839
nutri you generate intense effects but

1019
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,880
the same applies to periaqueductal gray

1020
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,359
in fact the greatest intensity and range

1021
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,760
of affects anywhere in the brain can be

1022
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,240
elicited from deep brain stimulation of

1023
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,040
the periaqueductal brain

1024
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,520
brain stimulation of the cortical mantle

1025
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,599
produces very little if any affect

1026
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,000
um another method positron emission

1027
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,839
tomography so another study of

1028
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,440
demarzio's patients in states of anger

1029
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,440
sadness happiness and fear uh you see

1030
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,040
where the brain

1031
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,920
the

1032
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,079
the major brain activity is in all of

1033
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,079
these affective states the major

1034
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,720
activities subcortical it's in the brain

1035
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,880
stem it's not cortical

1036
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,520
so again this is exactly what you would

1037
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,680
predict if the affect is actually being

1038
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,800
generated by the brain stem not being

1039
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,359
read out by the cortex but generated by

1040
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,040
the brain stem

1041
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,000
and then there's also the matter of the

1042
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,040
neurotransmitters that

1043
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,480
psychopharmacologists tinker with

1044
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,760
the mainstream psychiatric medications

1045
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,160
modulate

1046
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,960
neurotransmitters that are sourced in

1047
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,760
the reticular activating system

1048
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,440
we don't normally think of it that way

1049
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,560
but it is

1050
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,319
simply the case

1051
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,200
that serotonin which we increase

1052
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,040
with antidepressants

1053
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,760
is sourced in the reticular activating

1054
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,079
system dopamine which we block with

1055
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,760
antipsychotics

1056
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
is sourced in the reticular activating

1057
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,839
system noradrenaline

1058
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:44,880
which

1059
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,319
is blocked in

1060
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,480
many anti-anxiety drugs

1061
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,560
is sourced in the reticular activating

1062
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,800
system if the reticular activating

1063
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,079
system was just the power source

1064
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,359
uh that i referred to in my analogy

1065
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,520
about the television set then it should

1066
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,920
only interest anesthetists

1067
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,160
you shouldn't be able to change the

1068
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,440
channel

1069
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,520
alter the programming of the television

1070
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,880
set by pulling out the plug or by

1071
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,000
or by attenuating the power supply you

1072
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,400
might expect the screen to sort of go

1073
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,680
blank or or just flicker but not to have

1074
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,800
whole new programs with new contents and

1075
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,560
new qualities

1076
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,400
and so this is my argument that the the

1077
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,280
idea that feeling states affective

1078
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,119
feeling states of the kind that those

1079
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,640
children display

1080
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,680
of the kind that these patients describe

1081
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,160
of the kind that psychiatrists are

1082
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,040
or directly trying to manipulate

1083
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,680
are generated by upper brain stem

1084
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,839
structures they're not generated by

1085
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,240
cortex you don't need to have cortex in

1086
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,880
order to have these states and yet

1087
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,079
we all know and agree we all agree that

1088
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,040
cortical consciousness is contingent

1089
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,640
upon reticular activating arousal

1090
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,319
if we now

1091
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,960
are forced to accept that reticular

1092
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,240
activating arousal is not contentless is

1093
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,400
not a mere quantity it's not just a

1094
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,680
level

1095
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,839
but rather has content and quality that

1096
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,319
we call affect then we have to accept

1097
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,880
that affect is a prerequisite for all

1098
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,040
other forms of consciousness and it's on

1099
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,920
this basis not on semantic one that i'm

1100
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,480
claiming that affect is the foundational

1101
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,839
form of consciousness uh it also makes

1102
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,119
good evolutionary sense uh that this

1103
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,359
ancient structure

1104
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,319
rather than the cortical mantle which

1105
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,400
evolves only with mammals

1106
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,680
that the ability to register your own

1107
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,920
subjective state how you're doing

1108
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,839
effectively in terms of hunger and

1109
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,920
thirst and sleepiness

1110
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,280
and to hotness and whatnot

1111
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,760
that this should not require

1112
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,319
such a late evolutionary development but

1113
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,319
that's another point i'm just wanting to

1114
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,040
slot in there that i also mean it in the

1115
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,359
evolutionary sense when i say that

1116
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,200
affect is the foundational form of

1117
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,960
consciousness i don't only mean it in

1118
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,880
the functional sense

1119
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,760
now i'll pause there because that's a

1120
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
big claim

1121
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,560
and a very controversial claim

1122
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,200
in fact i must tell you i'm still

1123
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,720
slightly

1124
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,560
dismayed that it remains controversial

1125
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,359
i've been i've been really surprised by

1126
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,119
the degree of pushback that i get

1127
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,200
when i argue and it's i'm not the only

1128
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,720
one who argues that i'm not the first

1129
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,640
one to argue it

1130
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,839
but

1131
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,240
demarzia argues that

1132
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,280
panxip was the first to argue it

1133
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,440
marker argues it

1134
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,560
and

1135
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,359
here i come a good few years on and

1136
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,520
argue the same thing citing all of this

1137
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,839
evidence and uh

1138
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,920
wow people just don't want to accept it

1139
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,800
so let's hear what what

1140
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,599
what you have to say

1141
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,560
stephen

1142
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,920
yeah yeah i'll read a question from the

1143
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,520
chat first and then we'll go to stephen

1144
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,400
so

1145
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,960
uh jonathan in the in the chat wrote

1146
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,280
i can imagine a modern large language

1147
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,000
model the likes of gpt3 creating such

1148
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,720
conversations without apparently having

1149
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,400
a mind's eye

1150
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,160
while i agree it is good evidence i

1151
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,599
think we are seeing machine learning

1152
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,160
systems having similar conversations so

1153
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,400
you've presented case studies that are

1154
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,319
the tip of the iceberg of broader

1155
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,720
populations and analyses how do we think

1156
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,599
about

1157
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,280
our evaluation of conversational

1158
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,920
dialogue

1159
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,119
in

1160
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,319
questions about necessity and

1161
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,800
sufficiency here

1162
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,440
yeah you see this is a kind of a

1163
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,240
um a relative of the philosophical

1164
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,640
zombie uh argument

1165
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,119
uh the the problem is with this sort of

1166
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,240
thing is that

1167
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,760
in fact the same applies uh to you and

1168
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,960
me

1169
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,560
i can't know for sure that daniel is

1170
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,720
conscious that stephen is conscious that

1171
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,480
david is conscious

1172
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,079
or that the person who asked that

1173
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,440
question is conscious you know

1174
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
the point you've just made really does

1175
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,640
apply in exactly the same way there's no

1176
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,480
greater reason to believe that it

1177
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,400
applies to the patients that i've just

1178
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,760
presented to you then and that it

1179
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,440
applies to you and me

1180
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,480
because you too could be a philosophical

1181
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,640
zombie in other words you too could look

1182
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,599
as if and you have internal states say

1183
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,599
that you have internal states but

1184
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,000
actually there's nobody there i can

1185
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,800
never

1186
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,480
disprove that

1187
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,720
that is a metaphysical

1188
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,400
problem that's not a scientific problem

1189
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,880
the scientific method is requires

1190
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,200
that your hypothesis has to be

1191
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,920
consistent with all the known facts um

1192
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,560
and then you have to make falsifiable

1193
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,319
predictions

1194
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,160
from that hypothesis

1195
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,920
and if your predictions are not

1196
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,880
falsified then they are upheld

1197
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,240
unless uh and until uh they some

1198
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,200
evidence is found which positively this

1199
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,680
is what positivism is all about which

1200
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,800
positively falsifies it so i'm saying

1201
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,119
these kids look as if they're conscious

1202
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,000
you know

1203
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
they behave as if they're conscious now

1204
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,480
it's true that they might not be and

1205
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,559
stephen might not be and daniel might

1206
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,960
not be and david might not be but you

1207
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,079
know

1208
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,640
my hypothesis is that they are so what

1209
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,359
do i do i say well if daniel

1210
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,880
feels pain like i do then when i stick a

1211
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,319
pin uh in his hand he's going to go ouch

1212
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,640
and withdraw his hand and avoid me in

1213
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,680
future

1214
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,599
and that's uh you know that's a

1215
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,960
confirmation of my prediction uh the

1216
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,200
same applies for these kids

1217
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,520
but you know that's just one source of

1218
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
evidence as i said you don't accept just

1219
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,400
one

1220
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,319
you then say okay well what about this

1221
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,000
line of evidence what about that and

1222
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,160
i've given you five lines of evidence

1223
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,040
here

1224
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,359
in which in every instance uh the

1225
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,680
prediction from the hypothesis

1226
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,839
that these people are conscious and that

1227
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,079
the consciousness is generated in the

1228
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,400
brain stem and that that it has an

1229
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,200
affect of quality every single line of

1230
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,720
evidence

1231
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,480
you know the prediction is confirmed

1232
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,559
what you would expect would happen if

1233
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,359
that were true is what happens

1234
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,319
so

1235
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,359
you know

1236
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,440
i'm afraid you can do no more than that

1237
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,839
in science um and it's a curious fact

1238
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,400
that we raise the bar uh of evidence uh

1239
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,720
when it comes to the problem of

1240
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,839
consciousness um i think we must be very

1241
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,200
careful not to require um any different

1242
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,599
sort of evidence in the case of

1243
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,000
consciousness then we require for any

1244
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,079
other

1245
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,000
matter in science

1246
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,480
and in this case in any other

1247
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,240
biological function you know it's

1248
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,000
if you start with the assumption that

1249
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,640
consciousness is something special

1250
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,559
that you know the ordinary rules of

1251
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,800
science don't apply to then you're going

1252
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,280
to have a self-fulfilling prophecy

1253
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,960
so yes it's possible it's possible that

1254
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,119
these kids and those patients are not

1255
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,559
there that they're lying to me uh that

1256
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,839
you know

1257
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,440
it's it's a little bit of a curious

1258
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,200
thing that somebody without a sense of

1259
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,520
self uh wants to pretend that they've

1260
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,240
got one um i think you're in a kind of

1261
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,440
slippery slope there to to uh

1262
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,160
to

1263
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,839
to irrationality

1264
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:48,640
but

1265
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,640
i can't prevent you from holding that

1266
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,880
view it's just not consistent with any

1267
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,160
of the evidence i'm afraid

1268
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,599
thank you mark stephen

1269
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,520
yeah i was wondering how much you think

1270
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,400
the challenge with uptake is because

1271
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,280
people are sort of stuck in

1272
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,440
the idea that

1273
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,760
knowledge and information is a signal

1274
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,880
coming in

1275
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,599
and

1276
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,520
meaning it's all about meaning and the

1277
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,920
ability to communicate meaning

1278
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,480
as opposed to

1279
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,720
engaging in meaningful action and

1280
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,920
skillful

1281
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,400
inactive processes of the voice

1282
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,920
twitching

1283
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,319
the voice box twitching and enabling

1284
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,960
words to be in the space around us

1285
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,839
in some sort of way and whether that

1286
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,440
that issue is um kind of a deeper

1287
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,720
ingrained

1288
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,760
challenge to overcome

1289
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,920
well i completely agree with that i

1290
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,000
think that that is the

1291
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,040
the

1292
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,160
a fundamental source of the problem

1293
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,119
um

1294
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,160
because our common sense tells us our

1295
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,040
consciousness is extraceptive as i said

1296
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,040
earlier you know the

1297
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,280
our conscious experience is dominated by

1298
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,599
visual qualia and where do they come

1299
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,440
from from you know

1300
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,520
things light waves impinging on my

1301
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,680
retina from outside and i'm seeing

1302
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,880
things out there and so consciousness

1303
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,079
seems

1304
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,040
to be

1305
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,920
so obviously derived from something out

1306
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,960
there

1307
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,880
um and this is

1308
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,119
this was at the heart of the experiments

1309
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,359
that magoon and maruzi did

1310
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,440
magoon and maruzi weren't expecting to

1311
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,040
find what they found

1312
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,760
um that they were expecting that

1313
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,200
a cat deprived of any extraceptive

1314
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,640
stimuli will fall asleep um if not fall

1315
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,400
into a coma

1316
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,400
and it was therefore a great surprise to

1317
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,559
find that that's not what happens

1318
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,400
that the consciousness is generated

1319
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,800
endogenously comes from deep within the

1320
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,200
brain doesn't flow in with sensory

1321
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,400
stimuli

1322
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,760
um and

1323
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,240
when they lesion that core brain stem

1324
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,319
structure the lights went out

1325
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:01,040
and

1326
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
they couldn't make sense of it and they

1327
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,400
came up with this

1328
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,880
with this uh theory which as i've shown

1329
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,599
you at least as i've shown to anyone

1330
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,920
who's you know who's willing to look at

1331
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,800
the evidence and draw the conclusions uh

1332
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,920
that uh

1333
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,720
this that the the way that they framed

1334
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,920
it is wrong it doesn't explain

1335
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,839
what they saw what they saw was that

1336
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,119
consciousness is endogenously generated

1337
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,040
and where does that where does the

1338
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,119
notion come from this common sense

1339
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,960
notion

1340
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,319
that it flows in from outside it comes

1341
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,160
not only from our own

1342
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,559
everyday experience but also from the

1343
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,480
british empiricist philosophers who

1344
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,160
probably themselves derived it from

1345
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,480
common sense you know that

1346
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,839
the mind literally the mind as a whole

1347
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:53,040
you know is is derived from sensory

1348
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,640
experience

1349
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,760
that leaves impressions uh

1350
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,880
leaves memory images impressed upon our

1351
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,440
cortex which are then associated with

1352
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,920
each other and this according to british

1353
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,359
empiricist philosophy which underpinned

1354
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,599
the whole of 19th century

1355
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,839
and early 20th century neurology and

1356
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,599
neuropsychology

1357
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,319
it's all predicated on that idea so i

1358
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,559
think it's deeply ingrained within

1359
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,880
ourselves and within our science um

1360
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,280
and uh you know within

1361
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,000
uh

1362
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,400
perception generally that consciousness

1363
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,000
comes from outside

1364
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,480
and you you're speaking about some

1365
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,960
further um you know

1366
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,319
ramifications of that and therefore

1367
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,480
sources of resistance against the

1368
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,200
alternative view but all the evidence

1369
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,960
suggests that consciousness is

1370
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,280
endogenous consciousness is generated

1371
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,480
from within

1372
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,559
um and

1373
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,440
i mean you saw i i had i i i'm sorry i

1374
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,280
don't know who the person was who made

1375
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,520
the comment about you know how do we

1376
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,760
know that this is not you know just some

1377
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,280
sort of program spewing out language um

1378
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,800
i have nothing against you i don't know

1379
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,000
who you are

1380
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,559
i just hear that all the time

1381
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,440
and uh you know i i find that frankly i

1382
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,440
find it astonishing you know that you

1383
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,280
present all of this evidence and then

1384
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,960
still people say well you know how do

1385
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,760
you know but how do you know that that

1386
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,079
these patients are really conscious and

1387
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,559
this is a this this this demonstrates

1388
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,839
the extent

1389
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,960
of the

1390
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,440
of the prejudice you know that has come

1391
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,720
with that with that historical um with

1392
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,319
that legacy

1393
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,720
that

1394
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,319
stephen with a raised hands then dave

1395
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,440
with a raised hand we'll go with the

1396
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,359
raised hands

1397
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,160
okay thanks um yeah so sort of following

1398
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,920
on from that yeah i totally agree and

1399
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,520
actually i think the work with first

1400
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,680
piston and active vision

1401
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,920
um is is quite helpful because the idea

1402
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,520
that we're reaching out and feeling the

1403
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,640
world

1404
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,319
and i think actually i was looking back

1405
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,839
before 300 400 years ago

1406
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,520
if you went back in time people actually

1407
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,920
almost had that as a an intuition that

1408
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,520
we were looking out in the world but

1409
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,599
once we discovered the retina and then

1410
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,880
photography we kind of re-imagined

1411
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,680
um

1412
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,920
so one question i've got is is regarding

1413
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,680
cerebral palsy i work a lot with

1414
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,920
communities with complex disability with

1415
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,280
non-verbal

1416
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,280
and their pre-motor cortex is often

1417
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,599
damaged and in the 1970s it was thought

1418
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,119
medically if you couldn't speak you

1419
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,559
couldn't think so that was where they

1420
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,000
were then if you couldn't communicate

1421
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,200
words

1422
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,280
and then once they started using symbols

1423
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,920
bliss symbolics and the ability to

1424
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,920
then and they suddenly discovered that

1425
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,319
all these clients who had

1426
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,400
who were non-verbal actually

1427
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,799
perform complete sentences because they

1428
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:53,200
have a way to act in the world and

1429
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,720
interact in the world

1430
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,000
and develop um language syntax and all

1431
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,319
of that so i'm just thinking whether

1432
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,319
you've had a lot of uh whether any of

1433
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,000
this works been tied in with clients

1434
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,119
with cerebral palsy

1435
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,599
not only with cerebral palsy but with

1436
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,599
all sorts of

1437
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,599
neurological conditions

1438
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,680
if i can just sort of piggyback on what

1439
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,559
you've said about cerebral palsy

1440
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,119
the whole trend

1441
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,880
within clinical neurology

1442
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,079
has been

1443
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,160
us realizing that patients who we

1444
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,079
thought were not conscious actually are

1445
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,280
conscious

1446
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,960
um

1447
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,160
and the whole

1448
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,640
the the sort of tenor of the research

1449
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,920
that's been done

1450
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,119
in recent decades um i mean locked in

1451
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:42,799
syndrome of course is the extreme

1452
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,520
example but but i don't only mean locked

1453
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,760
in syndrome i mean all of these states

1454
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,640
of reduced and obtunded uh con and

1455
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,480
clouded consciousness and so on

1456
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,119
minimally conscious states

1457
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,359
so-called vegetative states and so on

1458
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,920
we're finding more and more patients who

1459
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,680
actually who we thought

1460
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,920
were not conscious with increasing

1461
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,160
technology we find that they are

1462
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,040
um

1463
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,119
with with improvements in our methods we

1464
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,640
find that they are

1465
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,559
so it's it's a sort of an odd um

1466
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,000
it's an odd um contradiction with the

1467
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,400
sorts of philosophical skepticism and

1468
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,720
doubt that one confronts from people who

1469
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,240
say well you know

1470
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,359
you know how do we know they're

1471
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,119
conscious

1472
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,720
they're behaving as if they're conscious

1473
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,240
but maybe they're not

1474
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,680
in fact what we've been finding in

1475
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,440
clinical neurology is patients who

1476
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,599
behaving as if they're not conscious

1477
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,880
and then when we

1478
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,040
when we use the proper tools we find

1479
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,720
that they actually are

1480
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,440
so

1481
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,359
um

1482
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,119
your comment about

1483
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,640
cerebral palsy can be multiplied you're

1484
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,680
the observations that you refer to

1485
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,400
consciousness um you know using

1486
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,200
reportability

1487
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,880
as a criterion

1488
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,040
the capacity to declare

1489
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,880
your conscious states

1490
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,319
has really

1491
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,119
it's not just led to

1492
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,359
methodological and epistemological

1493
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,000
problems it's really led to gross

1494
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
clinical errors you know it's ethical

1495
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,200
problems

1496
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,720
i i feel we need a lot more than mere

1497
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,119
philosophical skepticism

1498
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,440
before we can take seriously in

1499
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,599
neurology which after all is a branch of

1500
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,000
medicine before we can take seriously

1501
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,640
the possibility that these kids and

1502
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,200
these patients look as if they conscious

1503
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,200
behave as if they're conscious say that

1504
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,359
they're conscious and we say well we

1505
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,599
can't be sure i mean think about the

1506
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,319
implications

1507
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,000
thanks mark

1508
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,839
dave with a question

1509
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,359
yes um

1510
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,839
two i'd like to say two things uh to

1511
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:52,160
what you were just talking about uh the

1512
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,480
difficulty of telling whether people who

1513
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,440
seem to be locked in or comatose are

1514
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,880
conscious

1515
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,960
there have been some people who

1516
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,400
initially got their experience in

1517
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,559
working with the diet they just wanted

1518
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,359
to people who were dying to not be alone

1519
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,040
and they spent a lot of time as

1520
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,040
typically as volunteers

1521
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,880
sitting with folks who seem to be

1522
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
comatose who seem to be completely

1523
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,640
unresponsive

1524
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,799
and they found that events that unroll

1525
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,559
very very slowly

1526
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,839
in the patient's room seemed to elicit a

1527
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,440
response

1528
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,520
and they got in high-speed cameras and

1529
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,480
would

1530
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,720
uh record

1531
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,880
what the patient is doing that's a study

1532
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,040
that's also been done with with infants

1533
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,520
that infants seem to to act extremely

1534
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,559
fast

1535
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,280
uh and that if you speed up those

1536
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,200
images you can actually see a child

1537
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,200
responding who seems to be kind of lying

1538
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,480
there they found with the comatose that

1539
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,160
it seemed they can carry out

1540
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,240
conversations and it actually did

1541
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,880
resemble conversations taking a person

1542
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,000
through childhood scenes

1543
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,880
for instance and watching them respond

1544
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,119
and they nod or they'd shake or they

1545
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,359
grin you mentioned some kid that used to

1546
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,640
bully you

1547
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,119
over a period of minutes maybe saying it

1548
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,680
over and over or speaking very slowly

1549
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,920
and you get this very slow but

1550
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,400
eventually a full grin that a nurse

1551
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
would say oh that's just a grimace now

1552
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,119
let me check her diaper

1553
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,720
and the other thing is a much better

1554
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,480
bigger picture question

1555
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,040
who actually is hyper alert

1556
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,200
getting out of professional settings or

1557
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,920
ideological settings you walk around you

1558
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,839
see someone who's just you got to be

1559
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,079
really careful with and they will just

1560
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,440
startle

1561
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,760
you have to be really careful what

1562
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,680
what you say you don't bring up

1563
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,559
unpleasant topics you never imply that

1564
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,480
they've done something wrong who are

1565
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,280
these

1566
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,040
for the most part

1567
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,880
these hyper alert individuals are

1568
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,440
children of alcoholics

1569
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,240
who as small children had to be

1570
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,440
the responsible person they had to keep

1571
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,319
daddy from hurting mommy

1572
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,240
even and i wonder how is niels bohr

1573
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,440
raised

1574
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,559
was he hyper alert is that why he became

1575
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:15,680
so

1576
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,240
amazingly oppressive as nice as he might

1577
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,598
have been nonetheless

1578
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,839
unremittingly insistent that only he was

1579
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,599
correct

1580
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,680
so in that big picture thing are the

1581
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,839
folks who want to insist that you

1582
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,240
absolutely positively are controlled

1583
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,000
only from the outside were they the

1584
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,240
child the people who as children were

1585
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,559
never able to emit

1586
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,720
they always had to react they always had

1587
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,079
to be really really careful because the

1588
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,599
environment really is something that

1589
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,280
will come in and get you

1590
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,960
well um about your second uh comment

1591
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,559
i will just say

1592
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,400
uh please note uh how affective uh you

1593
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,359
know

1594
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:03,599
all of this stuff is that you're talking

1595
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,559
about and i i i think that

1596
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,640
we we really

1597
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,079
underestimate the importance of affect

1598
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,960
in terms of the whole gamut of

1599
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,799
phenomena that we

1600
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,640
call consciousness

1601
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,440
but to your first point i want to make

1602
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,599
clear uh that

1603
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,000
i am i mean i agree with what you're

1604
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,520
saying uh

1605
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,599
the about

1606
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:30,960
the the

1607
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,119
um

1608
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,880
inference of consciousness in these

1609
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,920
patients

1610
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,839
uh but i but i want to make clear that

1611
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,720
i'm making actually a quite a

1612
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,400
in light of or

1613
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,440
notwithstanding or you know all of this

1614
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,760
other evidence and all of these other

1615
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,920
very interesting uh clinical phenomena

1616
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,599
all of which

1617
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,839
uh point in the direction of we've

1618
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,520
underestimated the presence of

1619
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,680
consciousness you know that we've

1620
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,400
we've been relying on a very

1621
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,400
poor

1622
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,839
criteria

1623
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,480
in terms of reportability

1624
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,839
and so on

1625
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,000
that really we need more sophisticated

1626
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,599
methods and the more we use more

1627
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,000
sophisticated methods the more we find

1628
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
evidence that there is in fact somebody

1629
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,440
there

1630
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,839
i agree with all of that but i'm making

1631
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,280
a very

1632
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,280
very limited claim

1633
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,760
i'm saying i'm not saying these kids are

1634
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,920
like you and me i'm not saying they have

1635
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,559
a full rich inner mental life

1636
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,799
i'm saying only that there is something

1637
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,720
it is like to be them

1638
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,920
um and in light of all the evidence in

1639
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,559
their cases plus all the other evidence

1640
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,119
that i've cited or using all these

1641
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,599
different methods all i'm saying is that

1642
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,599
that's something it is likeness that

1643
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,280
these kids possess

1644
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,760
is it feels like something they have

1645
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,640
feelings that's all i'm saying so it's

1646
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,480
it's all very interesting all these

1647
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,640
other things about how all these other

1648
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,000
capacities um have been missed by us in

1649
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,440
relation to all of these other

1650
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,079
neurological conditions but in these

1651
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,640
cases which have no cortex whatsoever

1652
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,480
they have only

1653
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,720
some of them have basal ganglia and and

1654
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,799
you know other subcortical for brand

1655
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,839
nupi some of them don't

1656
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:25,359
but even in cases you have no forebrain

1657
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,839
only a brain stem

1658
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,039
they

1659
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,160
display

1660
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,520
affects and so i'm saying that the brain

1661
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,920
stem

1662
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,880
prerequisite form of consciousness

1663
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,359
does have a quality and the content

1664
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,680
it therefore feels like something there

1665
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,920
is something it is like to be these kids

1666
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,000
and and that quality and content is

1667
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,319
affected that's all i'm claiming that

1668
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,200
the foundational form of consciousness

1669
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,359
is affect and it's generated in the

1670
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,359
brainstem

1671
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,079
so

1672
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,920
it's a it's a it's actually i think a

1673
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,599
rather modest claim

1674
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,359
in light of all the evidence it's quite

1675
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,760
a conservative claim it's a sort of it's

1676
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,200
a sort of a deflationary claim

1677
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,640
but so much flows from just that

1678
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,319
and i i'll just say once more

1679
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,280
i find it very hard to understand i mean

1680
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,760
i can understand

1681
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,640
you know and of course or politically or

1682
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,720
what you know i mean people's whole

1683
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,119
careers i mean generations of careers

1684
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,960
have been built on the assumption you

1685
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,359
know that that that cortex and

1686
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:37,039
consciousness um are are intrinsically

1687
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,480
bound up with each other which you know

1688
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,079
so the people have a hell of a lot to

1689
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,640
lose and and many of us with egg on our

1690
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,559
faces and i freely admit that i uh too

1691
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:49,280
uh believed that the cortex was the

1692
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,440
organ of consciousness this is what i

1693
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,520
took in like mother's milk when i

1694
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,480
trained

1695
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,640
and i believed that for many many years

1696
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,319
after i trained you know

1697
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,799
so you know i'm not exempted from that

1698
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,559
but gosh we've got to look at the

1699
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:05,440
evidence it's wrong we made a mistake

1700
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,039
you know it's not doesn't mean the

1701
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,799
cortex does nothing it doesn't mean it

1702
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,319
doesn't contribute anything to

1703
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,720
consciousness it's just not the source

1704
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,000
of consciousness the the cortex is

1705
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,119
elaborates this very raw

1706
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,240
primary elemental feeling that is

1707
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,039
generated in the brain stem and all we

1708
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,000
need to do is accept that and uh and

1709
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,640
then we'll make huge progress in

1710
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,920
consciousness science uh the the the the

1711
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,559
fallacy that the cortex is the source of

1712
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,760
consciousness uh is really a serious

1713
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,480
impediment to us at this point uh in the

1714
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,280
history of our field

1715
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,319
i i think it's you next daniel

1716
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,599
yes

1717
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,680
it is indeed a theme of the discussion

1718
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,799
that ambiguous evidence are continually

1719
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,880
interpreted and reinterpreted in light

1720
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,280
of our inherited or our previously

1721
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,960
structured priors

1722
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,760
and that's true in the active vision

1723
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,000
example it's also true in the scientific

1724
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,119
example

1725
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:08,880
where our inherited priors about

1726
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,680
scientific models influence how new

1727
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,000
evidence is not just perceived but

1728
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,599
funded and carried out

1729
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:16,510
and um

1730
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:17,839
[Music]

1731
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,880
it made me think about uh when people

1732
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,280
activate a gene or remove one gene and

1733
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,440
make claims of function

1734
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,640
might be an analogous to the brain but

1735
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,319
removing or having one node in a complex

1736
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,359
network

1737
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:34,799
showing that there is a single point of

1738
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,319
failure or

1739
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,039
gain of function does not entail that as

1740
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:40,960
a generating mechanism which is just an

1741
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,319
example of an explanation that retains

1742
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,039
an alternative perspective and so i

1743
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,400
think it's

1744
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,799
interesting on multiple levels as we

1745
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:55,920
kind of apply this idea of updating and

1746
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,319
learning and structural learning on our

1747
01:07:58,319 --> 01:07:59,280
theories

1748
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,760
about ostensibly the part of the body

1749
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,240
that does this function as opposed to

1750
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,559
one's hand which is important and has

1751
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,440
nerves in it but doesn't do this kind of

1752
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,839
engagement

1753
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,920
thanks very much um

1754
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,560
so i agree that's an everyday

1755
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,600
observation um that uh

1756
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,880
you know we we are reluctant to accept

1757
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,399
uh

1758
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,799
prediction errors uh

1759
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:30,000
we we we cling to our priors especially

1760
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,279
our most deeply consolidated priors

1761
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,799
and

1762
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,198
we see this in everyday life nobody

1763
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,439
likes to find they were wrong that they

1764
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,600
have to change their mind that they have

1765
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,880
to accept

1766
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,799
evidence for review other than the one

1767
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,080
that they

1768
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,799
had always held and this applies even to

1769
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,319
our scientists

1770
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,679
i mean who uh in their graduate studies

1771
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:54,960
when they were doing their first

1772
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,839
research you know didn't hope uh that

1773
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,640
their hypothesis was right uh and then

1774
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,479
when the evidence came in and they found

1775
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,960
oh dear you know i haven't found what i

1776
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,158
expected to find it's not welcome

1777
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,040
so what i'm referring to based on what

1778
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,920
you've just said um i know this is not

1779
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,439
quite what you were saying i'm sort of

1780
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,520
elaborating what you were saying

1781
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,640
um is that we don't recognize

1782
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,600
uh sufficiently the affect of dimension

1783
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,120
uh in our resistance um to prediction

1784
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,279
errors you know we

1785
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,479
we we we all know about you know friars

1786
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,640
and posteriors and you know and how this

1787
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,120
all works mechanistically but just from

1788
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,799
the sort of anecdotes that i've

1789
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,640
mentioned um

1790
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,439
we

1791
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,960
i'm i'm i'm i'm trying to get us to

1792
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,198
recognize that there is an affective

1793
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:49,198
dimension to that and when we get to

1794
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:51,759
this point about the concentric

1795
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,759
predictive hierarchy i'll come back to

1796
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:54,640
that

1797
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,480
but i think it's an it's an it's an

1798
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,280
interesting and important observation

1799
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,040
that as you

1800
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,800
traverse the hierarchy um

1801
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,159
and and get to what uh in my way of

1802
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,920
thinking about it as a concentric

1803
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,480
hierarchy to get deeper into the

1804
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,239
hierarchy in the traditional way we

1805
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,120
speak of going higher in the hierarchy

1806
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,159
but as we go deeper further from the

1807
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,159
sensory motor periphery

1808
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,199
so

1809
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:27,040
we come upon priors which are which are

1810
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,880
more and more difficult

1811
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,239
to update um and uh i say again there's

1812
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,239
a there's a there's a feeling that goes

1813
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,080
with that which is

1814
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,000
i don't care what you tell me i'm not

1815
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,719
gonna believe you

1816
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,600
thank you mark stephen with a question

1817
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,360
yeah i know you're going to come back to

1818
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,159
the cognitive consciousness um but just

1819
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:51,920
something around terminology we've been

1820
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,840
doing work around an ontology working

1821
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,280
group at the active inference lab

1822
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,880
actually trying to understand how to

1823
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,640
think about the language and

1824
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,600
you mentioned it could be um

1825
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,120
affects it is generated in the brainstem

1826
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,159
and then

1827
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:07,520
um

1828
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,360
and that's when something's like

1829
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,480
something

1830
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,080
that's what it's like but i'm also

1831
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,080
wondering how are you taking the dynamic

1832
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,640
with the body and environment going down

1833
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,159
i don't know if that's seen as another

1834
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,000
manifestation

1835
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,360
because obviously

1836
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,040
it makes sense because it's it's more

1837
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,280
integrated with the rest of the body's

1838
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,239
nervous system it's less distant from it

1839
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:31,440
but um i'm wondering whether the term

1840
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,719
um generated within is is more to do

1841
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,880
with when it's connected to the

1842
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,800
rest of the brain and

1843
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,320
when it goes down it's actually more

1844
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,800
distributed in the mind body environment

1845
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,360
dynamic

1846
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,400
um

1847
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,199
the

1848
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,159
i would have nothing against i mean

1849
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,080
that way of thinking

1850
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,520
is um i'm very sympathetic with it

1851
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,320
i'm i'm not a narrow localizationist

1852
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,640
uh i'm i'm very um

1853
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,400
very happy to recognize um it comes

1854
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,400
naturally to me to think about

1855
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,480
functional systems which are distributed

1856
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,560
and dynamic

1857
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,840
and

1858
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,440
and and in fact

1859
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,480
the the reticular activating system is

1860
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,199
probably the most deeply interconnected

1861
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,199
with everything else in the brain system

1862
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,400
that there is

1863
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,640
um it is it is

1864
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,760
it has tentacles everywhere and not only

1865
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,440
although it's called the ascending

1866
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,199
reticular active agent system it

1867
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,159
descends also you know it's uh

1868
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:37,520
it modulates the whole nervous system

1869
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,880
um in very important ways that that will

1870
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,800
come to you know because this whole

1871
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,840
thing of precision modulation um is at

1872
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,840
the heart of my way of understanding

1873
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,280
consciousness

1874
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,559
um so

1875
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,520
the the main thing that i'm wanting to

1876
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,040
say is i agree with you uh that the the

1877
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:03,199
the this is a deeply uh interconnected a

1878
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,400
system

1879
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,159
which functions uh by modulating other

1880
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,440
systems

1881
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,239
and

1882
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,640
i would be very happy if it were

1883
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,440
if we had to leave it there and say well

1884
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,600
you can't quite say that affect is

1885
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,480
generated in the reticular activating

1886
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,360
system because you know it's it's really

1887
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,480
modulating these other systems

1888
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,440
my

1889
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,320
reluctance however in this case

1890
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,920
to accept that um is twofold

1891
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,239
uh the one is that

1892
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,400
that's the kind of thing that people

1893
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,880
like joe ladue are saying they're saying

1894
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,880
yeah this is all unconscious until it is

1895
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,400
labeled by

1896
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,719
or read out in

1897
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:49,840
cortex

1898
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,880
uh you're not talking about cortex uh so

1899
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,800
you know that's but the principle

1900
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,640
remains you know that this

1901
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,280
i i i don't want to concede the point

1902
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,760
that it only becomes conscious once it

1903
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,080
modulates something else and that that's

1904
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,159
really where the contents and qualities

1905
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,199
are

1906
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:10,080
that's a sort of theoretical reluctance

1907
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,800
on my part you can see why

1908
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,760
but more importantly and more tellingly

1909
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,199
uh it is the evidence uh when you look

1910
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:21,199
at these kids

1911
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:24,400
they have no cortex so their efforts

1912
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,040
can't be modulating

1913
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,040
it can't be the result of something that

1914
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,239
the brainstem is doing to cortex

1915
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:35,280
because there ain't no cortex and yet

1916
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,080
you know there's all the evidence that

1917
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,400
they have affects um

1918
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,480
and so i think uh as much as surprising

1919
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,199
as it may be uh you know it's it's it's

1920
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:48,960
not consistent with our normal way of

1921
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,679
thinking about cortex and it's also not

1922
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,560
something that i'm wedded to the idea

1923
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,400
that that that you know anything is

1924
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,480
generated in anything

1925
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,440
but the evidence suggests that certainly

1926
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,080
uh the modulatory influence that the

1927
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,480
reticular activating system has over the

1928
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,199
cortex true as it is important as it is

1929
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,520
fundamental as it is to how that system

1930
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,400
works

1931
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,199
um

1932
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:16,640
that the affects are not a product of

1933
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,880
the modulation of cortex

1934
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,679
the effects are generated in the

1935
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:23,679
subcortical structures and if you just

1936
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,000
take a step back and

1937
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,719
the the implication of that

1938
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:29,760
is that

1939
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,480
well maybe there are affects

1940
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,040
in vertebrates who don't have cortex in

1941
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,679
other words maybe affects are not the

1942
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,960
exclusive preserve of mammals um and

1943
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,520
actually that seems pretty likely it

1944
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,679
seems pretty darn likely

1945
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:46,480
that

1946
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,360
non-mammalian vertebrates have aspects

1947
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,120
and again you know when you start

1948
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,800
looking at the evidence it's pretty darn

1949
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,159
good that they do

1950
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:57,600
so um i i'm happy to accept everything

1951
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,040
that you're saying about let us not

1952
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,719
forget that this is a system which is

1953
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,560
deeply interconnected with other systems

1954
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,040
that its primary function is to modulate

1955
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,400
other systems

1956
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,040
but all i'm saying is that when it comes

1957
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,480
to cortex

1958
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,880
it's not that the affects themselves are

1959
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,520
not generated by the modulating of

1960
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,239
cortex that doesn't mean that there's a

1961
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:21,120
disembodied brain

1962
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,280
or disembodied reticular activating

1963
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,080
system but you can have a decorticated

1964
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,320
reticular activating system

1965
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,560
and it can generate effects

1966
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,040
nonetheless

1967
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,880
thank you mark dave do you wanna thanks

1968
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,159
go

1969
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,000
okay so

1970
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,320
one thought i see that the

1971
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,080
the comments in the chat line have they

1972
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,960
been dealt with can i move on

1973
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:45,920
yes

1974
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,159
let's try to get to at least one other

1975
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,239
of these important points

1976
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,400
oh well this is a brief point

1977
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,640
um you know the reason i'm making this

1978
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,080
point

1979
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,320
um about affect not being synonymous

1980
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,880
with with interceptive inference is

1981
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,320
because those few people uh working

1982
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,640
within the active inference framework

1983
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,719
who are not corticocentric and happily

1984
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:10,800
they are increasing you know there's

1985
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,360
there's uh

1986
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,960
people who worked within this framework

1987
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,360
they had no reason to question you know

1988
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,520
all of the mainstream assumptions of

1989
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,400
cognitive neuroscience as far as as far

1990
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,280
as

1991
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,719
cortex is concerned um the the

1992
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:29,760
the but

1993
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,520
slowly um it's become apparent uh that

1994
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,679
affect uh is is uh is an important topic

1995
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,600
that we we're not only talking about

1996
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,000
perception and action and cognition uh

1997
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,840
you know we're talking also about

1998
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,800
affective processes and and about

1999
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,040
you know body regulating processes and

2000
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,480
so on um in fact the whole of

2001
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,920
self-organization uh

2002
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,600
you know has to do

2003
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,840
with the regulation of the of the own

2004
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,239
body and you know the whole notion of

2005
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,400
self-evidencing systems and so on you

2006
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,120
know

2007
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,400
so so this is happily slowly coming

2008
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,760
uh

2009
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,760
and increasingly coming uh

2010
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,480
into the mainstream of

2011
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,120
um the af people working within the

2012
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,640
within the sort of active inference

2013
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,920
framework

2014
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,120
um but

2015
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,960
the the the dominant view within that uh

2016
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,400
school of thought

2017
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,560
is that affect

2018
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,679
is to the internal body uh what

2019
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,719
perception is to the external world in

2020
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,239
other words extraception uh

2021
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:40,719
is uh it is a perceptual inference

2022
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:44,080
regarding uh things going on outside of

2023
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,040
me

2024
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,480
and affect uh is perceptual inference

2025
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,199
about things going on inside of me

2026
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,199
um and that's you know

2027
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,120
if that were so that would be nice and

2028
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,120
simple um but i i don't see it that way

2029
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,760
so uh and the the perhaps the

2030
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,480
outstanding proponent of the view

2031
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,520
that affect is intraceptive inference is

2032
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,360
a neil seth

2033
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,080
and he's just brought out a a really

2034
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,640
very good book um

2035
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,360
i have it right here

2036
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,800
here it is

2037
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,080
being you

2038
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,520
um you know which which is predicated on

2039
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,600
on on that view

2040
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,320
so because it's because i agree with him

2041
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,440
about so many things i i think that

2042
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,239
it's easy for people to conflate our

2043
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,480
views and to imagine that what i'm

2044
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,800
saying is the same as what he's saying

2045
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,080
on this score

2046
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,080
so i want to make clear that

2047
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,840
i'm not saying the same as what he's

2048
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,560
saying on the score that why do i think

2049
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,520
that affect is not

2050
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,199
the same as perception uh it's but but

2051
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,760
rather interceptive perception

2052
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,640
um

2053
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,719
well

2054
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,920
first of all

2055
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,800
because there are many interceptive

2056
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,640
perceptual states which are not

2057
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,920
effective

2058
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,600
so you know you can

2059
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,560
you can

2060
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,800
perceive this the the your heart rate uh

2061
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,239
the beating of your heart you can

2062
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:16,239
perceive uh your

2063
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,480
your respiration

2064
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,600
rate or the or the the the the the

2065
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,199
inspiring and expiring uh of air from

2066
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:29,199
your lungs you can perceive gurgling uh

2067
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,440
in your tummy which is an unequivocally

2068
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,400
visceral

2069
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,440
state

2070
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,280
and all of these things you can perceive

2071
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,000
them indifferently you can perceive them

2072
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,040
without any affective valence

2073
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,880
or quality at all

2074
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,199
so if affect were synonymous with

2075
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,600
interceptive inference then why are

2076
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,159
these common and garden examples

2077
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:54,239
of interception not effective

2078
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:55,520
and then

2079
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,280
secondly

2080
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,360
if affects were intraceptive perception

2081
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:04,000
how come so many affects are generated

2082
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,880
by extraceptive events

2083
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:07,840
where

2084
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,400
there doesn't seem to be any clear

2085
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,840
interceptive

2086
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,679
driving force so for example pain

2087
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,679
which is a fairly

2088
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,080
simple example of an affect you know you

2089
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,239
stick a pin in my finger it comes from

2090
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,719
the outside and it penetrates the you

2091
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,030
know the nociceptors in my extraceptive

2092
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:31,280
[Music]

2093
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,120
nervous system

2094
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,080
and

2095
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,159
i feel this intense affect called pain

2096
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,840
so that's extraception and yet it's

2097
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:43,440
effective um the same applies to

2098
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,840
surprise you know due to fright you know

2099
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,480
you get a you get a you get a you get a

2100
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,159
shock um

2101
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,920
well in fact electric shock is another

2102
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,639
one but these are but i i mean just you

2103
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,040
know fright something unexpected happens

2104
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,280
outside of you and you startle

2105
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,639
and there's a there's a there's an

2106
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:02,480
affect that goes with that a particular

2107
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,400
type of disgust is another one you

2108
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,600
imbibe something um that tastes smells

2109
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,480
bad and you wretch it up with this

2110
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,600
terrible feeling of disgust

2111
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,520
and then they're more

2112
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,520
and they're not purely entirely

2113
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,040
non-bodily affective states like

2114
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,760
missing somebody you know missing your

2115
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,800
brother

2116
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,719
it's clearly affective

2117
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:29,360
and there's nothing bodily about it

2118
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,560
so

2119
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,639
and nothing intercepted about it when i

2120
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,719
say nothing bodily i mean particularly

2121
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,560
you know it's not it's not about the

2122
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,760
state of your intraceptive

2123
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,000
visceral processes

2124
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,120
so i'm saying there are interceptive

2125
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,480
visceral processes which we perceive

2126
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,800
which are not effective

2127
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,760
and they are affective processes uh

2128
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,239
affective states that we

2129
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,120
experience which are not interreceptive

2130
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,880
so i don't think that we can say that

2131
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,280
affect is interceptive inference that

2132
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,840
it's the same as external perception

2133
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,960
except it's directed toward the state

2134
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,520
the internal state of the own body

2135
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,320
i think that it's something else

2136
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,239
and i don't say this to be difficult

2137
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,040
you know i'm

2138
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,400
i'm actually

2139
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,920
quite uh

2140
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,719
concerned that those few of us within

2141
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,639
the active inference framework who are

2142
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,600
recognizing the importance of affect uh

2143
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,800
can't agree on this point because uh you

2144
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,760
know

2145
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,679
they're few enough of us you know who

2146
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,560
recognize the the importance of africa

2147
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,040
so i'm i'm just wanting to make clear

2148
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:48,719
why i think that it's not merely a kind

2149
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,239
of mirror image reflection um of of

2150
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:55,600
extraceptive uh uh inference and then i

2151
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,159
want to add one last point which is that

2152
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,920
when you read

2153
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,159
i mean everything that i'm going to go

2154
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,960
on to argue about why

2155
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,280
extraceptive perception remember what i

2156
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,040
said at the very beginning about

2157
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,440
cortical vision having been the model

2158
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,840
example of where we will find the neural

2159
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,600
correlative consciousness which has led

2160
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,679
us down this blind alley

2161
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:21,440
and and got us got us into such uh such

2162
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,960
a mess

2163
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,400
that that

2164
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,320
it has to do

2165
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,719
largely as i'm going to argue later with

2166
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:31,360
the fact that cortical processes and

2167
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,960
perceptual processes are not

2168
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,199
intrinsically conscious things you can

2169
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,800
perceive

2170
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,320
the world

2171
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,400
through all your extraceptive modalities

2172
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,040
vision included at the cortical level

2173
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,360
too you can perceive the world without

2174
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,679
perceiving it consciously in other words

2175
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,760
extraceptive inference

2176
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,440
perceptual inference is not an

2177
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,480
intrinsically conscious process

2178
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,560
there's nothing about extraceptive

2179
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,719
inference or perceptual inference that

2180
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,679
that requires consciousness to for us to

2181
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,040
understand the mechanisms at work and so

2182
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,280
if interceptive inference is just the

2183
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,840
same thing applied to the interior of

2184
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,320
the organism it suffers all the same

2185
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,520
problems

2186
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,520
that it's it's not clear

2187
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,760
why it becomes conscious

2188
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,000
um and i said that's going to be my last

2189
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,360
point on the school but in fact i

2190
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,120
realized there's one more that i want to

2191
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,480
make which is that um the vast vast

2192
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,360
vast majority of our intraceptive

2193
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,920
processes are unconscious

2194
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,159
um i mean even more so than our

2195
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,159
extraceptive processes

2196
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,960
most of our regulation of our visceral

2197
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,760
bodily economy happens autonomically we

2198
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,520
know nothing about it

2199
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,239
so um it would be again a very curious

2200
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:49,840
place to find uh the um this the

2201
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,719
essential mechanism of of consciousness

2202
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,120
and in this case of affect

2203
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,080
if

2204
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,400
the majority of the mechanisms of this

2205
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,840
kind in fact do not operate consciously

2206
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,120
and if it suffers the very same problems

2207
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,400
as

2208
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,760
our extraceptive um

2209
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,080
using using vision as a as a model

2210
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,639
example using any form of perception i

2211
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:15,600
think

2212
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,719
as a model example of consciousness is

2213
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,199
to make a mistake because consciousness

2214
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,639
is not an afferent process

2215
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,120
consciousness is an endogenous process

2216
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,440
it's something generated

2217
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,520
not from within the guts

2218
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,560
but from within the core of the brain

2219
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,920
and uh

2220
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,400
that that's where we're going next

2221
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,960
so i'll stop there for any any uh

2222
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,960
comments on that point before i move to

2223
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,520
the next one

2224
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,480
great presentation important

2225
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,840
distinctions and points

2226
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,679
so indeed we'll take a breath

2227
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:58,719
and

2228
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,400
i think we can head on to the next one

2229
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,400
okay thanks

2230
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,000
so now

2231
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,360
um

2232
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,840
i've told you in relation to the point

2233
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,199
i've just made

2234
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,120
i i think that

2235
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,040
uh the hard problem

2236
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,800
uh of consciousness

2237
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,320
has arisen uh in large part

2238
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,679
from the

2239
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:22,800
uh

2240
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,159
example that we've used of consciousness

2241
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:28,400
starting with crick

2242
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,800
who has to be credited with

2243
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
bringing consciousness into

2244
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,840
center stage uh so you know i'm not i'm

2245
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,400
not bashing crick um and i also have

2246
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,000
said already i think it's perfectly

2247
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,239
reasonable that he started where he did

2248
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,960
um you know it's clear why he started

2249
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,800
with visual perception as his example

2250
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,239
where we should look for the neural

2251
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:53,120
correlate of visual consciousness

2252
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,520
and then distinguish you know

2253
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,440
unconscious vision from conscious vision

2254
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,880
and then there we have it then we have

2255
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,560
the neural corumat and then we can

2256
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,840
generalize from there um i'm saying that

2257
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,760
it turns out that was an unfortunate

2258
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,000
place to start and it links with what i

2259
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,840
was saying earlier that's also why i'm

2260
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:10,639
saying

2261
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:13,440
i don't want us to make the same mistake

2262
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,080
just just just turning it inwards and

2263
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,600
saying we're dealing with perceptual

2264
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,800
processes

2265
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,000
so let me let me say why all of this

2266
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,199
casts new lights on the hard problem

2267
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:28,320
um yeah so yes chalmers the person who

2268
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,320
formulated the hard problem in the very

2269
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,719
paper that he formulated it and he says

2270
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:34,480
what makes the hard problem hard and

2271
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,719
almost unique is that it goes beyond

2272
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,960
problems about the performance of

2273
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,639
functions

2274
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,639
to see this note that even when we've

2275
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,400
explained the performance of all the

2276
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,120
cognitive and behavioral functions in

2277
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,360
the vicinity of experience they may

2278
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,199
still remain a further unanswered

2279
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,159
question

2280
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,159
why is the performance of these

2281
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:57,360
functions accompanied by experience a

2282
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,440
simple explanation of the functions

2283
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,679
leaves this question open why doesn't

2284
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,920
all this information processing go on in

2285
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,719
the dark free of any inner field so this

2286
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:08,000
is a

2287
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,360
core

2288
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,800
aspect of chalmers's hard problem he's

2289
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,960
saying that our normal

2290
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,520
way of going about doing cognitive

2291
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:18,880
neuroscience

2292
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,520
where we take a mental

2293
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,800
phenomenon and we say okay uh you know

2294
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,600
let's see uh you know

2295
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,600
which part of the brain needs to be

2296
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,120
damaged in order to

2297
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,560
disrupt this

2298
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,080
this mental uh state and then you know

2299
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,560
let's start piecing together what the

2300
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,639
what this part of the brain does and how

2301
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,800
it works and uh

2302
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,480
next thing we end up with a wonderfully

2303
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,560
complicated map

2304
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,760
of all of the mechanisms at work

2305
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,360
in in this case

2306
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,400
using

2307
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,320
the standard example

2308
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,400
visual perception

2309
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,800
thomas's point is that you can do this

2310
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,719
this is standard the standard approach

2311
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,360
in cognitive neuroscience

2312
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,440
but it doesn't tell you why there is

2313
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,360
something it is like to see

2314
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,159
so

2315
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,480
you can you know the famous knowledge

2316
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,480
argument with mary the visual

2317
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,719
neuroscientist she knows everything that

2318
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:17,520
there is to know about the functional

2319
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,639
mechanisms of visual perception but she

2320
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,400
knows nothing about what it's like to

2321
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,679
see

2322
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,480
in in the in the in the example that

2323
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,800
jackson or the story as jackson told us

2324
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,040
you know she's never seen color but you

2325
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,159
know i i like to extend and simplify his

2326
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:35,840
arguments and just say she was born

2327
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,040
blind

2328
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,560
she knows everything there is to know

2329
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,480
about the functional mechanisms of

2330
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,239
vision but she's never experienced

2331
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:43,440
vision

2332
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,199
and if one day

2333
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,199
she's blessed with

2334
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:49,520
the gift of sight she will learn

2335
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,239
something utterly new about vision

2336
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,800
namely what it is like to see what

2337
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,800
redness is like what cleanness is like

2338
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,719
and so on and this is their argument the

2339
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:00,400
argument is

2340
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:01,199
that

2341
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:03,520
the normal uh

2342
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,480
way we proceed in cognitive neuroscience

2343
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,440
namely to dissect the function uh and in

2344
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,159
this way to explain uh the mental thing

2345
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:14,560
that we're trying to explain works very

2346
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,400
well for all of these

2347
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,639
mental functions but it doesn't work

2348
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,040
very well it doesn't work at all for

2349
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,040
consciousness

2350
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,679
consciousness

2351
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,280
defined as

2352
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,040
what it is like

2353
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,440
to perform these functions

2354
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,239
so

2355
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:33,760
uh they're

2356
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,920
claiming chalmers is

2357
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:39,360
and nagel and others of that ilk

2358
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,719
that somehow

2359
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:43,199
the consciousness is in a different

2360
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,520
realm uh from every other mental

2361
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,159
function because you know when you when

2362
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,400
you've explained all the functional

2363
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,600
mechanisms

2364
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,480
you still are left with this epistemic

2365
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,520
gap

2366
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,880
between that explanation of the function

2367
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,520
and the qualitative experiential

2368
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,040
phenomenal feel of seeing

2369
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,159
and

2370
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:09,199
so i'm saying that the problem is that

2371
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,679
they're using perception

2372
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:14,400
as an example perception is not an

2373
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,520
intrinsically conscious function

2374
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,480
and indeed cortical perception is not

2375
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,480
intrinsically conscious

2376
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,159
that it is demonstrably the case that

2377
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:29,600
the cortex can perform uniquely cortical

2378
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,360
perceptual

2379
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,280
operations

2380
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,360
like

2381
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,600
actually recognizing color you can

2382
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,320
recognize color unconsciously and you

2383
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,480
can recognize faces unconsciously you

2384
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,440
can read words unconsciously so

2385
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,320
um if the cortex can do all of this

2386
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,199
perceptual and cognitive gymnastics

2387
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:52,880
without consciousness i think it's

2388
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,040
perfectly reasonable to say well why

2389
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,040
doesn't all this information processing

2390
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,760
go on in the dark without any inner feel

2391
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,000
because that kind of information

2392
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,120
processing can go on in the dark without

2393
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,320
any inner feel a perceptual inference is

2394
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,840
not intrinsically conscious

2395
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,560
so

2396
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,159
this uh

2397
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:17,199
statement of chalmers is this really

2398
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,840
a strong statement where he says there

2399
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,560
is no cognitive function such that we

2400
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,120
can say in advance that explanation of

2401
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,440
that function will automatically explain

2402
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,080
experience this is this is what he says

2403
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,239
on the basis of

2404
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,239
everything that i've just told you

2405
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:35,120
that

2406
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,120
this is the this is this is where he's

2407
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,080
led he's saying that they you that

2408
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,639
explaining the function can never

2409
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,960
explain experience

2410
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,440
if that's the case we're in big trouble

2411
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,159
because consciousness is somehow you

2412
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,480
know going to have to be dealt with in a

2413
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,000
different way from everything else in

2414
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,400
science

2415
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,880
but if you change that word cognitive to

2416
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,239
affective

2417
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:02,239
um traumas

2418
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,320
would charmers have said this there is

2419
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,639
no affective function such that we can

2420
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,120
say in advance that explanation of that

2421
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,880
function will automatically explain

2422
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,080
experience

2423
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,639
i'm saying of course there is

2424
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,360
the function of feeling

2425
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,520
i am saying in advance

2426
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,920
that explanation of the function of

2427
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,639
feeling will automatically explain why

2428
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:26,960
it feels like something because that is

2429
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,880
the function of feeling the function of

2430
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,560
feeling is for the organism to feel it

2431
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,719
that to feel its own state

2432
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:37,679
so i'm saying had we begun there had we

2433
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,639
begun our quest uh for

2434
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:42,639
the neural correlate of consciousness

2435
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,600
with this model example had we had we

2436
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,080
begun by asking

2437
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,199
why

2438
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,679
and how does it come about

2439
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:52,560
that

2440
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,920
feelings are experienced i think that we

2441
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,480
would have had a much less hard time

2442
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,639
with it than

2443
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,400
we have had

2444
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,880
with starting with with visual

2445
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,440
information processing the mechanism of

2446
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,320
vision

2447
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:11,040
the mechanism even of cortical vision is

2448
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,440
not intrinsically conscious it does not

2449
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,600
automatically explain experience because

2450
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,440
it does not automatically have to be

2451
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,799
experienced but the mechanism of feeling

2452
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,199
you cannot explain

2453
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:28,320
how feeling works why feeling exists

2454
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,320
what it's there for if you have a

2455
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,480
functional account of feeling it would

2456
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,480
have to account for why it feels like

2457
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,320
something in other words why it's

2458
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,360
experienced so i think that

2459
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:42,480
what i said in my earlier point that um

2460
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,960
that um

2461
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,000
yeah

2462
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
that these facts uh uh cast new light on

2463
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,480
the hard problem uh the this is the new

2464
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,440
light that

2465
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,400
that it casts i just have also uh on the

2466
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,400
screen this slide

2467
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,639
this famous review paper by killstrom

2468
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:05,360
which summarizes all the experimental

2469
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,560
evidence

2470
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,280
for

2471
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,040
the conclusion that we were led to

2472
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,159
actually a good four decades ago already

2473
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:14,480
that perception without awareness of

2474
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,520
what is perceived is perfectly

2475
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,760
commonplace and learning without

2476
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,840
awareness of what is learnt is perfectly

2477
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,000
cognitive and perceptual functions

2478
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,920
performed by the cortex are not

2479
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,360
intrinsically conscious processes so

2480
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,840
this question of chalmers is why is the

2481
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,360
performance of these functions

2482
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,600
accompanied by experience why doesn't

2483
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,760
all this information processing go on in

2484
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,320
the dark that perplexity is not

2485
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,320
difficult to understand

2486
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,760
in light of

2487
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,119
those facts

2488
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:49,199
but i don't think that this question has

2489
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:51,440
anything like the same

2490
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,400
gravity

2491
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,199
uh when you apply it to

2492
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,679
the kinds of mechanisms that give rise

2493
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:00,880
to feeling i'm saying in short that if

2494
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,360
mary was an affective neuroscientist

2495
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:06,000
rather than a cognitive neuroscientist

2496
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,960
or a visual neuroscientist

2497
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,840
she could not know everything that there

2498
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,920
is to know about the functional

2499
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,520
mechanisms

2500
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,000
underpinning feeling without

2501
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,080
expecting that it will generate

2502
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,159
something that is experienced

2503
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:23,360
without

2504
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,679
without the mechanism necessarily

2505
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,639
accounting for why it is experienced and

2506
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:30,880
this is why i think at shifting our

2507
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,320
focus from cortex to brain stem and from

2508
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,960
perception to affect um has big

2509
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,280
implications for

2510
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:40,560
our

2511
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,080
ability to

2512
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,560
finally come to grips with this hard

2513
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,800
problem of consciousness

2514
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,199
i'll pause there again thank you

2515
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,119
thank you mark i'll read a comment in

2516
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,119
the chat and then you can respond then

dean writes

2519
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:00,639
pre-arousal plus awareness minimum of

2520
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:01,600
two

2521
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,679
not as brain geography or territory

2522
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:06,000
establishment effort rather

2523
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,440
a dance

2524
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,280
in an evolving relationship as we might

2525
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,800
see in an agent dancing with the

2526
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,360
environment whereas the territorial view

2527
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,760
might examine control

2528
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,400
brain stem of the cortex or vice versa

2529
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,960
one in an in controlling relationship

2530
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,719
through a mechanical lens

2531
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:24,639
this relationship of arousal and

2532
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:29,199
awareness could be choreographed but not

2533
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,880
choreographed mechanized but not

2534
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,800
necessarily choreographed

2535
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,639
not sure what that part meant our

2536
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:37,440
feelings a residue of arousal plus

2537
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,280
awareness revealed

2538
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,440
we accept the signals like we dance out

2539
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,840
a path

2540
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,639
generated

2541
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,639
look i think that this is similar to the

2542
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:48,480
point that we were discussing earlier

2543
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:52,080
you know about um generated in uh you

2544
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,600
know the upper brain stem as opposed to

2545
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,719
the upper brain stem modulating other

2546
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,719
other other structures

2547
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,520
whether they be

2548
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:05,600
above or below the brain stem in the

2549
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,400
nervous system

2550
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,600
i said then i'm very happy to think of

2551
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,679
it as a dance uh as something

2552
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,760
choreographed where it's not a matter of

2553
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,560
whose master and whose servant you know

2554
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:21,440
um that that's a is it's a

2555
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,040
when it comes to the relationship

2556
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,639
between the affective arousal um and and

2557
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,199
cortical

2558
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,679
representation i think that there's some

2559
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:33,360
instances where

2560
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,719
affective arousal just absolutely um

2561
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:40,320
brushes aside any amount of uh decision

2562
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,719
making and thought processing and

2563
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,679
conversely uh the opposite happens too

2564
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,679
you know that there clearly are ways in

2565
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:50,000
which where one can

2566
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,040
in a top-down way modulate affect

2567
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,480
dramatically

2568
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,480
and i don't only mean you know regulate

2569
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,119
your emotions i mean if you look at some

2570
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:00,639
of these examples of these buddhist

2571
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:03,119
monks who are able to you know really

2572
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:04,800
massively control

2573
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,760
autonomic functions and and the affects

2574
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,480
that normally would go you know with uh

2575
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:14,880
not breathing or walking on uh you know

2576
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,639
painful um

2577
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:19,280
surfaces and so on that those affects

2578
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,560
seem to be overridden so

2579
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,040
i have nothing against the idea of there

2580
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,360
being a choreography

2581
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,800
between

2582
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,719
brain stem and cortex

2583
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:32,000
but

2584
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,040
i've already said why i think

2585
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,920
that in this instance the affects do not

2586
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,679
require the cortex

2587
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:41,119
to be

2588
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:44,800
actually qualify for the name affect

2589
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,119
that they actually are felt without

2590
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,360
cortex i've already said why

2591
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,280
what the evidence is

2592
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:54,080
both in terms of

2593
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,119
studies

2594
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:58,080
of uranus studies using the various

2595
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,679
methods that i mentioned

2596
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,920
the most dramatic being as i said cases

2597
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,159
where there is no cortex and yet there's

2598
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,440
evidence that

2599
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,040
there's there's plenty

2600
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,400
of affect there

2601
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,639
but also the evolutionary implications

2602
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:13,280
of that which is that we don't have to

2603
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,239
wait for the appearance of cortex

2604
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:19,040
and the mammalian series for uh that for

2605
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,199
the for the dawn of consciousness that

2606
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:24,400
if if if affect is generated in the

2607
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:28,560
subcortical structures uh then um affect

2608
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,840
uh it does not require cortex and affect

2609
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,320
is a it can be um

2610
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,080
can be uh

2611
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,360
attributed

2612
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,040
to

2613
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,280
other vertebrates and not only

2614
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,600
vertebrates by the way there also is

2615
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,360
good evidence that

2616
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,199
some invertebrates

2617
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:48,560
are conscious

2618
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,199
of the octopus is the famous the most

2619
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:53,280
famous example

2620
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,440
um but i think that there's a further

2621
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,119
problem in this comment you know which

2622
01:41:57,119 --> 01:42:00,239
has to do with the word awareness um you

2623
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:03,760
know you speak of arousal and awareness

2624
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,880
and you seem to attribute arousal to

2625
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,880
particular activating system which i'm

2626
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,719
happy with

2627
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:13,280
and awareness to cortex which i'm not so

2628
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,960
happy with if

2629
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,199
if if you mean that

2630
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:19,600
you cannot be aware of arousal

2631
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,080
without cortex so i think this word

2632
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,000
awareness it's like all the other words

2633
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,520
i mentioned at the beginning like

2634
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,360
emotion and affection and i said i want

2635
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,199
to i want to use the word feeling to

2636
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:31,040
make clear what i'm talking about

2637
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,960
because these words mean different

2638
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,040
things to different people the word

2639
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,360
awareness means different things to

2640
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,080
different people and to to many people

2641
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,480
it seems to mean something like

2642
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,800
reflective awareness

2643
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,960
in other words you know

2644
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,440
in other words being aware of what

2645
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,920
you're aware of

2646
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,239
or access consciousness

2647
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,000
as ned block calls it you know that

2648
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,679
there's this sort of phenomenal

2649
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:59,199
consciousness which is some kind of like

2650
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:01,280
a raw consciousness and then there's a

2651
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,000
then there's a subject that that

2652
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,360
accesses

2653
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,360
this information it's it's like the

2654
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,920
global workspace theory works that i

2655
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,960
mean it's pretty similar sort of idea

2656
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,159
um if if we're going to reserve the word

2657
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:18,400
awareness for that higher order thought

2658
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,880
or reflective consciousness or access

2659
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,360
consciousness

2660
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:27,440
then it means that we can't attribute um

2661
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,320
awareness to raw fields

2662
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,400
uh and um

2663
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,360
you know

2664
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,360
that's that's an odd use of the word

2665
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:39,040
awareness to me um to me how can you

2666
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:40,400
feel pain

2667
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,880
without being aware of it you know and

2668
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,000
um

2669
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,199
and pain

2670
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:47,040
um you don't need to have any kind of

2671
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,040
reflective cognition about it you don't

2672
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,320
need to have any explanatory labeling uh

2673
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,280
or anything it's just like that's

2674
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,920
so and you pull away even if you don't

2675
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,000
have language even if you're not human

2676
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,760
even if you're not a mammal

2677
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,639
even if you're another kind of creature

2678
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:07,280
so um i

2679
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:13,280
arousal for me implies uh awareness um

2680
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,880
in the way i use the word but um if if

2681
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,480
we're going to use awareness for

2682
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,040
that higher order type of consciousness

2683
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,280
then i would just want to remind you

2684
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,800
that there are other types of

2685
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,080
consciousness

2686
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,679
that don't possess that kind of

2687
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:30,719
awareness

2688
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:33,119
which nevertheless have something it is

2689
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:37,040
likeness um and and the core of that

2690
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,880
quality is feeling

2691
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,880
that something it is like this is

2692
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,800
feeling

2693
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,159
thank you mark stephen

2694
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,119
yes thank you um

2695
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:52,480
so i was wondering if we think of um

2696
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,000
consciousness as a kind of an

2697
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,480
integration of our accent action

2698
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,760
expectations of what's happening

2699
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:00,880
and

2700
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,199
those expectations then were

2701
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:05,119
and casper hesp talks about this with

2702
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:07,360
his work with active imprints but

2703
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,400
is how

2704
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:11,119
those expectations were weren't met can

2705
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:12,560
be effective

2706
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,880
um so i was wondering within that kind

2707
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,480
of that prediction process um

2708
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:19,760
when someone

2709
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:22,000
gets a question right so you have a

2710
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,719
mathematician when they get it right

2711
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,560
they get a feeling that it's right it's

2712
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,800
like it's a felt sense

2713
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,440
and you could ask someone what's that

2714
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,520
feeling like and they can sort of bring

2715
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,520
out a metaphor landscape

2716
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,840
that relates to that like it can

2717
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,679
actually have a structure

2718
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:41,920
and there's a similar thing with pain as

2719
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,199
well pain

2720
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,360
has to be expressed as a metaphor you

2721
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,119
have to say it's like a stabbing or it's

2722
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:47,760
a

2723
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,639
throbbing or it's a it's always some

2724
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:52,080
kind of

2725
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,560
dynamical kind of metaphorical

2726
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,880
embodiment

2727
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,520
so i'm just curious um

2728
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,920
has these you know this embodiment this

2729
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:03,520
meeting

2730
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,560
in this brainstem uh how you

2731
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,639
how you how you see that in terms of if

2732
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,040
that's congruent with you and

2733
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,239
whether this this is then uh sort of a

2734
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:16,560
re-reimagining

2735
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,880
consciousness is like a reimagining of

2736
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,920
these

2737
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,400
of these expectations

2738
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,760
um and it can

2739
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:27,119
it could go up or down

2740
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:28,880
in terms of how that

2741
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,199
is being kind of

2742
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:33,839
realized

2743
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,560
so i'd like to separate out two

2744
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:41,119
different aspects of what you're saying

2745
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,639
um

2746
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,600
the the first has to do with metaphor

2747
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,119
and um

2748
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:48,960
i think that

2749
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,760
that

2750
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:51,360
may be true

2751
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,600
of um

2752
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:54,400
of

2753
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,960
being able to report or declare your

2754
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,679
conscious states in language uh that

2755
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:02,080
somehow or other you have to symbolize

2756
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,880
because language is is just that

2757
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,840
it's a symbolic

2758
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,480
representation

2759
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:09,920
of the

2760
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,920
thing itself

2761
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,880
um

2762
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,800
so

2763
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,199
that as long as you you you use the word

2764
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:18,800
expressing it

2765
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,440
yes you can't express

2766
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:22,560
in words

2767
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,119
and emotion without using some sort of

2768
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:26,239
metaphor

2769
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:29,920
some sort of symbolic system in order to

2770
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:35,119
be able to communicate it to others

2771
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,440
they can of course be the direct

2772
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,400
behavioral effect of display expression

2773
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,040
of the emotions in darwin's sense of the

2774
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,880
use of that term uh that which we then

2775
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:47,840
um

2776
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:51,920
us symbolic species um you know we

2777
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:56,080
we we use that symbolically uh too

2778
01:47:56,080 --> 01:48:00,480
but um i i don't think that the raw

2779
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,119
feeling itself has to be

2780
01:48:04,119 --> 01:48:06,719
re-represented in any way i think it can

2781
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:07,840
just be

2782
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:12,320
the raw feeling um without it being

2783
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,840
represented

2784
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,639
in in in any language in the broader

2785
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:18,480
sense of the word

2786
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,360
and so i don't think that metaphor

2787
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:22,159
is

2788
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:25,199
a necessary component of the core

2789
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:26,560
feature

2790
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,880
of feeling

2791
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,719
then the other thing you were saying

2792
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,480
which had to do with

2793
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:35,760
uh with surprise uh uh if i understood

2794
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,040
you correctly

2795
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:40,639
um i i i i

2796
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:43,760
at times in my own thinking about this

2797
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,600
there were times when i was keen on

2798
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,199
thinking about

2799
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:53,040
affect or linking affect more with error

2800
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,960
signals than with

2801
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,880
than with inferences themselves um the

2802
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,480
and that was you know

2803
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,440
i was thinking along those lines because

2804
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,159
so many people within the active

2805
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,080
inference framework

2806
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,760
were speaking

2807
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,159
about perception you know this famous

2808
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:14,880
phrase controlled hallucination that

2809
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,880
perception is fantasy

2810
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,320
that it is the it is the upshot of the

2811
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,400
predictive process

2812
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,520
um and uh what worried me about that is

2813
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:26,880
the very thing i've been banging on

2814
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,199
about all along you know which is that

2815
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:31,119
perception is not

2816
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:33,040
intrinsically conscious and so this

2817
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:36,000
business of inferring

2818
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,520
the source

2819
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,239
of your sensory signals

2820
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:42,800
doesn't explain why there's something it

2821
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:47,280
is like to infer the the source uh uh

2822
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,560
of your or

2823
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:51,440
the cause uh of your of your

2824
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:54,719
sensory signals and so so so from that

2825
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:57,520
sort of point of view um i've i found

2826
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,639
myself thinking well it it's not so much

2827
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:02,639
that you know i mean imagine if what you

2828
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:04,960
perceive is just what you predict that

2829
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,040
that that would be you know bloody

2830
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:10,400
dangerous um so the controlled aspect

2831
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,239
seemed to me to be the more important

2832
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:15,520
aspect it's the it's the constraint on

2833
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,040
what you predict um that seems to be

2834
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,800
more the upshot of what we call

2835
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,840
perception as as opposed to

2836
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,480
hallucination and so i i wanted to place

2837
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,920
the emphasis

2838
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,280
um more

2839
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:30,639
uh on

2840
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:32,960
on the error side of things

2841
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,199
than on the than on the prediction side

2842
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:36,320
of things

2843
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,360
um

2844
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:40,480
but subsequently i i have changed my

2845
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:43,650
mind uh on on that score um

2846
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:44,800
[Music]

2847
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,040
for which will become clearer you know

2848
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:50,000
when i when i get down here where is it

2849
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,880
uh when i get down here um which we're

2850
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:55,360
obviously not going to get to today uh

2851
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:57,920
but i'm i'm very much looking forward to

2852
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,760
us having a second meeting where we can

2853
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:02,880
get there for me uh it's it's got

2854
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,320
everything to do

2855
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:05,280
with the

2856
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:09,440
uh with the modulation of confidence in

2857
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,960
the prediction uh versus uh the area

2858
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,520
signal or the error signal that is that

2859
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,000
that is connected with uh that

2860
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,800
particular prediction um and and i will

2861
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,400
just say it now because we're not going

2862
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,880
to get to it in this meeting um that

2863
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,520
that the pithy formulation

2864
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,679
of the way that i see it

2865
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:32,239
is that it is good

2866
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:35,840
when things turn out as expected and it

2867
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,199
is bad when uncertainty prevails and i

2868
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:43,040
mean here goodness and badness um in as

2869
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,280
in the in the evaluative sense of the

2870
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:49,119
word that is linked to the primary um

2871
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:51,440
value system of all living things you

2872
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,880
know which is that it is bad to die and

2873
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,280
it is good to survive and if things are

2874
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,199
turning out as expected in other words

2875
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:00,880
you have a prediction

2876
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,400
which actually

2877
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:04,000
cuts it

2878
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,679
that that is good

2879
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:08,719
from the viewpoint of the organism um

2880
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:11,280
and that if things are not turning out

2881
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,480
as expected and uncertainty is uh

2882
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:17,199
prevailing that is bad uh

2883
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:19,679
it means you know this this is likely to

2884
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:21,119
end in tears

2885
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:23,199
and so um

2886
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:24,000
the

2887
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,440
the the

2888
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,360
the uh

2889
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,960
what was it the choreography that

2890
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,719
somebody with the dance that somebody

2891
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:33,199
else was talking about earlier and i

2892
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:35,119
think that what

2893
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:38,000
that that the the crucial thing here

2894
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,040
is the is the is the palpating of the

2895
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,440
precision uh the modulating of the

2896
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:47,040
precision uh in the predictions uh uh

2897
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:50,000
over the error signals uh and that that

2898
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,159
is at the heart of what affects all

2899
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:54,960
about and i'm only saying that now uh in

2900
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,639
advance because i know we're not going

2901
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:59,679
to get there in in this meeting because

2902
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:01,920
we've only got seven minutes to go

2903
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,560
but i'm going to try if i may just

2904
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,400
unless there any further questions and

2905
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,719
comments are there any further questions

2906
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:10,480
and comments

2907
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:13,360
no here are some future comments it

2908
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,280
takes many oh they are so then if

2909
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:17,679
they're hostile something

2910
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:20,000
i think what we should do is i'll take

2911
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,480
i'll take whatever comments remain or

2912
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:25,119
questions and then we'll start next time

2913
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:27,199
with this point because i don't think i

2914
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:28,719
can squeeze it in

2915
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,560
to i don't think i should even try to

2916
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,840
squeeze it into to too short at a time

2917
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,440
period so

2918
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:36,880
totally agree

2919
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:41,280
yeah that was my comment was uh we will

2920
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,920
have a last few minutes

2921
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:44,639
to

2922
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:46,639
really just appreciate you coming on for

2923
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,639
the 16.1 and we'll find the time to do

2924
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:55,040
16.2 when we will condense and sort of

2925
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,440
reflect on what has already transpired

2926
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,360
and look forward to these next

2927
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:01,119
points i think it was really

2928
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:02,239
great

2929
01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:04,239
to walk through it this way

2930
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:05,280
so

2931
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,840
stephen or dave do you have any last

2932
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,520
thoughts otherwise mark

2933
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:12,080
please have a last thought

2934
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,320
so dave first then optionally stephen

2935
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,760
and then mark

2936
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:18,480
yeah in addition to professor seth whose

2937
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:22,400
book we already have who else can we uh

2938
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:26,800
check with as people doing ai without

2939
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,719
the um

2940
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:29,440
the

2941
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,920
the constriction

2942
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,679
with without which you mean with you

2943
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:36,000
mean who else is working on affective

2944
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,560
processes within within this

2945
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:39,960
exam

2946
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:41,520
[Music]

2947
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,320
so

2948
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:45,360
um two people who come to mind

2949
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:46,880
immediately

2950
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,840
is manos sakiris

2951
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:00,320
they

2952
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,840

to say that i appreciate having the um

2982
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,639
i mean it's not every day that you have

2983
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:20,000
two hours uh with with with excellent

2984
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,199
minds uh to be able to talk about only

2985
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:25,199
half of what you wanted to talk about so

2986
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:28,400
it's been very kind of you uh to

2987
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,400
um to um

2988
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:33,520
give me this this this latitude uh and i

2989
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,440
think that these issues

2990
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,440
and i'm also particularly pleased that

2991
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:40,080
you're going to be in one way or another

2992
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:40,800
uh

2993
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,440
recording and i don't just mean video

2994
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:46,000
recording but also turning into some

2995
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,159
sort of written form uh what we're

2996
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:51,119
talking about because as i hope you can

2997
01:56:51,119 --> 01:56:54,320
see from what i've said just in half

2998
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,560
of what i wanted to go through is really

2999
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:57,840
are pretty

3000
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,800
basic issues for for consciousness

3001
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,800
science and for the science of the mind

3002
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:03,840
and for

3003
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:04,719
and

3004
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:08,320
and by implication uh for what we can do

3005
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:12,559
within this active inference framework

3006
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,520
in tackling these

3007
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,360
really i don't mean to be hyperbolic

3008
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:20,159
when i say these profound and ancient

3009
01:57:20,159 --> 01:57:22,639
problems i think that we have real

3010
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:25,199
prospects of being able to make

3011
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:28,560
significant progress um on on these

3012
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,679
fronts and so it deserves is the point

3013
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:34,080
i'm making it deserves the time that

3014
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,320
that we are giving it and i'm grateful

3015
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:41,040
to you for um for recognizing that

3016
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,679
well sir thank you very much thanks

3017
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:46,800
