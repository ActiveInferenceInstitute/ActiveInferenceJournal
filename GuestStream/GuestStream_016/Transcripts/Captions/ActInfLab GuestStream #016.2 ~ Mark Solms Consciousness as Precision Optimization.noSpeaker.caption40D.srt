00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,408
Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:12,012
This is Active Inference Lab Gueststream
number 16.2.

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,382
It is June 11th, 2022.

4
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,018
We're here with Mark Solms.

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,854
This is the second part
in our discussion.

6
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,057
We had an awesome part one today.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,459
We are going to have a recap

8
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,996
on some of the points
that were addressed in the first part.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,831
In 16.1.

10
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:35,668
And then we're going to head
into some unexplored territory

11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,773
So, Mark, thanks so much for joining
for these sessions.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,142
And please take it away.

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,443
Thanks, Daniel.

14
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,179
Glad to be here again.

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,348
I was just

16
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,618
testing out, sharing my screen
a minutes ago, and it seems as if

17
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:55,755
I'm incapable of showing you my face
and sharing my screen at the same time.

18
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,590
So take a good look at me.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,093
You're not going to see me for a while.

20
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,796
Here comes my screen. Please, God,

21
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,333
there we are.

22
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:08,601
Great.

23
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,972
And here comes my pointer.

24
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,542
There we are.

25
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,977
And here's my title.

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,015
The emphasis is on physiological

27
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,518
and philosophical considerations
rather than computational ones.

28
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,292
So I'll start with a brief recap.

29
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,762
I made a few claims,

30
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,165
and I didn't get to the end of this list,

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,436
so I will just remind you
what those claims were.

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,907
And then I will pause when I get to
the point that we stopped at lost time,

33
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,843
which was here.

34
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,812
That effort
is an extended form of homeostasis.

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,283
I started with the claim,
which really is the main claim

36
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,553
of my of my presentation.

37
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,389
It is that affect feeling

38
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,259
is the foundational form of consciousness

39
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,928
and that it is intrinsically conscious.

40
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:14,567
I quoted Freud, who more than anyone else

41
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,304
introduced the notion into mental science

42
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:23,042
that mental processes
are not intrinsically conscious,

43
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,080
that much of our cognitive processing
goes on unconsciously.

44
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:32,952
And even he made this point,
the point that I'm making,

45
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,390
which in his words was that
it is surely of the essence

46
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,893
of an emotion
that we should be aware of it.

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,329
That is, that it should become known
to consciousness.

48
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,700
Thus, the possibility
of the attribute of unconsciousness

49
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,472
would be completely excluded as emotions,
feelings and ethics are concerned.

50
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,908
And I emphasize the word feelings

51
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,712
because there's a whole lot of reasons
why some people claim

52
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,616
that they all such things as unconscious
emotions and unconscious affects.

53
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,086
So just to be absolutely clear
what I'm talking about here.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,289
I'm talking about feeling.

55
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,925
And you can't have
an unconscious feeling.

56
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,094
In other words, you can't have a feeling
that you don't feel

57
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:20,633
So whatever might be meant by unconscious
emotions and unconscious affects

58
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:25,939
and that they can't apply to feelings,
they can't be unconscious feelings.

59
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,641
But that might

60
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,612
sound like a semantic point,
just a matter of words

61
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:36,149
that you can't have the feeling
that you don't feel that's an oxymoron.

62
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,686
So I then went on to set out

63
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,188
various reasons, empirical ones,

64
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:47,560
why the claim that feelings
are intrinsically conscious

65
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,831
also has a solid empirical basis.

66
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,236
I I drew attention to this discovery

67
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,038
that was made in 1949 already

68
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:05,511
that the brain mechanisms
for consciousness itself.

69
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,548
In other words, what wakes us up

70
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,651
in the morning
and puts us to sleep at night,

71
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,054
the sort of switching on and off
of the lights of consciousness

72
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,224
that this is the business
of the reticular

73
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,761
activating system,
the reticular activating system

74
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:27,300
is the brain system
for arousing consciousness,

75
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:33,273
for activating cortical processes
and rendering them conscious.

76
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,376
I also mentioned the Perry Aqueduct
to Gray

77
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:42,015
which plays a and, and also it also plays
a crucial part in all of this

78
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,918
together
with the reticular activating system.

79
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,887
But I'll come back to that later.

80
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,257
For now, let's just focus
on the reticular activating system

81
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,260
to give you a sense of what I mean by

82
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,430
how these structures are they.

83
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,035
Their intrinsic function is the switching
on of the lights of consciousness

84
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,272
I, I pointed out
that you can make a lesion

85
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:11,411
or you can suffer a lesion as small
as two cubic millimeters in size.

86
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:16,382
In the para brachial complex
of the reticular activating system.

87
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,752
In other words, a lesion
the size of a match head.

88
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,623
And that is enough in human beings
reliably

89
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,192
to obliterate consciousness entirely.

90
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,496
So I was saying
let's look at these structures

91
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:35,001
and if we wanting to understand
something of the intrinsic consciousness

92
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:40,106
generating mechanisms of the
brain and I made the point

93
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,443
that if the cortex,

94
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,512
which is where we normally shine
the light in terms

95
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,350
of looking for the neural correlates
of consciousness, if the cortex were

96
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,854
the seat of consciousness, then there's
an easily testable prediction,

97
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,926
which is that if you have a case
in which there is no cortex,

98
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,329
then the patient should not be conscious.

99
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,164
Not so.

100
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,802
Therefore, I showed you one such case
and this is one

101
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,606
representative example of its type

102
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,177
that shows a patient born with no cortex.

103
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,313
The condition is called dren.

104
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:24,384
And carefully here
you see in an MRI scan of the brain

105
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,821
that where cortex should be
there is just cerebrospinal fluid.

106
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,891
And you see that
a brain stem is perfectly intact.

107
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,262
So on the view that this brain stem area

108
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:40,366
is where the consciousness is generated,
that it doesn't require cortex

109
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,270
this is a critical case
on the brain stem view.

110
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,006
She should be conscious on the cortical
view.

111
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:47,740
She should not.

112
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,043
And yet she is and she is conscious.

113
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,645
As you can see.

114
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,515
She wakes up in the morning,
she goes to sleep at night

115
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,051
in the sense that the lights are on.

116
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,221
But much more interestingly,

117
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,791
she's not merely blankly awake.

118
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,459
She hurt her.

119
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,163
Her her wakefulness has a content
and the quality

120
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:15,435
and the quality that I'm talking about
is affective quality.

121
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,138
You see how she responds to her
baby brother being placed on her lap?

122
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,874
She responds with some form of pleasure.

123
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,846
And so there's there's a content
to this mental state

124
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,882
and a quality to this mental state
that she's displaying

125
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,152
Why that's important is

126
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,889
because when we first learned in 1949

127
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,324
that the reticular

128
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:42,528
activating system is prereq
was it for all consciousness that there's

129
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:47,633
no such thing as cortical consciousness
without brainstem arousal of the cortex,

130
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,872
that we had the view
that the cortex provides the qualities

131
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:57,343
and the contents of consciousness
and the reticular activating system.

132
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,812
Mary merely provides the the,

133
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,616
the quantitative dimension,
the sort of level of consciousness.

134
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,219
So it's as if this was a power supply

135
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,422
like a television
set needs to be plugged into the wall.

136
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,893
The reticular activating system
is the prerequisite sort

137
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:18,064
of booting up of the system,
but the television set itself

138
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:22,435
the cortex where the contents
and qualities of consciousness

139
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:27,240
are processed could still be claimed
to be the seat of consciousness.

140
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,476
And the reticular activating system
merely as a

141
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,679
and as a power source.

142
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,416
This is why it was important
to point out that this child

143
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,987
is not only conscious
in some blank sense of wakefulness

144
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:46,259
without content and quality,
but rather that she displays efforts.

145
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:51,163
She's emotionally responsive to her baby
brother being placed on the lap

146
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:56,569
just as this child, who also has no
cortex, is emotionally responsive.

147
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,739
Yeah, you can see she's responding
with pleasure

148
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,942
to a stimulus,

149
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:08,080
and this is quite generally the case
for these children just beyond MCAS.

150
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,650
Summary of his observations.

151
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,920
In many, many, many such children,
they express pleasure,

152
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,256
they smile, they laugh,
they show aversion and fussing.

153
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,959
By arching their backs and crying.

154
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,595
Their faces are animated
by these emotional states.

155
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:26,465
They build up sequences, they smile,
they giggle, they laugh, they show

156
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,734
great excitement.
ET cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

157
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:30,603
So I've

158
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:36,242
highlighted all of those words to show
that these two cases that I just showed

159
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:41,547
you with no cortex, they are conscious
and they are responsive,

160
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,617
and in particular,
they are emotionally responsive.

161
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,820
And on this I base the claim

162
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,591
that these children

163
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,795
do have a quality,
that they do have a consciousness.

164
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,031
And this consciousness does
have a quality and it does have content.

165
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,101
Many people look perplexed
as to how this could happen,

166
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,236
since they have no cortex.

167
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,671
How can they respond

168
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,474
to things like their baby
brother's been placed in their laps?

169
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,444
And so I just inserted this slide.

170
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:16,415
I don't think I showed it last time,
just to point out that our sensory

171
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,285
and organs he has the example is the eye.

172
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,655
Same applies to two to the skin

173
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,725
and two to hearing and taste as well.

174
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,560
The the

175
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,296
optic nerve that

176
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,667
projects to the lateral genic Nicollet
and from there to the visual cortex.

177
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:39,605
But not only to the visual cortex,
it also projects subcortical

178
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,777
to the superior calculi
of the midbrain of the brainstem,

179
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,147
which is immediately
adjacent to the peri aqueduct

180
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,017
gray, which I said earlier
I was going to mention again.

181
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,755
So these children receive information
in the brainstem

182
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,892
which is not conscious,
it's not cognitively conscious perception

183
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,829
that conscious perception
is generated in the cortex,

184
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,600
but unconscious sensory
information goes into the brainstem

185
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,705
where it is responded to consciously
by the emotional structures

186
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,708
that are the main focus

187
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,744
of what I'm talking to you about now.

188
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,548
And of course many of you

189
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:28,020
and like many of my colleagues,
will reasonably say, well,

190
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,791
how do you know that there's something
it's like to be those children?

191
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,961
These might just be reflexes or instincts
and these

192
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:41,067
these might be the equivalent,
these kids of philosophical zombies.

193
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:41,567
In other words,

194
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,603
they look as if they're conscious,
they behave as if they're conscious.

195
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,239
But we can't know that
they're actually conscious.

196
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,276
And so last time I tried to address

197
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,512
this, this objection

198
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:58,117
by drawing attention
to what happens in cases

199
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,087
who lose great swathes of their cortex

200
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:05,624
and are able because they haven't
lost all of their cortex,

201
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,028
they are able to describe to us
what it's like to be them.

202
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,629
This is one way

203
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,233
of getting around the objection
that because these kids have no cortex

204
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,404
and therefore can't declare
their conscious states,

205
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,173
we can't be sure that they have
conscious states.

206
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,976
So I focused first of all on the case

207
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,380
who has a massive lesion
of the prefrontal cortex.

208
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,550
The reason I did
that is because this is a favorite

209
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,220
part of the

210
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,190
cortex for those who claim
the cortex is the seat of consciousness,

211
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,261
like the global work space theorists,
they say it all comes together

212
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,863
in the prefrontal lobes.

213
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,066
All of this information
that's processed in the posterior

214
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:52,438
cortices is re represented
or accessed in the global workspace.

215
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:57,243
And this this is where the center
in being the subject of the mind

216
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,644
comes about.

217
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:03,048
And I pointed out last time
that if that were the case,

218
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,152
then where again,
we have a falsifiable prediction,

219
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,456
a patient who has no prefrontal cortex
like this patient of mine,

220
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:15,094
a patient w he has no prefrontal cortex,

221
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,963
but he has a sliver of language cortex.

222
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,933
He if, if his sentient being

223
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,103
was was contingent upon

224
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,305
the integrity of prefrontal cortex,

225
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,809
he should not have sentient being.

226
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:35,514
And so I showed you what it's like I talk
to him about what it's like to be him.

227
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,350
He claims to be consciously
aware of his thoughts.

228
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,720
I ask him to imagine something
for me to imagine

229
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,558
a two dogs and a chicken,
to see them in his mind's eye.

230
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,093
Then I asked him to count the legs.

231
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,697
I thought this would be a reasonable test
of whether he's actually got

232
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,299
conscious mental imagery.

233
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:57,469
And please note the person
I'm talking to refers to himself as I am.

234
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,907
So he seems to think that he exists
as a safety and being and I ask him

235
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,611
how many legs they are in total
if you have two dogs and one chicken.

236
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,280
And to my disappointment, he said eight.

237
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,716
And when I questioned his answer,
he answered.

238
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:14,153
He pointed out that in his mind side
the dogs at the chicken.

239
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,224
And so I thought that was
maybe not a great joke,

240
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,694
but it certainly suggested
that there was somebody at home.

241
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,598
And I made the point
last time that these patients,

242
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,667
generally patients
with massive frontal lesions

243
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,872
and that this tendency to make Purell

244
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:37,209
jokes is considered to be a rather common

245
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,647
part of the frontal lobe syndrome
or the frontal lobe personality

246
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:46,051
and this is part of the bigger story
that I mentioned last time, which is that

247
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,856
these patients are generally quite
emotionally disinhibited

248
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,927
and why that's important is because,
remember, what we are considering

249
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,697
here is the question
as to whether the feelings

250
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:03,068
that you saw in those patients
those kids with no cortex

251
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,237
where whether

252
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,840
those feelings could be generated
in the brain stem.

253
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:12,845
And the claim of the of
of cortical centric theorists

254
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:17,349
like Joe Ledoux, for example,
is that the feelings literally come about

255
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,421
when they are registered to re
represented or labeled or even named.

256
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,991
Some people claim that it's only once you

257
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,461
are able to re represent this

258
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:34,667
this these subcortical survival circuits

259
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,172
in a declarative consciousness in

260
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,676
prefrontal lobes, that this is literally
what brings the feeling about.

261
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,377
And I think it's quite

262
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,114
interesting that these patients
who have no prefrontal cortex

263
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:53,085
and don't have a dearth of feeling,
which is what you would expect

264
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,755
if the machinery that brings feelings
about is absent,

265
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,891
then they shouldn't
be able to have feelings.

266
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,861
But in fact what is generally accepted
is these patients have an excess

267
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,496
of feelings and

268
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:05,965
there's the

269
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,667
disinhibited emotionality
in these patients

270
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,138
I made much the same argument about

271
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,709
the the other major

272
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,945
cortical area that is associated

273
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:26,185
with the symptom and self,
and that is the insular cortex.

274
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,355
Of course, this is associated
above all with the work of Bud Craig.

275
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:35,260
But has been very widely accepted
that the feeling self comes about when

276
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,198
when one's the state of one's

277
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,469
intercept of a body is,

278
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,339
is, is re represented in insula cortex.

279
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,642
And so again,
we have the falsifiable prediction.

280
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,547
If you take a case who has no insula
cortex like this patient of DiMaggio's,

281
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:00,452
then there should be no
and self at present.

282
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,556
And I showed you this interview
where Damasio speaks to him

283
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,091
about his sense of self

284
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:10,062
and the patient is perfectly adamant
that he exists as a self.

285
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,332
He speaks about
himself as I, I, you know,

286
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,934
and it ends.

287
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,738
This interview ends with Damasio
saying You're aware that I'm aware.

288
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:23,542
And the patient be says, I'm aware
that you're aware that I'm aware,

289
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,547
you know, or, and,
and this patient just like my patient w

290
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,384
is not deficient in emotionality.

291
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:37,056
In fact, all the basic emotions
are present, including

292
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,026
both bodily affects and emotional affects
and sensory affects.

293
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:46,231
And not only that, he's
also a little too emotional.

294
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,102
And this is a little disinhibited
in his emotionality.

295
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:54,940
And this is what we quite generally
see with patients with insula lesion.

296
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,845
So again, it's very hard to sustain
the argument that the self actually comes

297
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,815
into being in the cortex

298
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,085
now of course,

299
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,655
those two cases,
those examples of the kinds

300
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:13,459
patients with massive frontal
cortical lesions, passive patients

301
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:18,630
with massive internal lesions,
of course they are just examples.

302
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,801
But the point is the point I'm making now

303
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:27,739
is that the there's lots of cortex
left in those cases.

304
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,010
So the argument is, well, you know,
maybe this

305
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,748
the and subject is generated
in the remainder of their cortex.

306
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,953
And it's a bit of a it's a bit
of a circular argument because remember,

307
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,056
the children do have no cortex

308
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,493
and we're told, well, how do we know that

309
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,461
that they're conscious, they can't report

310
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,198
their conscious states are
then gave these two outstanding examples

311
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,602
looking at the areas of cortex
that are most bound up

312
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:02,541
with with a sentence subjectivity
according to cortical theories

313
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,477
of consciousness and these patients

314
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,981
seem to have intact
a sentence subjectivity.

315
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,251
But now I'm told
well you know the remainder of the cortex

316
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,121
might be what's
what's generating the consciousness.

317
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,991
So we can't use only lesion methods.

318
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,193
There's no way out of that impasse.

319
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:25,230
And so I then showed you last time
evidence of a different kind

320
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:30,035
and I showed you
what happens if you stimulate reticular

321
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:36,008
activating system nuclei and there again,
there's a there's an easily

322
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,877
tested prediction.

323
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,647
The prediction is that
if these brain stem nuclei

324
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:45,617
that would kill activating system
in Perry Aqueduct, as I'm claiming,

325
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:50,422
if these are the structures
that generate consciousness and feeling,

326
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,458
then stimuli lation of these structures

327
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,761
should stimulate conscious feelings.

328
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,332
And I showed you that he has a case
who had a steep

329
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,803
brain stimulator placed into this
substantia nigra this this part of her

330
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,307
reticular activating system
and within 5 seconds

331
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,877
it's it generated

332
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,781
it produced a profound depression.

333
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,850
The patient was actually suicidal.

334
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,653
She didn't want to live anymore.

335
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,356
This is a patient
with no psychiatric history.

336
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,793
The electorate was placed
in her brain stem

337
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:32,965
for the treatment of Parkinson's disease
and and stimulated the wrong nucleus.

338
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,634
And that's how this came about.

339
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,638
90 seconds
after the stimulator was switched off,

340
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:45,077
the depressed feeling disappeared
and the patient generously agreed

341
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,313
to allow for further stimulation

342
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,450
in the reticular activating system.

343
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,351
And all of it.

344
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,921
And it was only when
that particular nucleus was stimulated

345
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,991
that that she fell into the depression.

346
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,861
So this is the kind of evidence
and remember, again, I'm just giving

347
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:03,695
you examples.

348
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,833
You can
stimulate intense affective states

349
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:13,171
by stimulating reticular
activating nuclei and peri aqueduct gray,

350
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:17,242
you get the greatest intensity
and the greatest variety of ethics

351
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,844
from stimulating there

352
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:22,080
and you get nothing of the kind
from stimulating cortex.

353
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:26,985
So this is a different line of evidence
suggesting that feelings

354
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:31,189
on actually generated
in the upper brainstem.

355
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,059
And then I showed you
another line of evidence

356
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:38,497
that was positron
emission tomography and of people

357
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,667
in intense affective states
and here you see

358
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,737
research participants
in states of sadness

359
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,341
here, of anger
here, of happiness here of fear.

360
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:54,212
And in all instances yes,
the activation is in the brainstem

361
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:59,017
and the circuits arising from it,
the subcortical circuits arising from it.

362
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,420
That's what we see

363
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,022
the cortex is

364
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,460
by contrast, largely deactivated.

365
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,331
So this is a further line of evidence
that the,

366
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:14,800
you know,
an entirely different line of evidence.

367
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,601
Remember,
with a lesion evidence that we got

368
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:20,605
deep brain stimulation evidence
here, we've got positron emission imaging

369
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,475
evidence that

370
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,378
the part of the brain
that's generating the feelings

371
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,581
is the part of the brain
that switches on the lights.

372
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,452
And this is why I'm claiming
that the basic

373
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,722
the foundational form of consciousness

374
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,791
and this prerequisite form is affect.

375
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,627
Affect
is the elemental form of consciousness.

376
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:47,132
A further line of evidence
is pharmacologic called manipulations.

377
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,103
If you tinker with the neural modulators

378
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,140
that are sourced in these reticular
activating nuclei

379
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,010
like for example, noradrenaline
or serotonin

380
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,014
or dopamine, all of which the source
delivered to your activating system.

381
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:03,949
Right.

382
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,718
Serotonin is, of course, regularly

383
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,790
pharmacologically manipulated
for the treatment of depression,

384
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,260
dopamine for the treatment of psychosis,

385
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,063
noradrenaline
for the treatment of anxiety

386
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,567
and noradrenaline is sourced in locus
release complex

387
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,538
serotonin in the RAF nuclei, dopamine
at least the one

388
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,474
that's important for psychosis
in the ventral tegmental area.

389
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,611
All of these are parts of the reticular
activating system.

390
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,614
If, if all that this system did
was switch

391
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:39,184
on blank wakefulness,
it might be of interest to anesthetists.

392
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,587
But in fact it's it,
it is the main target

393
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,090
of the drugs of psychiatrists

394
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:50,295
who are treating emotional disorders
by manipulating the chemistries

395
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,265
that are the source nuclei

396
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:57,936
for which are in the reticular
activating system so

397
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,771
on the basis of

398
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,608
all of that, I argued remember
that affect

399
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,712
is the foundational form of consciousness
and it's intrinsically conscious.

400
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,348
I said that feelings

401
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,517
we don't tend
not only on semantic grounds,

402
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm saying that feeling is the basic form
of consciousness.

403
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,391
The reason I'm saying
that is because the basic consciousness

404
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:23,895
generating tissues of the brain,
the reticular activating system,

405
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:30,001
which is prerequisite for the activation
of consciousness in cortex,

406
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,572
that this, that these structures
generate feeling,

407
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:38,009
that feeling therefore is prerequisite
it is foundational

408
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,213
for all forms of consciousness
are then made.

409
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:45,150
This is a sort of a sidebar.

410
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,952
The reason I went into this third

411
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:51,122
point
is that namely that the claim that effect

412
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,925
is not synonymous
with into receptive inference.

413
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:58,530
In other words, that it's not just
an intrinsic to form of perception

414
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:00,866
as opposed to

415
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:05,437
the extra receptive forms which have been
the major focus of consciousness

416
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:10,242
studies over the last few decades
and vision being the main focus.

417
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,844
I'm saying that effect is not.

418
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,515
And why I say this is because
this is increasingly being argued.

419
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,885
In fact,
it was argued by Bud Craig himself.

420
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:23,588
That effect is just into receptive
perception.

421
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:27,893
Is the perception
of the state of the own body

422
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:33,031
is the equivalent of the perception
of the outside world.

423
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,034
In the more typical form

424
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,671
or extra set, the form of perception
that's been equated with consciousness.

425
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,807
I made the point that there's
that there's good reason

426
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,277
to believe that effect isn't just a sixth

427
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,446
modality of perception.

428
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,449
And the evidence that I presented for

429
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:56,054
that was of various kinds for example,

430
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,824
that there are ethics
which are clearly not receptive.

431
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,361
For example,
getting a fright with being startled

432
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:08,934
or feeling pain when, when, when,
when you put this stuff into your finger.

433
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,370
These are all extra receptive forms

434
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,408
of stimulation,
and yet they arouse affective responses.

435
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:21,012
So an affect
clearly is not uniquely inter receptive.

436
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:25,584
And then I also made the point
that there are many inter

437
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,353
receptive perceptual states
which are not affective.

438
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,658
You can feel your tummy grumbling
or you can feel your heart beating

439
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,962
or you can feel your
your lungs expanding.

440
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,098
And these are not
intrinsically affective phenomena.

441
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,635
So the intercept of perception can happen
without affect

442
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:47,639
an affect can happen
without into receptive perception.

443
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,943
And so I was trying to draw a line
under the idea

444
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,046
that effect
is just another modality of perception.

445
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,718
I think that by detaching effect

446
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:04,022
from perception casts
some new light on the hard problem.

447
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,092
And so that's where I went next.

448
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,361
And I reminded you

449
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,097
that David Chalmers,
who coined the hard problem

450
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,367
said that when we look at

451
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,504
functions, perceptual functions
like vision,

452
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,340
which was, as I said, the model example

453
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:27,779
derived from the
or grounded upon the assumption

454
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,016
that consciousness
is a cortical phenomenon

455
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:35,954
and cortical vision became the model
example of consciousness.

456
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:40,425
This was following Crick's
initiative in the mid 1990s.

457
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,095
Crick's idea
was that if we can, if we can identify

458
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,732
the neural correlate of consciousness
in the case of cortical vision,

459
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,136
then we can generalize from that, that

460
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,773
by, by, by discerning the mechanism

461
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,677
whereby a visual information processing

462
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,580
gets turned into conscious vision
in the cortex.

463
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:08,319
By isolating that mechanism
we will be able to understand

464
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:12,023
the nature and function of consciousness.

465
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,959
And Chalmers said that that's not true.

466
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,230
If you, if you isolate, identify

467
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:24,102
the mechanism of visual information
processing like this map.

468
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,103
Yeah, it does.

469
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,807
It doesn't tell you anything about why
there's something it is like you see,

470
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,143
and he he used the

471
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:36,047
well known knowledge argument
to Frank Jackson,

472
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,284
the story about about Mary,

473
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:43,354
the visual neuroscientist
who knows everything about all of this.

474
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,725
And I slightly simplified the story
by saying,

475
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,427
well, let's
let's imagine that Mary is blind,

476
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:54,499
even though she knows everything
about the functions of cortical vision.

477
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:59,137
She knows everything about the mechanism
whereby visual information

478
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,839
is processed in the cortex

479
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,509
because she's blind, she knows nothing
about what it is like to see.

480
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,345
And if she were to be gifted

481
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,783
suddenly with a normal sight,

482
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,720
then she would learn something
completely new about vision.

483
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:18,656
She would learn what it is like to see

484
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:23,194
red and blue what blueness and redness,
et cetera, are like,

485
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,830
none of which is accounted for

486
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,533
by this information

487
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,505
processing flow diagram
and none of what she knew

488
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,441
about the functional mechanisms
of cortical vision

489
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,278
that would have prepared too
for what it is like to see.

490
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:45,016
In other words, there's other there's
there's something some something else

491
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,153
about visual information processing

492
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,256
other than the sort
of things that mechanistic

493
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:52,924
functionalist

494
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,560
dissections like this provide us with.

495
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,397
It doesn't that this
this mechanistic account doesn't predict

496
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,734
what that there should be
anything that it is like to see.

497
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:07,038
And this is the grounds upon
which people like Chalmers say

498
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:12,210
that a mechanistic and account
of the functional mechanism

499
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:16,080
of act,
cognitive and perceptual processes.

500
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,918
It doesn't tell us anything about why
there is something

501
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,388
that is like to do
to perform these processes.

502
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,024
And this is the essence
of the hard problem.

503
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,795
I said that I thought that this might be

504
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,399
because they were looking
in the wrong place, that visual

505
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,404
perception and, and,
and all forms of cortical perception

506
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,943
and indeed not only perception
but learning and cognition

507
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,780
more generally
that this can readily go on unconsciously

508
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,682
that these

509
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,151
are not
intrinsically conscious processes,

510
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:58,623
that it is perfectly possible
to see and to recognize faces

511
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:03,261
and to read with comprehension
and even to discriminate colors.

512
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,566
These are all uniquely cortical processes
and they can all go on

513
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,302
in the dark, as it were.

514
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,771
In other words,
you do not have to be conscious

515
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,441
of what you're perceiving
in order to perceive it.

516
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:22,447
And so this this costs
all the different light on Thomas's point

517
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,217
that all of this information
processing can go on in the dark.

518
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,421
So, you know, consciousness
this isn't accounted for

519
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:35,126
by our normal functionalist
and mechanistic, mechanistic

520
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,363
way of doing cognitive neuroscience.

521
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,634
So I was saying, well, that's
because they're looking at functions

522
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:47,639
like perception and functions
like learning, which which are not

523
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,409
these are not intrinsically
conscious processes.

524
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:55,113
And I drew your attention to

525
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,716
this other statement of Thomas's
from his famous paper

526
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,820
in which he says, In summary,
there is no cognitive function

527
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,324
such that we can say in advance
that the explanation of the function

528
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,726
will automatically explain experience.

529
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,362
And my point was, well, that's
because they're talking

530
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,264
about cognitive functions.

531
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,767
I could Chalmers make the same statement

532
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,969
if we were talking about

533
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,406
affective functions, I'm saying, no,
he could not.

534
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,510
I'm saying that we can say in advance

535
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,813
that explanation
of the function of feeling

536
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:34,185
will automatically explain experience,
because the function of feeling

537
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:39,490
is to feel it's intrinsically conscious
is this is this function

538
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,461
unlike vision and perception
in general and cognition

539
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,230
as a whole,
none of that is intrinsically conscious,

540
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:50,501
but feeling affective feeling
is intrinsically conscious.

541
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:55,239
You could not understand
the mechanism of affective feeling.

542
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,376
It didn't account for why
it feels like something

543
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,778
because that's
the whole point of feeling.

544
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,949
So this question of Chalmers is why

545
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,952
is the performance of these functions
accompanied by experience?

546
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,489
Why doesn't all this information
processing go on in the dark

547
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,358
free of any inner feel?

548
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,960
I'm saying that that question
is perfectly reasonable.

549
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:20,765
When asked of these cognitive functions
which are not intrinsically conscious,

550
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,901
that kind of information
processing can go on in the dark

551
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,737
free of any in the field.

552
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,173
But that is not true
of feeling, of affective feeling.

553
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,241
And so

554
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,377
my claim, and

555
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:36,681
this is where we got to last time,
this is now I'm now starting

556
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:42,954
with a new arguments about my claim,
is that if we can identify

557
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:47,325
the functional mechanism
of affect of affective feeling,

558
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:53,564
then we will be able to explain
why this sort of information

559
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:57,101
processing doesn't go on in the dark
so I hope that that's clear.

560
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,370
That's kind of like my main point.

561
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,241
My main point is we've been,
we've been looking in the wrong place

562
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,377
and we've been looking to cortical vision

563
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:10,014
and cortical perceptual
and cognitive processes in general.

564
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,318
And in order to isolate
the neural correlates of consciousness

565
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,588
and traumas, has said, well,
it doesn't work.

566
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,392
You can isolate the mechanism
whereby this sort of in these sorts

567
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:25,229
of information processing goes on
and it doesn't tell you anything about

568
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:29,100
why this is something
it is like to see, et cetera.

569
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:33,371
And so my argument is, yes,
that's true of those processes,

570
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,908
but it's not true of effort effect that

571
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,845
remember what
I've said to you in my summary, not today

572
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:45,750
that this is the most concentrated
consciousness generating tissue,

573
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,554
that there is the reticular
activating system and Perry Aqueduct

574
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,790
Gray is where the lights are switched on

575
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:58,062
and that the you need you can

576
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,399
switch those lights off

577
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:05,403
with as small a lesion
as two cubic millimeters in extent

578
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,673
so this is the place where we should
obviously have been looking

579
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:09,774
in the first place.

580
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,477
And in order to understand the

581
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,214
to identify the neural current
into consciousness

582
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,649
and to enter
and to understand its mechanism.

583
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,953
And and much more important than that

584
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:26,324
is the fact that
the kind of consciousness it generates

585
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,127
in that namely feeling is

586
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,730
it is it is an intrinsically conscious
mechanism.

587
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,735
That feeling
and it wouldn't exist if it wasn't felt.

588
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:43,574
And so unlike vision and
and learning and cognition in general,

589
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:48,546
which does not does not have to be felt,
that affect does have to be felt.

590
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,481
That's the whole point of effect.

591
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,684
So I'm saying that if we could understand
the mechanism of affect,

592
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,188
in other words, the mechanism
whereby feeling comes about,

593
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,358
then we might make some progress

594
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,427
with this hard problem of consciousness.

595
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,298
So remember,
that's how far we got last time.

596
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,769
And now I go on to an
I'm not going to slow down a little bit

597
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,006
because I'm now getting to argue,

598
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,607
try to

599
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,944
identify what
the functional mechanism of affect is.

600
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:24,248
But I thought perhaps before I do that,
I should pause for a moment in case there

601
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,919
any questions
arising from my summary of my argument

602
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,120
so far

603
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,892
it's good to carry on.

604
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,194
Thank you, Mark.

605
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,197
OK, thanks.

606
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,534
So might you see

607
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,571
I'm saying
effort is an extended form of homeostasis

608
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:53,277
and by the way, this is not my argument.

609
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,514
This is an argument
that was first to my knowledge,

610
00:36:56,514 --> 00:37:00,284
first introduced by Ansip in the 1990s,

611
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,720
subsequently

612
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,056
popularized

613
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,393
by Antonio Damasio
so I'm just summarizing

614
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,830
my version of what is in fact now

615
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,801
a good at 25 year old argument

616
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,471
what I mean is Stacey's is

617
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,976
probably the most basic
biological mechanism.

618
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:30,681
It could be said that homeostasis is what

619
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,751
enables living

620
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:38,489
organisms to resist the second law
of thermodynamics.

621
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:43,127
In other words, it is what enables them
to be living organisms

622
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,696
and they don't just dissipate

623
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,100
they remain in an organized form

624
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:53,738
and the basis of this is homeostasis

625
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:59,210
and that rather than just explore
all possible states

626
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:03,948
we living, things have to remain
within highly specific states.

627
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:08,386
And these are called the
the settling point

628
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,922
or the set point,
the viable ranges of the organism.

629
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,293
And this applies across
multiple different parameters

630
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,563
let me use the example of cool body
temperature.

631
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,800
For those of us
who think in degrees Celsius,

632
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:27,738
we have to remain between 36 and a half
and 37 and a half degrees Celsius.

633
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,241
That's where we need to be.

634
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:34,612
If we, if we deviate too far
from that very narrow range

635
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,715
then we are at risk of dying.

636
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,183
And that

637
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,020
doesn't apply only to temperature,
it applies to water,

638
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,724
to oxygen to salt,

639
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,960
to sugar, to blood pressure,

640
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:54,065
to all sorts of things about our,
our bodies.

641
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:56,934
There have to remain
within very narrow ranges

642
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:01,105
that are viable with the preservation
of out of our living state.

643
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,475
If we move outside of those ranges
in other words,

644
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:09,246
if we explore all possible states,
then we die.

645
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:13,451
So we have to work
against that dissipate.

646
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:18,923
If a trend, as I said,
that is this entropic trend.

647
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,493
We have to resist entropy and and

648
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,296
and remain within our viable states

649
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,432
and very narrow specific ranges

650
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:32,970
of of viability across these multiple

651
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,041
dimensions of our physiology.

652
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,411
And this is why I say

653
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,547
that homeostasis is what keeps us alive.

654
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,784
Now, a deviation from that

655
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,520
settling point
then becomes a demand for work.

656
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:53,224
The organism has to do something
to return itself.

657
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,326
To its viable bounds.

658
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,962
And that's the basic mechanism
of homeostasis.

659
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,665
That's
how all of those autonomic functions

660
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:05,102
I was talking about earlier
like core body

661
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,939
temperature and blood gas balance
and so on, that's how they work.

662
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,575
If you're moving outside of your range,

663
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,345
you have to do something
to retain yourself into the range.

664
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,647
That is what homeostasis is.

665
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:21,685
It's the it's the mechanism
that returns us back to our viable range.

666
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,923
Now, what I'm saying is that affect

667
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,893
is an extended form of homeostasis.

668
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,063
And how it extends homeostasis
is that when we move out

669
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,433
of our viable range, we feel it.

670
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,669
We feel an unpleasant quality.

671
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,940
That means
I am moving out of my viable range.

672
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,610
And by contrast, if you're moving back

673
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,314
towards your viable range,
you have pleasurable feeling.

674
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:55,953
And this seems to be the basic function
of ethics that enables the organism

675
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,990
to know how it's doing in terms
of its organism.

676
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,592
OK, viability.

677
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,462
So the organism feels

678
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,531
when it's moving outside of its viable
range

679
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,468
as unpleasant, which means this is bad

680
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:15,306
and it feels moving back
towards its viable range, back towards

681
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:19,310
its ideal settling point as pleasure,
which means this is good,

682
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:23,113
this predicts my survival, this predicts
my demise.

683
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:28,252
So feelings are rooted in a value system.

684
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,556
In other words, that there is
something good and there's something bad.

685
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,961
And what is good is to survive
and as it happens to reproduce

686
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,597
and what is bad is to not do so.

687
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,633
This is, of course the basic value system

688
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,436
that underwrites all of life.

689
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:49,907
This is the value system
that underwrites natural selection.

690
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,409
So the

691
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:56,247
feelings are rooted in that value system.

692
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:00,918
And what they do
is they enable the organism subjectively

693
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,921
the organism itself to know

694
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,557
whether it's
moving out of its viable bounds.

695
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:10,528
In other words, whether it's doing
something bad within that value system.

696
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,632
Or something good
within that value system.

697
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:19,136
That's what feelings do they enable
the organism

698
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:22,773
to know how they are doing
within that value system.

699
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:23,541
Now, why?

700
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,377
Why does this get added to homeostasis?

701
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,079
Because not all homeostasis is felt

702
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,516
that most homeostasis
is entirely autonomic.

703
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,954
And I was mentioning earlier
blood pressure, for example,

704
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:41,625
when you move out of your variable
range your heart rate changes

705
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,796
and your that
the your blood vessels dilate

706
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,933
in order to

707
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,869
return, you
to your viable blood pressure.

708
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,971
And you don't need to know.

709
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,373
In fact,
you do not know anything about it.

710
00:42:56,373 --> 00:43:00,144
And in fact, it's clinically notorious
how blood pressure regulation works

711
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,948
because you can be way out of your viable
bounds and know nothing about it.

712
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:07,952
And I'm just using blood
pressure is an example of that.

713
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:12,222
Then there are many,
many many ways in which your autonomic

714
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,692
nervous system

715
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:18,429
maintains you within your viable bounds
without you doing anything about it.

716
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,332
So why do we need to feel it?

717
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,701
Well, there

718
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,036
what feeling adds up

719
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:30,641
is when you are in a situation
of uncertainty and a situation

720
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,111
where you do not have a readily

721
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:39,316
a pre prepared reflex

722
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:43,320
which returns you
to your viable bounds so

723
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,658
you don't need to feel how you're doing
if you don't have to make any choices,

724
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,127
if you have automatic predictions

725
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,896
which return you by reflex,

726
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:58,068
like in the case of blood pressure
regulation that to your viable bounds,

727
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,537
then you you the sentient being

728
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,041
have no part to play in the process.

729
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:08,012
What, what,
where feeling comes into its own

730
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:11,915
is where the organism finds itself
in a state of uncertainty

731
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:17,454
for example in a novel situation
for which it's it's innate

732
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,991
pre wired as it were reflexes

733
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,261
have no have no preparedness

734
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,364
and you find yourself
in a state of surprise

735
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:31,769
and now what you're going to do and the

736
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:35,439
if there's no reflexive
solution available,

737
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,778
then a feeling enables
the organism to make choices.

738
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,814
The choices
have to be rooted in a value system.

739
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,816
There has to be a good choice
and a bad choice.

740
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,418
Otherwise it's random.

741
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,953
So whether you're doing the right thing

742
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,256
or the wrong thing is

743
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:57,194
is announced to you by how it feels

744
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,931
so this enables voluntary action.

745
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,902
I really must emphasize
that this enables you to choose.

746
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,971
It enables you to decide for yourself
what to do.

747
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,840
Things are getting worse.

748
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,875
So I'm going to change my mind.

749
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,277
Things are getting better.

750
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,612
I will stick with this policy.

751
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:19,817
This is working so these are not
these are not hardwired.

752
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,453
These are not innate predictions.

753
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:26,657
These are choices
made on the fly by the organism.

754
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:27,691
Here and now.

755
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:31,962
And they enable the organism
to survive in states of uncertainty.

756
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,098
In other words,
in unpredicted situations,

757
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:38,102
in other words, in novel situations
and God knows they are many of those in

758
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,703
life. So

759
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,172
just to put flesh to those

760
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:45,843
bones,
let me give you an illustrative example

761
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:52,015
and it's normally respiratory
control is autonomic risk.

762
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,651
You don't need to make any decisions

763
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,988
about breathing
it just happens automatically.

764
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:03,127
So you automatically remain
within your viable bounds

765
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:06,029
in terms of the ratio of oxygen

766
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,766
to carbon dioxide.

767
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,468
But that's only when the normal

768
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:14,171
autonomic reflexes

769
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:16,740
manage the situation

770
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,444
because you are in predictable
circumstances.

771
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:25,649
Now, imagine that you are in a carbon
dockside filled room.

772
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,553
Now suddenly you move out of your viable
bronze

773
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,458
bounds and breathing
normally normal reflexive regulation

774
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,629
of the of of your respiratory system
doesn't work

775
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,566
because ordinary breathing in this
in this carbon

776
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,270
dioxide filled room
is going to rapidly lead to your demise.

777
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,238
So now you've got to do something.

778
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:51,241
You've got to get you've got to
you've never been in a burning

779
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:54,244
building before,
let alone this particular one.

780
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:58,315
So you have no you have no reflex

781
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,885
or instinct,
no innate prediction as to what to do.

782
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,155
So you feel your
way through the situation.

783
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,892
And please note at this point,

784
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:12,930
at the point when you find yourself
in this unexpected situation,

785
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,567
this is where this is where your need

786
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,902
for oxygen becomes conscious.

787
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,672
So this is a very important point.

788
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,942
And otherwise autonomic function

789
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:28,045
now becomes a conscious function

790
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:33,617
and you feel what we call
air hunger or suffocation along

791
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,420
and you now you move

792
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:41,859
about in this building deciding
which way to go.

793
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:46,163
Remember, you have no
you know, prior knowledge of what to do

794
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,399
and it's only on the basis
of how it feels.

795
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:55,105
So if, for example, you go upstairs
and the oxygen supply diminishes

796
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:58,709
and you feel worse, air hunger,

797
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,045
if you go downstairs and there, there's

798
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,382
a greater provision of oxygen,
then you feel better.

799
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,619
You feel relief
from the suffocation along.

800
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:13,657
And so the feelings tell you whether
what you're doing is working or not.

801
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:18,128
And so your choices are based on feeling.

802
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:22,666
And so you are able to feel your way
through this problem.

803
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,768
And survive.

804
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:26,870
This is not a small advantage.

805
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:31,508
The ability to survive in unpredicted

806
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,912
environments
is an enormous adaptive advantage.

807
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,782
And so that, we believe, is
what the function of feeling is.

808
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:42,653
That's why in this narrow example, why

809
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:47,524
respiratory control suddenly becomes
conscious that that that it

810
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:50,694
dramatically intrudes on consciousness.

811
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,096
Suddenly your need for oxygen.

812
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,366
And the purpose of this is to enable you

813
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,568
to calibrate your choices

814
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:04,708
to to
to to change your mind about your policy,

815
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:08,145
your current policy on the basis
of whether it's working or not,

816
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,482
which is, which is exactly what
feeling announces for you.

817
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,585
In the absence of feeling

818
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,888
you would behave randomly and

819
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,925
one in a million will do the right thing,

820
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:26,563
and that one will survive and reproduce,
and the rest of you have had it.

821
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:31,068
So this enables us to make choices
within our own lifetime.

822
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:35,072
But we don't have to let natural
selection do it within our own lifetimes.

823
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,675
We can adapt to unpredicted situations.

824
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:43,380
And of course, once you've done that, you

825
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,250
then also can learn from the experience
within your own lifetime.

826
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,187
And so the next time you find yourself
in a burning building,

827
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:52,889
you might on the basis of,

828
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,592
of, of learning from experience,

829
00:49:56,193 --> 00:50:00,163
you might have somewhat less uncertainty
about what to do

830
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,467
so again, let me just make sure

831
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:08,638
that I'm getting across my main point,
because this is the mechanism of feeling.

832
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,607
This is the function of feeling.

833
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,342
This is what feeling does.

834
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,611
This is why the organism must feel it.

835
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:18,815
Now, remember what Chalmers had said
that, you know,

836
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,985
why doesn't all this information
processing go on in the dark and so on?

837
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,589
And that was built upon
an earlier argument by Tom Nagle,

838
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,792
who said an organism
as conscious mental states

839
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:32,662
if and only if there is something
that it's like to be that organism,

840
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,032
something it's like for the organism.

841
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:39,603
Then he went on to say, if we acknowledge
that a physical theory of mind

842
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,071
must account for the subjective

843
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:45,108
character of experience,
we must admit that no presently available

844
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:48,578
conception gives us a clue
about how this could be done.

845
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,082
So this is what I'm trying to do
in this talk.

846
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,218
I'm trying to give us a clue
about how this could be done

847
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:59,523
as this is enables
way of formulating a hard problem.

848
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:03,493
Why and how is this something
it's like to be an organism,

849
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,896
something it's like for the organism?

850
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,566
My point is that that question

851
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:14,237
only makes sense in relation to things
like visual information processing,

852
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:19,342
which it does not have to be something
it is like to to see

853
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,845
that does not have to be something.

854
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,614
It is like to discriminate
read from move.

855
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,250
You can do that unconsciously.

856
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,418
The cortex can do that.

857
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,186
Automatically.

858
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,222
That kind of information
processing can go on in the dark.

859
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,892
But would you would
would Thomas even have asked?

860
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,261
I mean, Nagle
even have asked this question

861
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,630
if we were talking about feeling,

862
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,433
I've just explained to you
what the function of feeling is,

863
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:47,904
and it makes it kind of absurd to ask why
and how is this something?

864
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:51,808
It is like to be an organism, something
it's like for the organism.

865
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,512
I hope that you can see what I mean, why

866
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:59,249
and how there is something
it is like to be an organism,

867
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:04,488
something it is like for the organism
has everything to do with feeling.

868
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,492
It feeling is, is what it is
like to be an organism,

869
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,328
how you're doing as an organism.

870
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:15,132
How much longer are you going
to remain in existence as an organism?

871
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,334
That's what feeling is like.

872
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:22,072
And, and this is why and how it exists.

873
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:26,676
So if we can get to what
the physical mechanism going back to what

874
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,313
to what to what Nagle was saying here
and he said,

875
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,083
if we acknowledge
that the physical theory of mind

876
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:36,486
must account for this
something that is likeness

877
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:40,657
then he's saying, we have to admit that
we currently have no clue

878
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,827
that I'm saying it's because
we've been looking in the wrong place.

879
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:49,533
I think if we look to feeling
and we seek a physical theory of feeling,

880
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,236
this will account for the subjective
character of experience

881
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,839
and we will make some progress.

882
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,943
This will provide us some clue
about how we might

883
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,213
go about solving this hard problem

884
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,117
so my next

885
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,219
point so let me pause at that point.

886
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,290
Having said that effect
is an extended form of a disease.

887
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,925
That's my next claim.

888
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:19,529
Let's see if anybody wants to argue the
toss or make a comment or ask a question.

889
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:20,964
Yeah.

890
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,667
So, Stephen, there's
no need to raise a hand after each point.

891
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,368
We'll take any questions.

892
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:29,139
So go for it, Stephen and then Dave,
if you have anything.

893
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,140
Thank you.

894
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,609
Yes, thank you.

895
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,177
Really, really enjoying this.

896
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,947
I'm interested in this awareness

897
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,417
that leads to the homeostatic

898
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,118
sort of correction.

899
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,588
And if it's where the awareness is with

900
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,157
the actual cells or organs

901
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:51,161
struggling in some way to act or enact

902
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:55,031
upon the surprise
or to be that in the environment

903
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,235
that they're encountering
at different scales.

904
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,738
So this this issue of actually action

905
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,741
or inaction
and when that action and inaction

906
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:06,710
can functionally

907
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,146
correlate up the nested hierarchies,

908
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,149
then it's those actions

909
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,287
or the inability
to act in the way that cells would like.

910
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,223
That then is becoming the signal

911
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,994
of what or where action is failing

912
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:28,331
rather than necessarily a signal of

913
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:32,102
that actually contains information
inherently in it.

914
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:35,138
I wonder what your thoughts
would be on that.

915
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,307
Yes, I agree.

916
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:41,544
If I'm understanding you correctly,
I agree with the emphasis on action.

917
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,547
So I'll I'll slightly run

918
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,750
ahead of myself if I say this.

919
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:50,420
Obviously, a homeostatic deviation

920
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,223
can also be construed
as a prediction error.

921
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,325
In other words, what you would

922
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:58,595
what you're doing has not led
to the outcome that was expected.

923
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,866
And the two ways
of correcting prediction errors.

924
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,269
And you can either you can either

925
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:10,940
change your prediction
or you can change what you're doing

926
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:14,177
in order to bring about the prediction
that you had originally.

927
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:19,249
In other words, and when it comes to
when it comes to prediction error,

928
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:23,453
you can either update the prior
and have a posterior prediction

929
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:28,491
or you got to do something differently
in order to confirm the prior prediction.

930
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,194
So that's where the emphasis is on
action.

931
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:35,198
Now, why this is so important
in relation to homeostasis

932
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:40,036
is that you can't change your prediction
about what your viable bones are.

933
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:44,941
You know, if you expect to be between 56
and a half and 37 and a half degrees

934
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:48,511
Celsius on the basis of acting
in a certain way, in other words,

935
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,781
a firing and autonomic reflex

936
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:55,318
and you then find yourself to be at 39
degrees Celsius.

937
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:56,553
You can't say, OK,

938
00:55:56,553 --> 00:56:00,924
my posterior prediction is that by doing
this I'll be 59 degrees Celsius

939
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:05,161
because if you do that, you're on that,
you're rapidly on the road to death.

940
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:10,233
So, so the emphasis, so
the prediction error has to be corrected

941
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:14,304
on the basis
of changing your action policy,

942
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:19,075
doing something different in order
to confirm your prior prediction.

943
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:23,546
So, so the emphasis is
very much on action when it comes

944
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:28,351
to these organism
predictions, these, these phenotypic

945
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,554
the the

946
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,758
viable states for your phenotype
can't be changed.

947
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:40,296
So you can't just up
you can't just change your mind

948
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:42,932
about what you expect
will flow from your actions.

949
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:47,370
You have to change your actions
in order to bring about the expected

950
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,240
or preferred state of your phenotype.

951
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,410
Thanks.

952
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,712
And I'll just add one piece to that.
I think that's really helpful.

953
00:56:56,246 --> 00:57:01,651
And also in terms of like multiple scales
going down to smaller scales.

954
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,255
So for instance,
if I actually feel heat in my body

955
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:11,227
and my body might be
my cells are trying to act

956
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:17,100
to find a better state that can be seen
as oppressive and claustrophobic.

957
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:22,472
If I then read that as being me
getting into an uncomfortable state,

958
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,242
it could also be me
basking in the sun on a beach,

959
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:31,514
you know, in the same way that if I taste
something that's very sour, there's

960
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,684
some sort of action at the cell or the

961
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:39,055
or the organ level
reacting to that sound.

962
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:45,094
So that sweetness, which could be like
a nice confectionery, sweet for a child,

963
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:48,298
you know, like one of these gob stoppers
or it could be quite a

964
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:49,899
problem.

965
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:52,402
So I think
I like what you're saying with action.

966
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:55,905
I was wondering whether that that action
piece is

967
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,845
the inaction is the prediction error
in terms of how it can go up in terms

968
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:06,583
of these these nested hierarchies
of of physical scale.

969
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:12,722
Yes. So again, I must be careful
not to run ahead of myself too much.

970
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:15,925
I mean, inevitably, you know,
you must ask whatever question comes

971
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:20,163
into your mind at any point,
but I am aware that as I go

972
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:25,568
down this list of of of arguments,
I'm going to be addressing those points.

973
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:29,038
So I don't want to make
all of those arguments in one go.

974
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:33,843
So I will just say that for now
that that what you've just asked has,

975
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:37,580
first of all, a lot to do with the fact
that we have multiple needs

976
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,650
that there's not only one needs,

977
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,286
that they have to be balanced in relation
to each other.

978
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:47,657
And also very importantly, that we're
talking about a predictive hierarchy

979
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,126
that this is

980
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:54,364
what you're speaking about with reference
to scale, that what applies

981
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:58,201
at the sensory periphery and what applies

982
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:00,970
at the core of the predictive hierarchy

983
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:06,609
have different implications
for the way that that affect works.

984
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,714
So I'm just saying those
very kind of vague and abstract things

985
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:15,018
for now, and I hope that the picture
will become clearer as I proceed.

986
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,186
Thank you, Mark.

987
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,923
Yes, Dave, go for it.

988
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:20,723
Yeah.

989
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,859
I don't know how to state this clearly.

990
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:26,829
This is some thinking that I got into
from listening

991
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,966
to a very recent interview you did with

992
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,870
young man in another part of Capetown,

993
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,740
talking about perception

994
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:42,278
and I think for
and maybe this has already been done.

995
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:46,849
I just haven't run across the research
that there's a larger framework in which

996
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:52,422
these notions of what can be perceived,
what can be perceived consciously,

997
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:56,893
what is a sensory
modality, what we don't call a sense.

998
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:01,097
It seems that there are on the one hand,

999
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,702
conditions we've been calling

1000
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:09,672
those homeostatic conditions
that you can't do anything about

1001
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:12,909
your body either
adjusts the blood pressure

1002
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:16,813
internally or it goes haywire,
which you can't be aware of it.

1003
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:20,717
So we don't think about this as something
that we can consciously perceive

1004
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:26,089
and we don't call the mechanisms
that are sensitive

1005
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,058
to blood pressure and

1006
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,863
core temperature
and other things as matters

1007
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:37,033
of sensation, not as of perception,
matters of consciousness.

1008
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,335
On the other

1009
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,004
side.

1010
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:42,338
The other side of the map.

1011
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:47,310
And there are single objects

1012
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,914
influences

1013
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:56,185
a mechanism that is sensitive
only to blood pressure

1014
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,856
presents
another reason, not to call this a sense.

1015
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:05,128
An eye spot just tells us certain

1016
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:09,599
kinds of ones there's light around here
or there isn't light around here.

1017
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:13,603
No directionality, just it's daytime
or it is I'm under the mud or

1018
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:14,637
I'm not under the mud.

1019
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,442
Where as even

1020
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:24,514
a little more information,
more kinds of information qualify

1021
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,750
this more as a sensory modality

1022
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,654
and in

1023
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,123
things like hearing and vision

1024
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:38,127
and smell, we have this very rich need.

1025
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:41,130
And there's many things you can do
about that, many things

1026
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,167
you can do about a burning smell.

1027
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:49,405
And there are many kinds of odors
out there.

1028
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:55,278
So this tie,
the thing you're thinking about. Yes.

1029
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:59,282
So the first thing
that you're touching on

1030
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:06,456
there is the fact that homeostasis
is only part of the story.

1031
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:10,426
In fact, the the example

1032
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:13,830
I gave earlier of the of the person

1033
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:17,500
who finds themselves in a carbon dioxide
filled room in a burning building,

1034
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,470
they need to maintain

1035
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,372
their homeostatic blood gas balance.

1036
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:29,378
But there's nothing that the autonomic
nervous system can do about that.

1037
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:31,848
They therefore need to turn

1038
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,985
to the to action in the outside world.

1039
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:40,356
So when I said that the person starts
moving about upstairs and down

1040
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,725
and then feels,

1041
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,261
is this working or is this not,
is this good

1042
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,564
or is this bad that we call Alastair
this?

1043
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,168
It's acting in the outside world

1044
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:55,471
in order to return myself
to Mommy Esthetic Arms.

1045
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,640
So that's the first thing
I just wanted to make clear.

1046
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,342
I know it's implicit

1047
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:02,845
and I know I'm telling you something
that you very, very well,

1048
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:08,284
but I just want to make that explicit
for, for, for our participle it's

1049
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:12,155
that what the importance
of the outside world

1050
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:17,193
for these internal bodily states

1051
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,798
the bridge from homeostasis
to other states,

1052
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,233
this is how we conceptualize that.

1053
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,404
So then it moves to the next point
which is that

1054
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:33,042
think about those kids that I showed you
earlier who have no cortex

1055
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:36,078
and all they're capable of feeling

1056
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:40,783
is their affect and they don't they can't
they can't consciously

1057
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,387
think I feel like this about that.

1058
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,924
In other words,
they don't know what the about that is.

1059
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:50,893
They just feel things

1060
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:55,798
and they can't include
within their consciousness of the feeling

1061
01:03:56,032 --> 01:04:01,070
and what the thing in the outside world
is that contextualizes that feeling,

1062
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:05,942
the context doesn't become conscious,
only the feeling itself to be able

1063
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:10,413
to extend the feeling onto the context,
to be able to say, in effect,

1064
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:14,851
I feel like this about that incorporates

1065
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:17,420
the context within that

1066
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:23,793
that terrain of uncertainty where one's
navigating the one's palpating

1067
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:29,498
the uncertainty in order to make choices
not only on the basis of blind feeling,

1068
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,501
but also on the basis
of what kind of object

1069
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:38,341
brings about this change in my feeling
and what kind of object brings

1070
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:39,141
about that.

1071
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:42,511
For all of that to be incorporated
within the realm of consciousness,

1072
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:47,250
I think is a further leap and clearly
another enormous adaptive advantage.

1073
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,587
So the first leap is just to be able
to feel the consequences of your actions.

1074
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:55,825
The second leap is to be able to picture,
as it were,

1075
01:04:56,325 --> 01:05:01,297
your those actions
within the sphere of consciousness and,

1076
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:06,068
and in this way
to bring the context into consciousness

1077
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:10,406
and extend the
realm of choices enormously.

1078
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,242
Thank you, Mark.

1079
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:16,178
And I'll
just chime in with a third question.

1080
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:20,449
So you mentioned
homeostasis is only part of the story.

1081
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,052
And in the chat broadcast

1082
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:25,955
what part of the story is for me since

1083
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,991
I didn't know that word?

1084
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:31,894
So a small stress inducing

1085
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:35,865
like some kind of benefit
over the integrated time horizon,

1086
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:40,069
like in exercise stress
that leads to improved strength.

1087
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:44,407
You mentioned Aloe Stacy's
kind of an anticipatory movement towards

1088
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,210
a set point, but where does, for example,

1089
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:51,948
induced stress, mild stress and recovery

1090
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:56,686
play into this extended homeostatic
or generalized homeostatic framework?

1091
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,256
So sorry,
I didn't understand what you meant.

1092
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:03,926
So, you know,
I think again, when one gives

1093
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:08,798
an overview of a
of a of an argument like this one

1094
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,169
always oversimplifies
why one sort of has to simplify.

1095
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:17,673
You know, when I say that homeostasis
that, you know, you always have

1096
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:22,178
to confirm your prior prediction
that that's not entirely true.

1097
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:27,650
There are also ways in which
the homeostatic range can be extended.

1098
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,520
The homeostatic ranges,
I mean like for example,

1099
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,125
you know what I was saying about oxygen?

1100
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,696
You can, you can if you're a diver,
you know, you can learn

1101
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:44,433
how to how to hold your breath
and how to manage the stress

1102
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,571
of being out of your viable blood
gas range

1103
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,240
in a way that's naive

1104
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:55,945
a person like, like, like I cannot.

1105
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,081
So they are, they are mechanisms

1106
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:04,453
whereby these, these things can in very,
very narrow limits.

1107
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,722
These things can be changed.

1108
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,692
But I think the emphasis
there has to fall on the narrow limits.

1109
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:14,030
Ultimately, there is there is an outer
limit to you, a viable range.

1110
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:18,434
And this is the driving mechanism

1111
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,437
of the story that I'm talking about. You

1112
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,608
thank you.

1113
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:26,242
Of course.

1114
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,712
So much more to say
and learn and add, but please carry on.

1115
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:32,281
Thank you.

1116
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:36,318
Well, you can see highlighted
on the screen now my next point

1117
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:41,090
and it might seem like a small point,
it might seem like an obvious point

1118
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:45,027
that complex organisms
require multiple obvious debts.

1119
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:49,565
And in fact, I've more or less said
this already, but I want to make explicit

1120
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:54,870
and here is the same slide
that you saw a moment ago

1121
01:07:55,071 --> 01:08:00,009
where I've just added the point
that I have now that I'm now making up

1122
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,412
the importance of this point is that

1123
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:07,083
we have multiple needs

1124
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:11,821
which must be categorically distinguished
from one another.

1125
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:16,192
In other words, we can't have
a continuous variable called need

1126
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,995
that that variable has to be fact

1127
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:23,466
arised
across a number of different categories.

1128
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,502
So let me be clear
what I'm talking about.

1129
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:33,275
Imagine you have if we quantify
on a continuous and a scale

1130
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,612
how much deviation there is from where

1131
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,782
you need to be, let's say, OK, I've got

1132
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,285
I've got six out of ten

1133
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:50,259
of first and I've got four out of ten
of sleepiness.

1134
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:53,362
Then all that means I've got

1135
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:56,132
ten out of 20 of total need.

1136
01:08:57,032 --> 01:08:59,502
And so all I need to do is sleep.

1137
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,370
I don't need to drink

1138
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:04,940
and if I, if I can generalize
from that little example there,

1139
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,444
the point that I'm trying to make
is that, no, that's not true.

1140
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:14,383
You have to sleep and you have to drink
and you have to eat

1141
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:18,120
and you have to defecate
and you have to breathe.

1142
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:23,425
You can't just submit to all of these
and, and bring down the total number.

1143
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,095
If you did that, you would die.

1144
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:30,533
So we have to recognize that
each one of these needs

1145
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,702
has to be met in their own right.

1146
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:37,106
And that means we need to know

1147
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:41,310
we can't just have a total
variable called need.

1148
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:45,548
We need to know which need
or we're talking about and this is why.

1149
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:49,151
And they have to be treated
as categorical variables.

1150
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:50,085
In other words,

1151
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:54,089
this here we're talking about how much
how much water I'm lacking.

1152
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,025
Yeah, we're talking about how much oxygen
I'm lacking.

1153
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,894
Yeah, we're talking about how much sleep
I'm lacking, et cetera.

1154
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:03,232
So that they can be
so that the category of need

1155
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:07,169
that the organism finds itself in
can be addressed

1156
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:09,805
appropriately.

1157
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,341
The appropriate category
needs to be addressed.

1158
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:16,111
And I know what I'm saying
sounds absolutely obvious,

1159
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:20,015
but why it's important is that it's

1160
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:24,019
because of this, because of the points
I've just been making.

1161
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,389
And that hunger feels different
from thirst,

1162
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:30,659
and thirst feels different
from suffocation alone.

1163
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:34,663
And suffocation alone feels different
from sleepiness and sleepiness

1164
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:39,201
feels different from pain and so on,
because each one of these feelings

1165
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:42,571
and the quality of the feeling tells

1166
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:46,041
us which need is is at issue

1167
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:51,247
and categorical variables
are distinguished qualitatively.

1168
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:54,250
So we are not only talking about

1169
01:10:54,250 --> 01:11:00,322
valence goodness or badness and arousal,
how much or how little are talking

1170
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:03,459
also about qualitative categories.

1171
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,262
And I think that's important.

1172
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,497
When we come back to the

1173
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,799
whole point of what

1174
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:14,336
I'm talking about, namely qualia,
you know, namely

1175
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,374
the qualitative stuff of

1176
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:23,612
of of what it is like to do anything,
be anything.

1177
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:26,815
Those those qualitative distinctions.

1178
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,385
It's of the essence of consciousness

1179
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,488
that that is qualitative.

1180
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,923
It has qualitative differentiations.

1181
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,694
It's not just some total quantitative,

1182
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:41,530
some total, a continuous matter of need.

1183
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,866
It's a matter of different
categories of need,

1184
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:47,236
which therefore are different
qualities of need.

1185
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:51,340
And I think that's important in terms
of understanding what an affect is.

1186
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:56,312
And that fact is a state of the organism
registered by the organism.

1187
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:59,081
In other words,
it is intrinsically subjective.

1188
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:04,553
It has intrinsic value, valence,
goodness and badness,

1189
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,290
which has existential consequences
for the organism.

1190
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,360
And in addition to that, it has quality.

1191
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:14,730
It is inherent in the nature of ethics

1192
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:18,400
that they are qualitatively distinct
from each other.

1193
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,070
And I hope
and I hope that this very simple,

1194
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:24,473
functional, mechanistic
reasoning that I've given you

1195
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:28,210
as to why that needs to be the case,
why that must be the case,

1196
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:30,713
helps to

1197
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:35,084
to make clear why ethics
take the form that they do it.

1198
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:40,689
Remember, what we are doing here
is addressing and enables question about,

1199
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:44,360
you know, why is this something
it is like to be an organism

1200
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,029
and how does it come about that
there is something

1201
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,498
it is like to be an organism
for an organism.

1202
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:52,501
That's something it is like this is not

1203
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:57,406
just a valence goodness and badness,
but also a qualitatively

1204
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:01,377
differentiated state,
subjective state of the organism.

1205
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:07,015
So I think that by by reducing
the mechanism of ethics

1206
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:11,220
to these essential features,
we begin to see why

1207
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:15,791
it takes the form that it does, why it is
and necessarily conscious something

1208
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:20,229
in the sense that the rudimentary sense
that I'm defining consciousness.

1209
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:25,868
So that's why this point is important
and that's why I wanted to make the point

1210
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:31,673
clearly that complex organisms
require multiple categorical homeostatic.

1211
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,977
They need to be treated
as categorical variables.

1212
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:39,415
They need therefore to be
that they need to be qualified.

1213
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,352
Each of these different factors of need,

1214
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:46,288
each of these different
categories of need

1215
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,892
have to be qualitatively differentiated
from each other.

1216
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:54,163
And this is, I think, the ground zero

1217
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:57,833
of where qualia come from.

1218
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:00,269
Now, I'll go on to my next point,

1219
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,039
which is that these different categories

1220
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:07,476
of need must be prioritized and again,

1221
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,779
I think this is
this is in a way an obvious point,

1222
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,283
but it's but I want to just dwell on it
for a moment

1223
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:18,053
and to, to, to to

1224
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,856
draw out some of the
some of the implications of this.

1225
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:26,361
I said earlier that our autonomic

1226
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,965
hobbyist stats run

1227
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:34,470
well autonomously most of the time.

1228
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:38,740
In other words, there are automatic
automated predictions,

1229
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,910
which we call reflexes,

1230
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:47,316
that are when the organism moves
out of its viable bounds,

1231
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:53,088
then it fires these reflexes which
bring it back into its viable bounds.

1232
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:57,860
And then I told you that not all of our
needs can be dealt with that way.

1233
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:01,396
Some of them, as we move outside

1234
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:04,500
of the range of what the

1235
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:06,902
autonomic reflex can

1236
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:09,004
achieve, like, for example,

1237
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:13,675
when it comes to thermoregulation,

1238
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,011
you start to perspire

1239
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:18,514
if you get too hot, this is a reflex.

1240
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:22,584
You start to breathe more shallowly
and rapidly panting.

1241
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:26,855
In other words, that's a reflex these are
autonomic responses to overheating.

1242
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:29,791
Then they reach a certain limit,
you know,

1243
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,794
that they they

1244
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,830
haven't cooled you down adequately.

1245
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,665
So then you've got to do something.

1246
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,834
You're going to do something
like leave the kitchen.

1247
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:42,170
And that is that is that is

1248
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:46,742
what I've just said applies
to one of your multiple obvious debts.

1249
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:50,479
In other words, one of them now requires
allostatic action.

1250
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:53,282
And you now need to do something
in the outside world.

1251
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:56,552
And clearly you can't do something
in the outside world

1252
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,421
in relation
to all your needs simultaneously.

1253
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:03,158
So all the time you're sliding,
you know, you're,

1254
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:07,796
you're, you're your hydration,
your water in relation to salt

1255
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,532
content of your body
sliding all the time.

1256
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:13,535
It doesn't mean that you're thirsty
all the time.

1257
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:15,871
You're you're burning up the,

1258
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:19,308
the sugars in your adipose tissues
all the time.

1259
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:20,976
It doesn't mean
you're hungry all the time.

1260
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,612
So the question

1261
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:27,115
is you know, what gets prioritized

1262
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:33,121
and and there must be some prioritization
because you can't do everything at once

1263
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:36,558
when it comes to voluntary activity
in the outside world,

1264
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:37,993
you have to prioritize.

1265
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:40,262
There's an action bottleneck.

1266
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:43,365
And the point I'm making here is first

1267
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:47,002
of all, just simply that
that you do have to prioritize.

1268
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:51,273
And secondly, that what is prioritized
is what becomes conscious.

1269
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:56,578
In other words,
as I gave in the example of suffocation,

1270
01:16:56,578 --> 01:17:01,383
the law, that that business carries
on unconsciously until it becomes

1271
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:05,220
prioritized at that point, it
forcibly intrudes on consciousness.

1272
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,590
And my priority now is I need oxygen.

1273
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:14,463
And that's what you feel the other needs
this is the other point I'm making.

1274
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,232
The other needs don't disappear
at that point.

1275
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,901
They continue to be regulated,

1276
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,971
but they are regulated automatically.

1277
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:26,875
So the prioritization of a need brings

1278
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:30,679
that need into the realm
of palpating uncertainty.

1279
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:36,151
In other words, into the realm of feeling
your way through the problem. And

1280
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,788
this, I think, is an important mechan

1281
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:43,492
an important part of
how of how feeling works.

1282
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,694
So let me

1283
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:49,197
remember I said I was going to talk
about the Perry Aqueduct.

1284
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:50,198
Great.

1285
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:54,603
So and I was going to tell you
how this plays in

1286
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,173
as important, if not more important role

1287
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:03,278
in the basic machinery
of consciousness of the upper brainstem,

1288
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:08,083
then the reticular activating system
and the Perry Aqueduct, or Gray,

1289
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:13,255
which is just a 14 millimeter
long structure column, the structure

1290
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:19,528
around the central canal of the midbrain
and all of our homeostatic

1291
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:23,498
mechanisms in other words,
all of the multiple Humvee assets.

1292
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:28,003
And we have many, all of the multiple
omnibus debts, all of them

1293
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:32,040
send their residual errors, signal
to the Perry Aqueduct, operate

1294
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:36,211
the Perry Aqueduct will graze
like a final common pathway

1295
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:40,982
of all of these
homeostatic errors signals.

1296
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:46,621
And it seems that this is where the
prioritization must be must be going on.

1297
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:51,159
The the the
the the the the the determining

1298
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:54,763
which of the current error
signals is the most salient

1299
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:57,566
then gives rise to.

1300
01:18:57,566 --> 01:19:02,003
And this is an argument I must again
make clear this is not an argument of

1301
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:04,906
this is not my own novel insight.

1302
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:08,643
This was a beautifully argued on

1303
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:10,712
comparative anatomical grounds

1304
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:14,649
by beyond Mecca

1305
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:17,385
in his in his in a brilliant paper

1306
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,122
in behavioral and brain sciences

1307
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,859
so he he recognized that
the Perry aqueduct

1308
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:28,597
gray together with the superior calculi
that I showed you earlier

1309
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:32,400
and the midbrain locomotor region,
they form what

1310
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,403
he called a midbrain selection triangle.

1311
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,573
In other words,
this is where the ethic, the need

1312
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,610
that is to be prioritized is selected.

1313
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,846
And this gives rise to a feeling,

1314
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:50,252
the feeling being as in the example
that I gave with suffocation, alarm,

1315
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:54,189
the need that is prioritized, the need
that is currently most salient,

1316
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:58,260
the need that is going to now
color your consciousness,

1317
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:02,230
qualify your consciousness, in terms
of its most rudimentary property.

1318
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,634
In other words, the feeling, the affect,
what state,

1319
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:08,570
what organism, state am I in?

1320
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,906
I'm in a state of respiratory distress.

1321
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:12,808
I'm in a state of suffocation a lot.

1322
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,109
That's what I feel.

1323
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,913
Why? It's because that
this is where choices need to be made.

1324
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:20,816
This is where the creature needs to feel.

1325
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:25,053
The person in that example needs
to feel their way through the problem.

1326
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:28,323
The other needs remain
at the other needs.

1327
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:32,160
The non prioritized needs are not raised

1328
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,730
to the level of feeling
and and I hope it's there. Why?

1329
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:40,569
And we need to understand mechanistically
how does all of this work?

1330
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,004
And that leads to my next point.

1331
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:47,342
So before I go to that next point,
let me just pause again in case there

1332
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:51,112
any comments or questions
about this prioritization function

1333
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:55,483
performed by the Perry Aqueduct or Gray,
which is what determines

1334
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:59,688
what affective state you are going to be
in from one moment to the next.

1335
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:03,258
In other words,
which need is which need is going to

1336
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:06,995
is going to qualify
you your affective state

1337
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:09,865
thank you, Mark.

1338
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,900
Dave then Stephen.

1339
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:13,235
Yeah.

1340
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:17,772
I just want to throw out there
in Sylvan Thompkins later work

1341
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:21,910
that is after 1970 he came to

1342
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,680
elevate reset

1343
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:30,552
to the status of a fundamental emotion

1344
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:36,491
and I think it's very relevant to this
the notion of suddenly shifting

1345
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:41,830
from one conscious emotion
or one conscious activity

1346
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:45,166
or world attitude to another.

1347
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:50,438
I, I I believe York concept drew pretty

1348
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:54,809
heavily on Tompkins and the reason that
he doesn't hate him in a lot of detail

1349
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:59,414
is that he accepted so much of kind of
like what you said about

1350
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:02,317
I agree almost totally with

1351
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:09,090
over the,
the britisher whose father's from India.

1352
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,458
I'm sorry, I'm blanking on this.

1353
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,894
Then we had a dialog
with in just a few months ago

1354
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,798
am I completely
wrong about and are you talking about.

1355
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:18,733
Yes, thank you.

1356
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:19,801
Am I completely wrong?

1357
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:22,037
This just, just did this was time.

1358
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:23,538
Did Tompkins simply grow no.

1359
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,006
I agree with that completely.

1360
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:28,643
Tompkins, the reason that thanks
it doesn't cite him

1361
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:33,982
barely ever cites him
usually in in the beginning

1362
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:37,652
of a kind of a general discussion.

1363
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:41,056
You know, just just to say
this is the tradition I belong to

1364
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:44,125
and then and then carries
on building on on his shoulders.

1365
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,861
I agree with that very much that that's

1366
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:49,864
thank you, Stephen.

1367
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:50,565
Yeah.

1368
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:54,102
I liked the when you talked
about Palpatine uncertainty

1369
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:58,173
and the silence around that
so that that's a nice term.

1370
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:01,443
And I think that relates to like
what is going on, so to speak.

1371
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,713
So what about what's going on?

1372
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:07,315
And then now what happens next?

1373
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:08,950
And I'm wondering though as well

1374
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:11,486
if the

1375
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:14,522
idea of
where which I think is often left out,

1376
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:18,660
there's a lot of categorization
of what things are, but where is it

1377
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:23,365
happening that makes a difference
in terms of how significant

1378
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:26,401
it might be in terms of prioritization

1379
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:29,838
so I was wondering how much

1380
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,440
the risk of the awareness

1381
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,078
of some sort of disequilibrium happens

1382
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:39,781
could be featured in this.

1383
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:42,717
And maybe that's
where the physical ization

1384
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:45,820
and the specialization
becomes much more significant.

1385
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:50,525
Than when you're just starting
with the brain yes.

1386
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:54,929
So well, all of these
homeostatic mechanisms, of course,

1387
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:59,934
the physiological processes
that they regulate or widely distributed,

1388
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,805
but the control centers of these
homeo states

1389
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,608
are for the most part

1390
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:10,145
in the brain stem broadly defined

1391
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:13,548
and I say broadly defined
because there are some

1392
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,051
that are in the middle
oblongata and pons,

1393
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:17,919
but there's some
that are in the midbrain,

1394
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:19,888
there are some that are Diane symbolic.

1395
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:24,392
And for example, let me just mentioned
the most outstanding example.

1396
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:28,730
The hypothalamus is full of
homeostatic control centers

1397
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:32,033
but know so

1398
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:34,436
so hypothalamus

1399
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:38,073
circum ventricular organs,

1400
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,009
the para brachial complex,

1401
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:45,847
the area post-trauma,

1402
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:49,050
the nucleus, solid Taurus,

1403
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:52,587
these are all
homeostatic control centers, but

1404
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:57,225
a fundamental importance
and I think it's not

1405
01:24:57,225 --> 01:25:00,995
sufficiently recognized,
although Maca certainly made much of it,

1406
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:06,301
that all of these nuclei
that I have just enumerated,

1407
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:10,171
they in turn project to
the peri aqueduct will grade

1408
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:16,010
the peri aqueduct,
while Gray is in my view a matter home.

1409
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:20,582
Yes matter homeostatic sort of the
the the the

1410
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,918
the control center of the control centers

1411
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:27,589
and and that the the essential function

1412
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:30,391
there is a prioritization function watts

1413
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:34,095
and by being able to physically locate

1414
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:39,300
these mechanisms bearing in mind
what where I started I started my answer

1415
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,004
to your question by pointing out
that ultimately these ideas that's

1416
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:47,208
regulate physiological processes
which cannot be localized.

1417
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:50,145
They are distributed
processes, politics, excellence.

1418
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:54,649
But the center
the control center can be localized

1419
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:58,820
and those control centers
all they are numerous at once

1420
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:04,225
and they in turn they,
they all send the residual error

1421
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:07,795
signal to peri aqueduct
that that is really important.

1422
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:12,634
Now what that enables us then to do
is to test models like the one that

1423
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:18,273
I'm describing to you, what happens
when one or another of these individual

1424
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,142
homeostatic control centers is lengthened

1425
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:24,779
and what happens when the peri aqueduct

1426
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,782
for gray as a whole, these lesions
and what happens

1427
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,485
I might as well just insert that here

1428
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:34,022
is you get a persistent vegetative state.

1429
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:37,592
In other words, you get that condition

1430
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:42,330
that Magoon and Maruti led us to believe

1431
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:47,235
is is a is a theoretical possibility.

1432
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:49,270
In other words, blank wakefulness.

1433
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:54,042
And remember I said earlier in my summary
of what I said last time I spoke

1434
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:58,780
that the idea that the reticular
activating system

1435
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,517
provides merely a quantitative of level

1436
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:06,454
of consciousness
and not any quality or content,

1437
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,524
and that that's fictional state

1438
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:11,893
of affairs of blank wakefulness, is

1439
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,598
the thing
that the reticular activating system

1440
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:18,399
was supposed to be producing,

1441
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,935
which, as I've showed
you, is not the case

1442
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:24,606
because all of those different lines
of evidence that are summarized

1443
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:29,444
show that what the reticular activating
system is producing is anything but

1444
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,448
without quality
and without content, that this is in fact

1445
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:36,451
the foundational form of the qualities
and contents

1446
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:38,953
of consciousness,
namely the different effects.

1447
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:44,792
If you lesion the period with the gray,
then you get that fictional state

1448
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:48,129
to that artificial state
of blank wakefulness.

1449
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:51,266
In other words, the these patients

1450
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:55,803
and so they show not unresponsive
wakefulness.

1451
01:27:56,371 --> 01:28:00,208
They still have the autonomic sleep
waking cycle.

1452
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:03,211
In other words, they wake up
in the morning and go to sleep at night

1453
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:06,748
like those those hydrogen liquids
that I showed you.

1454
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:11,252
But unlike those kids,
they show no emotional or

1455
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:14,522
no affective, no no response

1456
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:16,291
to their

1457
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,760
situation and no intentionality either.

1458
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:24,198
And so, you know, that's
that's what you would expect would occur

1459
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:27,602
if Perry Aqueduct or Gray is where

1460
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:31,039
the ethics are actually being generated,
because remember,

1461
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:31,839
that's what I'm saying.

1462
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:34,809
I'm saying that the prioritization of a

1463
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:39,681
of a homeostatic error
signal is the feeling of that signal.

1464
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:42,684
That is the rendering
conscious of that signal.

1465
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:46,020
And that is what we mean
by feeling something.

1466
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:50,758
It means now, then, now this need is not
just to need, not this need is a drive

1467
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:54,395
now this need is driving
my voluntary behavior.

1468
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:58,232
And that is why it becomes conscious,
because as I said to you earlier,

1469
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:02,570
voluntary behavior can be defined
as the making of choices

1470
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:06,307
as opposed to the executing
of automatons predictions

1471
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:09,811
just to

1472
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:14,716
notes on that when hearing Steven's
questions about spatial localization

1473
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:18,820
and how that can refer to brain
localization as well as like

1474
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:22,557
in the Perry personal space
it made me think about how awareness

1475
01:29:22,724 --> 01:29:26,394
a awareness
it could be without awareness.

1476
01:29:26,394 --> 01:29:29,897
Awareness could be spatially dislocated

1477
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,668
or awareness
might be a highly specialized percept.

1478
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:38,072
And then the other note
that I wanted to make was as a researcher

1479
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:41,943
of distributed physiology,
in the use social insect colony,

1480
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:45,279
this extended homeostatic

1481
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:48,983
perspective leads
to many interesting connections.

1482
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:53,187
When we think about extended
social homeostasis as well, but

1483
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:56,791
just two notes and we can carry on

1484
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:02,764
very good points

1485
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:05,266
so you're saying we can carry on,

1486
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:08,536
meaning I can carry on whichever way
you'd like to.

1487
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:10,471
OK, great.

1488
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:14,342
So I'm not going to move to my to my next
my next claim,

1489
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:18,346
which is,
which is I see we have half an hour left,

1490
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,416
so I must I must admit,
it's really quite amazing, you know,

1491
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:25,920
because you are so generous
with giving your speakers 2 hours.

1492
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:30,358
You love us to a false sense of security
and thinking, well, I can just elaborate

1493
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:32,860
as much as I want
to. There's plenty of time.

1494
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:34,929
And now we're

1495
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:37,999
down to our last half hour
and I've still got three points to go.

1496
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:41,569
So it's like no one goes there anymore.

1497
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:43,171
It's too busy.

1498
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:44,672
Yeah.

1499
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:48,776
Well, again, grateful
for the time that you're giving me.

1500
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:53,514
So let me move to this point
and this has everything to do

1501
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:57,318
with the relationship
between affective consciousness

1502
01:30:57,318 --> 01:30:59,053
and cognitive consciousness.

1503
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:03,658
I spoke earlier about
I feel like this about that.

1504
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:08,663
In other words, the incorporating
of the of the cognitive domain

1505
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:10,998
within the sphere of feeling

1506
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:14,335
and so this is the point
that I'm making now.

1507
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:18,606
This is a drawing that a diagram

1508
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,342
that comes from a paper
that I wrote with Karl Feresten

1509
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:25,580
and and here

1510
01:31:25,646 --> 01:31:28,249
the important equation is the third one.

1511
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:33,187
And here this diagram
basically is just trying to spell out

1512
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:37,959
in a visual form
what the what these equations are saying.

1513
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:41,329
So when I said earlier that

1514
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,900
we have two ways of

1515
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:49,637
reducing prediction error

1516
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:51,806
when to win a prior

1517
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:56,878
prediction does not lead
to the sensory state that's expected,

1518
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:02,149
then we can either change our perception.

1519
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:05,686
In other words,
we can change the prediction

1520
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:09,056
or we can change our action.

1521
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:13,928
We can do something differently in order
to bring about the prior prediction.

1522
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:17,431
So that's what these two equations
describe,

1523
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:20,401
that we have a generative model

1524
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:23,237
which generates predictions

1525
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:27,441
as to what sensory state
will flow from our actions.

1526
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,878
And so here so here

1527
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:33,381
there's an action in the external world

1528
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:37,952
which is predicted
to bring about a certain sensory state.

1529
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:41,756
And to the extent that it does
not bring about that sensory state,

1530
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:45,626
in other words, the difference
here is the prediction error.

1531
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:50,898
And of course the prediction error is
then used to update the generative model

1532
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:54,402
in order to give rise
to better predictions,

1533
01:32:54,835 --> 01:32:59,073
in order to better maintain
your expected sensory states.

1534
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:01,442
I need to emphasize here,

1535
01:33:02,109 --> 01:33:05,079
because this was not the case
in the early days

1536
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:08,649
of the predictive processing paradigm,

1537
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:11,852
that that colorist and his colleagues

1538
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,289
unleashed upon the world.

1539
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:20,127
Sensory states do not necessarily mean
extra set of sensory states.

1540
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:25,466
And so in the examples that I have been
giving in this talk so far

1541
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:29,070
that this would be the equivalent of,
for example, cold

1542
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:31,939
body temperature or blood, oxygen level,

1543
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:34,875
et cetera.

1544
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:39,513
These are the the most important
sensory states for the organism.

1545
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:43,417
Or its viable states in terms of its

1546
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:46,087
homeostatic expectations.

1547
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:51,058
So please remember that
when I speak about actions in the world,

1548
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:53,861
the world that we're talking about here

1549
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:57,231
is the can be the visceral body

1550
01:33:57,665 --> 01:34:00,401
and it can be the external world that the

1551
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:03,771
the body, the mark of blanket,

1552
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:08,342
it it's the, the, the,

1553
01:34:08,542 --> 01:34:10,711
the body is as much external

1554
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:15,282
to the blanket as the external world.

1555
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:18,052
Is external,
the blanket of the nervous system

1556
01:34:20,054 --> 01:34:22,089
I think we've got some reverend
somebodys kitchen.

1557
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:22,390
Yeah.

1558
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:25,259
Which you must put, you must,
if you like,

1559
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:28,462
whoever is doing the dishes, they're just

1560
01:34:29,463 --> 01:34:33,534
so, so what, what this equation.

1561
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:33,834
Yeah.

1562
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:37,505
Which is,
which is, which is written in words.

1563
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:37,772
Yeah.

1564
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:43,177
The rate of change of precision
which is, which is omega in the equation.

1565
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:46,247
The rate of change of precision over time

1566
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,684
depends on how much free energy changes
when you change precision.

1567
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:53,821
This means that precision will look as
if it's trying to minimize free energy.

1568
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:57,391
The rate of this free energy
minimization process is the difference

1569
01:34:57,391 --> 01:35:02,163
between the inverse precision
and the sum of squared prediction errors.

1570
01:35:02,396 --> 01:35:05,599
So that's this equation here
put into words,

1571
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:10,004
and it's for granting the central role

1572
01:35:10,171 --> 01:35:14,975
that precision plays
in minimizing prediction error so

1573
01:35:16,143 --> 01:35:18,045
that the

1574
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:22,516
I want to be clear that this is precision

1575
01:35:22,516 --> 01:35:26,887
modulation is in physiological terms

1576
01:35:27,421 --> 01:35:29,824
the modulation of postsynaptic gain.

1577
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:33,327
So the message passing going on here

1578
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:37,998
between error signals

1579
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:40,167
and prediction signals

1580
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:44,405
is modulated by hosts.

1581
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:49,643
It's the reticular activating
is modulation of that message pulsing.

1582
01:35:50,111 --> 01:35:55,249
So it's that increasing or decreasing
of the gain on the error signals,

1583
01:35:55,516 --> 01:36:01,055
that's the role of precision modulation,
which is just the same thing as to say

1584
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:03,758
that is the role of the reticular
activating system.

1585
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:09,330
It is modulating the gain in the message,
pulsing it.

1586
01:36:09,363 --> 01:36:12,933
You speak physiologically
that you speak computationally.

1587
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:16,003
It is a matter of increasing

1588
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,806
or decreasing precision values

1589
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:22,143
attached to the predictions
over the errors.

1590
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:28,549
So this to put it into different words,

1591
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:32,119
if things are turning out as expected,

1592
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:34,755
that's good

1593
01:36:35,556 --> 01:36:38,492
if uncertainty prevails, that's bad.

1594
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:43,330
So increasing confidence in a prediction
is good

1595
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:46,700
in other words, increasing
precision in the prediction is good

1596
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:51,172
at increasing confidence in an error
signal is bad.

1597
01:36:51,605 --> 01:36:55,843
In other words, the more uncertainty,

1598
01:36:56,043 --> 01:37:02,016
the more you become clear that
things are not turning out as expected

1599
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:05,085
to that extent of course, your confidence

1600
01:37:05,085 --> 01:37:07,621
in your current policy is reduced.

1601
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:11,525
In other words, the precision
in your current policy is reduced,

1602
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:13,561
and that just is bad.

1603
01:37:13,561 --> 01:37:17,097
So the goodness and badness, the pleasure
and and pleasure

1604
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:21,302
function of precision modulation
that I described to you earlier

1605
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:26,040
is it has this enormously important
contribution

1606
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,577
to make to the whole of this mechanism
by determining

1607
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:32,947
the influence of the precision

1608
01:37:32,947 --> 01:37:35,449
all over the predictive model.

1609
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,986
So to the extent

1610
01:37:38,986 --> 01:37:43,290
that precision is reduced
in the error signal

1611
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:47,161
and thereby confidence is maintained
in the policy,

1612
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:50,130
to that extent, the error signal will or

1613
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:54,902
will not have influence
over the parameters

1614
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,471
and of the of the predictive model.

1615
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:01,775
And so this is trying to illustrate
the crucial role

1616
01:38:01,976 --> 01:38:06,247
that ethic plays in
in this whole predictive mechanism.

1617
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:09,016
So this is the

1618
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:13,087
this is, as it were,
the role of the reticular activating

1619
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:19,093
system of the modulation of the message
passing that goes on in the

1620
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:24,899
these are these are, as it were,
and this synaptic transmission mechanisms

1621
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:28,769
and these are postsynaptic
modulatory mechanisms.

1622
01:38:28,969 --> 01:38:33,073
And so I'm just wanting to link
these formalisms

1623
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,743
to the affect of rule

1624
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:38,712
that the reticular
activating system plays.

1625
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,883
So and this
so just to go back to the statement here,

1626
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:46,253
the mechanism of perceptual
and cognitive consciousness

1627
01:38:46,453 --> 01:38:49,590
is precision modulation
of allostatic prediction errors.

1628
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:54,628
In other words, it is the
it is the modulation of confidence

1629
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:56,997
in a current policy.

1630
01:38:56,997 --> 01:39:02,469
In other words, the,
the perceived consequences of a current.

1631
01:39:03,437 --> 01:39:05,773
So, so as you, as the, as the

1632
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:09,009
a particular need is prioritized,

1633
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:12,012
that need is felt.

1634
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:16,417
This generates
a category of predictive policies.

1635
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:21,255
In other words, this is what I will,
which is what I do in this situation.

1636
01:39:21,255 --> 01:39:23,824
In this context that I find myself in.

1637
01:39:24,091 --> 01:39:27,094
This is what I expect
the consequences will be.

1638
01:39:27,828 --> 01:39:30,230
In other words, these are my expected

1639
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:34,935
and there's an expected precision
attaching to the error signals.

1640
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:38,939
Of course,
it's all the other domains of need.

1641
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:43,410
Remember what I was saying earlier here
about the needs must be prioritized.

1642
01:39:43,777 --> 01:39:47,214
The other domains
have monotonous precisions.

1643
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:50,651
So the crucial mechanism

1644
01:39:50,884 --> 01:39:53,220
in terms of voluntary action

1645
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:57,725
is that to use the phrase
that one of you said you liked

1646
01:39:57,725 --> 01:40:01,695
earlier
is the palpating of the uncertainty.

1647
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:02,229
In other words,

1648
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:07,034
the palpating of the precision
and the adjustment of the confidence

1649
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:11,071
in the current perceptual
and cognitive in other words,

1650
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:14,308
the allostatic aspect of, of,

1651
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:17,444
of what I must do about this needs state,

1652
01:40:17,911 --> 01:40:21,415
because there's a state of uncertainty
that's being prioritized there.

1653
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:25,686
There's a changing
of one's mind on the fly.

1654
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:30,257
This is what this mechanism

1655
01:40:30,257 --> 01:40:31,425
makes possible.

1656
01:40:31,425 --> 01:40:35,996
So it is the effects are,
as it were, a drive

1657
01:40:35,996 --> 01:40:39,299
for or a demand for predictive work

1658
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:42,002
for mental work.

1659
01:40:42,002 --> 01:40:46,507
And this the modulation, the palpating

1660
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:50,344
of the confidence in the policy over

1661
01:40:50,344 --> 01:40:53,847
the error signals is the predictive work
so demanded.

1662
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:58,919
So in other words, the work of
of updating one's policy

1663
01:40:59,086 --> 01:41:03,090
of changing one's mind
and it is all of it

1664
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:07,361
underwritten by the affective demand.

1665
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:10,931
So the affect of demand
for predictive work

1666
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:15,135
is what gives rise
to the predictive work itself,

1667
01:41:15,436 --> 01:41:18,072
which is the palpating of uncertainties

1668
01:41:19,006 --> 01:41:21,041
in the current policy

1669
01:41:21,542 --> 01:41:24,511
and the sensory states
that it gives rise to.

1670
01:41:24,812 --> 01:41:28,482
And so this is changing your mind
in other words,

1671
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:33,520
in other words, voluntary action, in
other words, the capacity for choice. And

1672
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,723
this is the crucial role
that precision modulation

1673
01:41:36,723 --> 01:41:40,160
plays in that process. So

1674
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:43,297
that's OK.

1675
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:43,831
Good.

1676
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:48,569
So I think let me just pause for a moment
to see if there are any questions

1677
01:41:48,569 --> 01:41:51,338
about that, because I want to
illustrate it with a case

1678
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:56,410
which I think is going to pretty much
take us to to to the end of our time.

1679
01:41:56,743 --> 01:41:59,880
So before I launch into this last case,

1680
01:42:00,314 --> 01:42:04,017
let's see if anybody has any questions
or comments about that mechanism.

1681
01:42:06,186 --> 01:42:08,589
I think we'll go to the case then.

1682
01:42:08,589 --> 01:42:12,559
There's always so much to unpack with
defining the variables and understanding

1683
01:42:12,559 --> 01:42:13,894
what the edges mean and so on.

1684
01:42:13,894 --> 01:42:16,697
But I think the case is a good way
to close this.

1685
01:42:17,264 --> 01:42:21,935
OK, so this is,
this is a patient of mine.

1686
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:28,142
Mr s and he had a meningioma here

1687
01:42:28,842 --> 01:42:31,111
at the base of his frontal lobes.

1688
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:36,150
It was an olfactory sheath meningioma
and it pushed on his optic nerves.

1689
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:39,019
And as a result of that, he

1690
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,122
his vision was, was, was impaired.

1691
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:46,360
And and this is how the tumor
came to attention

1692
01:42:46,593 --> 01:42:49,163
and it was successfully,
surgically resected

1693
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:52,399
not because of

1694
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:56,069
its location in relation,
in fact, to the optic nerves.

1695
01:42:56,670 --> 01:43:00,340
There was some nervousness
on the part of the surgeon to remove it

1696
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,375
and its entirety.

1697
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:05,612
And in fact, he felt it was not possible
to remove it in its entirety.

1698
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:08,515
So he left a little nub of the tumor.

1699
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:10,651
And this regrew

1700
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:14,588
and so the the patient again

1701
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:19,560
noticed these visual difficulties
returned to the surgeon

1702
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:23,597
and the operation had to be repeated
because of scar tissue.

1703
01:43:24,164 --> 01:43:27,000
The second operation is always trickier
than the first.

1704
01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:32,005
And unfortunately, in
the second operation, there was a bleed

1705
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:37,311
and that bleed was into the basal
forebrain nuclei, small bleed.

1706
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:40,113
But the basal forebrain
nuclei are crucial

1707
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:44,151
these are the upper end of the

1708
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:48,322
of the remember I was saying earlier
that these different parts

1709
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:52,593
of the ascending arousal mechanisms
of the of the brain

1710
01:43:53,193 --> 01:43:58,532
that they that they are the source nuclei
for these different neural modulators.

1711
01:43:58,799 --> 01:44:03,237
And I spoke of dopamine in that
noradrenaline and serotonin earlier.

1712
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:03,737
Well,

1713
01:44:04,705 --> 01:44:07,507
these nuclei are the source nuclei

1714
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:11,812
or they are other source nuclei
for acetylcholine too.

1715
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:16,216
But these are very important source
nuclei for receipt al-kurdi.

1716
01:44:16,216 --> 01:44:19,286
Now, remember all of these
what I was saying earlier

1717
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:23,390
about these
at these neural modulatory systems

1718
01:44:23,657 --> 01:44:26,593
is that they are modulating postsynaptic

1719
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:29,663
gain, which is just the same thing
physiologically.

1720
01:44:29,663 --> 01:44:31,298
Is to say computationally.

1721
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:33,433
They're modulating precision.

1722
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:34,635
That's what they do.

1723
01:44:34,635 --> 01:44:38,939
They up and down regulate the precision
in the message pulsing.

1724
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:42,075
And this as I said earlier,

1725
01:44:42,075 --> 01:44:45,412
it dictates
which which messages are going

1726
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:48,649
to are going to be selected
and which not.

1727
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:51,385
So it's a
it plays a crucially important role.

1728
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:55,656
Does precision modulation in cognition.

1729
01:44:55,656 --> 01:45:01,361
And, and I'm not wanting to show you
this relationship, the relationship

1730
01:45:01,361 --> 01:45:04,665
between the affective mechanisms
that I'm talking about,

1731
01:45:04,898 --> 01:45:08,201
that is the affect of functions
that are performed

1732
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:11,271
at centrally by peri aqueduct or gray.

1733
01:45:11,505 --> 01:45:15,542
And then how this gives rise
to the modulation through these

1734
01:45:16,076 --> 01:45:20,080
arousal systems of these different
neurotransmitter systems.

1735
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:22,949
And I'm going to show you
how this worked.

1736
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:28,455
In this case, the seats alkaline and
modulates the confidence in error signals

1737
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:33,427
and so let me just quickly tell you
a little bit more about this patient.

1738
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:35,395
He was he was

1739
01:45:35,395 --> 01:45:39,232
56 years
old at the time of the second operation.

1740
01:45:39,566 --> 01:45:44,338
And as a result of the damage
to the basal forebrain nuclei

1741
01:45:45,572 --> 01:45:47,441
from the second operation,

1742
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:51,778
he woke up from the surgery
with a condition

1743
01:45:51,778 --> 01:45:54,014
called confabulate to be amnesia.

1744
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:59,453
So although the tumor was resected
successfully, and the visual problem

1745
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:04,891
was, was was corrected,
he now had this devastating new condition

1746
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,463
called Confabulate to Remeasure
Confabulate to re amnesia.

1747
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:14,267
The patient is is it's
not only that they are amnesic,

1748
01:46:14,468 --> 01:46:18,505
in other words, that they are unable
to remember, particularly recent events.

1749
01:46:19,172 --> 01:46:23,143
But there's also quite a long
retrograde extension to

1750
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:25,112
in other words,
there's quite an impairment

1751
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:29,583
of the retrograde memory
to not only do they have this,

1752
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:32,452
but they also are not aware

1753
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:35,555
of their of their memory problems.

1754
01:46:35,822 --> 01:46:37,691
And so when they drew up,

1755
01:46:38,759 --> 01:46:39,760
when they

1756
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,295
attempt to retrieve a memory,

1757
01:46:43,363 --> 01:46:45,899
the memory that they retrieve
is not the correct one.

1758
01:46:46,133 --> 01:46:48,301
And they don't realize
it's not the correct one.

1759
01:46:48,602 --> 01:46:52,072
And so they have what appear to be false
memories.

1760
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:54,307
These are the confabulations.

1761
01:46:54,307 --> 01:46:59,446
They frequently are related in in,
in, in some semantic sense

1762
01:46:59,446 --> 01:47:02,682
with the target memory,
with the memory that they're looking for,

1763
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:07,087
there's some semantic relationship
between the memory they find and the one

1764
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:10,357
they're looking for,
but they can be grossly mis

1765
01:47:10,957 --> 01:47:13,593
misplaced in space and time.

1766
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:16,229
And so these are what we call
confabulations.

1767
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:20,200
And the patient
is not sufficiently critical of these

1768
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:24,571
remembering as a result of the

1769
01:47:24,738 --> 01:47:28,208
the damage
to these neural modulatory mechanisms.

1770
01:47:28,575 --> 01:47:31,144
So now this patient, Mr.

1771
01:47:31,144 --> 01:47:34,915
S, just to give you one example,
I mean, an extreme example,

1772
01:47:35,549 --> 01:47:38,985
he a he had his operation
in Johannesburg,

1773
01:47:39,553 --> 01:47:43,223
which is in South Africa,
which is where I hail from.

1774
01:47:43,523 --> 01:47:48,128
But at that at the time I was living
and working in London.

1775
01:47:48,428 --> 01:47:52,265
And so the surgeon who I knew
well sent the patient to see

1776
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:53,800
me to consult me in London

1777
01:47:55,368 --> 01:47:55,836
because I

1778
01:47:55,836 --> 01:47:59,272
was doing work with this
with this condition, confabulate amnesia.

1779
01:47:59,539 --> 01:48:02,409
So the patient arrives
in London on a Friday

1780
01:48:03,043 --> 01:48:06,780
and comes to me on the Monday and

1781
01:48:08,548 --> 01:48:10,083
and has no idea

1782
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:13,687
that he's in London because of course
he doesn't remember the journey.

1783
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,223
He can't remember anything
from one minute to the next.

1784
01:48:16,756 --> 01:48:20,427
And so I say something about, well,
you know,

1785
01:48:21,461 --> 01:48:23,697
the surgeon whose name was Mr.

1786
01:48:23,697 --> 01:48:27,868
Miller, the surgeon referred you to me
because of this memory difficulty

1787
01:48:27,868 --> 01:48:30,203
that you're having.
That's why he sent you to London.

1788
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:33,206
And he said, London,
what do you mean, London?

1789
01:48:33,573 --> 01:48:35,408
And I said, Yes,
you know, you're in London.

1790
01:48:35,408 --> 01:48:37,978
You don't realize it
because you don't remember the journey

1791
01:48:38,578 --> 01:48:40,146
you know, that's the whole point.

1792
01:48:40,146 --> 01:48:42,883
This is the kind of
problem that you having. And

1793
01:48:44,084 --> 01:48:44,851
he denies it.

1794
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:47,521
He says he's not in London now.

1795
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:50,357
So that's the confabulate,
the respect that these patients

1796
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:53,860
in his memory, his in Johannesburg.

1797
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:56,463
And so he believes he is in Johannesburg.

1798
01:48:56,463 --> 01:49:01,234
So I point out to him it was winter
and it was it was snowing outside.

1799
01:49:01,234 --> 01:49:06,139
I point out to him
the wintry conditions outside.

1800
01:49:06,273 --> 01:49:08,708
You never, by the way,
have snow in Johannesburg.

1801
01:49:08,808 --> 01:49:12,245
So I say look out the window he looks at
is absolutely shocked,

1802
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:17,551
but then retorts,
no, I know I'm in Johannesburg.

1803
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:21,488
Just because you're eating pizza
doesn't mean you're in Italy.

1804
01:49:22,022 --> 01:49:23,490
That's what he says to me.

1805
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:26,860
So in other words, you know,
you don't have to you know,

1806
01:49:27,294 --> 01:49:30,130
you mustn't
overrate the evidence of your senses.

1807
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:33,600
And so that's just an extreme

1808
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,603
example of what
I mean by how these patients

1809
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:39,806
how how how them

1810
01:49:40,006 --> 01:49:43,243
their amnesia it's
not just a lack of memory.

1811
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:46,179
It's also an excess of confidence

1812
01:49:46,713 --> 01:49:49,883
in the in the incorrect memories
that they drew up.

1813
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:52,953
So that's that's the background.

1814
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,588
And I saw this man.

1815
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:57,991
The whole point of him being referred
to me is because I treat such patients.

1816
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:01,528
And so I then saw him six days a week

1817
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:04,431
at the same time in

1818
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:08,068
my outpatient clinic at the Royal London
Hospital,

1819
01:50:08,935 --> 01:50:12,772
same time, same place he came
with his wife to the waiting room.

1820
01:50:13,206 --> 01:50:17,010
I would then go and collect him,
take him up to my consulting room,

1821
01:50:17,544 --> 01:50:20,714
spend an hour with him,
take him back down to the waiting room,

1822
01:50:20,914 --> 01:50:23,783
and then I would talk to his wife because

1823
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:27,487
he was so full of confabulations.

1824
01:50:27,487 --> 01:50:32,926
I needed to verify things in order
to get some sense of what was going on.

1825
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:34,427
And there were certain themes

1826
01:50:34,427 --> 01:50:36,663
and this is an interesting thing
about these patients,

1827
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:39,265
these confabulate theory patients.

1828
01:50:39,265 --> 01:50:41,368
There's certain themes

1829
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:43,470
that returned again and again.

1830
01:50:44,104 --> 01:50:47,540
The patient was an electronic engineer,
but but he

1831
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:51,378
in reality,
he was but he thought the reason

1832
01:50:51,378 --> 01:50:55,982
he was coming to me frequently,
he thought he was coming to me to, to, to

1833
01:50:56,149 --> 01:51:00,720
because I was consulting him
about an electronic problem. And

1834
01:51:01,688 --> 01:51:02,155
otherwise.

1835
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:05,091
He thought that the two of us
were electronic engineers together

1836
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:09,162
working on some electronic problem

1837
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:10,430
also, frequently

1838
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:14,801
he thought that he and I were in
in some sporting team together

1839
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:17,837
that we played rugby together all or we

1840
01:51:17,971 --> 01:51:20,607
we were in this rowing team together.

1841
01:51:20,874 --> 01:51:23,076
Now, his wife told me he had played rugby

1842
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:27,547
at university
a good 30 years or more before

1843
01:51:28,448 --> 01:51:31,418
and likewise
he had, he had been a keen rower,

1844
01:51:31,951 --> 01:51:35,422
but this too was at university
more than 50 years before.

1845
01:51:35,722 --> 01:51:39,659
And so these are again
good examples of confabulations

1846
01:51:39,659 --> 01:51:44,264
into the patient, misallocating in space
and time, a memory that, that

1847
01:51:45,298 --> 01:51:48,735
he draws up now
and he has too much confidence in

1848
01:51:48,735 --> 01:51:54,708
that is to to to readily accepts
the veracity of

1849
01:51:54,874 --> 01:51:59,412
of of the products of his own memory such
so that's the that's the background.

1850
01:51:59,612 --> 01:52:02,582
Now on this particular day
that I want to give you a little snippet

1851
01:52:02,916 --> 01:52:07,921
of a session from he on this day
when I came to the waiting room

1852
01:52:08,188 --> 01:52:12,392
he touched the scar on his head,
the craniotomy scar on his head

1853
01:52:12,826 --> 01:52:16,463
and he said hi doc to me
said this was progress.

1854
01:52:16,463 --> 01:52:19,699
You know, for the first time
he was associating me with medicine

1855
01:52:20,266 --> 01:52:23,670
and he was associating me
with the surgical scar on his head.

1856
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:26,106
And so I thought this was great progress.

1857
01:52:26,106 --> 01:52:28,808
And so when we got into my consulting
room, I said to him,

1858
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:31,411
you touched your head
when we met in the waiting room.

1859
01:52:32,112 --> 01:52:35,482
And he said, I think the problem is
that a cartridge is missing.

1860
01:52:35,815 --> 01:52:37,517
We must we just need the specs.

1861
01:52:37,517 --> 01:52:40,186
What was it to see? 49.
Should we order it?

1862
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:44,290
So I said to him,
What does this 49 cartridge do?

1863
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:46,926
He says, Memory, it's a memory cartridge.

1864
01:52:47,093 --> 01:52:48,695
A memory implant.

1865
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:50,730
Oh, sorry, I should have mentioned this.

1866
01:52:50,730 --> 01:52:53,967
His wife told me that he had had dental
implants,

1867
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,436
he'd had serious problems with his teeth

1868
01:52:57,437 --> 01:53:00,974
and these had been for many years,
but these problems

1869
01:53:00,974 --> 01:53:03,276
had finally been successfully treated

1870
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:06,312
by implants.

1871
01:53:06,312 --> 01:53:08,882
Teeth implanted into the into the jaws.

1872
01:53:09,649 --> 01:53:14,487
So when he said that
that c 49 cartridges a memory cartridge

1873
01:53:15,121 --> 01:53:18,424
and that it's a memory implant
it brought that operation

1874
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:22,929
that dental operation to my mind
he said but I never really understood it.

1875
01:53:22,929 --> 01:53:24,464
In fact I haven't used it

1876
01:53:24,464 --> 01:53:28,001
for a good five or six months
now it seems we don't really need it.

1877
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:30,470
It was all chopped away by a doctor.

1878
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:32,472
What's his name? Doctor Solms, I think.

1879
01:53:32,839 --> 01:53:34,674
But it seems I don't really need it.

1880
01:53:34,674 --> 01:53:37,310
The implants work fine.

1881
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:39,612
So I said to him,
You're aware that something's

1882
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:43,383
wrong with your memory,
but and he interrupts me and he says,

1883
01:53:43,683 --> 01:53:46,619
Yeah, it's not working 100%,
but we don't really need it.

1884
01:53:46,953 --> 01:53:48,855
It was just missing a few beats.

1885
01:53:48,855 --> 01:53:51,958
The analysis showed
there was some C or SIO nine missing.

1886
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:54,761
Denise brought me here to see a doctor.

1887
01:53:54,761 --> 01:53:56,229
What's his name again?

1888
01:53:56,229 --> 01:54:00,266
Doctor Solms or something, and he did
one of those heart transplant things.

1889
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:03,736
So this is referring to another operation
that he'd had,

1890
01:54:04,304 --> 01:54:06,806
which is clearly
also being referred to here,

1891
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:10,310
which was that
he had the cardiac arrhythmia,

1892
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:14,848
and so he had a pacemaker
fitted, a cardiac pacemaker.

1893
01:54:15,215 --> 01:54:17,884
So he said so he did one of those heart
transplant things

1894
01:54:18,117 --> 01:54:20,820
and now it's working
fine. Never misses a beat.

1895
01:54:22,088 --> 01:54:24,524
So I said to him, which is what
I actually thought.

1896
01:54:25,024 --> 01:54:28,228
I said, You're aware that something is
amiss, some memories are missing.

1897
01:54:28,228 --> 01:54:29,762
And of course, that's worrying.

1898
01:54:29,762 --> 01:54:32,999
You hope I can fix it
just like those other doctors

1899
01:54:32,999 --> 01:54:37,337
fixed the problems with your teeth
and your heart, but you wanted so much

1900
01:54:37,337 --> 01:54:40,740
that you're having difficulty
accepting that it's not fixed already.

1901
01:54:41,407 --> 01:54:43,309
So he goes on and says, Oh, I see.

1902
01:54:43,309 --> 01:54:45,211
Yes, it's not working. 100%.

1903
01:54:45,211 --> 01:54:46,846
And he touches his head.

1904
01:54:46,846 --> 01:54:50,617
He says, I got knocked on the head,
went off the field for a few minutes,

1905
01:54:51,084 --> 01:54:51,784
but it's fine.

1906
01:54:51,784 --> 01:54:56,823
Now, I suppose I shouldn't go back on,
but you know me, I don't like going down.

1907
01:54:57,123 --> 01:54:58,291
So I asked Tim Noakes.

1908
01:54:58,291 --> 01:55:01,294
Tim Noakes, by the way, is a sports
physician in South Africa.

1909
01:55:01,694 --> 01:55:02,662
Is this so?

1910
01:55:02,662 --> 01:55:06,232
I asked him next, because I've got the
insurance, you know, so why not use it?

1911
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:07,467
Why not go to the best?

1912
01:55:07,467 --> 01:55:09,302
And he said, fine, play on.

1913
01:55:10,503 --> 01:55:14,641
So that's the end of the snippet
that I wanted to show you.

1914
01:55:15,008 --> 01:55:18,411
And by the way,
before I show you about that, so

1915
01:55:18,444 --> 01:55:22,782
so this is a case in which due to damage

1916
01:55:22,782 --> 01:55:26,319
to one of the precision modulating nuclei

1917
01:55:26,552 --> 01:55:30,924
or sets of nuclei,
and in this man's case,

1918
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:36,629
the basal forebrain nuclei
due to the damage to the acetylcholine

1919
01:55:37,263 --> 01:55:41,567
and modulating mechanisms

1920
01:55:42,335 --> 01:55:46,506
that I showed you earlier,
that he has too much confidence

1921
01:55:46,706 --> 01:55:49,876
in his predictions
and too little confidence in the

1922
01:55:50,143 --> 01:55:54,047
he does not up the game on the areas
in the say looks.

1923
01:55:54,314 --> 01:55:58,451
I say to him he's his predictive
model tells him he's in Johannesburg.

1924
01:55:58,851 --> 01:56:01,321
I say to him, no, you're in London.

1925
01:56:01,321 --> 01:56:02,622
Look out the window.

1926
01:56:02,622 --> 01:56:05,124
He looks out the window, he sees snow.

1927
01:56:05,892 --> 01:56:08,194
You know, clearly
not something that could possibly

1928
01:56:08,194 --> 01:56:11,197
be associated with Johannesburg.

1929
01:56:11,464 --> 01:56:13,466
But he sticks with his prediction.

1930
01:56:13,466 --> 01:56:15,668
He says, no, I know I'm in Jo'burg

1931
01:56:16,202 --> 01:56:19,172
just because you're eating pizza,
that doesn't mean you're in Italy.

1932
01:56:19,505 --> 01:56:24,043
And likewise,
in the case of these memory processes

1933
01:56:24,043 --> 01:56:27,013
that I showed you in that session,
each time

1934
01:56:27,747 --> 01:56:30,016
that he starts to feel

1935
01:56:30,016 --> 01:56:34,020
the pleasure of the mounting error
signals,

1936
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:37,390
the mounting, that things are said,
just think about it.

1937
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:39,726
He has he touches his head.

1938
01:56:39,926 --> 01:56:45,098
He's on the brink of being aware
that he's he's had a brain operation

1939
01:56:45,898 --> 01:56:49,035
that the brain operation
has resulted in loss of memory.

1940
01:56:49,035 --> 01:56:52,005
I hope you can
see that to him saying that

1941
01:56:53,373 --> 01:56:56,342
he says we just need to order the specs
for this module that's missing.

1942
01:56:56,342 --> 01:56:57,243
What does the module do?

1943
01:56:57,243 --> 01:57:02,648
It does memory, you know, so touching
his head, speaking about operations.

1944
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:06,753
So he's on the is on the brink
of recognizing that things were not

1945
01:57:07,286 --> 01:57:11,290
as he expected,
that things are in fact quite different.

1946
01:57:11,624 --> 01:57:15,495
That my point being that
this evokes feelings, that this is bad

1947
01:57:15,962 --> 01:57:19,032
this is a
this is a panic inducing situation.

1948
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:24,470
And because this man has damage
to these precision modulation mechanisms

1949
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:30,243
that we've been talking about, that he
what he does is he simply up regulates

1950
01:57:30,843 --> 01:57:34,047
the or maintains
his confidence in his prediction.

1951
01:57:34,247 --> 01:57:38,851
And in this way, maintains
his his emotional equanimity

1952
01:57:39,252 --> 01:57:42,088
rather than allowing the unpleasant

1953
01:57:43,022 --> 01:57:45,658
affect to dominate and the unpleasant,

1954
01:57:45,992 --> 01:57:48,694
unpleasant affect to update

1955
01:57:49,762 --> 01:57:52,799
to to
doing to to upregulated every signal

1956
01:57:53,266 --> 01:57:57,303
and and which would which would normally
update the predictive model.

1957
01:57:57,804 --> 01:58:01,874
So I'm hoping that in this case,
you can see something of the role

1958
01:58:01,874 --> 01:58:07,413
of affect the role that the
the feelings involved in this man's case

1959
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:12,151
in relation to his predictions
and the prediction errors.

1960
01:58:12,151 --> 01:58:16,322
In other words, the cognitive business
of what he perceives

1961
01:58:16,823 --> 01:58:19,859
and what he believes
and how what he perceives

1962
01:58:20,293 --> 01:58:23,863
changes what he believes
and the role of feeling in all of this

1963
01:58:24,063 --> 01:58:27,567
I thought this was a succinct case
to be able to illustrate

1964
01:58:27,834 --> 01:58:30,002
and illustrate all of that.

1965
01:58:31,737 --> 01:58:33,072
The because it's only

1966
01:58:33,072 --> 01:58:35,808
one case, I thought I should just
show you some of this.

1967
01:58:36,242 --> 01:58:41,180
These are the several papers
that we've written on showing how

1968
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:45,184
these mechanisms work in confabulation.

1969
01:58:45,751 --> 01:58:50,556
We it's not just this one case
we were able to show that affect

1970
01:58:50,556 --> 01:58:51,924
regulation.

1971
01:58:51,924 --> 01:58:56,896
That's that the Confabulate confabulation
has a wistful quality.

1972
01:58:56,896 --> 01:59:00,900
In other words, it has a down
regulating of error signals quality

1973
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:03,436
and an up
regulating of predictions quality

1974
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:08,941
and we were we were also able to show
that by analysis

1975
01:59:08,941 --> 01:59:13,246
of transcripts of cases like this,
we studied many cases like this

1976
01:59:13,713 --> 01:59:17,884
how the effect actually improves
with each confabulation.

1977
01:59:17,884 --> 01:59:21,454
So there's an increasing negative ethic
followed by confabulation,

1978
01:59:21,888 --> 01:59:23,890
followed by an improvement in the affect.

1979
01:59:24,657 --> 01:59:27,793
So I see I'm right at the end of my time.

1980
01:59:28,427 --> 01:59:29,395
I just want to

1981
01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:32,632
I don't have time to go into this point.

1982
01:59:32,632 --> 01:59:33,566
I'm sorry.

1983
01:59:33,566 --> 01:59:37,403
And this is
this is not such a fundamental point.

1984
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:41,007
It's just a slightly different way
that I see the predictive

1985
01:59:41,007 --> 01:59:43,643
hierarchy if we if we

1986
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:46,646
take seriously

1987
01:59:46,646 --> 01:59:49,549
that what we are talking about here,

1988
01:59:49,549 --> 01:59:53,553
fundamentally we
we are talking about homeostatic systems

1989
01:59:53,853 --> 01:59:58,624
and that the most important predictions
have to do with maintaining your,

1990
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:04,630
your phenotypic prior preference
distribution, that this has implications

1991
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:07,633
for how we conceptualize
the predictive hierarchy.

1992
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:10,503
But as I say,
we don't have time to go into that

1993
02:00:10,803 --> 02:00:16,108
and then the last thing is just to say
that these models that we, that I've,

1994
02:00:16,142 --> 02:00:19,979
I've together with my colleagues
derived from the study

1995
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:23,182
of of the neuroscientific evidence

1996
02:00:24,617 --> 02:00:27,053
on the basis of this well known

1997
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:30,890
statement of of Richard Feynman's

1998
02:00:31,023 --> 02:00:33,392
what I can't create, I do not understand

1999
02:00:34,126 --> 02:00:38,064
we, we are trying to instantiate

2000
02:00:38,264 --> 02:00:42,602
these mechanisms that I described to you
earlier in an artificial consciousness.

2001
02:00:43,502 --> 02:00:45,638
I'm working with a group

2002
02:00:45,638 --> 02:00:48,241
of really great guys

2003
02:00:49,041 --> 02:00:51,210
and physicists and,

2004
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:54,380
and computer scientists
and applied mathematicians

2005
02:00:54,714 --> 02:01:00,419
and we presented our preliminary findings
a few months ago

2006
02:01:00,419 --> 02:01:05,458
at a college, for instance,
theoretical neurobiology meetings.

2007
02:01:05,758 --> 02:01:10,763
And so watch this space we are we are
we are saying that

2008
02:01:11,063 --> 02:01:14,900
if we have identified the mechanism,

2009
02:01:15,501 --> 02:01:17,803
the causal mechanism where

2010
02:01:18,738 --> 02:01:22,308
whereby ethics are generated,
what they actually do

2011
02:01:22,808 --> 02:01:28,981
in relation to a self-organizing system,
then if this really is

2012
02:01:28,981 --> 02:01:33,919
how ethics is is generated,
if this really is how it is caused,

2013
02:01:34,587 --> 02:01:39,625
then we should be able to instantiated
in a, in an artificial system.

2014
02:01:39,625 --> 02:01:42,528
And that's what we
what we are trying to do at the moment.

2015
02:01:42,995 --> 02:01:48,601
I'm sorry to have rushed at the end,
but if you'll indulge me, I will wait for

2016
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:52,872
if there are any questions, comments,
I just want to reassure you.

2017
02:01:53,272 --> 02:01:58,044
So this is I'm saying these questions
can be that they look quite different

2018
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:01,914
if we look at it through the lens
that I've tried to encourage you

2019
02:02:01,914 --> 02:02:06,018
to look at it with me through in
other words, through the lens of affect

2020
02:02:06,285 --> 02:02:09,989
these questions why and how is this
something it's like to be an organism,

2021
02:02:10,256 --> 02:02:13,659
something it's like for the organism
and questions like

2022
02:02:13,793 --> 02:02:17,296
why is the performance of these functions
accompanied by experience?

2023
02:02:17,563 --> 02:02:21,067
This is Thomas's this question
Why doesn't all this information

2024
02:02:21,067 --> 02:02:24,003
process
God in the dock free of any in the field?

2025
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:28,607
I'm saying that these questions
I've tried to provide you a clue

2026
02:02:29,108 --> 02:02:32,845
as to how we might be able
to address them differently.

2027
02:02:33,879 --> 02:02:35,581
Ooh, what happened there?

2028
02:02:35,581 --> 02:02:37,149
I've lost my

2029
02:02:39,452 --> 02:02:41,754
or my good. OK.

2030
02:02:41,754 --> 02:02:44,457
Oh, there I am. Yes.

2031
02:02:44,457 --> 02:02:46,459
How we might be able
to address them differently,

2032
02:02:46,459 --> 02:02:48,994
but get them through this lens.

2033
02:02:48,994 --> 02:02:50,796
Sorry to have gone on my word.

2034
02:02:50,796 --> 02:02:53,299
I can't believe I've spoken
for 2 hours again,

2035
02:02:53,966 --> 02:02:57,169
but if you, if you will,

2036
02:02:57,203 --> 02:03:00,873
I'll be happy to wait for any further
comments and questions before we end

2037
02:03:02,141 --> 02:03:05,478
us as we have actually
a whole document of questions

2038
02:03:05,478 --> 02:03:07,446
and many questions in the chat.

2039
02:03:07,446 --> 02:03:11,917
I think it's a perfect place
to end the live session.

2040
02:03:12,251 --> 02:03:15,454
And whenever the Affordance presents
itself, we're always happy

2041
02:03:15,454 --> 02:03:18,657
to have a dart three
the numbers keep counting

2042
02:03:18,657 --> 02:03:23,396
and we'll keep hosting the sessions
because this was very fascinating

2043
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:27,566
and I hope people got a lot out
of it and very tantalizing

2044
02:03:29,668 --> 02:03:32,438
thank you so much for inviting me
and apologies

2045
02:03:32,438 --> 02:03:36,242
for going on for so long,
and I really enjoyed

2046
02:03:37,443 --> 02:03:40,312
what little interchange
we had over these 4 hours.

2047
02:03:40,312 --> 02:03:42,581
I really enjoy it. Thank you so much.

2048
02:03:42,581 --> 02:03:45,151
Maybe one nice future

2049
02:03:46,018 --> 02:03:48,654
event
could be picking up on those last two,

2050
02:03:48,654 --> 02:03:51,624
which are extremely interesting
and important,

2051
02:03:51,957 --> 02:03:55,528
and then starting with those two
with the dot one and the dot two

2052
02:03:55,528 --> 02:03:59,498
as prerequisite
and then sharing more about those two

2053
02:03:59,732 --> 02:04:03,202
when the time is right and having that
as more of a full discussion.

2054
02:04:04,904 --> 02:04:07,239
Very good thank you, Mark.

2055
02:04:07,239 --> 02:04:09,308
Thank you, Steve. Dave.

2056
02:04:09,308 --> 02:04:09,975
Thanks, Stephen.

2057
02:04:09,975 --> 02:04:12,011
Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Daniel.

2058
02:04:12,011 --> 02:04:13,379
He saw something else.

2059
02:04:13,379 --> 02:04:16,048
Take a bite.

2060
02:04:19,552 --> 02:04:20,219
All right.

2061
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,754
Thanks, everybody, for watching.

2062
02:04:21,754 --> 02:04:23,355
Hope you enjoyed that. See you later.
