00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,519
hello and welcome everyone this is ActInfLab

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,960
Gueststream number 16.2

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,079
it is june 11 2022.

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,880
we're here with Mark Solms this is the

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,600
second part in our discussion

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,400
we had an awesome part one today we are

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,599
going to

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,840
have a recap on some of the points that

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,560
were addressed in the first part

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,200
in 16.1 and then we're going to head

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,280
into some unexplored territory so Mark

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
thanks so much for joining for these

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,640
sessions and please take it away

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,600
thanks daniel glad to be here again

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,559
um

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,440
i

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
i was just testing out sharing my screen

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,920
a minute ago and it seems as if i'm

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,000
incapable of showing you my face and

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
sharing my screen at the same time

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,920
so take a good look at me you're not

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,480
going to see me for a while uh here

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,160
comes my screen

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,800
please god

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
there we are

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,119
great

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,720
uh and here comes my pointer

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,159
there we are and here's my title

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,000
um

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
the emphasis is on physiological and

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,320
philosophical considerations rather than

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,839
computational ones

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,119
so i'll start with a brief recap

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,840
i made a few claims um

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,840
and i didn't get to the end of the this

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,640
list um

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,560
so i will just remind you what those

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,520
claims were and then i will pause when i

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,600
get to the point that we stopped at last

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,119
time which was here that affect is an

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
extended form of homeostasis

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,240
started with the claim which really is

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,479
the main claim

44
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,040
of my of my presentation

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,960
it is that affect

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
feeling

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
is the foundational form of

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
consciousness and that it is

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,160
intrinsically conscious

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,560
um i quoted freud

51
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
who

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,000
more than anyone else uh introduced the

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
notion into mental science

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,680
that

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
mental processes are not

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,520
intrinsically conscious

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
that much of our cognitive processing

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,800
goes on unconsciously

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,680
even he made this point

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,599
the point that i'm making

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,560
which in his words was that it is surely

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
of the essence of an emotion that we

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,560
should be aware of it

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
that is that it should become known to

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,319
consciousness

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,720
thus the possibility of the attribute of

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
unconsciousness would be completely

68
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
excluded as emotions feelings and

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,840
affects are concerned and i emphasize

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,120
the word feelings uh because there's a

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
whole lot of reasons why some people

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
claim that there are such things as

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,200
unconscious emotions and unconscious

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,440
affects this so just to be absolutely

75
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,599
clear what i'm talking about here i'm

76
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,360
talking about feeling

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,599
and you can't have an unconscious

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,440
feeling in other words you can't have a

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,200
feeling that you don't feel so whatever

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,440
might be meant by unconscious emotions

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,080
and unconscious affects um

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,159
that they can't apply to feelings they

83
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
can't be unconscious feelings

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
but uh that might sound like a semantic

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,040
point uh just a matter of words that you

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
can't have a feeling that you don't feel

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
that's an oxymoron

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,200
so i then went on to

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
set out various reasons empirical ones

90
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
uh why

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,239
the claim that feelings are

92
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,159
intrinsically conscious

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,680
or also has a solid empirical basis

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
i drew attention to this discovery that

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
was made in 1949 already

96
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,120
that the

97
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,439
brain mechanisms

98
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,239
for

99
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,640
consciousness itself in other words what

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
wakes us up

101
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
in the morning

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,080
and and puts us to sleep at night the

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
sort of switching on and off of the

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,639
lights of consciousness uh that this is

105
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,959
the business of the reticular activating

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,560
system the reticular activating system

107
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
is the brain system for arousing

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,720
consciousness for activating uh cortical

109
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,840
processes and rendering them conscious

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,960
i also mentioned the periaqueductal gray

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
which plays a a

112
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
and also it also plays a crucial part in

113
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,600
all of this

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
together with the reticular activating

115
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,919
system but i'll come back to that later

116
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,600
for now let's just focus on the

117
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,560
reticular activating system to give you

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,600
a sense of what i mean by how

119
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
these structures

120
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,759
their their intrinsic function

121
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,360
is the switching on of the lights of

122
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
consciousness uh i i pointed out that

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
you can make a lesion or you can suffer

124
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,919
a lesion as small as two cubic

125
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,039
millimeters in size uh in the

126
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,280
parabrachial complex of the reticular

127
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,280
activating system

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,199
in other words a lesion the size of a

129
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,000
match head and that is enough in human

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,880
beings reliably to obliterate

131
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
consciousness entirely

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
so i was saying

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
let's look at these structures

134
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,440
if we're wanting to understand something

135
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,039
of the intrinsic consciousness

136
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,560
generating

137
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,400
mechanisms of the brain

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,960
and um i made the point

139
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,440
uh that if the cortex

140
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
which is where we normally shine our

141
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,600
light in terms of looking for the neural

142
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
correlates of consciousness if the

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
cortex where the seat of consciousness

144
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,320
then there's an easily testable

145
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,440
prediction

146
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,520
which is that if you

147
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,560
have a case in which there is no cortex

148
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,000
then the patient should not be conscious

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,840
not so

150
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,039
therefore i showed you one such case uh

151
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,039
this is one

152
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,319
representative example of its type uh

153
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,600
that here is a patient uh born with no

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,319
cortex uh the condition is called hydran

155
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,840
encephaly here you see in an mri scan of

156
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,880
her brain

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,280
that where cortex should be there is

158
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,600
just cerebrospinal fluid and you see

159
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,560
that her brain stem is perfectly intact

160
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
so

161
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,479
on the view that this brainstem area is

162
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,560
where the consciousness is generated

163
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,120
that it doesn't require cortex

164
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,199
this is a critical case

165
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,880
on the brainstem view she should be

166
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,000
conscious

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,720
on the cortical view she should not

168
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
and here she is and she's conscious as

169
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
you can see

170
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
she wakes up in the morning she goes to

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,919
sleep at night uh in this sense

172
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,840
the the lights are on

173
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,960
but much more interestingly uh she's not

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,960
merely blankly awake uh she her her

175
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,680
her wakefulness has a content and the

176
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
quality

177
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
and the quality that i'm talking about

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,479
is affective quality you see how she

179
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,240
responds to her baby brother being

180
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
placed on her lap she responds with some

181
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,639
form of pleasure

182
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,680
um and so there's a there's a content to

183
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,080
this mental state and a quality to this

184
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,840
mental state that she's displaying

185
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,319
why that's important is because when we

186
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,599
first learned

187
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,120
in 1949 that the reticular activating

188
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,039
system is prerequisite for all

189
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,280
consciousness that there's no such thing

190
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,919
as cortical consciousness without brain

191
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,639
stem arousal of the cortex though we had

192
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,240
the view that the cortex provides the

193
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,319
qualities and the contents of

194
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,400
consciousness and the reticular

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
activating system merely provides the

196
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,160
the the quantitative dimension the sort

197
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,720
of level of consciousness so it's as if

198
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,199
this was a power supply as like a

199
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,039
television set needs to be plugged in at

200
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,560
the wall

201
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
the the reticular activating system is

202
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
the prerequisite sort of booting up

203
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,599
of the system but the television set

204
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,639
itself uh the cortex where the contents

205
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,639
and qualities of consciousness are

206
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,280
processed uh could still be claimed to

207
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,919
be the seat of consciousness and the

208
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,199
reticular activating system merely as a

209
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,958
as a

210
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,120
power source this is why it was

211
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,679
important to point out that this child

212
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,760
is not only conscious in some blank

213
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,080
sense of wakefulness without content and

214
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,320
quality but rather

215
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,640
that she displays affects she's

216
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,760
emotionally responsive to her baby

217
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
brother being placed on her lap just as

218
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,880
this child who also has no cortex

219
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,279
is emotionally responsive here you can

220
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,160
see

221
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,320
she's responding with pleasure

222
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
to

223
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,920
a stimulus

224
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
and this is quite generally the case for

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,959
these children has beyond marcus summary

226
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,680
uh of his observations in many many many

227
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,160
such children they express pleasure they

228
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,800
smile they laugh they show aversion and

229
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
fussing by arching their backs and

230
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,000
crying

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,680
their faces are animated by these

232
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,839
emotional states they build up play

233
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,839
sequences they smile they giggle they

234
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,240
laugh they show great excitement etc etc

235
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
etc

236
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
um so i've highlighted all of those

237
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,720
words

238
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
to show

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,240
that these two cases that i just showed

240
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
you with no cortex

241
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
they are conscious and they are

242
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
responsive and in particular they are

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,800
emotionally responsive um and on this

244
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
i base the claim

245
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,480
that these children

246
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
uh

247
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,480
do have a quality uh that they're cut

248
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
they do have a consciousness and this

249
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
consciousness does have a quality and it

250
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,240
does have content many people are

251
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
perplexed as to how this could happen uh

252
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
since they have no cortex how how can

253
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
they respond to things like their baby

254
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,120
brothers being placed in their laps

255
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,079
and so

256
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,920
i just inserted this slide i don't think

257
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
i showed it last time

258
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
just to point out that our sensory

259
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,079
end organs here's the example is the eye

260
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,120
same applies to to to the skin and the

261
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,440
and you know to to hearing and taste as

262
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,959
well the the the the uh

263
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,320
optic nerve

264
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
projects to the lateral geniculate

265
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,200
and from there to the visual cortex but

266
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,920
not only to the visual cortex it also

267
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
projects subcortically

268
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
to the superior colliculi of the

269
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,279
midbrain of the brain stem

270
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,360
which is immediately adjacent to the

271
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
periaqueductal gray which i said earlier

272
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
i was going to mention again

273
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,120
so these children receive information in

274
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
the brain stem which is not conscious

275
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,279
it's not cognitively conscious

276
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,800
perception

277
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,279
conscious perception is generated in the

278
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,600
cortex but unconscious sensory

279
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
information goes into the brain stem

280
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
where it is responded to consciously

281
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,279
by the emotional structures

282
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,760
that that are the main focus

283
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,399
of what i'm talking to you about

284
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,279
now

285
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,600
um of course

286
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,120
many of you

287
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,720
and like many of my colleagues will

288
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,440
reasonably say well how do you know

289
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,120
that there's something it's like to be

290
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,440
those children these might just be

291
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,320
reflexes or instincts uh these these

292
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,360
might be uh the equivalent these kids uh

293
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,600
of philosophical zombies in other words

294
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,279
they look as if they're conscious they

295
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,279
behave as if they're conscious but we

296
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,800
can't know that they're actually

297
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,839
conscious and so last time i tried to

298
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,959
address

299
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:51,920
this

300
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,880
this

301
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,320
objection

302
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,600
by drawing attention to what happens in

303
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
cases who lose great swathes of their

304
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
cortex

305
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,639
and are able because they haven't lost

306
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,560
all of their cortex they are able to

307
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,920
describe to us what it's like to be them

308
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,680
this is one way of getting around the

309
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,519
objection that because these kids have

310
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,560
no cortex and therefore can't

311
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,360
declare their conscious states we can't

312
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,839
be sure that they have conscious states

313
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,480
so i focus first of all on a case who

314
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,839
has a massive lesion of the prefrontal

315
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,160
cortex the reason i did that is because

316
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,440
this is a favorite

317
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,240
part of the cortex for those who claim

318
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
the cortex is the seat of consciousness

319
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,959
like the global workspace theorists they

320
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,800
say it all comes together in the

321
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,360
prefrontal lobes all of this information

322
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
that's processed in the posterior

323
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,880
cortexes is re-represented or accessed

324
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
in the global workspace

325
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,279
and this this is where the sentient

326
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
being the subject of the mind comes

327
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
about

328
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,680
and

329
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,320
i pointed out last time that if that

330
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,720
were the case then again we have a

331
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
falsifiable prediction

332
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,120
a patient who has no prefrontal cortex

333
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
like this patient of mine

334
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
a patient w

335
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,760
he has no prefrontal cortex

336
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,639
but he has a sliver of language cortex

337
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,440
he if if his sentient being

338
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,839
was was contingent upon

339
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
uh the integrity of prefrontal cortex uh

340
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,399
he should not have sentient being

341
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,200
and so i showed you what it's like uh i

342
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
talked to him about what it's like to be

343
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,839
him he claims to be consciously aware of

344
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,000
his thoughts i asked him to imagine

345
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
something for me to imagine

346
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,920
two dogs and the chicken

347
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,240
to see them in his mind's eye and then i

348
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,480
asked him to count the legs i thought

349
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
this would be a reasonable test of

350
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
whether he's actually got conscious

351
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,160
mental imagery and please note the

352
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
person i'm talking to refers to himself

353
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
as i um so he seems to think that he

354
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,920
exists as a sentient being and i ask him

355
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,160
how many legs they are in total if you

356
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,320
have two dogs and one chicken and to my

357
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
disappointment he said eight

358
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
and when i questioned his answer he

359
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
answered he pointed out that in his

360
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,040
mind's eye the dogs had at the chicken

361
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
so i thought that was

362
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
maybe not a great joke but it certainly

363
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
suggested that there was somebody at

364
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,480
home

365
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
and i made the point last time

366
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,800
that these patients generally patients

367
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,600
with massive frontal lesions

368
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,959
that this uh tendency to make pure oil

369
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,920
jokes

370
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,800
is is is considered to be a rather a

371
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,760
common

372
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,320
part of the frontal lobe syndrome or the

373
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,639
frontal lobe personality and this is

374
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,040
part of a bigger story that i mentioned

375
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,800
last time which is that these patients

376
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,880
are generally quite

377
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,760
emotionally disinhibited

378
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,519
and why that's important is because

379
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,839
remember what we are considering here is

380
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
the question as to whether the feelings

381
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,240
that you saw

382
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
in those patients those kids with no

383
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,959
cortex

384
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,399
whether those feelings could be

385
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,720
generated in the brain stem

386
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,320
and the claim of the of of

387
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,839
corticocentric theorists like joe ledoux

388
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,240
for example is that the feelings

389
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,480
literally come about uh when they are

390
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
registered or re-represented or labeled

391
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,959
or even named

392
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,680
some people claim uh that it's only once

393
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,279
you um

394
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,880
are able to re-represent this uh this uh

395
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,160
uh these subcortical uh survival uh

396
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,199
circuits uh in uh a

397
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,240
declarative consciousness uh in in

398
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,160
prefrontal lobes that this is literally

399
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
what brings the feeling about

400
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,240
and i think it's quite interesting that

401
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,639
these patients who have no prefrontal

402
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,079
cortex

403
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,160
don't have a dearth of feeling which is

404
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
what you would expect if the machinery

405
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,199
that brings feelings about is absent

406
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,560
then they shouldn't be able to have

407
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,639
feelings but in fact what is generally

408
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,399
accepted is these patients have an

409
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
excess of feelings

410
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,920
there's disinhibited emotionality in

411
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
these patients

412
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,800
um my i made much the same argument

413
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
about uh

414
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,240
the the other

415
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
major cortical area that is associated

416
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,880
uh with the sentient self uh and that is

417
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,959
the insular cortex of course this is

418
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,800
associated above all with the work of

419
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,639
bud craig but has been very widely

420
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,440
accepted uh that the feeling self comes

421
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,639
about um when um

422
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,000
when uh once the state of one's uh

423
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,959
intraceptive uh body uh is is is is uh

424
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,240
re-represented in insular cortex and uh

425
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,079
so again we have a falsifiable

426
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,560
prediction uh if you take a case who has

427
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,800
no insular cortex like this patient of

428
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,320
demarzios

429
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,000
then there should be no sentient self uh

430
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
present and

431
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,519
i showed you this interview where di

432
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,520
marzia speaks to him about his sense of

433
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,760
self and the patient is perfectly

434
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,480
adamant that he exists as a self he

435
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,640
speaks about himself as i i you know

436
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,599
and

437
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,119
at the end of this interview ends with

438
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,400
dimarzia saying

439
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
you're aware that i'm aware and the

440
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,480
patient b says i'm aware that you're

441
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,119
aware that i'm aware you know all and

442
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,280
and this patient just like my patient w

443
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,640
is not

444
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,240
deficient in emotionality uh in fact uh

445
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,559
all the basic emotions are present

446
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,880
including both bodily affects and

447
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,520
emotional affects and sensory affects

448
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,960
and um

449
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,600
not only that he's also a little too

450
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
emotional

451
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,360
and this is a little disinhibited in his

452
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,679
emotionality and this is what we quite

453
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,160
generally see with patients uh with

454
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,559
incident lesions so again it's very hard

455
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,960
to sustain the argument that the self

456
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
actually comes

457
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,919
into being

458
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,400
in the cortex

459
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,280
um

460
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,000
now of course those two cases those

461
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,799
examples of their kinds patients with

462
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,039
massive frontal cortical lesions pace of

463
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,679
patients with massive insulin lesions of

464
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,440
course they are

465
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,679
just examples uh but uh the point is the

466
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,559
point i'm making now is that

467
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,360
the

468
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,280
there's lots of cortex left in those

469
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,480
cases

470
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,280
so

471
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,000
the argument is well you know maybe this

472
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the sentient subject

473
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,160
is generated in the remainder of their

474
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
cortex and it's a bit of a that's a bit

475
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,280
of a circular argument because remember

476
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,120
you know the the children who have no

477
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,039
cortex um

478
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,760
we're told well how do we know uh that

479
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,520
that they're conscious they can't report

480
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
their conscious states i then gave these

481
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,559
two outstanding examples looking at the

482
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
areas of cortex that are most bound up

483
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,320
uh

484
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,880
with with a sentient subjectivity

485
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
according to cortical theories of

486
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,919
consciousness and uh these patients seem

487
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,160
to have uh intact a sentient

488
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,640
subjectivity but now i'm told well you

489
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,120
know the remainder of the cortex

490
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,520
might be what's what's generating the

491
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,160
consciousness so we can't use only

492
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,000
lesion methods there's no way out of

493
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,559
that armpass and so i then showed you

494
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,760
last time

495
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,799
evidence of a different kind

496
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,480
i showed you what happens if you

497
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,840
stimulate reticular activating system

498
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,200
nuclei

499
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,440
there again there's a there's a an

500
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,200
easily

501
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
tested prediction the prediction is that

502
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
if these brain stem nuclei the reticular

503
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
activating system and periaqueductal

504
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,960
gray as i'm claiming if these are the

505
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,520
structures that generate consciousness

506
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,200
and feeling

507
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520
then stimulation of these structures

508
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,120
should stimulate conscious feelings

509
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,280
and i showed you that here's a case who

510
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,000
had a deep brain stimulator placed into

511
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,640
the substantia this this part of

512
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,039
her reticular activating system and

513
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,320
within five seconds uh it's it's it it

514
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,120
uh

515
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,200
generated uh it produced a profound

516
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,480
depression

517
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,520
the patient was actually suicidal

518
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,679
she didn't want to live anymore

519
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,919
this is a patient with no psychiatric

520
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,120
history

521
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,200
the the electrode was placed in her

522
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,720
brain stem for the treatment of

523
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
parkinson's disease

524
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
and and stimulated the wrong nucleus and

525
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,320
that's how this came about

526
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,039
90 seconds after the the stimulator was

527
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,240
switched off

528
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,120
the depressed feeling disappeared and

529
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,799
the patient generously agreed to allow

530
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,919
for further stimulation uh in the

531
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,080
reticular activating system and out of

532
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,240
it and it was only when that particular

533
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
nucleus was stimulated

534
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,760
that that she fell into the depression

535
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
so this is the kind of evidence and

536
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,039
remember again i'm just giving you

537
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,799
examples

538
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,360
you can stimulate intense affective

539
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
states by stimulating reticular

540
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
activating nuclei

541
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,000
and periaqueductal gray you get the

542
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
greatest intensity and the greatest

543
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,320
variety of efforts from stimulating

544
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,120
there

545
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,799
and you get nothing of the kind from

546
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,960
stimulating cortex

547
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,760
so

548
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
this is a different line of evidence

549
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,840
suggesting that feelings are actually

550
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
generated

551
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,080
in the upper brain stem and then i

552
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,559
showed you another line of evidence

553
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,520
that was positron emission tomography

554
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,880
of people in intense affective states

555
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,720
here you see

556
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,120
research participants in in states of

557
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,480
sadness here of anger here of happiness

558
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,280
here of fear and in all instances the

559
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,880
activation uh is in the brainstem

560
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
and the circuits arising from it the

561
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,520
subcortical circuits arising from it

562
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,000
that's what we see

563
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,760
the cortex

564
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,919
is

565
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,120
by contrast largely deactivated

566
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,440
so this is a further line of evidence

567
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,720
that the

568
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,480
you know an entirely different line of

569
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
evidence remember we've got lesion

570
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,120
evidence then we've got deep brain

571
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,799
stimulation evidence here we've got

572
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,000
positron emission imaging uh uh

573
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,640
evidence that the part of the brain

574
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,200
that's generating the feelings

575
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,960
is the part of the brain that switches

576
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,400
on the lights

577
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
and this is why i'm claiming that the

578
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,000
basic uh the foundational form of

579
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,120
consciousness and this prerequisite form

580
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,840
is affect affect is the elemental form

581
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,080
of consciousness a further line of

582
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,159
evidence is pharmacological

583
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,919
manipulations

584
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,679
if you tinker with the neuromodulators

585
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,919
that are sourced in these reticular

586
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,400
activating nuclei like for example

587
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,919
noradrenaline

588
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,720
or serotonin or dopamine all of which

589
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
are sourced in the reticular activating

590
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
system now

591
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,880
serotonin is of course regularly um

592
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,720
pharmacologically manipulated for the

593
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,440
treatment of depression uh dopamine for

594
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,760
the treatment of psychosis uh

595
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
noradrenaline for the treatment of

596
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
anxiety

597
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,440
noradrenaline is sourced in locus

598
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,400
ceruleas complex serotonin in the reef

599
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,799
nuclei dopamine at least the one that's

600
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,640
important for psychosis in the ventral

601
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,960
tegmental area all of these are parts of

602
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,200
the reticular activating system if if

603
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,840
all that this system did was switch on

604
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
blank wakefulness it might be of

605
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,559
interest to anaesthetists uh but

606
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,960
in fact it's it is the main target of

607
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,159
the drugs of psychiatrists uh who are

608
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,640
treating emotional disorders by

609
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,039
manipulating the chemistries

610
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,799
that are the source nuclei for which uh

611
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,600
are in the reticular activating system

612
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,960
so

613
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,120
on the basis of all of that

614
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,000
i argued remember that affect is the

615
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
foundational form of consciousness and

616
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,640
it's intrinsically conscious i said that

617
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,600
feelings uh we don't turn not only on

618
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,080
semantic grounds i'm saying that feeling

619
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,919
is the basic form of consciousness the

620
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,240
reason i'm saying that is because the

621
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,039
basic consciousness generating tissues

622
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,440
of the brain the reticular activating

623
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,400
system

624
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,240
which is prerequisite for the activation

625
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,360
of consciousness in cortex and that this

626
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,200
uh that these structures generate

627
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,840
feeling uh that feeling therefore is

628
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,720
prerequisite is foundational for all

629
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,480
forms of consciousness

630
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
i then made if

631
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,200
this is a sort of a sidebar um

632
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,840
the reason i went into this third point

633
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,799
um is that namely that the claim that

634
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,480
affect is not synonymous with

635
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,559
interreceptive inference

636
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,640
in other words that it's not just an

637
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,159
interreceptive form of perception

638
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,400
as opposed to the extra receptor forms

639
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,720
which have been the major focus

640
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
of consciousness studies over the last

641
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,760
few decades um vision being the main

642
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,799
focus

643
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,880
i'm saying that affect is not

644
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,039
and why i say this is because this is

645
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,080
increasingly being argued um in fact it

646
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,400
was argued by bud craig himself

647
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,960
that affect is just interreceptive

648
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,600
perception

649
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,520
the perception of the state of the own

650
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,640
body

651
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,760
is the equivalent of the perception

652
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,600
of the outside world

653
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,799
in the more

654
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,520
typical form or extraceptive form of

655
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,039
perception that's been equated with

656
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,200
consciousness i made the point that

657
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,960
there's that there's good reason to

658
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,400
believe that affect isn't just a sixth

659
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,919
modality of perception um and uh the

660
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,480
evidence that i presented for that

661
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,520
was

662
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,480
of various kinds uh for example

663
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,559
that there are affects which are clearly

664
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,200
not receptive for example getting a

665
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,320
fright uh was being startled um or

666
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,440
feeling pain when when when when you you

667
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,279
a pin is stuck into your finger these

668
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,000
are all extra receptive

669
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,039
forms of stimulation and yet they arouse

670
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,840
affective responses so

671
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,080
affect clearly is not uniquely

672
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,400
interreceptive and then i also made the

673
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,960
point that there are

674
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
many interreceptive perceptual states

675
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,760
which are not affective you can feel

676
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,480
your tummy grumbling or you can

677
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,559
feel your heart beating or you can feel

678
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,360
your

679
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,240
your your lungs expanding these are not

680
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,400
intrinsically affective phenomena so

681
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,799
intraceptive perception can happen

682
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,039
without affect an affect

683
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,039
can happen without interreceptive

684
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,640
perception

685
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,440
so i was trying to draw a line under the

686
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,679
idea that affect is just another

687
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,679
modality of perception

688
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
i i i think that by

689
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,600
detaching affect from perception uh

690
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,480
casts some new light on the hard problem

691
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,679
and so that's where i went next uh and i

692
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,440
reminded you

693
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,679
that david chalmers who coined the hard

694
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,360
problem uh

695
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,480
said that

696
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,679
when we look at um functions uh

697
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,399
perceptual functions like vision which

698
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,120
was as i said the model example

699
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
derived from the

700
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,480
or grounded upon the assumption

701
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,399
that consciousness is a cortical

702
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,919
phenomenon

703
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,120
cortical vision became the model example

704
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
of consciousness this was following

705
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,000
crick's

706
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,520
initiative in the mid-1990s crick's idea

707
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,080
was that if we can if we can identify

708
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,159
the neural correlate of consciousness in

709
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,880
the case of cortical vision then we can

710
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,000
generalize from that uh

711
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,799
by by discerning the mechanism whereby

712
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,200
visual information processing

713
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,000
gets turned into conscious vision in the

714
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,120
cortex by isolating that mechanism

715
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,440
we will be able to uh understand uh the

716
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,360
the the nature and function of

717
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,159
consciousness and chalmers said that

718
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,520
that's not true

719
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,440
you if you if you isolate uh identify

720
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,799
the mechanism

721
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,279
of visual information processing

722
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,679
like this map here does it doesn't tell

723
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,760
you anything about why there's something

724
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,159
it is like to see

725
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,039
and he he used the

726
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,600
well-known knowledge argument of frank

727
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,960
jackson

728
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,480
the story about

729
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,120
about mary the visual neuroscientist who

730
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,799
knows everything about

731
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,440
all of this and i slightly simplify the

732
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,159
story by saying well let's let's imagine

733
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,000
that mary is blind

734
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,080
even though she knows everything about

735
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,880
the functions of cortical vision she

736
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
knows everything about the mechanism

737
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,840
whereby visual information is processed

738
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,320
in the cortex because she's blind she

739
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,240
knows nothing about what it is like to

740
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,799
see and if she were to be

741
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,039
gifted

742
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,440
suddenly with a normal

743
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,399
site

744
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,840
then she would learn something

745
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,399
completely new about vision she would

746
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,760
learn what it is like to see red and

747
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,880
blue what blueness and redness etc are

748
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,760
like

749
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,840
none of which is accounted for by this

750
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,000
information um processing flow diagram

751
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and none of what she knew about the

752
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,720
functional mechanisms of cortical vision

753
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,480
that would have prepared her

754
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,799
for what it is like to see in other

755
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,120
words there's other there's there's

756
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,600
something some something else

757
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,159
about visual information processing

758
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,399
other than the sort of things that

759
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,320
mechanistic um

760
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,720
functionalist dissections like this uh

761
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,600
provide us with uh it doesn't this this

762
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,159
mechanistic account doesn't predict what

763
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,080
that there should be anything that it is

764
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,360
like to see and this is the grounds upon

765
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,840
which people like chalmers say

766
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,720
that a mechanistic effect an account of

767
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,159
the functional mechanism of uh

768
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,480
cognitive and perceptual processes it

769
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,279
doesn't tell us anything about um why

770
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,919
there's something it is like to to to to

771
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,919
perform these processes

772
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,679
and this is the essence of the hard

773
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,880
problem

774
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,520
um i said that i thought that

775
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,279
this might be

776
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,720
because they were looking in the wrong

777
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,679
place

778
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,200
that visual perception uh and and and

779
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,399
and all forms of cortical perception um

780
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,279
and uh indeed not only uh perception

781
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,200
with learning and cognition more

782
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,919
generally that this can readily go on

783
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,000
unconsciously

784
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that these are not intrinsically

785
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,840
conscious processes

786
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,399
that it is perfectly possible to see

787
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,679
um and to recognize faces and to read

788
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,080
with comprehension and even to

789
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,880
discriminate colors

790
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,559
these are all uniquely cortical

791
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,240
processes and they can all go on

792
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,159
in the dark as it were in other words

793
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,080
you do not have to be conscious of what

794
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,320
you're perceiving in order to perceive

795
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,120
it

796
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
and so this

797
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,519
this costs a rather different light on

798
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,679
thomas's point that all of this

799
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,919
information processing can go on in the

800
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,960
dark um so you know consciousness uh

801
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,760
can't isn't accounted for by our normal

802
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,440
uh functionalized

803
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,600
mechanist mechanistic

804
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,279
way of doing uh cognitive neuroscience

805
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,440
so i was saying well that's because

806
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,960
they're looking at functions like

807
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,320
perception

808
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,640
and functions like learning uh which

809
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,200
dude which are not uh these are not

810
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,159
intrinsically conscious uh processes

811
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,919
um i i i drew your attention to uh this

812
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,919
other statement of chalmers is from his

813
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,120
famous paper in which he says in summary

814
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,279
there is no cognitive function such that

815
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,440
we can say in advance that explanation

816
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,600
of the function will automatically

817
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,240
explain experience and my point was well

818
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,679
that's because they're talking about

819
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,679
cognitive functions

820
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,799
could charmers make the same statement

821
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,640
if we were talking about affective

822
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,760
functions

823
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,240
i'm saying no he could not

824
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,840
i'm saying that we can say in advance

825
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,320
that explanation of the function of

826
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,360
feeling

827
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,000
will automatically explain experience

828
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,640
because the function of feeling is to

829
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,919
feel it's intrinsically conscious

830
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,159
is this is this function

831
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,440
unlike vision

832
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,519
and perception in general and cognition

833
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,760
as a whole none of that is intrinsically

834
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,120
conscious but feeling affective feeling

835
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,200
is intrinsically conscious you could not

836
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,720
understand

837
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,760
the mechanism of affective feeling

838
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
if it didn't account for why it feels

839
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,200
like something because that's the whole

840
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
bloody point of feeling

841
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,760
so this question

842
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,919
of chalmers is why is the performance of

843
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,360
these functions accompanied by

844
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,200
experience why doesn't all this

845
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,760
information processing go on in the dark

846
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,000
free of any inner feel i'm saying that

847
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,480
that question is perfectly reasonable

848
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,039
when asked of these cognitive functions

849
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,799
which are not intrinsically conscious

850
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,960
that kind of information processing can

851
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,760
go on in the dark free of any inner feel

852
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,240
but that is not true of feeling of

853
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,039
affective feeling and so

854
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,600
uh my claim and this is where we got to

855
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,840
last time this is uh now

856
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,679
i'm now starting with

857
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,600
new arguments

858
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,440
my claim is that if we can identify the

859
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,240
functional mechanism of affect of

860
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,000
affective feeling

861
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,760
then we will

862
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,960
be able to explain why this sort of

863
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,039
information processing doesn't go on in

864
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,120
the dark so i hope that that's clear

865
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,519
that's kind of like my main point

866
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,840
my main point is we've been we've been

867
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,080
looking in the wrong place and we've

868
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,799
been looking to cortical vision and

869
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,719
cortical perceptual and cognitive

870
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,719
processes in general

871
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,960
in order to isolate the neural

872
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,599
correlative consciousness and chalmers

873
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,239
has said well it doesn't work you can

874
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,560
isolate the mechanism whereby this sort

875
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,239
of in these sorts of information

876
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,399
processing goes on and it doesn't tell

877
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,079
you anything about why there is

878
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,679
something it is like

879
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,918
to see etc

880
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,320
and so my argument is yes that's true of

881
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,719
those processes but it's not true of

882
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,679
affect

883
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,800
affect uh the the the remember what i've

884
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,359
said to you in my summary now today

885
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,079
that this is the most concentrated

886
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,000
consciousness generating tissue that

887
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,560
there is the reticular activating system

888
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,879
and periaqueductal gray

889
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,599
is where the lights are switched on um

890
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,918
and that the

891
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,440
you need uh you you can uh

892
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
switch those lights off

893
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,760
with as small a lesion as two cubic

894
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,000
millimeters in extent

895
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,680
so this is the place where we should

896
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
obviously have been looking in the first

897
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,920
place uh in order to understand

898
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
the

899
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,680
to identify the neural correlate of

900
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,280
consciousness and to enter and to

901
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
understand its mechanism

902
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,240
and

903
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,040
much more important than that um is the

904
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,680
fact that the kind of consciousness it

905
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,520
generates uh in that namely feeling is

906
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,160
it is it is an intrinsically conscious

907
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,280
mechanism that feeling uh

908
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,320
it wouldn't exist if it wasn't felt

909
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,359
and so unlike vision and and and

910
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,000
learning and cognition in general which

911
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,960
does not re does not have to be felt uh

912
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,119
affect does have to be felt that's the

913
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,280
whole point of affect so i'm saying that

914
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,280
if we could understand the mechanism of

915
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,520
affect in other words the mechanism

916
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,000
whereby feeling comes about

917
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,119
then we might make some progress

918
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,240
with this hard problem of consciousness

919
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,440
so remember

920
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,400
that's how far we got lost time and now

921
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,839
i go on to

922
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,599
and i'm now going to slow down a little

923
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,480
bit because i'm now going to

924
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,160
argue

925
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,560
try to identify what the functional

926
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,800
mechanism of affect is but i thought

927
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,960
perhaps before i do that i should pause

928
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,760
for a moment in case there any questions

929
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,000
arising from my summary of my argument

930
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,480
so far

931
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,240
carry on thank you Mark

932
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,560
okay

933
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,119
thanks

934
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,119
so um

935
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,280
you see i'm saying affect is an extended

936
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
form of homeostasis

937
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,320
um

938
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,720
and by the way this is not

939
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,880
my um

940
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,560
argument this is an argument that was

941
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,440
first

942
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,680
uh to my knowledge first introduced by

943
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,960
jacques pancep uh in the 1990s uh

944
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,680
subsequently uh uh

945
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,119
popularized

946
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,680
by antonio de marzio

947
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,079
so i'm just summarizing

948
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,560
my version of what is in fact now a good

949
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,320
25 year old

950
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,079
argument

951
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,839
homeostasis

952
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,400
is probably the most basic biological

953
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,160
mechanism

954
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,079
it's it could be said that homeostasis

955
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,839
is what

956
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,280
enables

957
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,560
living

958
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,680
organisms to resist the second law of

959
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,560
thermodynamics in other words uh it is

960
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,680
what enables them to be living organisms

961
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,640
um they don't just dissipate uh they

962
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,000
remain in an organized form

963
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,800
and

964
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,680
the

965
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,880
basis of this is homeostasis

966
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,760
that

967
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,800
rather than just explore all possible

968
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,000
states

969
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,480
we living things have to remain within

970
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,640
highly specific states

971
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,440
and

972
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,400
these are called the the settling point

973
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,040
or the set point the viable ranges

974
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,480
of the organism

975
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,240
and this applies across multiple

976
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,920
different parameters

977
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,200
let me use

978
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,400
the example of core body temperature

979
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,160
for those of us who think in degrees

980
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,079
celsius you know we have to remain

981
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,880
between 36 and a half and 37 and a half

982
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,440
degrees celsius that's where we need to

983
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,320
be

984
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,520
if we if we deviate too far from that

985
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,280
very narrow range

986
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,800
then we are at risk of dying

987
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,480
and that doesn't apply only to

988
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,560
temperature it applies to

989
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
water uh

990
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,480
to oxygen uh to salt to sugar

991
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,160
to blood pressure to all sorts of things

992
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,200
about our our bodies they have to remain

993
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,520
within very narrow ranges that are

994
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,599
viable with the preservation

995
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,240
of our of our living state if we move

996
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,560
outside of those ranges in other words

997
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,240
if we explore all possible uh states uh

998
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,000
then we die

999
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,119
so we

1000
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,119
have to work against that dissipative

1001
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,000
trend

1002
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,599
as i said that is

1003
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,640
this entropic trend uh we have to resist

1004
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,960
entropy uh and and

1005
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,920
and remain within our viable states a

1006
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,880
very narrow specific ranges

1007
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,560
of

1008
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,320
viability across these multiple um

1009
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,599
dimensions

1010
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,920
of of our physiology

1011
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,880
and

1012
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,839
this is

1013
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,160
why i say that homeostasis

1014
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,320
is what keeps us alive

1015
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,599
now a deviation from that settling point

1016
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,240
then becomes a demand for work

1017
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,400
the organism has to do something to

1018
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,440
return itself to its viable bounds

1019
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,200
and that's the basic mechanism of

1020
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,560
homeostasis that's how all of those

1021
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,640
autonomic functions i was talking about

1022
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,599
earlier

1023
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,319
um like core body temperature and blood

1024
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,400
blood gas balance and so on that's how

1025
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,640
they work uh if you're moving outside of

1026
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,800
your range you have to do something to

1027
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,880
return yourself into the range that is

1028
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,839
what homeostasis is it's the it's the

1029
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,560
mechanism that returns us back to our

1030
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,480
viable range

1031
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,520
now

1032
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,560
what i'm saying is that affect is an

1033
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,760
extended form of homeostasis and how it

1034
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,880
extends homeostasis is that when we move

1035
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,160
out of our viable range we feel it

1036
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,520
we feel an unpleasant quality

1037
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,560
that means i am moving out of my viable

1038
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,839
range

1039
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,880
and by contrast if you're moving back

1040
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,280
towards your viable range you have

1041
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
pleasurable feeling

1042
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,839
this seems to be the basic function of

1043
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,640
affect it enables the organism to know

1044
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,440
how it's doing in terms of its

1045
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,760
organismic viability

1046
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,560
so

1047
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,960
the organism feels

1048
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,200
when it's moving outside of its viable

1049
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,079
range as unpleasure which means this is

1050
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,200
bad

1051
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,839
and it feels moving back towards its

1052
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,079
viable range back towards its ideal

1053
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,480
settling point as pleasure which means

1054
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,680
this is good this predicts my survival

1055
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
this predicts my demise

1056
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,359
so feelings

1057
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,880
are rooted in a value system

1058
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,640
in other words that there is something

1059
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,359
good and there's something bad and what

1060
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,240
is good is to survive and as it happens

1061
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,119
to reproduce and what is bad is to not

1062
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,160
do so this is of course the basic value

1063
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,560
system that underwrites

1064
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,319
all of life

1065
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,160
this is the value system that

1066
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,960
underwrites natural selection

1067
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,359
so the so feelings uh are rooted in that

1068
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,319
value system and what they do is they

1069
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,359
enable the organism subjectively the

1070
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,079
organism itself to know

1071
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,160
whether it's moving out of its viable

1072
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,240
bounds in other words whether it's doing

1073
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,920
something bad within that value system

1074
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,240
or something good within that value

1075
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,200
system that's what feelings do

1076
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,400
they enable the organism to know

1077
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
how they are doing within that value

1078
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,280
system now why why does this get added

1079
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,680
to homeostasis because not all

1080
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,280
homeostasis is felt most homeostasis is

1081
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,520
entirely autonomic

1082
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,839
i was mentioning earlier uh blood

1083
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,480
pressure for example when you move out

1084
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,319
of your viable range

1085
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,160
your heart rate changes

1086
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,280
and your the the the your blood vessels

1087
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,240
dilate um in order to

1088
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,520
um return you to your viable blood

1089
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,960
pressure

1090
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
you don't need to know in fact you do

1091
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,960
not know anything about it uh in fact

1092
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,720
it's clinically notorious how blood

1093
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,119
pressure regulation works uh because you

1094
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,960
can be way out of your viable bounds and

1095
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,720
know nothing about it

1096
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,480
and i'm just using blood pressure as an

1097
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,800
example

1098
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,960
there are many many many ways in which

1099
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,599
your autonomic uh

1100
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,079
nervous system maintains you within your

1101
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,680
viable bounds without you knowing

1102
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,359
anything about it

1103
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,920
so why do we need to feel it

1104
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,520
uh well the

1105
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,240
the what feeling adds

1106
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,400
is when you're in a situation of

1107
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,839
uncertainty and a situation where you do

1108
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,560
not have a readily uh

1109
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,839
pre-prepared

1110
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,160
reflex which returns you to your viable

1111
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,200
bounds so you don't need to feel how

1112
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,960
you're doing if you don't have to make

1113
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,440
any choices if you have automatic

1114
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,720
predictions

1115
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,160
which return you by reflex uh like in

1116
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,720
the case of of blood pressure regulation

1117
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,520
uh to your viable bonds then you you the

1118
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,119
sentient being um have no part to play

1119
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,160
in the process uh what what

1120
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,560
where feeling comes into its own is

1121
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,800
where the organism finds itself in a

1122
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,280
state of uncertainty for example in a

1123
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,960
novel situation for which it's it's uh

1124
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,640
innate um

1125
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,400
pre-wired as it were reflexes uh have no

1126
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,800
have no uh preparedness

1127
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
um you find yourself in a state of

1128
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,920
surprise and uh now what you're going to

1129
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,880
do uh the the the if there's no

1130
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,240
reflexive

1131
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,200
solution available then

1132
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,240
feeling enables the organism to make

1133
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,520
choices

1134
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,440
choices have to be rooted in a value

1135
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,200
system there has to be a good choice and

1136
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,520
a bad choice otherwise it's random

1137
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,319
so

1138
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,240
whether you're doing the right thing or

1139
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
the wrong thing

1140
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,200
is

1141
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,400
is

1142
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,920
announced to you by how it feels

1143
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,280
so this enables voluntary action i

1144
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,000
really must emphasize that this enables

1145
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,720
you to choose it enables you to decide

1146
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,720
for yourself what to do things are

1147
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,920
getting worse

1148
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,400
so i'm going to change my mind things

1149
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,160
are getting better i will stick with

1150
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,119
this

1151
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,119
policy this is working

1152
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,079
so these are not these are not hardwired

1153
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,560
these are not innate predictions

1154
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,920
these are choices made on the fly by the

1155
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,880
organism here and now and they enable

1156
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,280
the organism to survive in states of

1157
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,720
uncertainty in other words in

1158
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,880
unpredicted situations in other words in

1159
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,280
novel situations and god knows there are

1160
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,359
many of those in life

1161
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,800
so

1162
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,040
just to put flesh to those bones let me

1163
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,440
give you an illustrative example

1164
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,720
normally

1165
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,240
respiratory control is autonomic resp

1166
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,280
you don't need to make any decisions uh

1167
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,200
about breathing it just happens

1168
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,640
automatically

1169
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,359
so you automatically remain within your

1170
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,720
viable

1171
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,480
bounds in terms of

1172
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,400
the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide

1173
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,599
um

1174
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,520
but that's only when the normal

1175
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,800
autonomic reflexes

1176
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,640
manage the situation because you are in

1177
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,119
predictable circumstances

1178
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,000
now imagine that you are in a

1179
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,960
carbon dioxide filled room

1180
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,119
now suddenly you move out of your viable

1181
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,520
browns without bounds and breathing

1182
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,880
normally normal reflexive uh regulation

1183
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,920
uh of the of of your respiratory system

1184
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,000
doesn't work uh because ordinary

1185
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,560
breathing uh in this in this carbon

1186
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,720
dioxide-filled room that is going to

1187
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,040
rapidly lead to your demise so now

1188
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,720
you've got to do something you've got to

1189
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,880
get you've got to you've never been in a

1190
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,359
burning building before let alone this

1191
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,319
particular one so you have no you have

1192
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,319
no uh reflex or instinct no innate

1193
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,440
prediction as to what to do so you feel

1194
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,720
your way through the situation

1195
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,960
and please note at this point

1196
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,119
at the point when you find yourself in

1197
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,440
this unexpected situation

1198
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,640
this is where this is where your need

1199
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,680
for oxygen becomes conscious

1200
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,960
so this is a very important point

1201
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,079
an otherwise autonomic function uh now

1202
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,839
becomes a conscious function uh you feel

1203
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,160
what we call air hunger

1204
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,400
or suffocation alarm

1205
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,720
um and you now you move uh about in this

1206
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,680
building

1207
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,800
uh deciding which way to go remember you

1208
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,760
have no you know prior knowledge of what

1209
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,800
to do

1210
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,040
and it's only on the basis of how it

1211
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,160
feels so if for example you go upstairs

1212
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,680
and the oxygen supply diminishes

1213
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,000
you feel worse

1214
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,599
air hunger

1215
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,240
if you go downstairs and there there's a

1216
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,720
greater provision of oxygen then you

1217
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,520
feel better you feel relief from the

1218
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,160
suffocation alarm and so the feelings

1219
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,800
tell you whether what you're doing is

1220
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,280
working or not and so

1221
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,720
your choices

1222
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,319
are based on feeling and so you are able

1223
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,440
to feel your way through this problem

1224
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,800
and survive

1225
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,760
this is not a small advantage

1226
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,680
the ability to survive in unpredicted

1227
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,319
environments is an enormous adaptive

1228
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,040
advantage and so that we believe is what

1229
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,240
the function of feeling is that's why in

1230
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,160
this narrow example

1231
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,720
uh why respiratory control suddenly

1232
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,400
becomes conscious uh that it that it uh

1233
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,079
uh dramatically intrudes on

1234
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,079
consciousness suddenly your need for

1235
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,680
oxygen uh and the purpose of this is to

1236
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,240
enable you to calibrate your choices uh

1237
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,000
to to to to change your mind uh about

1238
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,240
your policy your current policy on the

1239
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,720
basis of whether it's working or not uh

1240
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,040
the which is which is exactly what

1241
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,440
feeling announces for you

1242
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,680
in the absence of feeling

1243
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,119
you would behave randomly and

1244
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,880
one in a million

1245
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,960
will do the right thing and that one

1246
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,119
will survive and reproduce and the rest

1247
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,000
of you

1248
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,280
have had it

1249
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,760
so this enables us to make choices

1250
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,520
within our own lifetimes we don't have

1251
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,079
to let natural selection do it within

1252
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,599
our own lifetimes

1253
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,839
we can adapt to unpredicted situations

1254
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,440
of course

1255
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,200
once you've done that

1256
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
you then also can learn from the

1257
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,599
experience within your own lifetime and

1258
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,440
so the next time you find yourself in a

1259
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,720
burning building

1260
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,920
you might

1261
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,599
on the basis of

1262
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,319
of of of learning from experience

1263
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,280
you might have somewhat less uncertainty

1264
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,119
about what to do

1265
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,160
so

1266
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,760
again let me just make sure that i'm

1267
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,680
getting across my main point because

1268
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,359
this is the mechanism of feeling this is

1269
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,280
the function of feeling this is what

1270
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,400
feeling does

1271
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,119
this is why the organism must feel it

1272
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,160
now remember what um chalmers had said

1273
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,680
uh that you know why doesn't all this

1274
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,520
information processing going in the dark

1275
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,160
and so on that was built upon an earlier

1276
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,720
argument by tom nagle who said an

1277
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,359
organism has conscious mental states if

1278
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,200
and only if there is something that it's

1279
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,680
like to be that organism something it's

1280
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,920
like for the organism

1281
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,079
then he went on to say if we acknowledge

1282
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,920
that a physical theory of mind must

1283
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,680
account for the subjective character of

1284
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,079
experience we must admit that no

1285
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,400
presently available conception gives us

1286
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,599
a clue about how this could be done

1287
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,760
so this is what i'm trying to do in this

1288
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,160
talk i'm trying to give us a clue about

1289
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,800
how this could be done as this is

1290
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,119
nagel's way of formulating the hard

1291
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,079
problem

1292
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,400
why and how is there something it's like

1293
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,960
to be an organism something it's like

1294
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,280
for the organism

1295
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,599
my point is that that question

1296
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,079
only makes sense in relation to things

1297
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,599
like visual information processing which

1298
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,599
it does not have to be something it is

1299
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,400
like to to see

1300
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,079
there does not have to be something it

1301
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,960
is like uh to discriminate red for blue

1302
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,280
you can do that unconsciously

1303
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,200
the cortex can do that automatically

1304
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,280
that kind of information processing can

1305
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,880
go on in the dark

1306
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,599
but would you would charmers even have

1307
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,839
asked i mean nagel even have asked this

1308
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:38,800
question

1309
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,880
if we were talking about feeling i've

1310
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,640
just explained to you what the function

1311
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,920
of feeling is

1312
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,319
and it makes it kind of absurd to ask

1313
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,240
why and how is there something it is

1314
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,640
like to be an organism something it's

1315
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,559
like for the organism

1316
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,119
i hope that you can see what i mean

1317
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,400
why

1318
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,319
and how there is something it is like to

1319
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,800
be an organism something it is like for

1320
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,079
the organism

1321
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,359
has everything to do with feeling

1322
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,000
feeling is is what it is like to be an

1323
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,040
organism

1324
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,680
how you're doing as an organism how much

1325
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,599
longer are you going to remain in

1326
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,760
existence as an organism

1327
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,640
that's what feeling is like and and and

1328
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,040
and this is why and how uh it exists

1329
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,359
so if we can get to what the physical

1330
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,079
mechanism going back to what to what uh

1331
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,640
to what nagel was saying here he said if

1332
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,720
we acknowledge that a physical theory of

1333
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,760
mind must account for this something at

1334
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,119
his likeness

1335
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,200
then he's saying we have to admit that

1336
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,520
we currently have no clue that i'm

1337
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,040
saying it's because we've been looking

1338
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,400
in the wrong place

1339
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,720
i think if we look to feeling

1340
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,240
and we seek a physical theory of feeling

1341
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,000
this will account for the subjective

1342
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,839
character of experience

1343
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,640
and we will make some progress uh this

1344
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,440
will provide us some clue about how

1345
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,559
we might uh go about solving uh this

1346
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,280
heart problem

1347
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,559
now um my next point oh so let me pause

1348
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,359
at that point uh having said that affect

1349
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,280
is an extended form of homeostasis

1350
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,680
that's my next claim uh let's see if

1351
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,000
anybody wants to argue the toss or make

1352
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,400
a comment or ask a question

1353
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,640
yeah so Stephen there's no need to raise

1354
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,720
hand after each point we'll take any

1355
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,440
questions so go for it steven and then

1356
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,480
Dave

1357
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,359
if you have anything thank you

1358
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,599
yeah thank you no really really enjoying

1359
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,079
this um i'm i'm interested in this

1360
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,520
awareness

1361
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,480
that leads to the homeostatic um

1362
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,680
sort of correction and if it's where the

1363
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,559
awareness is with the actual cells or

1364
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,240
organs

1365
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,680
struggling in some way to act or enact

1366
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,480
upon the surprisal so be that in the

1367
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,680
environment

1368
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,119
that they're encountering at the

1369
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,800
different scales

1370
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,920
so this this issue of actually acting or

1371
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,079
enacting and when that action and

1372
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,920
inaction

1373
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,160
can functionally correlate

1374
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,200
up the nested hierarchies

1375
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,240
then it's those actions or the the

1376
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,559
inability to act in the way that cells

1377
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,000
would like

1378
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,119
that then is becoming the signal

1379
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,960
of what or where action is fading

1380
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,520
rather than necessarily a signal of

1381
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,400
um

1382
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,079
that actually contains the information

1383
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,680
inherently

1384
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,599
in it i wonder what your thoughts would

1385
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,280
be on that

1386
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,480
yes

1387
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,480
i agree if i'm understanding you

1388
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,119
correctly i agree with the emphasis on

1389
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,240
action

1390
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,839
um so i'll slightly run ahead of myself

1391
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,920
if i say this

1392
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,119
obviously a homeostatic deviation can

1393
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,000
also be construed as a prediction error

1394
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,920
in other words what your what you're

1395
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,839
doing has not led to the outcome that

1396
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,000
was expected

1397
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,920
and there are two ways of correcting

1398
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,839
prediction errors

1399
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,680
you can either

1400
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,400
you can either change your prediction

1401
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,359
or you can change what you're doing in

1402
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,119
order to bring about the prediction that

1403
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,240
you had originally in other words

1404
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,680
when it comes to

1405
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,680
when it comes to prediction error you

1406
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,240
can either update the prior and have a

1407
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,119
posterior prediction or you've got to do

1408
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,880
something differently in order to

1409
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,359
confirm the prior prediction so that's

1410
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,760
where the emphasis is on action

1411
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,079
now why this is so important in relation

1412
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,839
to homeostasis

1413
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,240
is that you can't change your prediction

1414
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,400
about what your viable bounds are you

1415
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,280
know if you expect to be between 36 and

1416
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,920
a half and 37 and a half degrees celsius

1417
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,920
on the basis of acting in a certain way

1418
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,680
in other words

1419
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,079
firing an autonomic reflex

1420
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,480
and you then find yourself to be at 39

1421
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,799
degrees celsius you can't say okay my

1422
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,960
posterior prediction is that by doing

1423
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,359
this i'll be 39 degrees celsius because

1424
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,520
if you do that you're on the you're

1425
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,000
you're rapidly on the road to death

1426
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,720
so so the emphasis so the prediction

1427
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,280
error has to be corrected um on the

1428
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,640
basis of changing your action policy

1429
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,520
doing something different in order to

1430
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,680
confirm your prior prediction

1431
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,400
so so the emphasis is very much on

1432
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,799
action when it comes to these

1433
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,440
organismic predictions these these

1434
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,440
phenotypic um

1435
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,920
the viable states for your phenotype

1436
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,359
can't be changed

1437
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,079
so

1438
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,880
uh you you you can't just up you can't

1439
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,200
just change your mind about what you

1440
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,359
expect will flow from your actions you

1441
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,359
have to change your actions in order to

1442
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,559
bring about

1443
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,280
the expected or preferred state

1444
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,319
of your phenotype

1445
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,880
thanks can i just add one piece to that

1446
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,400
i think that's really helpful is and

1447
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,200
also

1448
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,720
in terms of like

1449
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,040
multiple scales going down to smaller

1450
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,160
scales

1451
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,559
so for instance if i actually feel heat

1452
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,880
in my body and my i

1453
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,200
my body might be my cells

1454
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,799
are trying to

1455
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:14,000
act to find a better state that can be

1456
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,359
seen as

1457
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,319
oppressive and claustrophobic if i then

1458
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,680
read that

1459
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,680
as being me getting into an

1460
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,760
uncomfortable state it could also be me

1461
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,359
basking in the sun

1462
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,760
on a beach you know in the same way that

1463
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,680
if i taste something

1464
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,280
that's very sour

1465
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,440
there's a there's some sort of action at

1466
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,079
the cell or the or the organ

1467
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,040
level

1468
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,160
reacting

1469
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,640
to that sourness or that sweetness which

1470
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,000
could be like a nice uh confectionary

1471
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,760
sweet for a child you know like one of

1472
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,079
these gob stoppers or it could be quite

1473
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,359
a

1474
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,599
a problem so i i think i like what

1475
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:52,720
you're saying with action i'm almost

1476
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,599
wondering whether that that action piece

1477
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:56,400
is

1478
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,280
um

1479
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,920
the inaction is the prediction error in

1480
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,000
terms of how it can go up in terms of

1481
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,960
these

1482
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,079
these nested hierarchies of of physical

1483
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,599
scale

1484
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,559
yes um so again i must be careful not to

1485
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,200
run ahead of myself too much i mean

1486
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,880
inevitably you know you must ask

1487
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,640
whatever question comes into your mind

1488
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,000
at any point but i i i'm aware that as i

1489
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,839
go down this list of of of arguments i'm

1490
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,559
going to be addressing those points so i

1491
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,920
don't want to make all of those

1492
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,400
arguments in one go so i will just say

1493
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,760
that for now

1494
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,920
that that what you've just asked has

1495
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,599
first of all a lot to do with the fact

1496
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,319
that we have multiple needs

1497
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:41,040
that there's not only one need that they

1498
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,040
have to be balanced in relation to each

1499
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,960
other and also

1500
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,319
very importantly that we're talking

1501
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,799
about a predictive hierarchy

1502
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:49,760
that

1503
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,520
this is what you're speaking about with

1504
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,720
reference to scale uh that what applies

1505
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,599
uh at the sensory periphery uh and what

1506
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,319
applies uh at the core of the predictive

1507
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,520
hierarchy um have different implications

1508
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,520
for the way that

1509
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,160
that affect works so i'm just saying

1510
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,920
those very kind of

1511
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,480
vague and abstract things for now and i

1512
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,839
hope that the picture will become

1513
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,000
clearer as i proceed

1514
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,440
thank you Mark

1515
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,480
uh yes Dave go for it

1516
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,240
yeah i don't know how to state this

1517
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,960
clearly um this is some thinking that i

1518
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,680
i got into from listening to a very

1519
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,599
recent interview you did with um a young

1520
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,640
man in another part of cape town

1521
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,799
i'm talking about perception

1522
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,480
um

1523
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,040
and i there i think there and maybe this

1524
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,119
has already been done i just haven't run

1525
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,359
across the research that there's a

1526
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,359
larger framework in which

1527
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,559
these

1528
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,720
notions of what can be perceived what

1529
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,359
can be perceived consciously what is a

1530
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,559
sensory modality what we don't call a

1531
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,000
sense

1532
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,680
it seems that there are on the one hand

1533
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,919
uh

1534
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,920
conditions we've been calling those

1535
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,920
homeostatic conditions

1536
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,319
that you can't do anything about

1537
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,559
uh your body either adjusts the blood

1538
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,799
pressure internally or

1539
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,640
it goes haywire but you can't be aware

1540
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,559
of it so we don't think about this as

1541
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,160
something that we can consciously

1542
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,119
perceive and we don't call

1543
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,599
the mechanisms that are sensitive to

1544
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,319
blood pressure and uh

1545
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,400
core temperature and other things

1546
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,520
as

1547
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,280
matters of sensation that is a

1548
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,760
perception matters of consciousness on

1549
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,839
the other

1550
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,040
side

1551
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,200
the other side of the mapping

1552
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,960
there are

1553
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,559
single

1554
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,200
object

1555
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,079
uh influences

1556
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,280
a a mechanism that is sensitive only to

1557
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,440
blood pressure

1558
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,359
presents another reason not to call this

1559
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:03,599
a sense um an eye spot just

1560
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,880
tells a certain kinds of worms there's

1561
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,960
light around here or there isn't light

1562
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,599
around here no directionality just it's

1563
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,680
daytime or it isn't i'm under the mud or

1564
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,200
i'm not under the mud

1565
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:15,740
um

1566
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,359
[Music]

1567
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,599
whereas even

1568
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,839
a little more information more kinds of

1569
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:26,319
information qualify this more as a

1570
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:29,759
sensory modality

1571
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,079
and in

1572
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,079
things like hearing and vision and smell

1573
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,640
we have this very rich many to many

1574
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,240
there's many things you can do about

1575
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,799
about many things you can do about

1576
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,720
a burning smell

1577
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,119
and there are many kinds of odors out

1578
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,079
there

1579
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,040
this is

1580
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,119
tie into anything you're you've been

1581
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,799
thinking about

1582
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,720
yes um

1583
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,119
so the first thing that you're touching

1584
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,640
on there

1585
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,599
is

1586
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:04,640
the fact that uh homeostasis

1587
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,319
is only part of the story uh in fact the

1588
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,920
the the the

1589
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,440
example i gave earlier uh of the of the

1590
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,440
person who finds themselves in a carbon

1591
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,119
dioxide filled room in a burning

1592
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,400
building

1593
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,799
they need to maintain

1594
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,920
uh their homeostatic blood gas balance

1595
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,559
um but there's nothing that their

1596
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,119
autonomic nervous system can do about

1597
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,039
that they therefore need to turn uh

1598
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:33,760
to

1599
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,480
the to action in the outside world so

1600
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,240
when i said that the person starts

1601
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,119
moving about upstairs and down and then

1602
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,480
feels um uh is this working or is this

1603
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,799
not is this good or is this bad

1604
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:50,079
that we call allostasis uh it's it's

1605
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,559
it's acting in the outside world in

1606
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,119
order to return myself to my homeostatic

1607
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,880
palms so that's the first thing i just

1608
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,160
wanted to make clear i know it's

1609
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,599
implicit uh

1610
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,359
and i know i'm telling you something

1611
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,839
that you know very well but i just want

1612
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,280
to make that explicit for for for uh

1613
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,480
our participants that um what the

1614
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,000
importance of the outside world um for

1615
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
uh these internal uh bodily states um

1616
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,160
the the the the the bridge from

1617
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,119
homeostasis to allostasis is how we

1618
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:26,000
conceptualize that so then it moves to

1619
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,599
the next point

1620
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,680
which is that think about those kids

1621
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,680
that i showed you earlier

1622
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,599
who have no cortex

1623
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,400
and all they're capable of feeling is

1624
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,359
their affect and they don't they can't

1625
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,359
they can't consciously

1626
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:45,039
think i feel like this about that

1627
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,880
in other words they don't know what the

1628
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,640
about that is

1629
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,000
they they just feel things uh and they

1630
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,960
can't include within their consciousness

1631
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,680
of the feeling uh what the thing in the

1632
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,480
outside world is that contextualizes

1633
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,640
that feeling the context doesn't become

1634
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,359
conscious only the feeling itself

1635
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,680
to be able to extend the feeling onto

1636
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,200
the context to be able to say in effect

1637
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,000
i feel like this about that

1638
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,119
incorporates the context within

1639
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,720
that

1640
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,839
that

1641
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,839
terrain of uncertainty where one's

1642
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,000
navigating the ones palpating the

1643
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,520
uncertainty

1644
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,160
in order to make choices not only on the

1645
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,720
basis of blind feeling but also on the

1646
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,480
basis of what kind of object

1647
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,960
brings about this change in my feeling

1648
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,720
and what kind of object brings about

1649
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,039
that for all of that to be incorporated

1650
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,640
within the realm of consciousness i

1651
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,559
think is a further leap

1652
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,640
and clearly another enormous adaptive

1653
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,119
advantage so the first leap is just to

1654
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,200
be able to feel the consequences of your

1655
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,240
actions the second leap is to be able to

1656
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,200
picture

1657
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,280
as it were uh your

1658
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,680
those actions within the sphere of

1659
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,960
consciousness uh and uh and in this way

1660
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,400
to bring the context into consciousness

1661
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,960
and extend the realm

1662
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,079
of choices enormously

1663
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,880
thank you Mark and i'll just chime in

1664
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,839
with a third question so you mentioned

1665
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:21,119
homeostasis is only part of the story

1666
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,319
and in the chat brock asked what part of

1667
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,440
the story is hormesis

1668
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,039
i don't know that word

1669
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,200
so a small stress

1670
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,760
inducing like some kind of benefit over

1671
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,200
the integrated time horizon like

1672
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,119
an exercise stress that leads to

1673
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,799
improved strength you mentioned

1674
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,920
allostasis kind of anticipatory movement

1675
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,440
towards a set point but where does um

1676
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,039
for example induced stress mild stress

1677
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,520
and recovery play into this extended

1678
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,160
homeostatic or generalized homeostatic

1679
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,440
framework

1680
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,839
so um sorry i i didn't understand what

1681
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,039
you meant so

1682
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,880
you know i think again

1683
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,200
when one gives um

1684
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,839
an overview of a of it of an argument

1685
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,200
like this one always oversimplifies

1686
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,839
what one sort of has to simplify and you

1687
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,319
know when i say that homeostasis that

1688
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,640
you know you always have to

1689
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,200
confirm your prior prediction that's not

1690
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,599
entirely true there are also ways in

1691
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,039
which the the homeostatic range can be

1692
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,160
extended uh the homeostatic ranges i

1693
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,039
mean like for example um

1694
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,240
uh

1695
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,559
you know what i was saying about oxygen

1696
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,720
um you you could you can if you're a

1697
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,520
diver you know you can learn how to how

1698
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,839
to hold your breath and how to manage

1699
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,720
the stress uh of being out of your

1700
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,920
viable blood gas range uh in in a way

1701
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,160
that a naive uh a person like like like

1702
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,440
i uh

1703
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,240
cannot so they are they are

1704
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,160
mechanisms uh whereby uh these these

1705
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,039
things can in very very narrow limits uh

1706
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,280
these things can be changed but i think

1707
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,039
the emphasis there has to fall on the

1708
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:11,920
narrow limits ultimately there is there

1709
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,799
is an utter limit to your viable range

1710
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:15,760
and

1711
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,280
you know this is the driving mechanism

1712
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,440
of the story that i'm talking about here

1713
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,760
thank you

1714
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,079
of course so much more to say and learn

1715
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,440
and add but please carry on

1716
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,400
thank you

1717
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,480
well you can see highlighted on the

1718
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,960
screen now my next point and it might

1719
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,119
seem like a small point

1720
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,680
it might seem like an obvious point

1721
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,319
that complex organisms require multiple

1722
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:47,039
homeostats and in fact i've more or less

1723
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,960
said this already but i want to make

1724
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,760
explicit um and here

1725
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,480
is the same slide that you saw a moment

1726
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,359
ago where i've just added at the point

1727
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,559
that i've now that i'm now making

1728
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,960
the the the the importance of this point

1729
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,319
is that

1730
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,119
we

1731
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:09,079
have multiple needs which must be

1732
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:11,440
categorically distinguished from one

1733
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,920
another in other words we can't have a

1734
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,279
continuous variable called need

1735
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,198
that that variable has to be factorized

1736
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:24,080
across a number of different categories

1737
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,238
so let me be clear what i'm talking

1738
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:27,359
about

1739
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,439
imagine you have

1740
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,799
if we quantify on a continuous

1741
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:34,000
scale

1742
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,640
how much deviation there is from where

1743
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,839
you need to be

1744
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:41,040
let's say okay i've got um

1745
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,158
i've got

1746
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:43,759
six out of ten

1747
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:44,560
um

1748
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,158
of first

1749
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:49,279
and i've got four out of ten

1750
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,960
of sleepiness

1751
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,080
then all i that means i've got a 10 out

1752
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,040
of 20 of total need

1753
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,238
and so all i need to do is sleep i don't

1754
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:01,920
need to drink

1755
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,920
if i if i can generalize from that

1756
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,000
little example the the point that i'm

1757
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,158
trying to make is that no that's not

1758
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,839
true you have to sleep and you have to

1759
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:15,120
drink and you have to eat

1760
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,759
and you have to defecate and you have to

1761
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,399
breathe you can't just submit all of

1762
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,960
these and and bring down the total

1763
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,920
number

1764
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,158
if you did that you would die

1765
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:26,960
so

1766
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,600
uh we we have to recognize that each one

1767
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,080
of these needs has to be

1768
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,799
met in their own right

1769
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,600
um and that means we need to know

1770
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,319
we can't just have a total variable

1771
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,120
called need we need to know which need

1772
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,479
are we talking about and this is why

1773
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,560
they have to be treated as categorical

1774
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,198
variables in other words this here we're

1775
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:53,600
talking about how much how much water

1776
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,960
i'm lacking here we're talking about how

1777
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,400
much oxygen i'm lacking here we're

1778
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,239
talking about how much sleep i'm lacking

1779
01:09:58,239 --> 01:09:59,520
etc

1780
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,159
um so that they can be so that the

1781
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,719
category of need uh that the organism

1782
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:08,719
finds itself in uh can be addressed uh

1783
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,280
appropriately the appropriate category

1784
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,040
needs to be addressed

1785
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,960
uh and now i know what i'm saying sounds

1786
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,400
absolutely obvious

1787
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,880
but why it's important

1788
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,000
is that it's because of this

1789
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,600
because of the point i've just been

1790
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,560
making

1791
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,760
that hunger feels different from thirst

1792
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,600
and thirst feels different from

1793
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,159
suffocation alarm and suffocation alarm

1794
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,080
feels different from sleepiness and

1795
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,560
sleepiness feels different from pain and

1796
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,000
so on because each one of these feelings

1797
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,880
with the quality of the feeling tells us

1798
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,400
which need

1799
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,560
is is at issue

1800
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,520
and

1801
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,320
categorical variables are distinguished

1802
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,159
qualitatively

1803
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,199
so we're not only talking about valence

1804
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,960
goodness or badness

1805
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,760
and arousal how much or how little

1806
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,920
we're talking also about

1807
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,159
qualitative categories

1808
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,719
um and i think that's important when we

1809
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:07,840
come

1810
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,760
back to the

1811
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,080
whole point of what i'm talking about

1812
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,760
namely qualia you know namely um the the

1813
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,080
qualitative stuff

1814
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,760
of um of of what it is like uh to

1815
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,800
do anything be anything and that those

1816
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,120
those qualitative distinctions it's of

1817
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,480
the essence

1818
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,679
of consciousness uh that that it is

1819
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,760
qualitative it has qualitative

1820
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,280
differentiations

1821
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,840
it's not just some uh a total

1822
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,719
quantitative some total continuous

1823
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:42,480
matter of need it's a matter of

1824
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,719
different categories of need which

1825
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:46,960
therefore are different qualities of

1826
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,960
need and i think that's important in

1827
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,840
terms of understanding what an affect is

1828
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,640
an affect is a state of the organism

1829
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,880
registered by the organism in other

1830
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,159
words it is intrinsically subjective

1831
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:03,840
it has intrinsic value valence goodness

1832
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,199
and badness

1833
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:07,520
which has existential consequences for

1834
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,320
the organism and in addition to that it

1835
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,600
has quality it it is inherent in the

1836
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,239
nature of affects uh that they are

1837
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,159
qualitatively distinctive from each

1838
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,320
other and i hope and i hope that this

1839
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,199
very simple functional mechanistic

1840
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,280
reasoning that i've given you as to why

1841
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,600
that needs to be the case why that must

1842
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,719
be the case

1843
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,800
um helps to

1844
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,679
to make clear why affects take the form

1845
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,199
that they do

1846
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:36,800
remember what we're doing here is

1847
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,960
addressing

1848
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,000
nagel's question about you know why is

1849
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,840
there something it is like to be an

1850
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,320
organism and how does it come about that

1851
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,080
there is something it is like to be an

1852
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,159
organism for an organism that something

1853
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:52,159
it is likeness

1854
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,960
is not just a valence goodness and

1855
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,560
badness but also a qualitatively

1856
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,640
differentiated state subjective state of

1857
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,320
the organism

1858
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,760
so i think that

1859
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,480
by

1860
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,280
by reducing the mechanism of affect to

1861
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,719
these essential features we begin to see

1862
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,520
why

1863
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,840
it takes the form that it does why it is

1864
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,320
and necessarily conscious something in

1865
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,640
the sense that i'm the rudimentary sense

1866
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,199
that i'm defining consciousness

1867
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,000
so that's why this point is important uh

1868
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,320
that's why i wanted to make the point

1869
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,440
clearly that complex organisms require

1870
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,239
multiple categorical homeostats they

1871
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,400
need to be treated as categorical

1872
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,000
variables they need to therefore be

1873
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,239
they need to be qualified

1874
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:43,040
uh each of these different factors of

1875
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:43,920
need

1876
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,000
each of these different categories of

1877
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,880
need

1878
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,280
have to be qualitatively differentiated

1879
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,480
from each other

1880
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,560
and this is a

1881
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,800
i think the ground zero

1882
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,920
of where qualia come from

1883
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,760
now i'll go on to my next point

1884
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,080
which is that these different categories

1885
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,040
of need must be prioritized

1886
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,679
again i think this is a this is in a way

1887
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,520
an obvious point

1888
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,440
but it's but i want to just dwell on it

1889
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,719
for a moment uh to to to to

1890
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,080
um

1891
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,760
draw out some of the some of the

1892
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,560
implications of this

1893
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,400
i said earlier that

1894
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,600
our

1895
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,760
autonomic

1896
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,600
homeostats

1897
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,440
run

1898
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,520
well autonomically

1899
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,760
most of the time in other words

1900
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,080
there are automatic automatized

1901
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,760
predictions

1902
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,000
which we call reflexes

1903
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,600
that are

1904
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,040
when the

1905
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,000
organism moves out of its viable bounds

1906
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,040
then

1907
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,520
it fires these reflexes which bring it

1908
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,920
back into its viable bounds and then i

1909
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,280
told you that

1910
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,360
not all of our needs can be dealt with

1911
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,719
that way

1912
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,080
some of them

1913
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,040
as we move outside of the range

1914
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,520
of what the

1915
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,920
autonomic reflex can achieve

1916
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,840
like for

1917
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,480
example

1918
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,760
in when it comes to thermoregulation

1919
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,080
you start to perspire

1920
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,040
if you get too hot this is a reflex

1921
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,199
you start to breathe more shallowly and

1922
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,520
rapidly painting in other words that's a

1923
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,239
reflex these are autonomic responses to

1924
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,239
overheating then they reach a certain

1925
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:31,360
limit um you know that you that they

1926
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,640
they that

1927
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,800
they haven't cooled you down adequately

1928
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,640
so then you've got to do something

1929
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,480
you want to do something like leave the

1930
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,600
kitchen

1931
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,800
and that is when that is that is uh what

1932
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,199
i've just said applies to one of your

1933
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,840
multiple homeostats in other words one

1934
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,880
of them now requires allostatic action

1935
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,480
you now need to do something in the

1936
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,120
outside world and clearly you can't do

1937
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,880
something in the outside world in

1938
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,400
relation to all your needs

1939
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,000
simultaneously

1940
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,880
so all the time you're sliding you know

1941
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,000
your your your your hydration

1942
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,400
your water in relation to salt uh

1943
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,239
content of your body sliding all the

1944
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,320
time it doesn't mean that you're thirsty

1945
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,520
all the time uh you're you're burning up

1946
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,719
the the sugars in your adipose tissues

1947
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,000
all the time that doesn't mean you're

1948
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,480
hungry all the time

1949
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,600
so the question is you know

1950
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,159
what gets prioritized

1951
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,800
and there must be some prioritization

1952
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,520
because you can't do everything at once

1953
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,600
when it comes to voluntary activity in

1954
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,000
the outside world you have to prioritize

1955
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,400
there's an action bottleneck

1956
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,880
and the point i'm making here

1957
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,280
is first of all just simply that that

1958
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,159
you do have to prioritize and secondly

1959
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,800
that what is prioritized is what becomes

1960
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,080
conscious

1961
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,440
in other words

1962
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,600
as i gave in the example

1963
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,679
of suffocation alarm

1964
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,440
that that business carries on

1965
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,440
unconsciously until it becomes

1966
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,920
prioritized at that point it forcibly

1967
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,920
intrudes on consciousness

1968
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,440
my priority now is i need oxygen

1969
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,280
and that's what you feel

1970
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,679
the other needs this is the the other

1971
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,520
point i'm making the other needs don't

1972
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,480
disappear

1973
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,199
at that point they continue to be

1974
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,159
regulated but they are regulated

1975
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:23,679
automatically

1976
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,480
so the prioritization of a need

1977
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,199
brings that need into the realm of

1978
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:32,080
palpating uncertainty in other words

1979
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,000
into the realm of feeling your way

1980
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,760
through the problem

1981
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,199
and uh the this i think is an important

1982
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,920
uh mechan an important part of how of

1983
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,920
how feeling works so let me here

1984
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,600
remember i said i was going to talk

1985
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,719
about the periaqueductal gray

1986
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,280
so and i was going to tell you how

1987
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,159
this

1988
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:55,600
plays in

1989
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,120
as important if not more important role

1990
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,080
in the basic machinery of consciousness

1991
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,000
of the upper brain stem than the

1992
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,400
reticular activating system

1993
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,719
the periaqueductal gray

1994
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:11,600
which is just a 14 millimeter long

1995
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,920
structure columnar structure around the

1996
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,640
central canal of the midbrain

1997
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,520
all

1998
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,880
of our homeostatic mechanisms in other

1999
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,679
words all of the multiple homeostats and

2000
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,199
we have many

2001
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,760
all of the multiple homeostats all of

2002
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,640
them send their residual error signal to

2003
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,600
the periaqueductal gray the

2004
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,120
periaqueductal gray is like a final

2005
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,800
common pathway

2006
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,440
of all of these

2007
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,159
homeostatic error signals and it seems

2008
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:45,120
that this is where the prioritization

2009
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,800
must be must be going on the the the

2010
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,400
the the the the determining which of the

2011
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,239
current error signals is the most

2012
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,000
salient

2013
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,239
then gives rise to and this is an

2014
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,800
argument i must again make clear this is

2015
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,920
not an argument of this is not my own

2016
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,440
novel insight

2017
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,760
this was a

2018
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,520
argued on comparative anatomical grounds

2019
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,560
um

2020
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:16,239
by Bjorn Merker uh in in his in his in

2021
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,040
in a brilliant paper uh in behavioral

2022
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,679
and brain sciences uh so he he

2023
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,719
recognized that the periaqueductal grey

2024
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,360
together with the superior colliculi

2025
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,199
that i showed you earlier

2026
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,920
and the midbrain locomotor region they

2027
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,800
form what he called a midbrain selection

2028
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,360
triangle in other words this is where

2029
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,199
the affect the need

2030
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,239
that is to be prioritized is selected

2031
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:45,600
and this gives rise to a feeling uh the

2032
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,280
feeling being

2033
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,280
as in the example that i gave with

2034
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,520
suffocation alarm the need that is

2035
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,440
prioritized the need that is currently

2036
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,159
most salient the need that is going to

2037
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,960
now

2038
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,120
color your consciousness qualify your

2039
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,040
consciousness in terms of its most

2040
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,120
rudimentary property in other words the

2041
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,960
feeling the affect

2042
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,400
what state

2043
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,960
what organismic state am i in i'm in a

2044
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,199
state of respiratory distress i'm in a

2045
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,600
state of suffocation alone that's what i

2046
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,400
feel why it's because there this is

2047
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,480
where choices need to be made this is

2048
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,360
where

2049
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,280
the creature needs to feel the the

2050
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,239
person

2051
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,239
in that example needs to feel their way

2052
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,400
through the problem the other needs

2053
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,360
remain

2054
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,679
but the other needs the non-prioritized

2055
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:30,639
needs

2056
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,920
are not raised to the level of feeling

2057
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,320
and and i hope it's why

2058
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,760
and we need to understand

2059
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,239
mechanistically how does all of this

2060
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:41,280
work

2061
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,840
and that leads to my next point so

2062
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,760
before i go to that next point let me

2063
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,600
just pause again in case there are any

2064
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,639
comments or questions about this

2065
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:52,239
prioritization function performed by the

2066
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,800
periaqueductal gray which is what

2067
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,280
determines what affective state you're

2068
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,360
going to be in from one moment to the

2069
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,080
next in other words which need uh is

2070
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,560
which need is going to is going to

2071
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,920
qualify your

2072
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,719
your affective state

2073
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:13,040
thank you Mark uh Dave then Stephen

2074
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,520
yeah i just want to throw out there um

2075
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,239
in sylvan tompkins later work that is

2076
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,400
after 1970

2077
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,080
he came to

2078
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,360
um

2079
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,960
elevate

2080
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,560
reset

2081
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,040
to the status of a fundamental emotion

2082
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,840
and i think it's very relevant to this

2083
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,920
the notion of suddenly shifting from one

2084
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,280
conscious

2085
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,040
emotion or one conscious activity or

2086
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,760
world attitude to another

2087
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,239
uh i i i believe uh yuck poncep drew

2088
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,560
pretty heavily on tompkins and the

2089
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,159
reason that he doesn't cite him in a lot

2090
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,520
of detail is that he accepted so much of

2091
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,080
it kind of like what you said about uh i

2092
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,080
agree almost totally

2093
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,160
with um

2094
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,320
[Music]

2095
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,760
um

2096
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,639
oh the the the britisher whose father's

2097
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,239
from india i'm sorry i'm blind can i

2098
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:11,920
understand you had a dialogue with him

2099
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,800
just a few months ago um am i completely

2100
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,560
wrong about it real seth are you talking

2101
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,719
about yes thank you

2102
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,960
am i completely wrong this just just did

2103
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,040
this was thompson did thompson simply

2104
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,040
agree no no i agree with that completely

2105
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,760
tompkins uh uh the reason that pancetta

2106
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,719
doesn't cite him uh or barely ever he

2107
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,080
cites him usually

2108
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,639
in in in the beginning

2109
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,639
of a kind of a

2110
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,120
general discussion you know just just to

2111
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,120
say this is the tradition i belong to

2112
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,199
and then and then carries on building on

2113
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,199
on his shoulders i agree with that very

2114
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,560
much

2115
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,600
thanks

2116
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,400
thank you Stephen

2117
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,239
yeah i liked uh when you talked about

2118
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:55,120
palpatine uncertainty um and the

2119
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,600
salience around that so that that's a

2120
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,199
nice term and i think that relates to

2121
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:02,000
like what is going on so to speak

2122
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,880
um so what about what's going on and

2123
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,400
then now what

2124
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,560
happens next and i'm wondering though as

2125
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,679
well

2126
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:10,639
um

2127
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:11,360
if

2128
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,920
the idea of where which i think is often

2129
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,000
left out there's a lot of categorization

2130
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,760
of what things are

2131
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,600
but where is it happening that makes a

2132
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,400
difference

2133
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,400
in terms of

2134
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,239
how significant

2135
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:27,840
it might be in terms of prioritization

2136
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,840
so i was wondering how much

2137
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,480
the risk of the awareness

2138
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,679
of

2139
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,040
some sort of

2140
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,679
this equilibrium happens

2141
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,840
um could be featured in in this and

2142
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,239
maybe that's where the physicalization

2143
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,960
um and the spatialization becomes much

2144
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,960
more significant than when you're just

2145
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,840
dealing with the brain

2146
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:53,760
yes so well um all of these homeostatic

2147
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,840
mechanisms of course the the

2148
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,000
physiological processes that they

2149
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,800
regulate are widely distributed

2150
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,960
but the control centers of these

2151
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,560
homeostats

2152
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,679
are

2153
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,120
for the most part uh in the brain stem

2154
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,159
broadly defined um and i say broadly

2155
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,239
defined because there's some that are in

2156
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,400
the medulla oblongata and pons but

2157
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,000
there's some that are in the midbrain

2158
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,880
there are some that are diencephalic um

2159
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,199
for example i mean just mention the most

2160
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,040
outstanding example

2161
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,760
the hypothalamus is full of homeostatic

2162
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,440
control centers

2163
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,480
um

2164
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,320
but uh you know so the so so

2165
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:35,360
hypothalamus um

2166
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,440
circumventricular organs

2167
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,960
um the

2168
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,800
uh parabrachial complex um the

2169
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,719
um

2170
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,719
area prostrama

2171
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:49,120
the nucleus solitars

2172
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,360
these are all homeostatic control

2173
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,000
centers but

2174
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,800
of fundamental importance and i i think

2175
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,960
it's not sufficiently recognized

2176
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,880
although mac has certainly made much of

2177
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,679
it

2178
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,840
that all of these

2179
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,960
nuclei that i have just enumerated

2180
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,880
they in turn project to the

2181
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,960
periaqueductal gray

2182
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,000
the periaqueductal grey is uh

2183
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,360
in my view a metahomius metahomeostat

2184
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,560
it's sort of the

2185
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,719
the the the the this the control center

2186
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:25,120
of the control centers

2187
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,480
uh and that the

2188
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,199
the essential function there is a

2189
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:31,199
prioritization function what's extreme

2190
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,520
and and by being able to physically

2191
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,239
locate uh these mechanisms bearing in

2192
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:39,040
mind what where i started i i started my

2193
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,040
answer to your question by pointing out

2194
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,360
that ultimately these homeostats

2195
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,679
regulate physiological processes which

2196
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:48,320
cannot be localized they are distributed

2197
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,120
processes part excellence

2198
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,000
but the center the control center can be

2199
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,880
localized and those control centers are

2200
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,840
there are numerous uh ones and they in

2201
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:00,880
turn

2202
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,000
they all they all send their residual

2203
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,920
error signal to periaqueductal grade

2204
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,560
that that is really important now what

2205
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,800
that enables us then to do

2206
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,880
is to test models like the one that i'm

2207
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,080
describing to you what happens uh when

2208
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,880
one or another of these individual

2209
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,840
homeostatic control centers is legioned

2210
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,199
what happens

2211
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,840
when the periaqueductal gray as a whole

2212
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,040
is lesioned

2213
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,520
what happens i might as well just

2214
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,199
insert that here

2215
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:34,480
is you get a persistent vegetative state

2216
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,480
in other words uh you get that condition

2217
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,840
that um magoon and maruzi led us to

2218
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,080
believe uh uh

2219
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,360
is is is a theoretical possibility in

2220
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,600
other words blank wakefulness

2221
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,159
remember i said earlier in my summary of

2222
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,719
what i said last time i spoke

2223
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:57,600
that the idea that the reticular

2224
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,360
activating system

2225
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:02,840
provides merely a quantitative level of

2226
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,920
consciousness and not any quality or

2227
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,600
content

2228
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,400
that that fictional state of affairs of

2229
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,440
blank waveforms

2230
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,239
the thing that the reticular activating

2231
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:18,480
system was supposed to be producing

2232
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,960
which as i've showed you is not the case

2233
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,360
because all of those different lines of

2234
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,440
evidence that are summarized show that

2235
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,679
what the reticular activating system is

2236
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:29,920
producing is anything but

2237
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,560
without quality and without content that

2238
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,199
this is in fact the foundational form of

2239
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,639
the qualities and contents of

2240
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,480
consciousness namely the different

2241
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,679
affects

2242
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,960
if you lesion the periaqueductal gray

2243
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,440
then you get that fictional state that

2244
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,639
artificial state of blank wakefulness in

2245
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,239
other words uh the these patients um

2246
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:53,199
show

2247
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:56,400
they show non-responsive wakefulness

2248
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,280
they still have the autonomic sleep

2249
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,600
waking cycle in other words they wake up

2250
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,520
in the morning and go to sleep at night

2251
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,760
like those those hydrant and cephalic

2252
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,159
kids that i showed you but unlike those

2253
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,560
kids they show no

2254
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,040
emotional no affective

2255
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,920
no no no response uh

2256
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,480
to their situation and no intentionality

2257
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,440
either

2258
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,159
and so you know that's uh that's what

2259
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,120
you would expect uh would occur uh if

2260
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,400
the periaqueductal gray is where the

2261
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,560
affects are actually being generated

2262
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:31,840
because remember that's what i'm saying

2263
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,400
i'm saying that the

2264
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,480
prioritization of a of a homeostatic

2265
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,760
error signal

2266
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,800
is the feeling of that signal it is the

2267
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,199
rendering conscious of that signal

2268
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,679
and that is what we mean by feeling

2269
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,480
something it means now now this need is

2270
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,199
not just a need now this need is a drive

2271
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,560
now this need

2272
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,040
is driving my voluntary behavior and

2273
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,199
that is why it becomes conscious because

2274
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:58,800
as i said to you earlier voluntary

2275
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,000
behavior can be defined as the making of

2276
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,199
choices

2277
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,960
as opposed to the executing of

2278
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,000
automatized predictions

2279
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,440
just to add to uh notes on that when

2280
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,840
hearing steven's questions about spatial

2281
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,560
localization and how that can refer to

2282
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,040
brain localization as well as like in

2283
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,199
the peripersonal space it made me think

2284
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:24,960
about how awareness a awareness it could

2285
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,760
be without awareness awareness could be

2286
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,040
spatially

2287
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,600
dislocated or awareness might be a

2288
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,480
highly spatialized percept and then the

2289
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,719
other note that i wanted to make was um

2290
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,960
as a researcher of distributed

2291
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,440
physiology in the eu social insect

2292
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,800
colony

2293
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,360
this extended homeostatic

2294
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,960
perspective um

2295
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,960
leads to many interesting connections

2296
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,199
when we think about extended social

2297
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:52,960
homeostasis as well

2298
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,719
but

2299
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,800
just two notes and we can carry on

2300
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,280
very good points

2301
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:05,600
so you're saying we can carry on meaning

2302
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,440
i can carry on

2303
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,280
whichever way you'd like to

2304
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,920
okay great so i'm now going to move to

2305
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,199
my to my next uh my next claim uh which

2306
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:18,080
is which is i see we have half an hour

2307
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,400
left so i must i mustn't it's really

2308
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,719
quite amazing you know because you are

2309
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,280
so generous with giving your speakers

2310
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,920
two hours you lull us into a full sense

2311
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,840
of security and thinking well i can just

2312
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,000
elaborate as much as i want to there's

2313
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,520
plenty of time and now we're down to our

2314
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,360
last half hour and i've still got three

2315
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,840
points to go so i'm going to it's it's

2316
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,840
like uh no one goes there anymore it's

2317
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,920
too busy

2318
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,600
yeah

2319
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,639
well i'm

2320
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:48,400
again grateful for the time that you're

2321
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,679
giving me so let me move to this point

2322
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,159
and this has everything to do

2323
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,639
with the relationship between affective

2324
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,080
consciousness and cognitive

2325
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,719
consciousness i spoke earlier

2326
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:03,840
about i feel like this about that in

2327
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,280
other words the incorporating of the

2328
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,760
of the cognitive domain within

2329
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,840
the sphere of feeling

2330
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,080
and so this is the point that i'm making

2331
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,760
now

2332
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,639
uh this is a a drawing that a diagram

2333
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,320
that comes from a paper that i wrote

2334
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,960
with carl fristen um and

2335
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,440
and and here um

2336
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,000
the the important equation is the third

2337
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,719
one uh and and here this diagram

2338
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,600
basically is just trying to spell out uh

2339
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,480
in in in a visual form uh what what the

2340
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,199
what these equations are saying so when

2341
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:42,719
i said earlier uh that um

2342
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:43,520
we

2343
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,520
have two ways

2344
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,320
of

2345
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:50,480
um reducing prediction error uh uh

2346
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,040
when a when a prior

2347
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,600
prediction does not lead to the sensory

2348
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,920
state that's expected

2349
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,880
then

2350
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,280
we can either change

2351
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:02,719
our perception

2352
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:04,880
in other words we can change

2353
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,320
the prediction

2354
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,600
or we can change our action

2355
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,920
we can do something differently in order

2356
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:14,480
to bring about the prior prediction so

2357
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,800
that's what these two equations uh

2358
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,080
describe

2359
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,199
that we have a generative model

2360
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,920
which generates predictions

2361
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,719
as to what sensory state will flow from

2362
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,560
our actions

2363
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,440
and

2364
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,400
so here so here there's an action in the

2365
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,239
external world

2366
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,639
which is predicted to bring about a

2367
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,560
certain sensory state

2368
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,480
and to the extent that it does not bring

2369
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,320
about that sensory state in other words

2370
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,800
the the difference uh here is the

2371
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,400
prediction error

2372
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,320
and of course the prediction error is

2373
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,040
then used to update the generative model

2374
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,760
uh in order to give rise uh to better

2375
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,960
predictions in order to better maintain

2376
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,400
your expected sensory states i i need to

2377
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,159
emphasize here

2378
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:04,320
because this was not the case in the

2379
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,920
early days

2380
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,280
of the predictive processing paradigm uh

2381
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,360
that that cole fristen and and and his

2382
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,360
colleagues uh uh

2383
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:16,000
unleashed upon the world uh century

2384
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,320
states do not necessarily mean

2385
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:21,760
extraceptive sensory states and so

2386
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,239
in the examples that i've been giving in

2387
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,400
this talk so far

2388
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,320
that this would be the equivalent of for

2389
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,040
example core body temperature or blood

2390
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,440
oxygen level um

2391
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,960
etc

2392
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,639
these uh the

2393
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:38,800
the most important sensory states for

2394
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:42,719
the organism um are its viable states in

2395
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:46,560
terms of its homeostatic uh expectations

2396
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,080
so um

2397
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,840
please remember that when i speak about

2398
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,719
actions in the world uh the world that

2399
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,440
we're talking about here uh is the can

2400
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,480
be the visceral body uh and it can be

2401
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,520
the external world

2402
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,120
the body the the Markoff Blanket um

2403
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:09,679
it it it it the the the the body is as

2404
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:12,320
much external uh to

2405
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:15,679
the blanket uh as the external world is

2406
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:16,960
external

2407
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,760
of the nervous system

2408
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,280
um i think we've got some we're in

2409
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,280
somebody's kitchen here which you must

2410
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,560
put you you must put your mic whoever is

2411
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,040
doing their dishes there

2412
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:33,520
um so so uh what what this uh equation

2413
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,920
here which is which is which is uh uh

2414
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,320
written in in words here the rate of

2415
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:41,199
change of precision uh which is which is

2416
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,760
uh uh omega in the equation

2417
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,920
uh the rate of change of precision over

2418
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,080
time depends on how much free energy

2419
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,239
changes when you change precision this

2420
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,000
means that precision will look as if

2421
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,480
it's trying to minimize free energy the

2422
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,400
rate of this free energy minimization

2423
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,000
process is the difference between the

2424
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,679
inverse precision

2425
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,480
and the sum of squared prediction errors

2426
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,199
so that's this equation here uh put into

2427
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:08,400
words and the it's it's foregrounding

2428
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,040
the the central role that precision

2429
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,159
plays

2430
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:14,560
in minimizing prediction error

2431
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,360
so

2432
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,320
um

2433
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,080
at the the the

2434
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,040
i want to be clear that this

2435
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:21,840
is

2436
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,360
precision modulation uh is

2437
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,560
in physiological terms uh the modulation

2438
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,480
of postsynaptic gain

2439
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:35,199
so the message passing going on here

2440
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,320
between error signals

2441
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:41,280
and and prediction signals

2442
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,199
is modulated

2443
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:44,000
by

2444
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,800
posts it's it's the reticular activating

2445
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,199
systems modulation of that message

2446
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:52,400
passing so it's the increasing or

2447
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,800
decreasing of the gain on the error

2448
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,080
signals that's the role of precision

2449
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,480
modulation which is just the same thing

2450
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,159
as to say that is the role of the

2451
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:04,560
reticular activating system it is

2452
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,960
modulating the gain

2453
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,199
uh in the message passing

2454
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:11,360
it to speak physiologically

2455
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,440
to speak computationally

2456
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,199
it is a matter of

2457
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:18,320
increasing or decreasing precision

2458
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,600
values attached to the predictions over

2459
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,199
the errors

2460
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:26,960
so this so to put it in in into

2461
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,119
different uh words

2462
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:33,520
um if things are turning out as expected

2463
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,600
that's good

2464
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,040
if uncertainty prevails that's bad

2465
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:42,880
so increasing confidence in a prediction

2466
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,960
is good in other words increasing

2467
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,360
precision in the prediction is good uh

2468
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,639
increasing confidence in an error signal

2469
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:53,920
is bad uh in other words uh

2470
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,360
the the more uncertainty the more uh you

2471
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,960
you you become

2472
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:01,440
clear that things are not turning out as

2473
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,239
expected to that extent of course uh

2474
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,639
your confidence in your current policy

2475
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:08,880
uh is reduced uh in other words the

2476
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,119
precision in your current policy is

2477
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:14,400
reduced and that just is bad so the

2478
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,480
goodness and badness the pleasure and

2479
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,119
unpleasure function of precision

2480
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:20,880
modulation that i described to you

2481
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,320
earlier

2482
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,280
is it has this enormously important

2483
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,280
contribution to make to the whole of

2484
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:31,040
this mechanism by determining uh the

2485
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,560
influence of the error signal over the

2486
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,480
predictive model

2487
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,280
so

2488
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,119
to the extent

2489
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:40,159
that

2490
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:42,880
precision uh is reduced in the error

2491
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,159
signal

2492
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:46,480
and thereby confidence is maintained in

2493
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,679
the policy

2494
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:50,239
to that extent the error signal will or

2495
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:51,520
will not

2496
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,440
have influence

2497
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,600
over the parameters

2498
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,000
of the of the predictive model

2499
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,960
and so this is trying to illustrate the

2500
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,560
crucial role that effect plays um in in

2501
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,920
in this whole predictive mechanism so

2502
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,520
this is the

2503
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,840
this is as it were the role of the

2504
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,840
reticular activating system of the

2505
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,360
modulation of the message passing that

2506
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,600
goes on um in the

2507
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,320
these are these are as it were

2508
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,199
this synaptic transmission mechanisms

2509
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,000
and these are post-synaptic modulatory

2510
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,280
mechanisms

2511
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:32,239
and so i'm just wanting to link these

2512
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,679
formalisms

2513
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:36,320
to the affective role

2514
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,320
that the reticular activating system

2515
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,600
plays

2516
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:40,639
so

2517
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:42,639
this so just to go back to the statement

2518
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:44,960
here the mechanism of perceptual and

2519
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,199
cognitive consciousness is precision

2520
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:49,280
modulation of allostatic prediction

2521
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,080
errors in other words it is the it is

2522
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,520
the modulation of confidence in a

2523
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,040
current policy

2524
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:00,320
in other words uh the the perceived

2525
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,239
consequences of a current uh so so as

2526
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,560
you as the as the

2527
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:10,239
a particular need is prioritized uh that

2528
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:15,040
need is felt this generates a category

2529
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,040
of predictive policies in other words

2530
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,159
this is what i will which is what i do

2531
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,880
in this situation in this context that i

2532
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,679
find myself in this is what i expect the

2533
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:28,719
consequences will be um in other words

2534
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:31,440
these are my expected uh

2535
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,360
and and there's an expected precision

2536
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,320
attaching to the error signals of course

2537
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,760
all the other

2538
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,920
domains of need remember what i was

2539
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,400
saying earlier here about the needs must

2540
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,440
be prioritized the other domains have

2541
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,159
monotonous precisions

2542
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:51,760
so the crucial mechanism in terms of

2543
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,000
voluntary action is that to use the

2544
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,840
phrase that one of you said you liked

2545
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,040
earlier um is the palpating of the

2546
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,199
uncertainty in other words the palpating

2547
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,840
of the precision and the adjustment of

2548
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,600
the confidence in the current perceptual

2549
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,280
and cognitive in other words the

2550
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,760
alistatic aspect

2551
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,040
of of what i must do about this need

2552
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,119
state because there's a state of

2553
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:21,119
uncertainty that's been prioritized

2554
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:24,960
there there's a changing of one's mind

2555
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,199
on the fly

2556
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:30,320
this is what this mechanism

2557
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:33,679
makes possible so it is the affects are

2558
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:38,159
as it were a drive for or a demand

2559
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:40,239
for predictive work

2560
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:42,159
for for mental work

2561
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:44,239
and this

2562
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:47,119
the modulation the palpating of the

2563
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:50,080
confidence in the policy

2564
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,800
over the error signals is the predictive

2565
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,280
work so demanded so in other words the

2566
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,440
work of of updating one's policy of

2567
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,360
changing one's mind

2568
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,560
it is

2569
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,159
all of it

2570
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:08,000
underwritten by the affect of demand so

2571
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,679
the affect of demand for predictive work

2572
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:12,560
is

2573
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,719
what gives rise to the predictive work

2574
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:17,199
itself which is the palpating of

2575
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:21,679
uncertainties uh in the current policy

2576
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,000
and the sensory states that it gives

2577
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,119
rise to

2578
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:28,000
and so this is changing your mind in

2579
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,639
other words in other words voluntary

2580
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:32,639
action in other words the capacity for

2581
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:35,520
choice and this is the crucial role that

2582
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,920
precision modulation plays

2583
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,760
in that process

2584
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,719
so

2585
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:41,679
um

2586
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,960
that's uh oh okay good so

2587
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,280
i think let me just pause for a moment

2588
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,199
to see if there any questions about that

2589
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:50,880
because i wanted to illustrate it with

2590
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,719
the case which i think is going to

2591
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:55,679
pretty much take us uh to to to to the

2592
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,840
end of our time so

2593
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,400
before i launch into this last case

2594
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,239
let's see if anybody has any questions

2595
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:06,000
or comments about that mechanism

2596
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,639
i think we'll go to the case and then

2597
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:10,560
there's always so much to unpack with

2598
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,560
defining the variables and understanding

2599
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,480
what the edges mean and so on but i

2600
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,400
think the case is a good way to close

2601
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,360
this

2602
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,560
okay

2603
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:19,360
so

2604
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,280
this is a this is a patient of mine

2605
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,440
mr s

2606
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,960
and he had a meningioma here

2607
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,600
at the base of his frontal lobes it was

2608
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,800
an olfactory sheath meningioma um and it

2609
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,800
pushed on his optic nerves and as a

2610
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,920
result of that um he

2611
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,880
his vision was was was impaired

2612
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,760
and this is how the tumor came to

2613
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,000
attention and it was successfully

2614
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,199
surgically resected

2615
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,760
now because of its location

2616
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,719
in relation in fact to the optic nerves

2617
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:59,040
there was some nervousness on the part

2618
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,719
of the surgeon to remove it in its

2619
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:02,719
entirety in fact

2620
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,719
he felt it was not possible to remove it

2621
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:07,119
in its entirety so he left a little nub

2622
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,639
of the tumor

2623
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:13,280
and uh this regrew and so uh the

2624
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,920
the the patient again uh

2625
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,239
noticed these visual difficulties uh

2626
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,080
returned to the surgeon

2627
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,320
and the operation had to be repeated

2628
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,800
because of scar tissue the second

2629
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,639
operation is always trickier than the

2630
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,880
first and unfortunately

2631
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,520
in the second operation um there was a

2632
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:32,560
bleed

2633
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,440
and that bleed was into the basal

2634
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,920
forebrain nuclei small bleed but the

2635
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,960
basal forebrain nuclei are crucial

2636
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,560
these are

2637
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,440
the upper end of the of the

2638
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,520
remember i was saying earlier that these

2639
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,440
different parts of the

2640
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,159
ascending arousal mechanisms of the of

2641
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:53,280
the brain

2642
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,920
that they that they are the source

2643
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,440
nuclei for these different

2644
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,480
neuromodulators and i spoke of dopamine

2645
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:03,440
and noradrenaline and serotonin earlier

2646
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,719
well

2647
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:08,560
these nuclei are the source nuclei or or

2648
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,320
there are other source nuclei for

2649
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,280
acetylcholine here too but these are

2650
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,360
very important source nuclei for

2651
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,080
acetylcholine now remember all of these

2652
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,040
what i was saying earlier about these

2653
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:21,880
these

2654
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:25,119
neuromodulatory systems is that they are

2655
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:27,920
modulating postsynaptic gain which is

2656
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,920
just the same thing physiologically as

2657
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:31,600
to say computationally they're

2658
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:34,719
modulating precision that's what they do

2659
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,440
they up and down regulate the precision

2660
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,239
uh in the message passing and this as i

2661
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:42,320
said earlier

2662
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,480
it dictates you know which which

2663
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:47,280
messages are going to are going to be

2664
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,520
selected and and which not so it's a cr

2665
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,920
it plays a crucially important role uh

2666
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,960
does precision modulation um in

2667
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,040
cognition and um

2668
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,679
and i'm now wanting to show you this

2669
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:02,159
relationship the relationship between

2670
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:04,000
the affective mechanisms that i'm

2671
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,960
talking about that is the the affective

2672
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,119
functions that are performed

2673
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:11,760
centrally by periaqueductal gray and

2674
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,239
then how this gives rise to the

2675
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:17,840
modulation through these arousal systems

2676
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:19,600
of these different neurotransmitter

2677
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,800
systems

2678
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,639
and i'm going to now show you how this

2679
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:25,760
worked in this case acetylcholine

2680
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,000
modulates the confidence in error

2681
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,440
signals

2682
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,639
and so

2683
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:32,080
let me just quickly tell you a little

2684
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,320
bit more about this patient

2685
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:37,360
um he was he was 56 years old

2686
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,679
at the time of the second operation

2687
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:42,719
and as a result of the damage to the

2688
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:45,679
basal forebrain nuclei

2689
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:49,119
from the second operation he woke up

2690
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:52,280
from the surgery with a condition called

2691
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:54,639
confabulatory amnesia

2692
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:55,920
so although

2693
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,320
the tumor was resected successfully and

2694
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:01,440
the visual problem was was was corrected

2695
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:04,320
he now had this devastating new

2696
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,800
condition uh called confabulatory

2697
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,000
amnesia

2698
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,199
confabulatory amnesia the patient is is

2699
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:14,560
it's not only that they are um amnesic

2700
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,400
in other words that they're unable to

2701
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:19,199
remember particularly recent events uh

2702
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:20,960
but there's also quite a

2703
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,679
long retrograde extension too in other

2704
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:25,280
words there's quite an impairment of

2705
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,159
their retrograde memory too

2706
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:31,440
not only do they have this but they also

2707
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,119
are not aware

2708
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:36,719
of their of their memory problems and so

2709
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:38,880
when they draw up um

2710
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,679
when they attempt to retrieve

2711
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,040
a memory

2712
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:44,960
their the memory that they retrieve is

2713
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,800
not the correct one and they don't

2714
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,679
realize it's not the correct one and so

2715
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,679
uh they have what appear to be false

2716
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:54,320
memories these are the confabulations

2717
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:58,239
they frequently are related um in in in

2718
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:00,639
some semantic sense with the target

2719
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:02,000
memory with the memory that they're

2720
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,760
looking for um

2721
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,360
there's some semantic relationship

2722
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,119
between the memory they find and the one

2723
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:09,360
they're looking for but they can be

2724
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,040
grossly mis

2725
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,679
misplaced in space and time

2726
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:15,360
and so these are what we call

2727
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,280
confabulations and the patient is not

2728
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:21,199
sufficiently critical of these

2729
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:22,800
misrememberings

2730
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,040
as a result of the

2731
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,600
the damage to these neuromodulatory

2732
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,840
mechanisms so

2733
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,080
uh this patient mr s just to give you

2734
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,920
one example i mean an

2735
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:37,440
extreme example um he uh he had his

2736
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:40,239
operation in johannesburg uh which is in

2737
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:42,880
south africa which is where uh i hail

2738
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:46,159
from but at that at the time

2739
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:48,719
i was living and working in london and

2740
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:51,440
so the surgeon who i knew well sent the

2741
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,440
patient to see me to consult me in

2742
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:55,199
london um

2743
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:57,199
because i was doing work with this with

2744
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:59,760
this condition confabulatory amnesia so

2745
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,920
the patient arrives in london on a

2746
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,199
friday

2747
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:06,400
and comes to me on the monday

2748
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,560
and um

2749
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,280
and has no idea that he's in london

2750
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,119
because of course he doesn't remember

2751
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:15,119
the journey he can't remember anything

2752
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:16,880
from one minute to the next

2753
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:20,159
and so uh i i say something about well

2754
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,880
you know the the the the surgeon

2755
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,800
whose name was mr miller the surgeon

2756
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,000
referred you

2757
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,840
to me because of this memory difficulty

2758
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,360
that you're having that's why he sent

2759
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:32,400
you to london and he said london uh what

2760
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,639
do you mean london and i said yes you

2761
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:36,239
know you're in london you don't realize

2762
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:37,520
it because you don't remember the

2763
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,440
journey uh you know that's the whole

2764
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,440
point this is the kind of problem that

2765
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,080
you're having and um

2766
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,320
he denies it he says he's not in london

2767
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,080
now it's that so that's the

2768
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:51,600
confabulatory aspect that these patients

2769
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,080
in his memory uh he's in johannesburg

2770
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,480
and so he believes he is in johannesburg

2771
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,520
so i point out to him it was winter

2772
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,360
and it was it was snowing outside i

2773
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:04,080
point out to him uh the

2774
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,560
the the wintry conditions outside you

2775
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:08,000
never by the way have snow in

2776
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,840
johannesburg so i said look out the

2777
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,920
window he looks art is absolutely

2778
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,520
shocked

2779
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,119
but then retorts

2780
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:16,000
no

2781
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,719
i know i'm in johannesburg just because

2782
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,960
you're eating pizza doesn't mean you're

2783
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:24,239
in italy that's what he says to me so in

2784
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:26,239
other words you know you don't have to

2785
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:28,880
you know you you mustn't overrate the

2786
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:31,199
evidence of your senses

2787
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:32,080
um

2788
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:34,159
and so that's just an extreme example of

2789
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:37,360
what i mean by how how these patients uh

2790
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,639
how how

2791
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,520
uh how their their amnesia

2792
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,480
it's not just a lack of memory it's also

2793
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:47,440
an an excessive confidence uh in the in

2794
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:50,639
the incorrect memories that they draw up

2795
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,280
so uh that's the that's the background

2796
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,199
and and i saw this man the whole point

2797
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:56,880
of him being referred to me is because i

2798
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:00,400
treat such patients and so i i then saw

2799
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:03,520
him six days a week um if

2800
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,480
at the same time in my outpatient clinic

2801
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,040
at the royal london hospital

2802
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,119
same time same place he came with his

2803
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:13,280
wife to the waiting room

2804
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:15,760
i would then go collect him take him up

2805
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,239
to my consulting room uh spend an hour

2806
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:20,080
with him take him back down to the

2807
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,159
waiting room and then i would talk to

2808
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,679
his wife uh because uh he he he was so

2809
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,159
full of uh confabulations i needed to

2810
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:31,119
verify things um in order to get some

2811
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:32,080
sense

2812
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:33,360
of what was going on and there were

2813
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,960
certain themes and this is an

2814
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,199
interesting thing about these patients

2815
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:39,520
the these confabulatory patients there's

2816
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:41,119
certain themes

2817
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:44,320
uh that returned again and again uh the

2818
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,880
patient was an electronic engineer but

2819
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:48,960
but he uh

2820
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,040
in reality he was but he thought the

2821
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,040
reason he was coming to me frequently he

2822
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,679
thought he was coming to me to to

2823
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:58,400
to because i was consulting him about an

2824
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,400
electronic problem

2825
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,440
and

2826
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,119
or otherwise he thought that the two of

2827
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:05,440
us were electronic engineers together

2828
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:09,280
working on some electronic problem

2829
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:12,080
also frequently he thought that he and i

2830
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:12,880
were

2831
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,040
in in some sporting team together that

2832
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:18,239
we played rugby together uh or or we we

2833
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:21,040
were in this a rowing team together now

2834
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,679
his wife told me he had played rugby uh

2835
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:27,119
at university uh a good 30 years or more

2836
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:28,560
before

2837
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,119
and likewise he had he had been a keen

2838
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:34,000
rower but this too was at university

2839
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,560
more than 30 years before and so these

2840
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,719
are again uh good examples of

2841
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:40,639
confabulations you know the patient

2842
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:43,040
mislocating in space and time

2843
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,280
a memory that that

2844
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,280
he draws up now

2845
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,960
and he has too much confidence in that

2846
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,679
he's too too readily um

2847
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:53,119
accepts uh

2848
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:53,920
the

2849
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,159
veracity of of the of the products of

2850
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,480
his own memory search so that's the

2851
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,239
that's the background now on this

2852
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:01,920
particular day that i want to give you a

2853
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:05,760
little snippet of a session from uh he

2854
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,679
on this day when i came to the waiting

2855
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:10,639
room he touched the scar on his head the

2856
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,520
craniotomy scar on his head and he said

2857
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,280
hi doc to me

2858
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:16,960
so this was progress you know for the

2859
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:19,119
first time he was associating me with

2860
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:20,320
medicine

2861
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,239
and he was associating me with the

2862
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:24,480
surgical scar on his head and so i

2863
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,560
thought this was great progress and so

2864
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,320
when we got into my consulting room i

2865
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,320
said to him you touched your head when

2866
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:32,159
we met in the waiting room

2867
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:34,400
and he said i think the problem is that

2868
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,719
a cartridge is missing we must we just

2869
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:39,520
need the specs what was it a c-49 should

2870
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:40,960
we order it

2871
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,520
so i said to him what does a c-49

2872
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,800
cartridge do

2873
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,199
he says memory it's a memory cartridge a

2874
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:49,840
memory implant oh sorry i should have

2875
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,480
mentioned this his wife told me that he

2876
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,360
had had dental implants he'd had serious

2877
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,520
problems with his teeth

2878
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,760
and these had been for many years but

2879
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,679
the the these problems had finally been

2880
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:06,400
successfully treated uh by implants uh

2881
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,679
teeth implanted into the into the jaws

2882
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:11,280
so when he said

2883
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:14,000
that that c49 cartridge is a memory

2884
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,199
cartridge

2885
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:17,199
and that it's a memory implant it

2886
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,520
brought that operation that dental

2887
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,199
operation to my mind

2888
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:22,960
he said but i never really understood it

2889
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,960
in fact i haven't used it for a good

2890
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,280
five or six months now it seems we don't

2891
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,440
really need it it was all chopped away

2892
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:32,239
by a doctor what's his name dr Solms i

2893
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:34,400
think but it seems i don't really need

2894
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,360
it the implants work fine

2895
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,199
so i said to him you're aware that

2896
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:41,199
something's wrong with your memory but

2897
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:44,000
and he interrupts me and he says yeah

2898
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,520
it's not working a hundred percent but

2899
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,440
we don't really need it it was just

2900
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,840
missing a few beats the analysis showed

2901
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:52,880
there was some c or c09 missing denise

2902
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:55,040
brought me here to see a doctor what's

2903
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:58,000
his name again dr psalms or something

2904
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,920
and he did one of those heart transplant

2905
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:02,400
things so this is referring to another

2906
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,320
operation that he'd had

2907
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,400
which is clearly also being referred to

2908
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:07,679
here

2909
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,679
which was that he had a cardiac

2910
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,520
arrhythmia and

2911
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,159
so he had a pacemaker fitted a cardiac

2912
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:16,480
pacemaker so he says so he did one of

2913
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,480
those heart transplant things and now

2914
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:22,320
it's working fine never misses a beat so

2915
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,239
i said to him which is what i actually

2916
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:25,119
thought

2917
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:26,639
i said you're aware that something's

2918
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,480
amiss some memories are missing and of

2919
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,880
course that's worrying you hope i can

2920
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:33,280
fix it just like those other doctors fix

2921
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:35,280
the problems with your teeth and your

2922
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,520
heart but you want it so much that

2923
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,520
you're having difficulty accepting that

2924
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:41,440
it's not fixed already

2925
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,760
so he goes on and says oh i see yes it's

2926
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,280
not working 100

2927
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,599
and he touches his head he says i got

2928
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:49,760
knocked on the head went off the field

2929
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,719
for a few minutes but it's fine now i

2930
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,480
suppose i shouldn't go back on but you

2931
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:57,520
know me i don't like going down so i

2932
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:59,520
asked tim knox tim knox by the way is a

2933
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:02,400
sports physician in south africa he says

2934
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,159
so i asked him nurks because i've got

2935
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:06,239
the insurance you know so why not use it

2936
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,719
why not go to the best and he said fine

2937
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:10,639
play on

2938
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:12,000
so um

2939
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,760
the that's the end of the snippet that i

2940
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,639
wanted to show you um by the way oh

2941
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:18,800
before i to show you about that so so

2942
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:22,320
this is a case uh in which due to

2943
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,480
damage to one of the precision

2944
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:26,800
modulating nuclei

2945
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:29,679
or sets of nuclei

2946
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:32,000
in this man's case the basal forebrain

2947
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,119
nuclei

2948
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:38,280
due to the damage to the acetylcholine

2949
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:40,719
modulating

2950
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:42,560
mechanisms that

2951
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,400
that i showed you earlier

2952
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:47,119
he has too much confidence in his

2953
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:49,679
predictions uh and too little confidence

2954
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:52,800
in the he does not up the gain uh on the

2955
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,080
arizona say looks i say to him

2956
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:57,840
his predictive model tells him he's in

2957
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,159
johannesburg i said to him no you're in

2958
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:01,440
london

2959
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,360
look out the window he looks out the

2960
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:06,080
window he sees snow

2961
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,520
you know clearly not something that

2962
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,599
could possibly be

2963
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:12,239
associated with johannesburg but he

2964
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:14,639
sticks with his prediction he says no i

2965
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,719
know i'm in joburg uh just because

2966
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:18,480
you're eating pizza it doesn't mean

2967
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,199
you're in italy uh and likewise uh in

2968
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:24,080
the case of the these memory processes

2969
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,320
that i showed you in that session

2970
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:30,080
each time uh that he starts to feel uh

2971
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,520
the unpleasure uh of the mounting error

2972
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:36,320
signals the mounting the the things are

2973
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,719
so just think about it he has

2974
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:41,040
he touches his head he's on the brink of

2975
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,560
being aware

2976
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:45,920
that he's he's had a brain operation uh

2977
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,239
that the brain operation has resulted in

2978
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,400
loss of memory i i hope you can see that

2979
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:53,760
with him saying uh that uh i i he says

2980
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,440
we just need to order the specs for this

2981
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,719
module that's missing what does the

2982
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:59,760
module do it does memory you know so

2983
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,920
touching his head uh speaking about

2984
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,159
operations so he's on the he's on the

2985
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:06,480
brink of recognizing that things were

2986
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:07,360
not

2987
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:10,159
as he expected that things are in fact

2988
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:12,000
uh quite different

2989
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,560
my point being that this evokes feelings

2990
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:17,679
this is bad this is a this is a panic

2991
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:19,679
inducing situation

2992
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:22,639
and because this man has damage to these

2993
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:24,639
precision modulation mechanisms that

2994
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:27,760
we've been talking about um that he what

2995
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:30,960
he does is he simply up regulates

2996
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,520
the or maintains his confidence in his

2997
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:36,800
prediction and in this way maintains

2998
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,360
his his emotional equanimity

2999
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:40,639
rather than

3000
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:43,920
allowing the unpleasant uh uh affect to

3001
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:46,639
dominate and the unpleasant unpleasant

3002
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:49,840
effect uh to update um

3003
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,040
to to to to upregulate the error signal

3004
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,639
uh and

3005
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:56,400
which would which would normally update

3006
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:57,920
the predictive model

3007
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,480
so i'm hoping that in this case you can

3008
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,280
see something of the role of affect uh

3009
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:04,800
that the role that the

3010
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,000
feelings involved in this man's case uh

3011
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,199
in relation to uh his predictions uh and

3012
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:13,199
the prediction errors in other words the

3013
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,679
cognitive business um of what he

3014
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:18,639
perceives uh and what he believes and

3015
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:20,400
how what he perceives

3016
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,800
changes what he believes and the role of

3017
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,719
feeling in all of this i thought this

3018
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:26,960
was a succinct case to be able to

3019
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:28,880
illustrate um

3020
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:31,760
illustrate all of that

3021
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:34,000
the because it's only one case i thought

3022
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,239
i should just show you some of this

3023
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:37,199
these are

3024
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:40,239
several papers that we've written uh on

3025
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:42,960
showing how uh these

3026
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:46,000
mechanisms work in confabulation uh we

3027
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,480
it's not just this one case we were able

3028
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:49,679
to show

3029
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,800
that affect regulation uh that that the

3030
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:56,400
confed that confabulation has a wishful

3031
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,719
quality in other words it has a down

3032
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:01,119
regulating of error signals quality and

3033
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:04,000
an up-regulating of predictions quality

3034
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,719
and we were we were also able to show uh

3035
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:08,320
that by

3036
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,560
analysis of transcripts of cases like

3037
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,360
this

3038
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,760
we studied many cases like this

3039
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:16,800
how the affect actually improves uh with

3040
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,719
each confabulation so there's a

3041
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:20,639
increasing negative effect followed by

3042
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:22,639
confabulation uh followed by an

3043
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:24,800
improvement in the affect

3044
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,520
so um i see i'm right at the end of my

3045
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:28,480
time

3046
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,800
i just want to uh

3047
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,639
i don't have time to go into this point

3048
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:35,840
i'm sorry um this is this is not such a

3049
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:38,719
a fundamental point it's just a slightly

3050
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:41,040
different way that i see the predictive

3051
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:44,800
hierarchy um if we if we um

3052
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,440
take seriously um that what we're

3053
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:48,880
talking about here

3054
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:52,159
um fundamentally uh we're talking about

3055
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:55,280
homeostatic systems and that the most

3056
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,599
important predictions have to do with

3057
01:59:57,599 --> 01:59:59,360
maintaining your

3058
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:02,080
the your phenotypic prior preference

3059
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,639
distribution that this has implications

3060
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:07,040
for how we conceptualize the predictive

3061
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:09,520
hierarchy but as i say we don't have

3062
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,599
time to go into that and then the last

3063
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:13,760
thing is just to say that

3064
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,520
these models that we

3065
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,679
that i've i've together with my

3066
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:20,639
colleagues derived from the study

3067
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:21,520
of

3068
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,639
of the neuroscientific evidence um

3069
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:27,679
on the basis of this well-known uh

3070
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:29,920
statement of of uh

3071
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:32,320
richard feynman's what i can't create i

3072
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:36,080
do not understand uh we we are

3073
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:39,280
trying to instantiate these mechanisms

3074
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:41,280
that are described to you earlier in an

3075
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:44,080
artificial consciousness um i'm working

3076
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:47,760
with a a group of really great

3077
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,080
guys

3078
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,719
physicists and and computer scientists

3079
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:55,040
and applied mathematicians

3080
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,880
and we presented our

3081
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:59,679
uh our preliminary findings a a few

3082
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:02,719
months ago at um uh carl fristan's

3083
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:04,960
theoretical neurobiology

3084
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,480
meetings um and so watch the space um we

3085
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:11,840
are we're we are saying that uh if we

3086
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,159
have identified the

3087
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:18,880
mechanism uh the causal mechanism where

3088
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,599
whereby affects are generated what they

3089
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:22,880
actually do

3090
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,800
in relation to

3091
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,119
a self-organizing system

3092
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:30,639
then if this really is how affect is

3093
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:33,440
is generated if this really is how it is

3094
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:34,639
caused

3095
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:37,199
then we should be able to instantiate it

3096
02:01:37,199 --> 02:01:40,159
uh in a in an artificial system and and

3097
02:01:40,159 --> 02:01:41,679
that's what we're what we're trying to

3098
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:43,040
do at the moment

3099
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:45,520
i'm sorry to have rushed at the end um

3100
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:46,320
but

3101
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,880
if you'll indulge me i will wait for if

3102
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,480
there are any questions

3103
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:53,360
comments um i just wanted to show you my

3104
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,159
so this is i'm saying these questions

3105
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:58,320
can be that they look quite different uh

3106
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,320
if we look at it through the lens that

3107
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,400
i've tried to encourage you to look at

3108
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,800
it with me through in other words

3109
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,639
through the lens of affect these

3110
02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:08,560
questions why and how is this something

3111
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:10,719
it's like to be an organism something

3112
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:13,360
it's like for the organism and questions

3113
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,440
like why is the performance of these

3114
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:17,840
functions accompanied by experience this

3115
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,679
is thomas's question

3116
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:21,119
why doesn't all this information

3117
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:23,440
processing go on in the dark free of any

3118
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,599
in the field i'm saying that these

3119
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:27,040
questions

3120
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,199
i've tried to provide you a clue

3121
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:32,000
as to how we might be able to address

3122
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,440
them differently

3123
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:35,599
um oh what happened there

3124
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:38,400
i've lost my

3125
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:40,719
oh oh my good

3126
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:41,760
okay

3127
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,480
ah there i am yes

3128
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:46,080
how we might be able to address them

3129
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:47,760
differently but get them through this

3130
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:50,960
lens um sorry to have gone on my word i

3131
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:53,040
can't believe i've spoken for two hours

3132
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:54,000
again

3133
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,840
but if you'll

3134
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:58,000
if you will allow me i'll be happy to

3135
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,599
wait for any further comments and

3136
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:02,159
questions before we end

3137
02:03:02,159 --> 02:03:04,719
as as we have actually a whole document

3138
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:06,960
of questions and many questions in the

3139
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:10,320
chat i think it's a perfect place to um

3140
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:13,199
end the live session and whenever the

3141
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:15,199
affordance presents itself we're always

3142
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:17,840
happy to have a dot three the numbers

3143
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,480
keep counting and we'll keep hosting the

3144
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:22,239
sessions because this was

3145
02:03:22,239 --> 02:03:24,880
very fascinating and i hope people got a

3146
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,560
lot out of it and

3147
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,760
very tantalizing

3148
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:31,840
thank you so much for inviting me and

3149
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,960
apologies for going on for so long and

3150
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:37,520
i really enjoyed

3151
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:39,440
what little interchange we had over

3152
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,440
these four hours i really enjoyed thank

3153
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,719
you so much

3154
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:45,599
maybe one nice um future

3155
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:48,079
uh event could be picking up on those

3156
02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:50,000
last two which are

3157
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,159
extremely interesting and important and

3158
02:03:52,159 --> 02:03:54,400
then starting with those two with the

3159
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:56,880
dot one and the dot two as prerequisite

3160
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:59,679
and then sharing more about those two um

3161
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:01,360
when the time is right and having that

3162
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:04,960
as more of a full discussion

3163
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:06,480
very good

3164
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:09,360
thank you Mark thank you Stephen Dave

3165
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:12,000
thanks steven thanks steve thanks daniel

3166
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,440
peace out

3167
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,480
take care

3168
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:16,638
bye

3169
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,760
all right thanks everybody for watching

3170
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:25,840
hope you enjoyed that see you later
