4680	43208	00:04	 guest stream number 15.1 with Valeria Beckhatini and Anna C unica. Presentation on selfless minds, unlimited bodies, homeostatic, bodily self regulation and meditative experiences. There will be a presentation followed by a discussion.	Presentation by Valeria Beckhatini and Anna C unica	Selfless Minds
43294	152250	00:43	Presenting pathavara wider project. This is a paper about what happened in selfless state from a Homo Sapie bodily self regulation perspective. What exactly is lost when experienced meditators report losing their self and the body?	This is a paper about what happened in selfless state from a bodily self regulation perspective	What exactly is lost in meditation?

More recently in cognitive science, we are appealing to a more common definition of sense of self that is defined as a multidimensional construct. This will allow us to draw our conclusions and present ongoing related projects.	The concept of the self has been debated since the beginning of philosophy	What is the Self in Human Experience?
363280	824290	06:03	In deep meditative states there is alterations in the sense of self. It's up to debate which dimension are affected by that. Western philosophy may have problems about the Eastern philosophy. Other problems are cross cultural problems on top of that.	So many definitions and characterization of the sense of self have come up	The sense of self in philosophy
825940	1094120	13:45	We propose a shift in focus in the bodily experience, examining this deep mercy state. In the tradition, our body has a unique status. Our sense of body boundaries is flexible and dynamic. This experience is dependent on how you actually perceive your boundary with you.	We propose a shift in focus in the bodily experience to examine meditation	The shift in the focus of meditation
1096380	1493320	18:16	Predictive processing acting framework considers brains as predictive machine. System can also active sample the world active modify the prediction error or the world in order to fit the prediction errors to the world. This comes into play how attention is analyzed or examined under this framework.	So here it comes predictive processing acting framework because we want to breach subjective experience	Predictive Processing
1494780	1598200	24:54	The first way is homeostasis which is the maintenance of required optimal state by survival and reproduction of self organizing biological systems. In this we bring into play other two important concepts in active inference which is way to self regulate that underlie all embassy experience.	Homeostasis is maintenance of required optimal state by survival and reproduction	Quantum experience and active inference
1598940	2140820	26:38	Our proximal sense are central for our minimal sense of self. Different kinds of touch can convey different experience of the sense ofSelf. Medication helps to successfully regulate the body especially in comparison to stress.	Central attenuation plays a role in building multisensory bodily self representations	The phenomenology of touch and self-awareness
2144700	2330480	35:44	All medicine practices across the tradition require systematic and carefully fully crafted body preparation to enter this deep method selfless state. Our claim is that a transfer essential self and body may underline the phenomenology of losing oneself. We propose a shift in focus on homostatic body self regulation in examining deep meditative states.	All medicine practices across the tradition require systematic body preparation to enter selfless state	Attenuating the Self and Limiting the Body
2331720	2490660	38:51	We are in the realm of active inference model in meditation research. We will also build our model on self modeling based on the previous literature. Potential benefit may be for cases of people or individual that suffer from disrupted body awareness or disrupted self awareness.	We are in the realm of active inference model in meditation research	Projects 6, Active Inference in Meditation
2491000	2866910	41:31	Depersonalization is the disruption of both body and self awareness. People with high traits of depression correlate with dimension of the time perspective so they are more future oriented or more negative oriented. Potential title is emotional Body Maps of Thought Detachment, Interpersonalization and Meditation.	Depersonalization is disruption of both body and self awareness	How does depression affect body and mind?
2867680	3194770	47:47	Danielle: We are doing a project on depersonalization and meditation. Would be nice to get all the traditions of the meditative experiences and how they relate to the body. We also plan to organize something around alteration of self consciousness across various conditions next year.	Daniel: We are doing a project on depersonalization and meditation	Discussion of depersonalization and meditation
3195540	3613944	53:15	Is it possible to reach deep matter states also not sitting in a still position? Can it happen when you don't have prediction of movement? You want to reach through yoga just like the opposite of automatic.	Anna: I have three questions about meditation and yoga. I think the first one is curious	How to reach deep states while doing yoga
3614142	3742610	1:00:14	Simon suggested to see what type of meditation maybe changed the sense of the self. Does the self is attenuated or not or increasing and kind of goes back to just Simon. Varia it was very interesting and I'm really looking forward to look at the results.	Simon suggested to look at how meditation changes sense of self	How meditation affects the sense of self
3745300	3959688	1:02:25	There is evidence that in expert meditators tension starts decreasing. But there is also because you allocate less and less attention. Different type of meditation may develop different type of attention. Not yet, but in the pipeline.	There is evidence that in expert meditators tension starts decreasing	Is meditation more stressful for meditators?
3959774	4207380	1:05:59	What we really want with Valeria is to push against this idea that you can have selfless experiences. What allows the mind to disappear is the fact that the impure body is kind of like put in a stable condition in such a way that basically you can afford to leave it in the background. Without that in place you can't really afford to go through this selfless experience.	Valeria and other collaborators push against idea that you can have selfless experiences	Self-Love and the Body
4207450	4822470	1:10:07	Do you think the attenuation of Somatosensory prediction error concerns more intermediate levels in a way increase meta awareness rather than sheer sensory attention?	Daniel: Do you think Somatosensory prediction error concerns more intermediate levels	Somatosensory Transparency in Meditation
4826220	5044280	1:20:26	Anna: The way those deep meditative states are reported sometimes and the way people with depersonalization disorder report their experience is very similar. Next steps would be to create or develop computational model around this.	Anna: I'm really interested in how the self is affected by interactions	Depersonalization disorders and the self
5045740	5198870	1:24:05	There is a lot of potential that can be discovered on this. The body boundaries dissolution is just one part of the phenomenology but it's not the only thing that happens during meditation. Love the idea of the two way street with different bodily and cognitive practices and collaboration and conversation.	Daniel: There is a lot of potential to study bodily reactions to meditation	The body in meditation
