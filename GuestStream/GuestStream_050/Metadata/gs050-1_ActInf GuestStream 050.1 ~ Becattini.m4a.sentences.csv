7280	8620	2	B	0.99981	Hello and welcome.
8770	19224	3	B	0.99945	It's July 27, 2023, and we're here in Acton, guest stream, number 15.1 with Valeria Becattini and Anna Ciaunica.
19352	32080	4	B	0.6731	This is going to be a very interesting and cool presentation and discussion on selfless minds, unlimited bodies, homeostatic, bodily self regulation and meditative experiences.
32240	35584	5	B	0.99981	There will be a presentation followed by a discussion.
35632	40420	6	B	0.98682	So thank you both for joining and to you Valeria, for the presentation.
41740	43208	7	A	0.97479	Thank you Daniel, very much.
43294	45924	8	A	0.86278	I'm very happy to be here with Anna.
45972	52090	9	A	0.99942	Presenting pathavara wider project.
52540	60840	10	A	0.56697	This is a paper about what happened in selfless state from a Homo Sapie bodily self regulation perspective.
61180	71040	11	A	0.97539	So it's as I said, it's part of a wider project that consists in both theoretical and experimental components.
74260	79600	12	A	0.82426	Today we're going to look at meditation.
80440	89620	13	A	0.68856	So for people that are not really familiar with that, meditation is a practice that engaged attention to self regulate physiological and cognitive activity.
90280	112140	14	A	0.99966	What we're interested here is that people that meditate with a certain experience, so for example, meditating in the past two years with regularly, like some hours per week, they consistently report losing one sense of the self or having selfless experiences.
112720	118480	15	A	0.99993	But not only that, they also report to have bodily alterations.
119220	121744	16	A	0.52452	So alterations in the procession of the body.
121782	127372	17	A	0.86067	That has been called expansion, oceanic boundlessness, dissolution of body boundaries.
127516	137696	18	A	0.99	And since you are particularly interested in this kind of phenomenal experience, we have proposed to frame them unlimited body, just for clarity.
137888	140308	19	A	0.9999	So our question here is what exactly?
140394	152250	20	A	0.93	And the question that will follow the whole presentation in the background is what exactly is lost when experienced meditators report losing their self and the body?
152940	160476	21	A	0.99992	So let's first look very briefly at what the self is, or the sense of self is.
160658	168800	22	A	0.99909	So this concept is so complex and so wide that has been debated since the beginning of philosophy.
169780	175260	23	A	1	And of course, it might be so intuitive that it's also very hard to define.
175420	183760	24	A	0.8743	But one very old and used definition is the unitary or unique individual eye.
183840	188656	25	A	1	The first person perspective, that Latin was called the subjectin.
188688	199320	26	A	0.99925	So something that lay under all our stream of experience, thoughts and whatever else happens to us, that's the subject.
200300	211992	27	A	0.99998	However, more recently in cognitive science, we are appealing to a more common definition of sense of self, a bit more exhaustive, that is defined as a multidimensional construct.
212056	219890	28	A	1	And here we will come back on this concept later and we'll unpack it a bit more.
221300	237296	29	A	0.99991	So the aim of this presentation will be to first of all, lay down the fact that in self experiences, the biological organism, so to speak, the human body remains successfully repregulated.
237488	266190	30	A	1	And this might be very intuitive but it needs us then to see that during selfless experiences what we propose is that they may be tacitly accompanied or implicitly underlined by enhanced connectedness with this successful self regulation that we propose to link it with a perceptually attenuated body or what has been already called transparent body.
268500	291430	31	A	1	And this allows us to propose but it's of course on a working process and we are very open to feedback at any stage of this presentation that the term selfless states may be misleading because what is lost is an ordinary way to mentally model the self relation to the body and the world.
292860	305660	32	A	0.61499	So our roadmap is composed as follows first I will passing through debates and definitions of losing oneself and body.
305730	326720	33	A	0.99971	So that means I will go through alterations in these three dimension during massive state and then I will introduce Keen concept of predictive process in the active infrastructure framework that are useful in our explanation.
328100	340710	34	A	0.95945	So that then I can unpack the role of the biological self organization and homostatic self regulation in constituting our sense of self.
341640	354148	35	A	1	And then pass to our more claim that the processes like somatosensory, attenuation and transparent self modeling are a key mechanism underlying the phenomenology of deep mathematical states.
354334	360380	36	A	1	And this then will allow us to draw our conclusions and present ongoing related projects.
363280	366430	37	A	0.9999	So let's come back to the sense of self.
367140	387456	38	A	0.98639	So when one has to investigate the sense of self, of course, as I said it's so wide concept that so many definitions and characterization of the sense of self has come up in philosophy and cognitive science.
387488	395128	39	A	0.99977	So we have terms like minimal self experience, selfhood sense of ownership and all of this.
395294	417000	40	A	1	And for other part I think we have just to stick to a common definition that comes for example from a similar paper from Gallagher 2000 that defines as a multidimensional construct composed by minimal or embodied components and narrative or reflective components.
417080	430420	41	A	0.99983	So to unpack a little bit these two concepts the minimal or embodied experience of the sense of self is the basic implicit functioning of the body of the ongoing moment.
430490	437812	42	A	0.99999	So the stream of experience that happens to me right now can be defined as my minimal sense of self.
437866	446760	43	A	0.99998	So I don't really need to have an explicit knowledge about myself to have this kind of dimension.
447740	457272	44	A	0.58	And these can be further unpacked through the concept of prereflective self consciousness that comes from a phenomenological tradition.
457416	473472	45	A	0.99979	Tracing back from peak argue that parts of our self conscious does not need any reflection to happen there or explicit thought.
473606	481440	46	A	0.99795	It happens in a way tambourian is consistently before reflection.
481600	487168	47	A	1	And then on top of this we build our narrative or our reflections about ourself.
487264	495844	48	A	1	And this is more linked to self identification processes or self monitoring, self recognition and introspection.
495892	502436	49	A	0.75864	Introspection, it's the ability of introspection.
502468	507870	50	A	0.93799	So perceive yourself or reflect about yourself in an explicit way.
508240	516430	51	A	0.99998	So you do need to have that biography or an explicit memory about yourself in order to tackle this aspect of the sense of self.
517780	530592	52	A	0.99909	So in deep meditative states there is alterations in the sense of self and it's up to debate which dimension are affected by that.
530726	541830	53	A	0.87	And it's far from clear what actually happens to this kind of dimension and more and many more other dimensional sense of self.
542380	546490	54	A	1	And we are here to unpack a little bit this.
546860	560632	55	A	0.99998	We proposed these quotations from Fashion 2008 where it suggested that enduring deep massive states one experiences oneself as these very moments of consciousness.
560776	569904	56	A	0.982	This is quotation that may reveal some position about the debate what happens to the sense of self.
570022	576556	57	A	0.99996	So in this case it's argued that meditation reveal a very moment of consciousness.
576588	585152	58	A	0.99216	So there is something that is true consciousness or something that is the real consciousness.
585296	589632	59	A	1	And this actually has broke through the concept of pure consciousness.
589776	599576	60	A	0.99998	So something that stayed there and it's purified by everything, by also the body.
599678	603364	61	A	0.95	And there is so many definition of this pure consciousness.
603412	610990	62	A	0.99997	We brought some example like ownerless consciousness, the consciousness that doesn't have an owner, that doesn't have a self.
611360	617760	63	A	0.99903	So it doesn't have a proper sense of self that walked or that owns this consciousness.
618420	626560	64	A	0.34751	Mastinger has worked on the minimal phenomenal experience defining aspecial a temporal dimensional consciousness.
627060	634080	65	A	0.99	And this is very supportive because it's consistent with the Buddhist philosophical stance of no self.
634150	640340	66	A	0.81043	So for most tradition of Buddhism, there is no self.
640410	642640	67	A	0.99	The self, it's an illusion.
642720	654890	68	A	1	And it comes to our psychology when we enter in contact with the world and with the sensations of the world and certain patterns of behavior that elicit the sense that we have a self.
656080	671440	69	A	0.9998	So, as I said, meditation allows us to access this pure consciousness for supporters of this thesis and rebuilds one choose an essential nature of subjective and we bring this into debate.
673460	685436	70	A	0.9997	There are also people that argue against this and it has been called by Matthew in their special issues, the Ubitiquity thesis.
685628	703610	71	A	0.98733	So the UBIT thesis claim that essential self is ubiquitous to all states of consciousness and sometimes it appeals to the immunity to error through misidentification argument of self ascription reports, which is simpler than this long name.
704400	720812	72	A	0.99	And it's basically the fact that I can say that I had a wonderful experience and this wonderful experience may be true or false on this weekend.
720956	735892	73	A	1	I can do mistakes, I can make mistakes, but I cannot not say that I didn't have these wonderful experiences because the moment in which I report I have a perspective on this.
735946	739300	74	A	0.99998	So I cannot really be mistaking on the fact that I'm reporting this.
739370	744576	75	A	0.51246	Maybe I was dreaming, maybe it wasn't a wonderful experience, but it's me that I'm reporting.
744608	748470	76	A	0.9999	So the moment I'm reporting this, it means that I have to be there.
748920	758700	77	A	1	And this applies also to when I ascribe myself selfless state, I had a selfless state.
758850	760700	78	A	0.9605	This is very controversial.
761680	766728	79	A	0.80514	Other problems on top of that are cross cultural problems also addressed in the literature.
766904	782180	80	A	0.99992	So this experience selfless states may be influenced by certain vows or certain beliefs that meditator endorse, especially during especially expert meditators.
782520	799060	81	A	1	And the other thing is these all cross cultural analysis and debate about the self may be also partially due to a verbal misunderstanding.
799140	806968	82	A	0.99995	So that the western philosophy may have problems about the self that actually the Eastern probably philosophy is not really addressing.
807064	811548	83	A	0.99935	So there might be some incommensurability of problems there.
811714	824290	84	A	0.62532	But as also we said in the paper, it's not that we want to address the Buddhist philosophical problems, rather we want to bring insight from these to our problems.
825940	831536	85	A	0.94529	So, given this debate, we want to propose a shift in the focus.
831638	839700	86	A	0.9999	So we don't want to start by looking at consciousness and trying to solve things about the self, but we want to start by focusing on the body.
839850	846630	87	A	0.99998	So we proposed a shift in focus in the bodily experience, examining this deep mercy state.
848940	858060	88	A	0.99965	So let's start by the subjective experience of the body or the study of the subjective experience of the body, which is phenomenology.
858480	861980	89	A	0.99279	In the tradition, our body has a unique status.
862560	868568	90	A	0.92532	So the anatomical structure of the body has been called by USA Kobe.
868664	873276	91	A	0.999	So the living body, the body that I can observe and others can be observed.
873308	877168	92	A	0.7344	So it's the object among the other object, they would say.
877334	882628	93	A	0.99846	But it's not only that because it's an object that I can live from inside.
882794	888950	94	A	0.7383	So it has been called the light, the lived body or the body as I leave it from inside, as I said.
890440	893972	95	A	0.99987	So what happens to these kind of dimension?
894036	899544	96	A	0.99994	Again, we can unpack this and see how the meditative states affect them.
899742	908876	97	A	0.99991	So from the point of view of the life believed body, we already know, and I will unpack a little bit more.
908978	921260	98	A	0.99954	So we have already said that we have called unlinuated body experiences the reports that spoke about this fading of the body boundaries.
921420	928156	99	A	0.99996	So the body boundary has been defined as a cognitive emotional perception of one's body surface.
928268	929836	100	A	0.52373	That's just a definition.
930028	932704	101	A	0.70812	We can also debate about this.
932822	939072	102	A	0.61415	But what it's important about for us that our sense of body boundaries is flexible and dynamic.
939136	944410	103	A	0.99989	It's not fixed because we are in the realm of the body as felt from inside.
945820	959228	104	A	0.99999	There is an interesting study that exemplified this concept in relation to meditation by Jumpren in 2016, though it has worked late further on on this as well.
959394	974796	105	A	0.7741	But I find it interesting to look at this image because this is part of a self report measurement that they used on a sample of people that had been trained in meditation, in particular with body scanning.
974908	981010	106	A	0.95337	So that people had to systematically scan sensation running the body.
981540	1001528	107	A	1	And the result is that in less than four months of practice, so not actually not the expert, they really started to report an increased tendency to go towards the almost imperceptible perception of the body.
1001694	1011960	108	A	0.99995	So they conclude that meditation can be actually studied in this sense where it affects our sense of body boundaries.
1012040	1025916	109	A	1	And they saw significant results also in relation to increased mood, happiness and decreased anxiety and rumination.
1025948	1030070	110	A	0.96827	But this is just another story that will come back later.
1031320	1042740	111	A	0.96991	So I find interesting also this quotation by Fink here in this paper it's talking about why ego dissolution may be better understood as ego expansion.
1044920	1050200	112	A	1	And then ego dissolution comes in a later interpretation.
1051980	1053496	113	A	1	And so I will read it.
1053598	1062300	114	A	0.87053	It's not the feeling of self that dissolves, but the boundary between a feeling of self and the feeling of anything else in consciousness.
1062720	1079010	115	A	0.9986	So here again Pink is talking about consciousness but from our perspective this quotation is pretty informing because it goes in our direction as well because he says it's not that you're losing really yourself.
1079720	1088724	116	A	0.52267	This experience is dependent on how you actually perceive your boundary with you and what you don't consider you.
1088762	1094120	117	A	0.99956	So self fading of the self other distinction ability.
1096380	1116780	118	A	0.99962	So here it comes predictive processing acting framework because we want to basically breach this phenomenal subjective experience to cognitive phenomena and underlying mechanistic explanation.
1118260	1122892	119	A	0.93588	Indeed, predictive processing activities have recently used for this purpose.
1122956	1129148	120	A	0.99989	Also meditation research and psychopathology research and so on.
1129334	1137552	121	A	0.9615	So in this presentation I will use them in an interchangeable way but following certain trends.
1137616	1153080	122	A	0.99985	But it doesn't have to be, it's also under debate and I will also give API purely I don't know how to say theoretical perspective on that I will not go too much technical.
1154620	1179164	123	A	0.98638	So briefly, this framework considers brains as predictive machine or as Friesen likes to say, consider brain as a fantastic organ which is because it's not only able to do amazing things, but also because it really generates fantasies about the world.
1179302	1202490	124	A	0.99	And this is because in order to act, interact with itself and the world around, the brain constantly anticipate the current state of affairs in order to make sense of the sensorium or the stream of experiences that happens.
1204480	1221952	125	A	0.59535	So it possess or embody or utilizes, it depends on the commitment a generative model which is a model that keep tracks of regularity of the world and forms predictions out of it in a hierarchical way.
1222086	1239670	126	A	0.9999	So highly rated prediction goes down to match sensory data and sensory data goes up to map to affect the predictions, to update the model.
1240600	1249124	127	A	1	However, every prediction comes with a degree of error which sometimes is called prediction errors.
1249252	1275970	128	A	0.99926	So the prediction error is a discrepancy between prediction and sensory input so that a new model is generated and they say the first imperative or the only imperative of the system is actually minimizing the prediction errors so that the model can most efficiently cope and interact and act in the world.
1276580	1302200	129	A	1	However, it's not the only imperative because as I will introduce in this slide, the system has also to estimate the confidence or likelihood or precision of prediction in order to evaluate the prediction errors that are coming from the discrepancy.
1302860	1329512	130	A	0.99983	So that the generative model has to compute in a fine way how much precision to assign to the prediction or prediction errors and I choose this image because it renders well how the distribution are set depending on the precision citation.
1329596	1337872	131	A	0.99646	So if you have a precise prediction error then the posterior distribution will be closer to the prediction error.
1337936	1365180	132	A	0.50564	Well, the imprecise prediction error have little effect on the prior, so does the posture distribution will be closer to the prior and this is very important because if the precision estimator are not weighted correctly then the system generates false inference that will not able to the system to interact efficiently and update the model efficiently.
1366400	1375680	133	A	0.98949	So, so far we have mostly talked about prediction error minimization by updating the model.
1375830	1391396	134	A	1	However, the system can also active sample the world active modify the prediction error or the world in order to fit the prediction errors to the world.
1391578	1412300	135	A	1	And this comes into play active inference that builds upon the free energy principle where it's based on the idea that living organisms maintain themselves with an optimal set of states that comes from the second low thermodynamics of schrodinger.
1414800	1427820	136	A	0.99163	So given that it comes into play how attention is analyzed or examined under this framework.
1428320	1455308	137	A	0.99224	So given that that the organism has to maintain within these optimal assessor states by maintaining an optimal balance between computation and precision optimization so wasting between prediction and prediction errors, attention comes into place as a modulation of this precision of sensory data working as a search light.
1455474	1460376	138	A	0.99561	So in other words, it optimizes signal to noise ratio.
1460408	1493320	139	A	0.57309	It's one of the way that we have to put in place this local optimization of precision estimates and this is very important why we bring into attention because meditation has a systematic and use of attention resources and we will come back into that a bit further on in this presentation.
1494780	1515390	140	A	1	And given that we are interested in okay, we have seen the lived body, what happens to the phenomenal experience now we're interested in what happens to the corporate, what happens to believing body that can be observed by the organism during medicine states.
1516480	1539456	141	A	0.68477	In this we bring into play other two important concepts in active inference which is way to self regulate that underlie all embassy experience, so all subjective experience, so two ways or one way that then is also active.
1539568	1550628	142	A	0.99983	So the first way is homeostasis which is the maintenance of required optimal state by survival and reproduction of self organizing biological systems.
1550644	1564456	143	A	0.99733	So for example, I cold and I use my internal resources to keep my states into optimal state so I start shivering.
1564568	1573196	144	A	0.99999	However, I can also put in place active modification in the world so that I'm not cold anymore.
1573388	1576556	145	A	0.99988	So for example, I take a blank, this is called allostasis.
1576588	1584500	146	A	0.61102	So it's active engagements and modification about the environment in order to maintain myself in optimal state for survival.
1585560	1598200	147	A	0.99997	So we can say of course, human bodies are self organizing biological system aiming at keeping these internal states within a certain viable range for survival.
1598940	1604170	148	A	1	Now, given that we will come back again to the phenomenology of touch.
1605360	1612750	149	A	0.49653	I'm going to do this for the second time to then wrap up everything again.
1615200	1618850	150	A	0.99663	So, we have talked about fermology of the body.
1619300	1629280	151	A	0.99588	However, we haven't underlined the importance that the touch and proximal sound has for our lip.
1631140	1642650	152	A	0.56105	Our as Nikka and colleagues has already proposed, our proximal sense are central for our minimal sense of self.
1643500	1655336	153	A	0.94	And on top of that, we bring into play the fact that different kinds of touch can convey different experience of the sense of self or sense of boundaries.
1655448	1667810	154	A	0.99348	So for example, imagine yourself that you are in a city of Portugal or California, you touching the whole environment with your body.
1668340	1676848	155	A	0.99996	You may feel that you have a sense of immersiveness or that your body boundaries are slowly a bit becoming less clear.
1677014	1690656	156	A	1	And this experience, it's actually a bit similar to the experiences of sensory deprivation states where people are put in a salty water and they let them flow for some moments.
1690848	1702650	157	A	0.61205	Sensory deprivation states are not really all deprived because you have other activities in the body and movements that produce signals that you are actually aware of.
1703020	1708876	158	A	0.9984	However, in both these experiences, the body boundary seems to fade a little bit.
1709058	1721376	159	A	1	However, if you're in the sea and you're swimming and then you touch the rock with your hand, you clearly will feel yourself as separated as something different from what you're actually touching, right?
1721478	1722720	160	A	0.98194	Sense of separation.
1724580	1735680	161	A	0.92905	This phenomenology can be brought into active inference through the mechanism of some of the sensory attenuation which comes from the sensory tinuation.
1736120	1743160	162	A	0.99357	So this process happens when the systemicates its own action.
1743980	1756556	163	A	0.9965	So for example, I take a glass and in this moment my rena has already created afferent copies of this action and the sensory consequences of this.
1756658	1768880	164	A	0.99995	So whenever I grab this glass, the sensory constant that happens to my body are slightly attenuated.
1769220	1775344	165	A	0.94	And this is why we cannot tickle ourselves because the prediction errors comes at.
1775382	1783972	166	A	0.9963	Not surprising this has implication for our embodied experience in the world.
1784026	1788564	167	A	0.99998	Because we feel that we are in immediate contact with ourselves in the world.
1788602	1796404	168	A	1	And this is because our conscious experience are mediated by transparent or non perceived cognitive processes.
1796532	1802920	169	A	0.9997	So that the system can leave behind or disatten self related sensory processing.
1803500	1810990	170	A	0.9	And these allow to allocate resources to perception and action involved in the processing of the object of interest.
1811440	1830850	171	A	0.99431	So for example, when LeMans confiscated this example of the cherry, when I have to take object salient for me, I'll be much more interested in picking the object and I will not really focus on my arm moving in picking that.
1831240	1839060	172	A	0.99986	So that the system needs to compute and maintain a fine balance between external and internal components of somatosensory attenuation.
1839400	1842630	173	A	1	And this is very important for a sense of self as well.
1843020	1851448	174	A	0.99484	So we need to understand and it's not that we need, but in order for us to have a sense of self.
1851534	1856284	175	A	1	We normally have a sense of what we are and what we are not.
1856402	1866040	176	A	0.9995	But for the brain as agents end up with the brain, we compute this distinction.
1866120	1873730	177	A	0.99998	So where the self ends and where do work begins or do I move my arm or my arm is moved by something or someone?
1874980	1884100	178	A	0.76249	So central attenuation plays a role in these distinctions in building multisensory bodily self representations.
1884680	1890976	179	A	0.99995	So that the sense of the self embody is subject to the and phenomenally transferred.
1891168	1901192	180	A	0.99997	That means that when we act in the world and we interact, we normally disattend the way we are in the world.
1901326	1904792	181	A	1	Because we need to be in contact, in direct contact with the world.
1904846	1919152	182	A	0.85751	If we always attend it to our body and ourself in the sense that we will be hyper reflexive then we will be actually will be impaired in what we normally do.
1919206	1922530	183	A	1	And this is actually a condition that we will talk about later.
1924020	1930052	184	A	0.97032	So that in active images the sense of self is an ongoing inferential process centering the body.
1930106	1942948	185	A	0.98391	So what we propose is what is lost during selfless experience is an ordinary way to mentally model self in relation to the body and the world.
1943114	1956940	186	A	0.99957	So that if we think about the self as I propose here the iceberg where the narrative self is what we see but the renewal self is what we actually are composed of and it's actually larger but we are not aware of.
1957090	1966620	187	A	0.99996	Similarly, when we have self experience we may have also this inferential process where we think we have lost ourselves.
1969220	1982580	188	A	0.99993	However, we have gathered some evidence in the fact that meditation facilitate autonomic regulation involved in homostatic processes.
1983080	1989590	189	A	0.99997	That means for example that meditation increase the synchronization of cardiac and respiratory system.
1991320	1999140	190	A	0.80572	This is connected with reduced levels of blood glucose or blood pressure and heart rate variability.
1999220	2003770	191	A	0.99974	So there is a success.
2004140	2014220	192	A	0.89065	Medication helps to successfully self regulate the body especially in comparison to stress that actually does the opposite.
2016560	2024320	193	A	0.89	And on top of that, meditation help us to attune us to our physiological interceptive awareness.
2024900	2050970	194	A	1	And it does it so they say, by enhancing the processing of extraceptive interceptive stimuli which doesn't have to be understanded as a maladaptive increased body awareness, but rather an adaptive body awareness which is a distinction that we can come back later if people are interested or they ask about.
2054480	2061032	195	A	0.99201	These evidence are also in line with evidence of meditation that promotes self regulation of pain and pain and pleasantness.
2061096	2086950	196	A	0.99818	So three day attentional training, the meditation allow you're actually able to self regulate the pain and not really like the sensation of the pain because actually it gets very fewer but the automatic behavioral patterns that comes in association with the pain.
2087480	2094170	197	A	0.99993	So there is a lot of also self regulation on emotions and so on.
2095420	2110460	198	A	0.99995	So the body does not literally disappear actually it stays at the very center as I propose here at the center as we propose it in the paper and I propose it through this image at the center of a cycling.
2111520	2124780	199	A	0.99978	So self regulatory processes allow the subjective experience to lose oneself so that the sense of the body remains present in the background.
2124940	2140820	200	A	1	And this for example, it's very clear from this report from a person undergoing this kind of experience that they say that there remains a sense that there is a body without any experience of a sense of boundary.
2144700	2160860	201	A	0.99844	So this is not very last slide but we come to our wrap up of our claim attenuating the self and limiting the body which is also the title of our paper.
2160930	2176960	202	A	0.99436	So, starting from the fact that all medicine practices across the tradition require systematic and carefully fully crafted body preparation to enter this deep method selfless state.
2177110	2188880	203	A	0.99998	So it doesn't happen that all of a sudden you just have a selfless state which actually may happen more similarly with psychedelic.
2188960	2201960	204	A	0.64002	But with meditation you need to pass through gradually a many different state or many different level of concentration.
2203820	2216088	205	A	0.99996	That happens when you have around a predictable environment and you do so by building prior expectation.
2216264	2219980	206	A	0.99998	So you have to keep your body in a certain position of posture.
2220060	2229904	207	A	0.77904	As you say in this image, the person is seated with a very straight, not very, but a straight back relaxed.
2229952	2233670	208	A	0.94262	This is very important meditation, banded legs and so on.
2234360	2249400	209	A	1	And then you need at least in the most part of your practice, you need safe predictable environments with temperature that enables you to maintain your homostatic processes.
2250860	2256120	210	A	0.99995	So all these conditions are necessary for your successful homostatic self regulation.
2257180	2280240	211	A	0.97196	In this sense when parts of preparation to enter then after the state of confrontation, the meditator can let go and leave behind self related processes and process the body transported or it can attenuate them attenuate the body can be attenuated.
2281620	2294790	212	A	0.9999	So our claim is that a transfer essential self and body may underline the phenomenology of losing oneself and blurring body boundaries as reported during meditative states.
2297820	2306970	213	A	0.50963	So our conclusion is that we have proposed a shift in focus on homostatic body self regulation in examining deep meditative states.
2308140	2314750	214	A	0.6	The experience of having a body living self organism biological system is never lost in this process.
2315280	2323200	215	A	0.99995	Rather it stay transferred at its very center, self attenuated yet very much present and hands alive.
2323780	2330480	216	A	0.60896	So that the self model is attenuated to become transparent and hands processed in the background.
2331720	2335860	217	A	1	Now giving this conclusion now I'm going to present related project.
2336010	2342068	218	A	1	The first one is still on the theoretical side.
2342234	2346616	219	A	0.56928	So we are in the realm of active inference model in meditation research.
2346798	2375330	220	A	0.99999	There is a radio literature about that that have studied different kinds of meditation techniques like focused attention, open monitoring, nondual awareness and they all study from Laconin in 2023 or Laconin and Lactar in 2021.
2376900	2399512	221	A	0.99997	They have for example showed that these attention techniques profoundly alter typical mental experiences and for example focus meditation is meditation that engage attention on one specific object experience.
2399646	2425792	222	A	0.99999	For example the breath and in active inference term it means that precision is estimated one sensory input which means that it reduce the impact of the other thoughts and parallel processes that are going on or often open monitoring meditation is the engaging of attention to one's experience as a whole.
2425846	2431090	223	A	0.78494	So the whole stream of experience without selecting anything in particular.
2431540	2443936	224	A	0.58878	So that in an activatory terms it has been described as assigning equal precision to all these experiencing promoting non reactive sensing.
2443968	2451290	225	A	1	And this is connected also why medicine are good in self regulated regulate pain.
2453100	2465500	226	A	0.9945	So we will also build our model on self modeling based on the previous literature which is integration.
2467600	2490660	227	A	1	And then going experimental we want to bring into the table application of what we're researching and potential benefit may be for cases of people or individual that suffer from disrupted body awareness or disrupted self awareness.
2491000	2501880	228	A	1	And there is a relatively recent condition that has been studied that is depersonalization.
2502780	2533140	229	A	0.98457	So depersonization is the disruption of both body and self awareness and it's a very heterogeneous condition, there is a lot of different dimensions that occurs but generally it's connected with feelings of heaviness disconnection feeling the body as an object, rather they're a transfer and medium of experience which simply is called disembodiment.
2533960	2542580	230	A	0.85207	It is linked with difficulties in concentration and attention, often comorbid with depression, rumination and anxiety.
2543000	2552760	231	A	0.93	And recently Chow Nuka and colleagues has also proposed AIDS characterized by failures in attenuating somatosentry signals.
2553980	2571680	232	A	0.87491	So based on what we have previously said and based on how this condition affects large number of population, we want to test certain hypotheses.
2572580	2591860	233	A	0.99978	So the first one would be that higher somasocentric attenuation Correlate with more feeling of aliveness and wide openness in experienced meditators and rather lowest somascentric attenuation Correlate with feelings of unrealness thatness in people experience deeper solidation.
2593420	2604424	234	A	0.52	And on the other hand, severe homostatic dysregulation of bodily states during deep meditative states may lead to negative emotional outcomes and Abernant self experience.
2604622	2626050	235	A	0.99809	This comes from to the fact that depression and meditation can both create stressing negative outcomes and it's interesting to see how this happened and what are the commonalities and differences in that.
2626980	2641460	236	A	1	And also we have dealt in the realm of spatial temporal perception which is connected also with mood disorders or like depression and anxiety and also with depersonalization.
2642520	2655792	237	A	0.99984	However, in depersonalization there is no specific items in the questionnaire that is usually used for measuring which is the Cambridge Depressionization scale.
2655876	2668780	238	A	0.70714	So we want to test this as well and we want to test it in people reporting selfless and disembodied experience so both pathological and non pathological conditions.
2670180	2690564	239	A	0.98005	So part of this hypothesis we are really going through this is our team coming from Humboldt University where I come from as well Simon Wendelman, but also University College London with Ines and Joseph first study is as I said about.
2690602	2691600	240	A	0.50432	Time perspective.
2691680	2707880	241	A	0.98905	So we want to analyze how people with high traits of depression correlate with dimension of the time perspective so they are more future oriented or more negative oriented.
2707960	2727420	242	A	0.99989	Our hypothesis that they're more negative past oriented so they're stuck in a very long present moment, but also they're the tendency of ruminating.
2727500	2730560	243	A	0.99998	So always going to past negative memories.
2732920	2750424	244	A	0.95344	Since this is titled Last in Dark Times the Effect of the Personalization Experience in on Time Perspective. And these we are already in the analysis of the data but it's an ongoing field of study.
2750622	2753930	245	A	0.99983	So we have preliminary data on this.
2755340	2769308	246	A	0.75247	While studies too we are in the recruitment phases but we are almost there and encompass the high traits of people individual into high traits of depression, and meditators.
2769484	2780444	247	A	1	I want to see through a set of questionnaires and a behavioral task how they may differ in the sense of self, body and motion.
2780492	2791430	248	A	1	Of course, they are very wide and concepts so there is always room for feedback and replications and so on.
2795240	2815390	249	A	0.99881	We have selected these tasks, the embody tasks adopted from new menma where individual participants has to color parts of the body in relation to activation that they feel by reading certain emotional story.
2816000	2825820	250	A	0.99964	So these stories are supposed to validate it to elicit certain emotions in the body and then people colors parts of the body.
2825890	2832820	251	A	1	And then we will see how people with hydrates and the visualization may say will differ in this.
2832890	2845400	252	A	1	And we will also compare with other questionnaires that we have put this. And potential title is “Emotional Body Maps of Thought Detachment, Interpersonalization and Meditation.”
2845820	2850344	253	A	1	And with this I thank you all and that's it.
2850462	2852708	254	A	0.99927	We are open for discussion.
2852804	2853690	255	A	0.99553	Thank you.
2858480	2859324	256	B	0.98986	Awesome.
2859522	2860444	257	B	0.99995	Thank you very much, Valeria.
2860482	2862904	258	A	0.98083	You are muted,
2862952	2863740	259	A	0.24989	Daniel.
2864400	2864876	260	B	0.99974	Thank you, 
2864898	2865740	261	B	0.62263	Valeria.
2866160	2866910	262	B	0.99834	Great!
2867680	2872720	263	B	0.97673	Well, very fascinating presentation.
2873140	2877212	264	B	0.9974	Perhaps Anna first and then our other colleagues who have joined.
2877276	2885990	265	B	0.98146	Would be awesome to hear your path to be here on this work and any reflection or questions you have on it.
2890020	2891360	266	C	0.79779	Is it my turn?
2891510	2891872	267	B	0.99287	Sure.
2891926	2892720	268	C	0.95009	Did I miss?
2892870	2893570	269	C	0.8168	Yeah.
2895380	2900790	270	C	0.96346	So obviously I don't have many questions because it's like we wrote this together.
2902680	2948604	271	C	0.99695	But I think what I would like just to add not really a question is I really like to see so for instance like in ideal world would be nice to get all the traditions of the meditative experiences and how they relate to the body and make a very precise prediction on what exactly they will kind of predict in terms of certain sensory experiences and how this can be interpreted through different theoretical lenses.
2948652	2972812	272	C	1	I think that could be really interesting because I think one of the problems, the challenges that we have right now is that we have so many concepts, so many approaches and kind of, like, scattered all over the map, and I think would be really nice to narrow down, because, as you said, Daniel so everybody knows what meditation is.
2972946	2983724	273	C	0.99981	Everybody knows at least one person that meditates in life and everything, but it's really unclear what exactly we are after and why.
2983762	2992172	274	C	0.93546	In certain cases, this is kind of like beneficial, and in other cases, basically it has negative consequences.
2992236	2998960	275	C	1	And this is why precisely we are doing this project on depersonalization and meditation.
2999120	3007190	276	C	1	And I can share with you informally, Scoop, but data is here, so we kind of like can share with.
3007560	3015092	277	C	0.99954	So what we did in this project, basically we took people with typical controls that don't have depersonalization and never meditated.
3015156	3015384	278	A	0.99965	Right?
3015422	3018216	279	C	0.99977	So it's kind of like, yeah, never did that.
3018318	3027160	280	C	1	And then we took people that meditated, and then we looked at whether they have kind of like high or low traits of depersonization.
3027240	3031240	281	C	1	And then we took people with depersonization that never meditate.
3031320	3031950	282	C	0.99975	Right.
3034240	3042640	283	C	0.99692	So we have this inclusion and exclusion criteria and yeah, it's really interesting to find what our findings is.
3042710	3053104	284	C	0.99133	It's really difficult to find people that have experience and low depersonalization skills, low depersonization traits.
3053152	3053652	285	A	0.99973	Right.
3053786	3057760	286	C	0.99983	So most of them, they actually have high depersonalization.
3057840	3064264	287	C	0.99999	But then it's interesting to see how that contrasts with the people that have depersonalization and no vegetation experience.
3064382	3065050	288	C	0.83471	Right.
3065900	3073850	289	C	0.99688	So that's something I would like to carry on to reach the community.
3076700	3079016	290	C	0.93447	That's something we'll definitely carry on with.
3079118	3086640	291	C	0.46647	Valerian the next steps and also with some people that I have here in the chat, julia and Simone.
3087220	3090080	292	C	0.98684	So Simone will going to work with us on also.
3090150	3097504	293	C	0.21957	Somatosensory attenuation through different have some without scooping.
3097552	3101190	294	C	0.99996	We have also some very interesting results coming up.
3101720	3105408	295	C	0.99724	We just finished data collection on intentional binding and depersonization.
3105504	3108420	296	C	0.95373	So related to the sense of agency.
3110120	3114104	297	C	0.92183	That's all for me for now.
3114142	3124780	298	C	0.93698	We're kind of like in between because Valerie represented very well, like the theory part and the studies are literally just getting hot from the oven now.
3124850	3130284	299	C	1	And we hope that in September it's like we're going to get them out.
3130402	3135920	300	C	0.60457	Yeah, but the data is in the box, so that's very exciting and yeah, we have the results.
3137860	3140368	301	C	0.99995	Thank you, Danielle, again for this platform.
3140454	3141104	302	C	0.99768	It's really nice.
3141142	3152228	303	C	1	And as I said, I really hope that after this discussion, we'll have more opportunities to change, exchange and discuss.
3152314	3162504	304	C	0.99995	We also plan to organize something around alteration of self consciousness across various conditions and also decarbonization in Lisbon next year.
3162542	3168948	305	C	0.99864	So maybe you can cross the pond and check for yourself that we have a nice airport in Lisbon.
3169044	3169690	306	C	0.93081	Yeah.
3171600	3171964	307	A	0.86633	Cool.
3172002	3175608	308	B	0.98933	Well, good to get the appetizer before the entree.
3175704	3194770	309	B	0.99539	So that's very awesome about just how much theory and even unconventional scientific theory, like world knowledge traditions come into play and then what it looks like to take that experimental step to make it scientific is definitely what I saw in the talk.
3195540	3200630	310	B	0.99676	Julia or Simon, do you want to give any reflection or any thoughts or questions?
3201240	3201990	311	D	0.99952	Yes.
3202520	3203476	312	D	1	Can you hear me?
3203578	3204230	313	B	0.98539	Yes.
3205000	3207990	314	D	0.96	I actually have three questions I noted down.
3209080	3220650	315	D	1	I think the first one because it's just for me personally, I'm curious about that is that those deep meditative selfless states I think that can also be reached while doing yoga, right?
3221260	3223784	316	D	0.98779	Basically the opposite of sitting still.
3223822	3226520	317	D	0.73414	It's like a sort of repetitive movement actually.
3226670	3233192	318	D	0.942	So I'm wondering do those movements have to be perfectly predictable in order to be attenuated and then reaching the same state?
3233246	3240160	319	D	0.99998	Or is that like a different different concept or how do you put that in your framework?
3244500	3251296	320	A	1	I think here you brought mainly two topics.
3251408	3258980	321	A	0.99	One is, is it possible to reach deep matter states also not sitting in a still position?
3259050	3260490	322	A	0.95	And the answer is yes.
3263820	3266216	323	A	0.99999	However, there is not so much research on that.
3266318	3282120	324	A	0.99993	So I can talk about anecdotal knowledge, but I did not read so much about walking meditation effect, usually walking meditation or of course you talk about yoga.
3282200	3291520	325	A	1	I know, but that's what I would say, that walking meditation is used as a complementary practice through the sitting.
3292260	3299140	326	A	0.99986	So I would say it's hard to reach deep meditative states only by walking meditation.
3302200	3306176	327	A	0.99954	In regarding to yoga, also yoga means unity.
3306368	3319480	328	A	0.99946	So what we think about yoga now, we think about movement, but it's always accompanied by reaching state of concentration through meditation.
3320540	3325980	329	A	0.99978	So you cannot have yoga without meditation, otherwise you'll be stretching or pilates.
3326720	3336560	330	A	0.99951	But second topic is that can it happen when you don't have prediction of movement?
3337300	3338096	331	A	0.99952	Right?
3338278	3342096	332	D	0.68099	No, I meant like because in yoga at least I don't really do yoga, right?
3342118	3350096	333	D	0.99999	But I can imagine that when people reach those states doing yoga, then they kind of do it almost like in a trance type of way.
3350118	3354704	334	D	0.99967	They're always doing the same movement over and over and over again so that they don't have to attend to those movements.
3354752	3356532	335	D	0.99682	But it's just like an automatic process.
3356586	3360950	336	D	1	I was wondering if that also can I jump in?
3361880	3364200	337	C	0.9982	Actually, this is precisely the opposite.
3364620	3369156	338	C	0.84497	What Valerie was saying is so Valerie was saying this is precisely the opposite.
3369188	3372360	339	C	0.99985	You want to reach through yoga just like the opposite of automatic.
3372800	3379292	340	C	0.9965	So basically when you do this movements, you need to be united with yourself doing it.
3379346	3394492	341	C	0.99984	So you really need to I'm doing yoga so the past ten years and precisely this is like they're trying to tell us don't do it on automatic.
3394556	3399652	342	C	0.99999	Because it's like when you have your thinking happening there and your body is doing some stuff there, right.
3399786	3403808	343	C	0.99996	You need to basically be presence in every single type of moon.
3403824	3410470	344	C	0.99798	So you have like fully, fully presence if you do it automatically, that's more like gymnastic or something.
3411720	3413152	345	C	0.59659	But it's interesting.
3413306	3433950	346	C	0.98958	So your point is really interesting because then would be really nice to have a control condition where we have people doing like movement, meditation and yoga and then contrast with the phenomena of some other sense retenuation and whether they have what type of embodiment and disembodiment and gentivity experiences they have.
3436960	3440384	347	D	0.99919	Okay, I don't know exactly what I was trying to get it.
3440502	3447888	348	D	0.99993	But I think it was also more related to because you said that when meditating you have to sort of let yourself letting go.
3448054	3448864	349	D	0.99994	Letting go, exactly.
3448902	3452660	350	D	0.57	And the idea is that everything has to be perfectly sort of predictable, right?
3452730	3454148	351	D	0.9779	That's the idea behind it.
3454234	3466356	352	D	0.98492	So then I'm thinking so within yoga, don't you have to do the exact same movements in order for it to be predictable, in order for you to let go and not overatten to the environment?
3466468	3467690	353	D	0.99761	Does that make sense?
3470460	3495984	354	A	0.57	I thought when we both and Simon were speaking I think on one side you, Simon, maybe you're referring to the implicit procedural knowledge that you can acquire through yoga and you, Ana, are talking about doing things without being aware, which is also automatic and left.
3496102	3506004	355	A	0.98	And you both are right, I think in this because on one Anna, you would say like if you do yoga, you learn how to do yoga, right?
3506122	3521256	356	A	0.96853	So you learn how to move yourself in this way so that when you do a certain position that you have to arrange your body and for arrange your dirty, you always have to keep monitoring yourself.
3521358	3529996	357	A	0.99997	So there is a continuous going back to your body, keeping track of your body and continue to monitor yourself.
3530178	3538736	358	A	0.99907	But in this way because you have learned to do this going back and being aware on yourself.
3538838	3551364	359	A	1	And this comes also when you do your movement, you have learned that certain posture are made in a certain way so that it becomes more or less predictable actually what you're going to do.
3551482	3551812	360	A	0.99851	Right.
3551866	3567384	361	A	0.93082	But it doesn't mean that you don't have to be awareness and actually there is a trick ribbon here because you're very attentive with what's going on but at the same time the more you're attentive, the more somatosensory attenuation may happen.
3567502	3572510	362	A	1	And actually it's what we are trying to argue in our active inference model.
3573600	3579660	363	A	1	The more predictable it gets, the more it gets attenuated, but doesn't mean that you're not aware.
3582640	3586828	364	A	0.99995	Thank you for this input because it helps us elaborate this.
3586914	3594240	365	D	1	I think it's super interesting because it's like when you look at people that climb or surf or whatever, any type of sports, right?
3594310	3602004	366	D	0.99989	In the beginning, in order to learn the skill, you have to put a lot of attention to the individual movements but then later on, in order to actually be good at it, you have to take the attention away.
3602122	3612024	367	D	1	And then in those moments is when the people report that they're actually feeling sort of selfless states and these flow is when the movements are internalized, so to speak.
3612142	3613944	368	D	1	I think that's super interesting.
3614142	3616024	369	D	0.98474	Can I just shoot the other two questions I had?
3616062	3619544	370	D	0.73488	They're sort of different or should we go to Julia first?
3619742	3621160	371	A	0.98721	Maybe it's Julia.
3624460	3625384	372	E	0.8442	Hi, sorry.
3625502	3630190	373	E	0.7016	Yeah, sorry for the lighting and sorry because I'm in the lab, so it's probably not the best position.
3630640	3631116	374	C	0.99913	Thank you.
3631138	3639584	375	E	0.19639	Varia it was very interesting and I'm really looking forward to look at the results you have in your study.
3639782	3650130	376	E	0.97561	Especially since as Anna mentioned, we had something interesting with the international binding and depersonalization and yeah, kind of happy about that.
3651080	3655044	377	E	0.98031	I'm really sorry because I listened kind of doing something else.
3655082	3658420	378	E	0.92085	Unfortunately in the lab I was busy while you were talking.
3658570	3660310	379	E	0.9986	But I kind of like this idea.
3661240	3661700	380	A	0.66513	Yeah.
3661770	3667892	381	E	0.50575	Does the self is attenuated or not or increasing and kind of goes back to just Simon.
3667956	3670920	382	E	1	The last comment from Simon about expertise.
3672460	3678936	383	E	1	I think in term of motor interaction there is some literal jobability expert.
3678968	3687440	384	E	1	I was trying to Google that, but I attended a workshop last year, and I think it was about once you're an expert.
3688900	3700790	385	E	1	At the beginning, you have this kind of flexible you have a better understanding consciousness, and then at the end, you kind of learn to let it go, to ride the flow of the motion, kind of.
3701880	3703572	386	E	0.98	And I think it's probably the same.
3703626	3714890	387	E	1	I don't know about attention in meditation is that you have to maybe more like not focus attentional state but more like open.
3716220	3719252	388	E	0.99996	Sorry, I forgot the name of the meditation type of meditation.
3719316	3721668	389	A	0.9997	But open meditation, open monitoring.
3721844	3722810	390	A	0.99677	Yeah, exactly.
3723340	3724328	391	E	0.95	I don't know.
3724494	3733212	392	E	0.99708	So it would be interesting and I suggested to see what type of meditation maybe changed the sense of the self.
3733266	3738080	393	E	0.99998	Maybe at the beginning it's more acute because you really scrutinize your sensation.
3739380	3740320	394	E	0.93	I don't know.
3740470	3742610	395	E	0.99867	This is something that you plan to do, right?
3745300	3763560	396	A	0.99961	Should I go or do you want to go on the the first question was there is a body of evidence that actually say that in expert meditators tension start decreasing.
3764620	3769700	397	A	0.99993	But there is also because you allocate less and less attention.
3769860	3781260	398	A	0.99501	But I would be careful with that with this because they say there is decreased activity in anterior singleet cortex.
3782560	3789890	399	A	0.62042	So they make inference about it as meditators as well.
3790500	3807920	400	A	0.97	And having to know other people that are more experienced than me, they would never say we lose our attention to that because our experience is so rich of sensory signals and related thought process that you cannot afford to not be attentive.
3808080	3811956	401	A	0.57521	However, we can bring into the plate different kinds of attention.
3812068	3821048	402	A	0.99999	As you said, there is focused attention or there's an attention that requires more explicit thought about it.
3821134	3828616	403	A	0.75948	So more explicit kind of way to focus on things and there is more like a bare attention.
3828728	3844284	404	A	0.99996	So when you focus on the whole experience and you let it go with a non judgmental attitude and more open attitude and it's actually these attitudes, they're very stressed in meditation techniques, that's why they're a bit underlooked.
3844332	3853552	405	A	0.86	And in research I feel because it's a lot about how we use attention but not the attention but not how we use intention.
3853696	3870650	406	A	0.99425	So the attitude of the meditator has to be very open and very non judgmental and these reduce the nonreactive senses for example and reduce the ability to self regulate your experience.
3873280	3874860	407	A	0.95636	Partially answered.
3876160	3900876	408	E	0.85451	Yeah, I kind of like the idea that you link that with attention and just I think maybe it would be interesting to look at different type of attention because maybe there is a difference between I don't know, different type of meditation may develop different type of maybe the open meditation is more prone.
3900908	3907152	409	E	1	I don't know because you mentioned the insula cortex and to me it's more associated with certain type of attention.
3907216	3916616	410	E	0.94418	Like more like maybe more prone for feedback or negativity or these kind of error monitoring process.
3916798	3919092	411	E	0.96688	So it's not like your attention, you lose your attention.
3919156	3926044	412	E	0.50328	It's just it's more like in the background and then when there is a mistake or something it kind of pops up more quickly.
3926162	3926876	413	E	1	I don't know.
3926978	3932312	414	E	1	And you may have more frontal or sustain attention.
3932376	3932716	415	E	1	I don't know.
3932738	3934824	416	E	0.9	I mean I'm not a specialist of attention at all.
3934882	3937440	417	E	0.9994	So please take that with a grain of salt.
3937940	3938304	418	A	0.98915	Yeah.
3938342	3948924	419	E	0.79	I was wondering if this is something, I don't know obviously because you're not planning to do any EEG or neurophysiological measurement.
3948972	3949570	420	A	0.9988	Right.
3950340	3954148	421	E	0.97598	So this is maybe like a follow up study that would be interesting.
3954314	3959180	422	C	0.99052	Not yet, but in the pipeline.
3959280	3959688	423	C	0.7884	Yeah.
3959774	3960264	424	C	0.61804	Okay.
3960382	3975176	425	C	0.99399	What we really want with Valeria is and other collaborators is to basically push against this idea that you can have selfless experiences.
3975288	3980220	426	C	1	I know it's controversial and many people talk about oh, selfless experience blah.
3981760	3991808	427	C	0.88212	So basically we want to say radically speaking okay, so that works if you bite the bullet and you're mind body dualist and somehow consider that actually the body kind of like disappears in the process.
3991894	4019956	428	C	0.99999	But if you're not mind body dualist then you need to basically put the body into equation and realize that actually what allows the mind to disappear is the fact into the pureness of the experience is the fact that the impure body is kind of like put in a stable condition in such a way that basically you can afford to leave it in the background and to have this type of experience arising.
4020068	4027848	429	C	1	But without that in place you can't really afford to go through this selfless experiences.
4027944	4049940	430	C	1	And this is why we want to be provocative in the titles that well actually maybe the experience of selfless experiences actually comes necessarily as two sign of the same coin of this experience of having an unlimited body that actually expands through the world.
4050010	4051044	431	C	0.84535	But the body is there.
4051082	4068504	432	C	0.99	I mean the thing, the entity that has the experience of no experience is that a body that kind of is self regulated in a certain way like the homeostasis is put at like a set point.
4068622	4081356	433	C	1	And when you're using this metaphor of think of a cyclone, right, moving cyclone so you have the steel eye of the cyclone in the middle doesn't mean that actually it's not there.
4081458	4084440	434	C	0.9804	It's just like it's around everything.
4084610	4088320	435	C	1	And because we are self organizing biological systems.
4091220	4095280	436	C	0.92759	This animal, this thing needs to keep track of this internal bodily states.
4095350	4100390	437	C	0.93	And a successful system does this all the time.
4100920	4107364	438	C	0.99999	All the time, literally from second one, when we basically get from one cell to the self.
4107402	4115424	439	C	0.68746	So this is some sort of fascinating self organization that is happening on the cellular level already and it needs to be.
4115562	4117752	440	C	0.95	And death is basically this is what is happening.
4117806	4122600	441	C	0.7743	It's like disintegration of this self organization.
4123200	4127132	442	C	0.99999	But clearly that's not what is happening on meditation, right?
4127186	4130104	443	C	0.99998	Because hopefully you don't die when you meditate.
4130232	4131324	444	C	1	In that sense.
4131442	4142060	445	C	0.99998	There is disintegration of a certain way to experience yourself in relation to the body in the world, but clearly there's something that stays there and needs to stay there for you to have those experiences.
4142140	4146012	446	C	0.53923	So that's a bit of controversial, radical claim that we like to defend.
4146076	4150390	447	C	0.98	And yeah, we already had this discussion with several people.
4150760	4158704	448	C	0.99874	For instance, like Valerie and I, we went to Enlightenment, this workshop on phrenology neurocompetition.
4158752	4163472	449	C	0.6116	We met there with people like Thomas Betziger and everything and obviously they have a different opinion.
4163536	4182750	450	C	0.9953	So we kind of, like, have a lively discussion about why we think it's like, what does it mean to actually lose yourself and what is the self and what is a pure experience and why we basically need whether we're like it or not, the connection with the impure body to make sure that you can have, at a certain point, a pure experience.
4183600	4187024	451	C	1	But then again, this is something that just speculation at the theory level.
4187062	4200790	452	C	0.67	And this is why I have this brilliant team here that we can do some studies and actually measure stuff, put the finger on it, put the number and see what we get.
4203160	4207380	453	B	0.99981	These are awesome points and there's so many ways it could go.
4207450	4210740	454	B	0.91249	I'll read a question from the live chat.
4210900	4223688	455	B	0.9865	So G Pagnani wrote, the notion of increased Somatosensory transparency in experienced meditators associated with increased liveliness of the experience is intriguing.
4223864	4236892	456	B	1	Can you say something about which levels in the hierarchical structure of the internal model are more likely to be affected by the meditative attentional task in terms of precision deployment?
4237036	4248260	457	B	0.99991	Do you think the attenuation of Somatosensory prediction error concerns more intermediate levels in a way increase meta awareness rather than sheer sensory attention?
4250520	4251924	458	C	0.95	I can take this one.
4252042	4257796	459	C	0.77964	So I can give a fuzz go and then you can go.
4257978	4260680	460	A	0.67126	No, I just wanted to ask rather than ensuring.
4263100	4266040	461	B	0.99968	Rather than sheer sensory attention.
4267580	4269290	462	A	0.99892	Yeah, you can go on now, please.
4272320	4287344	463	C	0.94543	Yeah, so this is something I'm trying to develop this idea right now with a PhD student of mine, Libetise, basically.
4287542	4297936	464	C	1	And this is why it's connected with the question that you ask, you'll see, is that your platform is active inference, right?
4297958	4309444	465	C	0.85	And so people kind of know lately kind of realize, wait a minute, actually we are active and we need to explain action in the world and everything kind of like comes late, right?
4309482	4317252	466	C	0.99966	But if you look going back to the animal, basically the action and the movement is there from the very beginning.
4317316	4328940	467	C	0.99993	So this means that this is why it's so important to basically relate the self organization, self awareness, self perception necessarily related with movement.
4329680	4334732	468	C	0.96525	So movement an action is not something that you add on the top of this, right?
4334786	4337064	469	C	0.75786	Like some of intention.
4337192	4342352	470	C	0.82955	So you can have an intention, but basically the first movements are kind of like automatic and need to be there, right?
4342406	4348564	471	C	1	And basically our body moves all the time because we breathe all the time and our heart beats all the time.
4348682	4356372	472	C	0.99997	So this means that for me, this type of attenuation is happening at the sensory level because that's the basic one.
4356426	4359832	473	C	0.99999	So can you have sensory stuff without metacognitive stuff?
4359886	4360344	474	C	0.9999	Yes.
4360462	4362872	475	C	0.83333	Can you have metacognitive stuff without sensory stuff?
4362926	4363288	476	E	0.99996	No.
4363374	4383564	477	C	0.69657	So it's like what is basic that's the first things needs to be attenuated and then there has to be a balance between metacognitive and sensory attenuation because this is precisely what I think it is happening in Depersonalization because if you focus too much, right?
4383602	4398770	478	C	0.97143	So you lose the balance between then it's kind of like this type of you cannot afford to self forget yourself.
4399300	4405350	479	C	0.53	And then it's kind of like the self stands in the way and that gets you even more disconnected, so to speak.
4406520	4429676	480	C	0.99985	So this is why I think it's important to contrast different type of meditative experiences and meditative practices to see which one of them actually has more focus on what you do with metacognitive, metawareness awareness of awareness and which one are actually involving more like sensory movement, for instance, let's say.
4429698	4433496	481	C	0.95389	Yeah, so that's something that needs to be empirically tested.
4433528	4447120	482	C	0.99998	But I would speculate and then obviously we can put it at test, either by doing a simulation or actually collecting data to see how that plays into this distinction.
4451840	4455324	483	C	1	I think Simon wants to say something, but I'm not the moderator.
4455372	4456800	484	C	0.99419	So Daniel, you decide.
4457540	4457856	485	D	0.98538	Yeah.
4457878	4459090	486	B	0.61777	Valeria first.
4463140	4464480	487	A	0.78499	Thank you, Anna.
4466840	4470100	488	A	1	I don't have so much more to say because I agree with her.
4470170	4488408	489	A	0.94243	But I thought when Daniel you were reading the question for me the answer was more or less clear in the sense that as I say, the Somatosens continuation happens the very low level predictions.
4488584	4517168	490	A	0.85432	So in a very pre reflective self consciousness, so that the person was asking in the meditation techniques, when you put the attention on, for example, your bodily signals there, you have a top down modulation of this, of precision wasting, but the top down modulation is on low level predictions.
4517344	4523024	491	A	0.99996	So you're not putting top down on what you think about your body is you're actually doing the opposite.
4523072	4535050	492	A	0.87183	You're trying to forget about your previous expectations about the body because you're trying to have this non judgmental awareness about what's going on in your experience.
4535680	4545180	493	A	0.69	And then with this, let's say, less biased way to attend your body.
4545330	4556956	494	A	0.99982	You start piercing and perceiving bodily sensations in your body or other kind of experiences.
4557068	4574020	495	A	0.99949	So I would say this increasing precision on somatosensory signals happens at the low level of the Yerarchy that then attenuates the sensory consequences of the posterior.
4575960	4587300	496	A	1	And the meta awareness comes when you learn, I think, when you start having increased body awareness.
4587460	4589356	497	A	0.99948	So you make more experience.
4589458	4602448	498	A	1	I think then you start developing meta awareness about how your body is actually about higher representation of the body of your body.
4602534	4609308	499	A	0.99881	But in the moment when this happens, I think it really happens at the low level, subpersonal beliefs.
4609404	4622740	500	A	1	And then later on, on the longer time scales, then it starts becoming more abstract and ingrained at the personal level of your beliefs.
4623480	4624768	501	A	0.97135	That's how I say it.
4624794	4631576	502	A	0.91333	But of course, if Simon has something to do with it, it's really I.
4631598	4632660	503	D	0.87167	Didn'T I didn't want to comment.
4632740	4634408	504	D	0.97	I just selfishly raised my hand to.
4634414	4639196	505	A	0.99984	Ask another question or Daniel, I don't know if you have an opinion on that.
4639218	4640910	506	A	0.97812	I'm happy to hear it as well.
4642480	4666950	507	B	0.94543	Well, certainly resonated with this comparative approach to studying the diversity of methods and protocols we already have for mind and body and attention, broadening the scope and just kind of putting darts in the space of what practices do people engage their mind and body in?
4667320	4674608	508	B	1	And then, how can that territory be explored with also a variety of theoretical models?
4674784	4683400	509	B	0.99	And how does that relationship connect to the kinds of empirical work that we might do in a brain scanner or with other kinds of measuring?
4684300	4705356	510	B	1	And I think one thing I want to explore more is in a hierarchical nested cognitive model, which we often speak of ourselves and other types of sophisticated entities as where's our awareness?
4705468	4708240	511	B	0.70344	Where's awareness in that picture?
4712520	4725972	512	B	0.94	And also to Simone's question about when we're moving, but we're expecting what we're moving, then how does the exteriorceptive flow?
4726116	4727400	513	B	0.99992	Like the visual field?
4727470	4743084	514	B	0.99999	You might be very familiar with walking, and so you might be able to proprioceptively kind of zero out on your walking, but there's this exteriorceptive flow of novelty in the world.
4743282	4754080	515	B	0.50673	So I think that how and then connect it back to the comparative and staring at a candle or a blank screen or darkness and all these different methods.
4758500	4762676	516	B	0.99888	There's a lot that these questions bring up.
4762858	4763636	517	A	0.55795	Yeah.
4763818	4764736	518	C	0.99949	Thank you, Daniel.
4764768	4775936	519	C	0.96981	So I have something to add to that because I think it's super know, my background is like, embodied cognition and activists and everything.
4775978	4785204	520	C	0.96	And for me, it's really not at all surprising the fact that many of these techniques have been developed by people that kind of, like, lived in closed communities.
4785332	4785768	521	C	0.5304	Right.
4785854	4793048	522	C	0.69723	So it's like you have a space where people can meditate walking.
4793144	4793772	523	C	0.89	I don't know.
4793826	4795144	524	C	1	And then they have this ritual.
4795192	4797630	525	C	0.75446	They wake up at this time and they do this thing.
4798080	4800732	526	C	0.99954	So you put yourself in yeah, it's a ritual.
4800796	4801024	527	C	0.99735	Right.
4801062	4803212	528	C	0.6341	Like all the rituals.
4803276	4806204	529	C	0.82079	So this means, as I said, it's like high predictability.
4806332	4807010	530	C	0.98764	Right.
4808340	4811460	531	C	1	And then that's something super important.
4811610	4818260	532	C	0.66	And even in the Wokie meditation, you need to follow a certain path.
4819880	4820292	533	C	0.52177	Yes.
4820346	4822470	534	C	0.83486	So that's super interesting.
4826220	4842190	535	B	0.9739	Well, in the last five or ten minutes, I would love to hear from each of you, like, what are your directions heading forward and what's exciting to you and where would you like to take this?
4844240	4849470	536	B	0.9887	Maybe Simone and Julia first, and then we'll kind of make our way back to the.
4853700	4856128	537	D	0.92954	Not myself, not working on the project.
4856214	4856704	538	D	0.97402	Right.
4856822	4878152	539	D	0.58353	But what I was really interested in sort of extending this is trying to understand because the way those deep meditative states are reported sometimes and the way people with depersonalization disorder report their experience is very similar.
4878286	4880808	540	D	0.99919	They almost use, like, the same words right.
4880974	4882760	541	D	0.98	And to describe how they feel.
4882830	4892140	542	D	1	And I wonder why one is experienced positively and one is experienced so negatively, as in it being a disorder and in completely disrupting someone's life.
4892290	4897230	543	D	0.97932	So that was like this comparison I think I'll be very curious about.
4901100	4901704	544	B	0.95892	Awesome.
4901822	4904670	545	B	0.9898	Julia, if you want to add anything.
4907440	4909390	546	E	0.96268	Well, it's very interesting.
4910960	4928224	547	E	0.71378	Again, I'm not so involved in this study, so it's a bit hard, but I'm really interested in all the self is affected by our interaction with the world, external world, and I'm completely already spoiled with the result we have with the international binding.
4928272	4940872	548	E	0.79103	So it's very if the self is attenuated or if it's disappeared, kind of I think that's the key question we want to answer.
4941006	4951784	549	E	0.96	And yeah, I would be very curious to mean what Valeria found in data to see if we can have a common narrative about what's happening.
4951982	4953720	550	E	0.99977	Also with the personalization.
4955120	4955532	551	A	0.96764	Yeah.
4955586	4965570	552	E	0.9942	It's very interesting to see how moving of body, attention to the body can really change the self, kind of or the way we process self information.
4966900	4967456	553	E	0.9558	Yeah.
4967558	4968770	554	E	0.94157	So very interesting.
4971140	4971696	555	A	0.99869	Cool.
4971798	4972640	556	B	0.89356	Anna.
4975320	4975732	557	C	0.99849	Yes.
4975786	4981590	558	C	0.9657	So it's like lots of work to do ahead, but that's exciting, right?
4982680	4983092	559	C	0.99752	Yeah.
4983146	4989670	560	C	0.99965	So, very short term, it's like we need to write up this result that we just got.
4990200	4991136	561	C	0.613	So yeah.
4991178	4992232	562	C	0.83852	In relation to the body.
4992286	4994440	563	C	0.99999	So basically, we're going to have some numbers to show.
4994510	4996090	564	C	0.99988	So that's super nice.
4996780	5028764	565	C	0.64	And then the next steps would be to create or develop computational model around this, basically contrast the real world data with, you know, simulation data and then have a multilayered type of approach with different methods, from physiological to behavioral to phenomenological to computational, potentially also neural.
5028812	5032660	566	C	0.99999	So that's something would be nice to do in the next steps.
5035720	5044280	567	C	0.26	And apart from that, I think that's all for now, and I'll leave the floor to Valeria.
5045740	5050010	568	A	0.99749	Well, again, thank you, Dan and everybody.
5050640	5051436	569	A	0.92051	Yeah.
5051618	5055144	570	A	1	I also want to thank you a lot for this platform, this invitation.
5055192	5056940	571	A	0.97211	It was really nice.
5057090	5060060	572	A	0.39442	Really nice person and really nice conversation.
5062000	5067404	573	A	0.99922	I'm working with Anne Andy's project, so she already said, what's the next direction?
5067532	5067776	574	A	0.9997	What.
5067798	5086708	575	A	1	I can add in this I think would be on the theoretical side also start engaging with more closely to bodily reactions to meditation because the body boundaries dissolution is just one part of it.
5086794	5091320	576	A	0.89665	It's like one part of the phenomenology but it's not the only thing that happens during meditation.
5092220	5122610	577	A	0.99999	There is a lot of potential that can be discovered on this because the body boundary solution again, it's really study a lot, but it's a phenomenon and there is so many other things that happens in our body while we meditate and I speak for first person experience, but in the community it's really like already said, other kinds of also more healing traditions like breath work, for example.
5123460	5127380	578	A	0.99959	There there is a lot of potential where people already work on that.
5127530	5131728	579	A	0.99999	But there is no bridge with the academic communities.
5131824	5148328	580	A	0.99998	So people work pragmatically with this intuitive knowledge about what happens in the body during these altered states of consciousness but still we need to bridge it with trying to make sense from a phonological and scientific point of view and experimental point of view as well.
5148414	5162110	581	A	0.91178	So I think I see myself in trying to step in this toward and bring insight from one world to the other and hoping to help myself and the other people around me.
5164260	5165008	582	B	0.99931	Awesome.
5165174	5167984	583	B	0.99917	Well, best of luck with the work.
5168022	5169356	584	B	0.87041	That sounds really exciting.
5169468	5188250	585	B	0.99993	Love the idea of the two way street with different bodily and cognitive practices and collaboration and conversation that can bring in all these different expertises that maybe don't have an fMRI study already, whatever that's worth.
5188780	5190440	586	B	0.99993	Thank you though, always.
5190590	5195530	587	B	0.99969	Any of you are welcome back and really appreciate that you all came out.
5196540	5197016	588	C	0.99983	Thank you.
5197038	5198456	589	B	0.31598	Daniel, thank you.
5198478	5198870	590	B	0.68267	See you soon.
