7280	40420	2	B	0.99981	00:07	70	Hello and welcome. It's July 27, 2023, and we're here in Acton, guest stream, number 15.1 with Valeria Beckhatini and Anna C unica. This is going to be a very interesting and cool presentation and discussion on selfless minds, unlimited bodies, homeostatic, bodily self regulation and meditative experiences. There will be a presentation followed by a discussion. So thank you both for joining and to you Valeria, for the presentation.
41740	71040	3	A	0.97479	00:41	54	Thank you Diana, very much. I'm very happy to be here with Anna. Presenting pathavara wider project. This is a paper about what happened in selfless state from a Homo Sapie bodily self regulation perspective. So it's as I said, it's part of a wider project that consists in both theoretical and experimental components.
74260	121744	4	A	0.82426	01:14	92	Today we're going to look at meditation. So for people that are not really familiar with that, meditation is a practice that engaged attention to self regulate physiological and cognitive activity. What we're interested here is that people that meditate with a certain experience, so for example, meditating in the past two years with regularly, like some hours per week, they consistently report losing one sense of the self or having selfless experiences. But not only that, they also report to have bodily alterations. So alterations in the procession of the body.
121782	160476	5	A	0.86067	02:01	85	That has been called expansion, oceanic boundlessness, dissolution of body boundaries. And since you are particularly interested in this kind of phenomenal experience, we have proposed to frame them unlimited body, just for clarity. So our question here is what exactly? And the question that will follow the whole presentation in the background is what exactly is lost when experienced meditators report losing their self and the body? So let's first look very briefly at what the self is, or the sense of self is.
160658	199320	6	A	0.99909	02:40	77	So this concept is so complex and so wide that has been debated since the beginning of philosophy. And of course, it might be so intuitive that it's also very hard to define. But one very old and used definition is the unitary or unique individual eye. The first person perspective, that Latin was called the subjectin. So something that lay under all our stream of experience, thoughts and whatever else happens to us, that's the subject.
200300	266190	7	A	0.99998	03:20	135	However, more recently in cognitive science, we are appealing to a more common definition of sense of self, a bit more exhaustive, that is defined as a multidimensional construct. And here we will come back on this concept later and we'll unpack it a bit more. So the aim of this presentation will be to first of all, lay down the fact that in self experiences, the biological organism, so to speak, the human body remains successfully repregulated. And this might be very intuitive but it needs us then to see that during selfless experiences what we propose is that they may be tacitly accompanied or implicitly underlined by enhanced connectedness with this successful self regulation that we propose to link it with a perceptually attenuated body or what has been already called transparent body.
268500	354148	8	A	1.0	04:28	162	And this allows us to propose but it's of course on a working process and we are very open to feedback at any stage of this presentation that the term selfless states may be misleading because what is lost is an ordinary way to mentally model the self relation to the body and the world. So our roadmap is composed as follows first I will passing through debates and definitions of losing oneself and body. So that means I will go through alterations in these three dimension during massive state and then I will introduce Keen concept of predictive process in the active infrastructure framework that are useful in our explanation. So that then I can unpack the role of the biological self organization and homostatic self regulation in constituting our sense of self. And then pass to our more claim that the processes like somatosensory, attenuation and transparent self modeling are a key mechanism underlying the phenomenology of deep mathematical states.
354334	360380	9	A	1.0	05:54	15	And this then will allow us to draw our conclusions and present ongoing related projects.
363280	430420	10	A	0.9999	06:03	137	So let's come back to the sense of self. So when one has to investigate the sense of self, of course, as I said it's so wide concept that so many definitions and characterization of the sense of self has come up in philosophy and cognitive science. So we have terms like minimal self experience, selfhood sense of ownership and all of this. And for other part I think we have just to stick to a common definition that comes for example from a similar paper from Gallagher 2000 that defines as a multidimensional construct composed by minimal or embodied components and narrative or reflective components. So to unpack a little bit these two concepts the minimal or embodied experience of the sense of self is the basic implicit functioning of the body of the ongoing moment.
430490	481440	11	A	0.99999	07:10	89	So the stream of experience that happens to me right now can be defined as my minimal sense of self. So I don't really need to have an explicit knowledge about myself to have this kind of dimension. And these can be further unpacked through the concept of prereflective self consciousness that comes from a phenomenological tradition. Tracing back from peak argue that parts of our self conscious does not need any reflection to happen there or explicit thought. It happens in a way tambourian is consistently before reflection.
481600	516430	12	A	1.0	08:01	73	And then on top of this we build our narrative or our reflections about ourself. And this is more linked to self identification processes or self monitoring, self recognition and introspection. Introspection, it's the ability of introspection. So perceive yourself or reflect about yourself in an explicit way. So you do need to have that biography or an explicit memory about yourself in order to tackle this aspect of the sense of self.
517780	569904	13	A	0.99909	08:37	99	So in deep meditative states there is alterations in the sense of self and it's up to debate which dimension are affected by that. And it's far from clear what actually happens to this kind of dimension and more and many more other dimensional sense of self. And we are here to unpack a little bit this. We proposed these quotations from Fashion 2008 where it suggested that enduring deep massive states one experiences oneself as these very moments of consciousness. This is quotation that may reveal some position about the debate what happens to the sense of self.
570022	603364	14	A	0.99996	09:30	64	So in this case it's argued that meditation reveal a very moment of consciousness. So there is something that is true consciousness or something that is the real consciousness. And this actually has broke through the concept of pure consciousness. So something that stayed there and it's purified by everything, by also the body. And there is so many definition of this pure consciousness.
603412	640340	15	A	0.99997	10:03	75	We brought some example like ownerless consciousness, the consciousness that doesn't have an owner, that doesn't have a self. So it doesn't have a proper sense of self that walked or that owns this consciousness. Mastinger has worked on the minimal phenomenal experience defining aspecial a temporal dimensional consciousness. And this is very supportive because it's consistent with the Buddhist philosophical stance of no self. So for most tradition of Buddhism, there is no self.
640410	671440	16	A	0.99	10:40	72	The self, it's an illusion. And it comes to our psychology when we enter in contact with the world and with the sensations of the world and certain patterns of behavior that elicit the sense that we have a self. So, as I said, meditation allows us to access this pure consciousness for supporters of this thesis and rebuilds one choose an essential nature of subjective and we bring this into debate.
673460	739300	17	A	0.9997	11:13	133	There are also people that argue against this and it has been called by Matthew in their special issues, the Ubitiquity thesis. So the UBIT thesis claim that essential self is ubiquitous to all states of consciousness and sometimes it appeals to the immunity to error through misidentification argument of self ascription reports, which is simpler than this long name. And it's basically the fact that I can say that I had a wonderful experience and this wonderful experience may be true or false on this weekend. I can do mistakes, I can make mistakes, but I cannot not say that I didn't have these wonderful experiences because the moment in which I report I have a perspective on this. So I cannot really be mistaking on the fact that I'm reporting this.
739370	766728	18	A	0.51246	12:19	65	Maybe I was dreaming, maybe it wasn't a wonderful experience, but it's me that I'm reporting. So the moment I'm reporting this, it means that I have to be there. And this applies also to when I ascribe myself selfless state, I had a selfless state. This is very controversial. Other problems on top of that are cross cultural problems also addressed in the literature.
766904	824290	19	A	0.99992	12:46	106	So this experience selfless states may be influenced by certain vows or certain beliefs that meditator endorse, especially during especially expert meditators. And the other thing is these all cross cultural analysis and debate about the self may be also partially due to a verbal misunderstanding. So that the western philosophy may have problems about the self that actually the Eastern probably philosophy is not really addressing. So there might be some incommensurability of problems there. But as also we said in the paper, it's not that we want to address the Buddhist philosophical problems, rather we want to bring insight from these to our problems.
825940	846630	20	A	0.94529	13:45	57	So, given this debate, we want to propose a shift in the focus. So we don't want to start by looking at consciousness and trying to solve things about the self, but we want to start by focusing on the body. So we proposed a shift in focus in the bodily experience, examining this deep mercy state.
848940	877168	21	A	0.99965	14:08	71	So let's start by the subjective experience of the body or the study of the subjective experience of the body, which is phenomenology. In the tradition, our body has a unique status. So the anatomical structure of the body has been called by USA Kobe. So the living body, the body that I can observe and others can be observed. So it's the object among the other object, they would say.
877334	908876	22	A	0.99846	14:37	80	But it's not only that because it's an object that I can live from inside. So it has been called the light, the lived body or the body as I leave it from inside, as I said. So what happens to these kind of dimension? Again, we can unpack this and see how the meditative states affect them. So from the point of view of the life believed body, we already know, and I will unpack a little bit more.
908978	939072	23	A	0.99954	15:08	66	So we have already said that we have called unlinuated body experiences the reports that spoke about this fading of the body boundaries. So the body boundary has been defined as a cognitive emotional perception of one's body surface. That's just a definition. We can also debate about this. But what it's important about for us that our sense of body boundaries is flexible and dynamic.
939136	1001528	24	A	0.99989	15:39	129	It's not fixed because we are in the realm of the body as felt from inside. There is an interesting study that exemplified this concept in relation to meditation by Jumpren in 2016, though it has worked late further on on this as well. But I find it interesting to look at this image because this is part of a self report measurement that they used on a sample of people that had been trained in meditation, in particular with body scanning. So that people had to systematically scan sensation running the body. And the result is that in less than four months of practice, so not actually not the expert, they really started to report an increased tendency to go towards the almost imperceptible perception of the body.
1001694	1042740	25	A	0.99995	16:41	74	So they conclude that meditation can be actually studied in this sense where it affects our sense of body boundaries. And they saw significant results also in relation to increased mood, happiness and decreased anxiety and rumination. But this is just another story that will come back later. So I find interesting also this quotation by Fink here in this paper it's talking about why ego dissolution may be better understood as ego expansion.
1044920	1088724	26	A	1.0	17:24	93	And then ego dissolution comes in a later interpretation. And so I will read it. It's not the feeling of self that dissolves, but the boundary between a feeling of self and the feeling of anything else in consciousness. So here again Pink is talking about consciousness but from our perspective this quotation is pretty informing because it goes in our direction as well because he says it's not that you're losing really yourself. This experience is dependent on how you actually perceive your boundary with you and what you don't consider you.
1088762	1094120	27	A	0.99956	18:08	9	So self fading of the self other distinction ability.
1096380	1153080	28	A	0.99962	18:16	94	So here it comes predictive processing acting framework because we want to basically breach this phenomenal subjective experience to cognitive phenomena and underlying mechanistic explanation. Indeed, predictive processing activities have recently used for this purpose. Also meditation research and psychopathology research and so on. So in this presentation I will use them in an interchangeable way but following certain trends. But it doesn't have to be, it's also under debate and I will also give API purely I don't know how to say theoretical perspective on that I will not go too much technical.
1154620	1249124	29	A	0.98638	19:14	158	So briefly, this framework considers brains as predictive machine or as Friesen likes to say, consider brain as a fantastic organ which is because it's not only able to do amazing things, but also because it really generates fantasies about the world. And this is because in order to act, interact with itself and the world around, the brain constantly anticipate the current state of affairs in order to make sense of the sensorium or the stream of experiences that happens. So it possess or embody or utilizes, it depends on the commitment a generative model which is a model that keep tracks of regularity of the world and forms predictions out of it in a hierarchical way. So highly rated prediction goes down to match sensory data and sensory data goes up to map to affect the predictions, to update the model. However, every prediction comes with a degree of error which sometimes is called prediction errors.
1249252	1365180	30	A	0.99926	20:49	212	So the prediction error is a discrepancy between prediction and sensory input so that a new model is generated and they say the first imperative or the only imperative of the system is actually minimizing the prediction errors so that the model can most efficiently cope and interact and act in the world. However, it's not the only imperative because as I will introduce in this slide, the system has also to estimate the confidence or likelihood or precision of prediction in order to evaluate the prediction errors that are coming from the discrepancy. So that the generative model has to compute in a fine way how much precision to assign to the prediction or prediction errors and I choose this image because it renders well how the distribution are set depending on the precision citation. So if you have a precise prediction error then the posterior distribution will be closer to the prediction error. Well, the imprecise prediction error have little effect on the prior, so does the posture distribution will be closer to the prior and this is very important because if the precision estimator are not weighted correctly then the system generates false inference that will not able to the system to interact efficiently and update the model efficiently.
1366400	1412300	31	A	0.98949	22:46	82	So, so far we have mostly talked about prediction error minimization by updating the model. However, the system can also active sample the world active modify the prediction error or the world in order to fit the prediction errors to the world. And this comes into play active inference that builds upon the free energy principle where it's based on the idea that living organisms maintain themselves with an optimal set of states that comes from the second low thermodynamics of schrodinger.
1414800	1515390	32	A	0.99163	23:34	171	So given that it comes into play how attention is analyzed or examined under this framework. So given that that the organism has to maintain within these optimal assessor states by maintaining an optimal balance between computation and precision optimization so wasting between prediction and prediction errors, attention comes into place as a modulation of this precision of sensory data working as a search light. So in other words, it optimizes signal to noise ratio. It's one of the way that we have to put in place this local optimization of precision estimates and this is very important why we bring into attention because meditation has a systematic and use of attention resources and we will come back into that a bit further on in this presentation. And given that we are interested in okay, we have seen the lived body, what happens to the phenomenal experience now we're interested in what happens to the corporate, what happens to believing body that can be observed by the organism during medicine states.
1516480	1576556	33	A	0.68477	25:16	113	In this we bring into play other two important concepts in active inference which is way to self regulate that underlie all embassy experience, so all subjective experience, so two ways or one way that then is also active. So the first way is homeostasis which is the maintenance of required optimal state by survival and reproduction of self organizing biological systems. So for example, I cold and I use my internal resources to keep my states into optimal state so I start shivering. However, I can also put in place active modification in the world so that I'm not cold anymore. So for example, I take a blank, this is called allostasis.
1576588	1612750	34	A	0.61102	26:16	73	So it's active engagements and modification about the environment in order to maintain myself in optimal state for survival. So we can say of course, human bodies are self organizing biological system aiming at keeping these internal states within a certain viable range for survival. Now, given that we will come back again to the phenomenology of touch. I'm going to do this for the second time to then wrap up everything again.
1615200	1667810	35	A	0.99663	26:55	96	So, we have talked about fermology of the body. However, we haven't underlined the importance that the touch and proximal sound has for our lip. Our as Nikka and colleagues has already proposed, our proximal sense are central for our minimal sense of self. And on top of that, we bring into play the fact that different kinds of touch can convey different experience of the sense of self or sense of boundaries. So for example, imagine yourself that you are in a city of Portugal or California, you touching the whole environment with your body.
1668340	1721376	36	A	0.99996	27:48	128	You may feel that you have a sense of immersiveness or that your body boundaries are slowly a bit becoming less clear. And this experience, it's actually a bit similar to the experiences of sensory deprivation states where people are put in a salty water and they let them flow for some moments. Sensory deprivation states are not really all deprived because you have other activities in the body and movements that produce signals that you are actually aware of. However, in both these experiences, the body boundary seems to fade a little bit. However, if you're in the sea and you're swimming and then you touch the rock with your hand, you clearly will feel yourself as separated as something different from what you're actually touching, right?
1721478	1768880	37	A	0.98194	28:41	80	Sense of separation. This phenomenology can be brought into active inference through the mechanism of some of the sensory attenuation which comes from the sensory tinuation. So this process happens when the systemicates its own action. So for example, I take a glass and in this moment my rena has already created afferent copies of this action and the sensory consequences of this. So whenever I grab this glass, the sensory constant that happens to my body are slightly attenuated.
1769220	1802920	38	A	0.94	29:29	69	And this is why we cannot tickle ourselves because the prediction errors comes at. Not surprising this has implication for our embodied experience in the world. Because we feel that we are in immediate contact with ourselves in the world. And this is because our conscious experience are mediated by transparent or non perceived cognitive processes. So that the system can leave behind or disatten self related sensory processing.
1803500	1851448	39	A	0.9	30:03	115	And these allow to allocate resources to perception and action involved in the processing of the object of interest. So for example, when LeMans confiscated this example of the cherry, when I have to take object salient for me, I'll be much more interested in picking the object and I will not really focus on my arm moving in picking that. So that the system needs to compute and maintain a fine balance between external and internal components of somatosensory attenuation. And this is very important for a sense of self as well. So we need to understand and it's not that we need, but in order for us to have a sense of self.
1851534	1890976	40	A	1.0	30:51	84	We normally have a sense of what we are and what we are not. But for the brain as agents end up with the brain, we compute this distinction. So where the self ends and where do work begins or do I move my arm or my arm is moved by something or someone? So central attenuation plays a role in these distinctions in building multisensory bodily self representations. So that the sense of the self embody is subject to the and phenomenally transferred.
1891168	1930052	41	A	0.99997	31:31	96	That means that when we act in the world and we interact, we normally disattend the way we are in the world. Because we need to be in contact, in direct contact with the world. If we always attend it to our body and ourself in the sense that we will be hyper reflexive then we will be actually will be impaired in what we normally do. And this is actually a condition that we will talk about later. So that in active images the sense of self is an ongoing inferential process centering the body.
1930106	1966620	42	A	0.98391	32:10	90	So what we propose is what is lost during selfless experience is an ordinary way to mentally model self in relation to the body and the world. So that if we think about the self as I propose here the iceberg where the narrative self is what we see but the renewal self is what we actually are composed of and it's actually larger but we are not aware of. Similarly, when we have self experience we may have also this inferential process where we think we have lost ourselves.
1969220	2014220	43	A	0.99993	32:49	71	However, we have gathered some evidence in the fact that meditation facilitate autonomic regulation involved in homostatic processes. That means for example that meditation increase the synchronization of cardiac and respiratory system. This is connected with reduced levels of blood glucose or blood pressure and heart rate variability. So there is a success. Medication helps to successfully self regulate the body especially in comparison to stress that actually does the opposite.
2016560	2050970	44	A	0.89	33:36	67	And on top of that, meditation help us to attune us to our physiological interceptive awareness. And it does it so they say, by enhancing the processing of extraceptive interceptive stimuli which doesn't have to be understanded as a maladaptive increased body awareness, but rather an adaptive body awareness which is a distinction that we can come back later if people are interested or they ask about.
2054480	2124780	45	A	0.99201	34:14	141	These evidence are also in line with evidence of meditation that promotes self regulation of pain and pain and pleasantness. So three day attentional training, the meditation allow you're actually able to self regulate the pain and not really like the sensation of the pain because actually it gets very fewer but the automatic behavioral patterns that comes in association with the pain. So there is a lot of also self regulation on emotions and so on. So the body does not literally disappear actually it stays at the very center as I propose here at the center as we propose it in the paper and I propose it through this image at the center of a cycling. So self regulatory processes allow the subjective experience to lose oneself so that the sense of the body remains present in the background.
2124940	2140820	46	A	1.0	35:24	39	And this for example, it's very clear from this report from a person undergoing this kind of experience that they say that there remains a sense that there is a body without any experience of a sense of boundary.
2144700	2216088	47	A	0.99844	35:44	118	So this is not very last slide but we come to our wrap up of our claim attenuating the self and limiting the body which is also the title of our paper. So, starting from the fact that all medicine practices across the tradition require systematic and carefully fully crafted body preparation to enter this deep method selfless state. So it doesn't happen that all of a sudden you just have a selfless state which actually may happen more similarly with psychedelic. But with meditation you need to pass through gradually a many different state or many different level of concentration. That happens when you have around a predictable environment and you do so by building prior expectation.
2216264	2256120	48	A	0.99998	36:56	84	So you have to keep your body in a certain position of posture. As you say in this image, the person is seated with a very straight, not very, but a straight back relaxed. This is very important meditation, banded legs and so on. And then you need at least in the most part of your practice, you need safe predictable environments with temperature that enables you to maintain your homostatic processes. So all these conditions are necessary for your successful homostatic self regulation.
2257180	2294790	49	A	0.97196	37:37	69	In this sense when parts of preparation to enter then after the state of confrontation, the meditator can let go and leave behind self related processes and process the body transported or it can attenuate them attenuate the body can be attenuated. So our claim is that a transfer essential self and body may underline the phenomenology of losing oneself and blurring body boundaries as reported during meditative states.
2297820	2335860	50	A	0.50963	38:17	83	So our conclusion is that we have proposed a shift in focus on homostatic body self regulation in examining deep meditative states. The experience of having a body living self organism biological system is never lost in this process. Rather it stay transferred at its very center, self attenuated yet very much present and hands alive. So that the self model is attenuated to become transparent and hands processed in the background. Now giving this conclusion now I'm going to present related project.
2336010	2425792	51	A	1.0	38:56	139	The first one is still on the theoretical side. So we are in the realm of active inference model in meditation research. There is a radio literature about that that have studied different kinds of meditation techniques like focused attention, open monitoring, nondual awareness and they all study from Laconin in 2023 or Laconin and Lactar in 2021. They have for example showed that these attention techniques profoundly alter typical mental experiences and for example focus meditation is meditation that engage attention on one specific object experience. For example the breath and in active inference term it means that precision is estimated one sensory input which means that it reduce the impact of the other thoughts and parallel processes that are going on or often open monitoring meditation is the engaging of attention to one's experience as a whole.
2425846	2465500	52	A	0.78494	40:25	65	So the whole stream of experience without selecting anything in particular. So that in an activatory terms it has been described as assigning equal precision to all these experiencing promoting non reactive sensing. And this is connected also why medicine are good in self regulated regulate pain. So we will also build our model on self modeling based on the previous literature which is integration.
2467600	2552760	53	A	1.0	41:07	138	And then going experimental we want to bring into the table application of what we're researching and potential benefit may be for cases of people or individual that suffer from disrupted body awareness or disrupted self awareness. And there is a relatively recent condition that has been studied that is depersonalization. So depersonization is the disruption of both body and self awareness and it's a very heterogeneous condition, there is a lot of different dimensions that occurs but generally it's connected with feelings of heaviness disconnection feeling the body as an object, rather they're a transfer and medium of experience which simply is called disembodiment. It is linked with difficulties in concentration and attention, often comorbid with depression, rumination and anxiety. And recently Chow Nuka and colleagues has also proposed AIDS characterized by failures in attenuating somatosentry signals.
2553980	2641460	54	A	0.87491	42:33	149	So based on what we have previously said and based on how this condition affects large number of population, we want to test certain hypotheses. So the first one would be that higher somasocentric attenuation Correlate with more feeling of aliveness and wide openness in experienced meditators and rather lowest somascentric attenuation Correlate with feelings of unrealness thatness in people experience deeper solidation. And on the other hand, severe homostatic dysregulation of bodily states during deep meditative states may lead to negative emotional outcomes and Abernant self experience. This comes from to the fact that depression and meditation can both create stressing negative outcomes and it's interesting to see how this happened and what are the commonalities and differences in that. And also we have dealt in the realm of spatial temporal perception which is connected also with mood disorders or like depression and anxiety and also with depersonalization.
2642520	2707880	55	A	0.99984	44:02	124	However, in depersonalization there is no specific items in the questionnaire that is usually used for measuring which is the Cambridge Depressionization scale. So we want to test this as well and we want to test it in people reporting selfless and disembodied experience so both pathological and non pathological conditions. So part of this hypothesis we are really going through this is our team coming from Humboldt University where I come from as well Simon Wendelman, but also University College London with Ines and Joseph first study is as I said about. Time perspective. So we want to analyze how people with high traits of depression correlate with dimension of the time perspective so they are more future oriented or more negative oriented.
2707960	2730560	56	A	0.99989	45:07	31	Our hypothesis that they're more negative past oriented so they're stuck in a very long present moment, but also they're the tendency of ruminating. So always going to past negative memories.
2732920	2791430	57	A	0.95344	45:32	116	Since this is titled Last in Dark Times the Effect of the Personalization Experience in on Time Perspective And these we are already in the analysis of the data but it's an ongoing steel study. So we have preliminary data on this. While studies too we are in the recruitment phases but we are almost there and encompass the high traits of people individual into high traits of depression and meditators. I want to see through a set of questionnaires and a behavioral task how they may differ in the sense of self, body and motion. Of course, they are very wide and concepts so there is always room for feedback and replications and so on.
2795240	2850344	58	A	0.99881	46:35	111	We have selected these tasks, the embody tasks adopted from new menma where individual participants has to color parts of the body in relation to activation that they feel by reading certain emotional story. So these stories are supposed to validate it to elicit certain emotions in the body and then people colors parts of the body. And then we will see how people with hydrates and the visualization may say will differ in this. And we will also compare with other questionnaires that we have put this and potential title is emotional Body Maps of Thought Detachment, Interpersonalization and Meditation. And with this I thank you all and that's it.
2850462	2853690	59	A	0.99927	47:30	7	We are open for discussion. Thank you.
2858480	2864876	60	B	0.98986	47:38	12	Awesome. Thank you very much. Valeria, you are muted. Donna. Thank you.
2864898	2885990	61	B	0.62263	47:44	39	Valeria. Great. Well, very fascinating presentation. Perhaps Anna first and then our other colleagues who have joined. Would be awesome to hear your path to be here on this work and any reflection or questions you have on it.
2890020	2900790	62	C	0.79779	48:10	23	Is it my turn? Sure. Did I miss? Yeah. So obviously I don't have many questions because it's like we wrote this together.
2902680	2998960	63	C	0.99695	48:22	192	But I think what I would like just to add not really a question is I really like to see so for instance like in ideal world would be nice to get all the traditions of the meditative experiences and how they relate to the body and make a very precise prediction on what exactly they will kind of predict in terms of certain sensory experiences and how this can be interpreted through different theoretical lenses. I think that could be really interesting because I think one of the problems, the challenges that we have right now is that we have so many concepts, so many approaches and kind of, like, scattered all over the map, and I think would be really nice to narrow down, because, as you said, Daniel so everybody knows what meditation is. Everybody knows at least one person that meditates in life and everything, but it's really unclear what exactly we are after and why. In certain cases, this is kind of like beneficial, and in other cases, basically it has negative consequences. And this is why precisely we are doing this project on depersonalization and meditation.
2999120	3027160	64	C	1.0	49:59	75	And I can share with you informally, Scoop, but data is here, so we kind of like can share with. So what we did in this project, basically we took people with typical controls that don't have depersonalization and never meditated. Right? So it's kind of like, yeah, never did that. And then we took people that meditated, and then we looked at whether they have kind of like high or low traits of depersonization.
3027240	3031950	65	C	1.0	50:27	11	And then we took people with depersonization that never meditate. Right.
3034240	3064264	66	C	0.99692	50:34	64	So we have this inclusion and exclusion criteria and yeah, it's really interesting to find what our findings is. It's really difficult to find people that have experience and low depersonalization skills, low depersonization traits. Right. So most of them, they actually have high depersonalization. But then it's interesting to see how that contrasts with the people that have depersonalization and no vegetation experience.
3064382	3073850	67	C	0.83471	51:04	14	Right. So that's something I would like to carry on to reach the community.
3076700	3101190	68	C	0.93447	51:16	53	That's something we'll definitely carry on with. Valerian the next steps and also with some people that I have here in the chat, julia and Simone. So Simone will going to work with us on also. Somatosensory attenuation through different have some without scooping. We have also some very interesting results coming up.
3101720	3130284	69	C	0.99724	51:41	64	We just finished data collection on intentional binding and depersonization. So related to the sense of agency. That's all for me for now. We're kind of like in between because Valerie represented very well, like the theory part and the studies are literally just getting hot from the oven now. And we hope that in September it's like we're going to get them out.
3130402	3162504	70	C	0.60457	52:10	69	Yeah, but the data is in the box, so that's very exciting and yeah, we have the results. Thank you, Danielle, again for this platform. It's really nice. And as I said, I really hope that after this discussion, we'll have more opportunities to change, exchange and discuss. We also plan to organize something around alteration of self consciousness across various conditions and also decarbonization in Lisbon next year.
3162542	3194770	71	C	0.99864	52:42	74	So maybe you can cross the pond and check for yourself that we have a nice airport in Lisbon. Yeah. Cool. Well, good to get the appetizer before the entree. So that's very awesome about just how much theory and even unconventional scientific theory, like world knowledge traditions come into play and then what it looks like to take that experimental step to make it scientific is definitely what I saw in the talk.
3195540	3207990	72	B	0.99676	53:15	29	Julia or Simone, do you want to give any reflection or any thoughts or questions? Yes. Can you hear me? Yes. I actually have three questions I noted down.
3209080	3240160	73	D	1.0	53:29	86	I think the first one because it's just for me personally, I'm curious about that is that those deep meditative selfless states I think that can also be reached while doing yoga, right? Basically the opposite of sitting still. It's like a sort of repetitive movement actually. So I'm wondering do those movements have to be perfectly predictable in order to be attenuated and then reaching the same state? Or is that like a different different concept or how do you put that in your framework?
3244500	3260490	74	A	1.0	54:04	30	I think here you brought mainly two topics. One is, is it possible to reach deep matter states also not sitting in a still position? And the answer is yes.
3263820	3299140	75	A	0.99999	54:23	72	However, there is not so much research on that. So I can talk about anecdotal knowledge, but I did not read so much about walking meditation effect, usually walking meditation or of course you talk about yoga. I know, but that's what I would say, that walking meditation is used as a complementary practice through the sitting. So I would say it's hard to reach deep meditative states only by walking meditation.
3302200	3338096	76	A	0.99954	55:02	59	In regarding to yoga, also yoga means unity. So what we think about yoga now, we think about movement, but it's always accompanied by reaching state of concentration through meditation. So you cannot have yoga without meditation, otherwise you'll be stretching or pilates. But second topic is that can it happen when you don't have prediction of movement? Right?
3338278	3360950	77	D	0.68099	55:38	80	No, I meant like because in yoga at least I don't really do yoga, right? But I can imagine that when people reach those states doing yoga, then they kind of do it almost like in a trance type of way. They're always doing the same movement over and over and over again so that they don't have to attend to those movements. But it's just like an automatic process. I was wondering if that also can I jump in?
3361880	3394492	78	C	0.9982	56:01	76	Actually, this is precisely the opposite. What Valerie was saying is so Valerie was saying this is precisely the opposite. You want to reach through yoga just like the opposite of automatic. So basically when you do this movements, you need to be united with yourself doing it. So you really need to I'm doing yoga so the past ten years and precisely this is like they're trying to tell us don't do it on automatic.
3394556	3433950	79	C	0.99999	56:34	105	Because it's like when you have your thinking happening there and your body is doing some stuff there, right. You need to basically be presence in every single type of moon. So you have like fully, fully presence if you do it automatically, that's more like gymnastic or something. But it's interesting. So your point is really interesting because then would be really nice to have a control condition where we have people doing like movement, meditation and yoga and then contrast with the phenomena of some other sense retenuation and whether they have what type of embodiment and disembodiment and gentivity experiences they have.
3436960	3454148	80	D	0.99919	57:16	58	Okay, I don't know exactly what I was trying to get it. But I think it was also more related to because you said that when meditating you have to sort of let yourself letting go. Letting go, exactly. And the idea is that everything has to be perfectly sort of predictable, right? That's the idea behind it.
3454234	3467690	81	D	0.98492	57:34	40	So then I'm thinking so within yoga, don't you have to do the exact same movements in order for it to be predictable, in order for you to let go and not overatten to the environment? Does that make sense?
3470460	3538736	82	A	0.57	57:50	150	I thought when we both and Simon were speaking I think on one side you, Simon, maybe you're referring to the implicit procedural knowledge that you can acquire through yoga and you, Ana, are talking about doing things without being aware, which is also automatic and left. And you both are right, I think in this because on one Anna, you would say like if you do yoga, you learn how to do yoga, right? So you learn how to move yourself in this way so that when you do a certain position that you have to arrange your body and for arrange your dirty, you always have to keep monitoring yourself. So there is a continuous going back to your body, keeping track of your body and continue to monitor yourself. But in this way because you have learned to do this going back and being aware on yourself.
3538838	3579660	83	A	1.0	58:58	109	And this comes also when you do your movement, you have learned that certain posture are made in a certain way so that it becomes more or less predictable actually what you're going to do. Right. But it doesn't mean that you don't have to be awareness and actually there is a trick ribbon here because you're very attentive with what's going on but at the same time the more you're attentive, the more somatosensory attenuation may happen. And actually it's what we are trying to argue in our active inference model. The more predictable it gets, the more it gets attenuated, but doesn't mean that you're not aware.
3582640	3613944	84	A	0.99995	59:42	110	Thank you for this input because it helps us elaborate this. I think it's super interesting because it's like when you look at people that climb or surf or whatever, any type of sports, right? In the beginning, in order to learn the skill, you have to put a lot of attention to the individual movements but then later on, in order to actually be good at it, you have to take the attention away. And then in those moments is when the people report that they're actually feeling sort of selfless states and these flow is when the movements are internalized, so to speak. I think that's super interesting.
3614142	3621160	85	D	0.98474	1:00:14	24	Can I just shoot the other two questions I had? They're sort of different or should we go to Julia first? Maybe it's Julia.
3624460	3650130	86	E	0.8442	1:00:24	65	Hi, sorry. Yeah, sorry for the lighting and sorry because I'm in the lab, so it's probably not the best position. Thank you. Varia it was very interesting and I'm really looking forward to look at the results you have in your study. Especially since as Anna mentioned, we had something interesting with the international binding and depersonalization and yeah, kind of happy about that.
3651080	3667892	87	E	0.98031	1:00:51	47	I'm really sorry because I listened kind of doing something else. Unfortunately in the lab I was busy while you were talking. But I kind of like this idea. Yeah. Does the self is attenuated or not or increasing and kind of goes back to just Simon.
3667956	3703572	88	E	1.0	1:01:07	87	The last comment from Simon about expertise. I think in term of motor interaction there is some literal jobability expert. I was trying to Google that, but I attended a workshop last year, and I think it was about once you're an expert. At the beginning, you have this kind of flexible you have a better understanding consciousness, and then at the end, you kind of learn to let it go, to ride the flow of the motion, kind of. And I think it's probably the same.
3703626	3724328	89	E	1.0	1:01:43	44	I don't know about attention in meditation is that you have to maybe more like not focus attentional state but more like open. Sorry, I forgot the name of the meditation type of meditation. But open meditation, open monitoring. Yeah, exactly. I don't know.
3724494	3742610	90	E	0.99708	1:02:04	46	So it would be interesting and I suggested to see what type of meditation maybe changed the sense of the self. Maybe at the beginning it's more acute because you really scrutinize your sensation. I don't know. This is something that you plan to do, right?
3745300	3807920	91	A	0.99961	1:02:25	115	Should I go or do you want to go on the the first question was there is a body of evidence that actually say that in expert meditators tension start decreasing. But there is also because you allocate less and less attention. But I would be careful with that with this because they say there is decreased activity in anterior singleet cortex. So they make inference about it as meditators as well. And having to know other people that are more experienced than me, they would never say we lose our attention to that because our experience is so rich of sensory signals and related thought process that you cannot afford to not be attentive.
3808080	3853552	92	A	0.57521	1:03:28	110	However, we can bring into the plate different kinds of attention. As you said, there is focused attention or there's an attention that requires more explicit thought about it. So more explicit kind of way to focus on things and there is more like a bare attention. So when you focus on the whole experience and you let it go with a non judgmental attitude and more open attitude and it's actually these attitudes, they're very stressed in meditation techniques, that's why they're a bit underlooked. And in research I feel because it's a lot about how we use attention but not the attention but not how we use intention.
3853696	3870650	93	A	0.99425	1:04:13	32	So the attitude of the meditator has to be very open and very non judgmental and these reduce the nonreactive senses for example and reduce the ability to self regulate your experience.
3873280	3919092	94	A	0.95636	1:04:33	104	Partially answered. Yeah, I kind of like the idea that you link that with attention and just I think maybe it would be interesting to look at different type of attention because maybe there is a difference between I don't know, different type of meditation may develop different type of maybe the open meditation is more prone. I don't know because you mentioned the insula cortex and to me it's more associated with certain type of attention. Like more like maybe more prone for feedback or negativity or these kind of error monitoring process. So it's not like your attention, you lose your attention.
3919156	3934824	95	E	0.50328	1:05:19	49	It's just it's more like in the background and then when there is a mistake or something it kind of pops up more quickly. I don't know. And you may have more frontal or sustain attention. I don't know. I mean I'm not a specialist of attention at all.
3934882	3954148	96	E	0.9994	1:05:34	46	So please take that with a grain of salt. Yeah. I was wondering if this is something, I don't know obviously because you're not planning to do any EEG or neurophysiological measurement. Right. So this is maybe like a follow up study that would be interesting.
3954314	3980220	97	C	0.99052	1:05:54	44	Not yet, but in the pipeline. Yeah. Okay. What we really want with Valeria is and other collaborators is to basically push against this idea that you can have selfless experiences. I know it's controversial and many people talk about oh, selfless experience blah.
3981760	4051044	98	C	0.88212	1:06:21	176	So basically we want to say radically speaking okay, so that works if you bite the bullet and you're mind body dualist and somehow consider that actually the body kind of like disappears in the process. But if you're not mind body dualist then you need to basically put the body into equation and realize that actually what allows the mind to disappear is the fact into the pureness of the experience is the fact that the impure body is kind of like put in a stable condition in such a way that basically you can afford to leave it in the background and to have this type of experience arising. But without that in place you can't really afford to go through this selfless experiences. And this is why we want to be provocative in the titles that well actually maybe the experience of selfless experiences actually comes necessarily as two sign of the same coin of this experience of having an unlimited body that actually expands through the world. But the body is there.
4051082	4088320	99	C	0.99	1:07:31	84	I mean the thing, the entity that has the experience of no experience is that a body that kind of is self regulated in a certain way like the homeostasis is put at like a set point. And when you're using this metaphor of think of a cyclone, right, moving cyclone so you have the steel eye of the cyclone in the middle doesn't mean that actually it's not there. It's just like it's around everything. And because we are self organizing biological systems.
4091220	4117752	100	C	0.92759	1:08:11	70	This animal, this thing needs to keep track of this internal bodily states. And a successful system does this all the time. All the time, literally from second one, when we basically get from one cell to the self. So this is some sort of fascinating self organization that is happening on the cellular level already and it needs to be. And death is basically this is what is happening.
4117806	4142060	101	C	0.7743	1:08:37	64	It's like disintegration of this self organization. But clearly that's not what is happening on meditation, right? Because hopefully you don't die when you meditate. In that sense. There is disintegration of a certain way to experience yourself in relation to the body in the world, but clearly there's something that stays there and needs to stay there for you to have those experiences.
4142140	4182750	102	C	0.53923	1:09:02	120	So that's a bit of controversial, radical claim that we like to defend. And yeah, we already had this discussion with several people. For instance, like Valerie and I, we went to Enlightenment, this workshop on phrenology neurocompetition. We met there with people like Thomas Betziger and everything and obviously they have a different opinion. So we kind of, like, have a lively discussion about why we think it's like, what does it mean to actually lose yourself and what is the self and what is a pure experience and why we basically need whether we're like it or not, the connection with the impure body to make sure that you can have, at a certain point, a pure experience.
4183600	4200790	103	C	1.0	1:09:43	46	But then again, this is something that just speculation at the theory level. And this is why I have this brilliant team here that we can do some studies and actually measure stuff, put the finger on it, put the number and see what we get.
4203160	4248260	104	B	0.99981	1:10:03	97	These are awesome points and there's so many ways it could go. I'll read a question from the live chat. So G Pagnani wrote, the notion of increased Somatosensory transparency in experienced meditators associated with increased liveliness of the experience is intriguing. Can you say something about which levels in the hierarchical structure of the internal model are more likely to be affected by the meditative attentional task in terms of precision deployment? Do you think the attenuation of Somatosensory prediction error concerns more intermediate levels in a way increase meta awareness rather than sheer sensory attention?
4250520	4260680	105	C	0.95	1:10:50	26	I can take this one. So I can give a fuzz go and then you can go. No, I just wanted to ask rather than ensuring.
4263100	4269290	106	B	0.99968	1:11:03	12	Rather than sheer sensory attention. Yeah, you can go on now, please.
4272320	4328940	107	C	0.94543	1:11:12	122	Yeah, so this is something I'm trying to develop this idea right now with a PhD student of mine, Libetise, basically. And this is why it's connected with the question that you ask, you'll see, is that your platform is active inference, right? And so people kind of know lately kind of realize, wait a minute, actually we are active and we need to explain action in the world and everything kind of like comes late, right? But if you look going back to the animal, basically the action and the movement is there from the very beginning. So this means that this is why it's so important to basically relate the self organization, self awareness, self perception necessarily related with movement.
4329680	4356372	108	C	0.96525	1:12:09	84	So movement an action is not something that you add on the top of this, right? Like some of intention. So you can have an intention, but basically the first movements are kind of like automatic and need to be there, right? And basically our body moves all the time because we breathe all the time and our heart beats all the time. So this means that for me, this type of attenuation is happening at the sensory level because that's the basic one.
4356426	4383564	109	C	0.99999	1:12:36	65	So can you have sensory stuff without metacognitive stuff? Yes. Can you have metacognitive stuff without sensory stuff? No. So it's like what is basic that's the first things needs to be attenuated and then there has to be a balance between metacognitive and sensory attenuation because this is precisely what I think it is happening in Depersonalization because if you focus too much, right?
4383602	4447120	110	C	0.97143	1:13:03	135	So you lose the balance between then it's kind of like this type of you cannot afford to self forget yourself. And then it's kind of like the self stands in the way and that gets you even more disconnected, so to speak. So this is why I think it's important to contrast different type of meditative experiences and meditative practices to see which one of them actually has more focus on what you do with metacognitive, metawareness awareness of awareness and which one are actually involving more like sensory movement, for instance, let's say. Yeah, so that's something that needs to be empirically tested. But I would speculate and then obviously we can put it at test, either by doing a simulation or actually collecting data to see how that plays into this distinction.
4451840	4459090	111	C	1.0	1:14:11	19	I think Simon wants to say something, but I'm not the moderator. So Daniel, you decide. Yeah. Valeria first.
4463140	4464480	112	A	0.78499	1:14:23	3	Thank you, Anna.
4466840	4535050	113	A	1.0	1:14:26	145	I don't have so much more to say because I agree with her. But I thought when Daniel you were reading the question for me the answer was more or less clear in the sense that as I say, the Somatosens continuation happens the very low level predictions. So in a very pre reflective self consciousness, so that the person was asking in the meditation techniques, when you put the attention on, for example, your bodily signals there, you have a top down modulation of this, of precision wasting, but the top down modulation is on low level predictions. So you're not putting top down on what you think about your body is you're actually doing the opposite. You're trying to forget about your previous expectations about the body because you're trying to have this non judgmental awareness about what's going on in your experience.
4535680	4589356	114	A	0.69	1:15:35	77	And then with this, let's say, less biased way to attend your body. You start piercing and perceiving bodily sensations in your body or other kind of experiences. So I would say this increasing precision on somatosensory signals happens at the low level of the Yerarchy that then attenuates the sensory consequences of the posterior. And the meta awareness comes when you learn, I think, when you start having increased body awareness. So you make more experience.
4589458	4631576	115	A	1.0	1:16:29	84	I think then you start developing meta awareness about how your body is actually about higher representation of the body of your body. But in the moment when this happens, I think it really happens at the low level, subpersonal beliefs. And then later on, on the longer time scales, then it starts becoming more abstract and ingrained at the personal level of your beliefs. That's how I say it. But of course, if Simon has something to do with it, it's really I.
4631598	4666950	116	D	0.87167	1:17:11	82	Didn'T I didn't want to comment. I just selfishly raised my hand to. Ask another question or Daniel, I don't know if you have an opinion on that. I'm happy to hear it as well. Well, certainly resonated with this comparative approach to studying the diversity of methods and protocols we already have for mind and body and attention, broadening the scope and just kind of putting darts in the space of what practices do people engage their mind and body in?
4667320	4708240	117	B	1.0	1:17:47	79	And then, how can that territory be explored with also a variety of theoretical models? And how does that relationship connect to the kinds of empirical work that we might do in a brain scanner or with other kinds of measuring? And I think one thing I want to explore more is in a hierarchical nested cognitive model, which we often speak of ourselves and other types of sophisticated entities as where's our awareness? Where's awareness in that picture?
4712520	4754080	118	B	0.94	1:18:32	86	And also to Simone's question about when we're moving, but we're expecting what we're moving, then how does the exteriorceptive flow? Like the visual field? You might be very familiar with walking, and so you might be able to proprioceptively kind of zero out on your walking, but there's this exteriorceptive flow of novelty in the world. So I think that how and then connect it back to the comparative and staring at a candle or a blank screen or darkness and all these different methods.
4758500	4785204	119	B	0.99888	1:19:18	65	There's a lot that these questions bring up. Yeah. Thank you, Daniel. So I have something to add to that because I think it's super know, my background is like, embodied cognition and activists and everything. And for me, it's really not at all surprising the fact that many of these techniques have been developed by people that kind of, like, lived in closed communities.
4785332	4797630	120	C	0.5304	1:19:45	33	Right. So it's like you have a space where people can meditate walking. I don't know. And then they have this ritual. They wake up at this time and they do this thing.
4798080	4807010	121	C	0.99954	1:19:58	25	So you put yourself in yeah, it's a ritual. Right. Like all the rituals. So this means, as I said, it's like high predictability. Right.
4808340	4822470	122	C	1.0	1:20:08	24	And then that's something super important. And even in the Wokie meditation, you need to follow a certain path. Yes. So that's super interesting.
4826220	4842190	123	B	0.9739	1:20:26	37	Well, in the last five or ten minutes, I would love to hear from each of you, like, what are your directions heading forward and what's exciting to you and where would you like to take this?
4844240	4849470	124	B	0.9887	1:20:44	16	Maybe Simone and Julia first, and then we'll kind of make our way back to the.
4853700	4882760	125	D	0.92954	1:20:53	60	Not myself, not working on the project. Right. But what I was really interested in sort of extending this is trying to understand because the way those deep meditative states are reported sometimes and the way people with depersonalization disorder report their experience is very similar. They almost use, like, the same words right. And to describe how they feel.
4882830	4897230	126	D	1.0	1:21:22	39	And I wonder why one is experienced positively and one is experienced so negatively, as in it being a disorder and in completely disrupting someone's life. So that was like this comparison I think I'll be very curious about.
4901100	4904670	127	B	0.95892	1:21:41	8	Awesome. Julia, if you want to add anything.
4907440	4953720	128	E	0.96268	1:21:47	103	Well, it's very interesting. Again, I'm not so involved in this study, so it's a bit hard, but I'm really interested in all the self is affected by our interaction with the world, external world, and I'm completely already spoiled with the result we have with the international binding. So it's very if the self is attenuated or if it's disappeared, kind of I think that's the key question we want to answer. And yeah, I would be very curious to mean what Valeria found in data to see if we can have a common narrative about what's happening. Also with the personalization.
4955120	4968770	129	A	0.96764	1:22:35	32	Yeah. It's very interesting to see how moving of body, attention to the body can really change the self, kind of or the way we process self information. Yeah. So very interesting.
4971140	4972640	130	A	0.99869	1:22:51	2	Cool. Anna.
4975320	4991136	131	C	0.99849	1:22:55	34	Yes. So it's like lots of work to do ahead, but that's exciting, right? Yeah. So, very short term, it's like we need to write up this result that we just got. So yeah.
4991178	5032660	132	C	0.83852	1:23:11	79	In relation to the body. So basically, we're going to have some numbers to show. So that's super nice. And then the next steps would be to create or develop computational model around this, basically contrast the real world data with, you know, simulation data and then have a multilayered type of approach with different methods, from physiological to behavioral to phenomenological to computational, potentially also neural. So that's something would be nice to do in the next steps.
5035720	5056940	133	C	0.26	1:23:55	42	And apart from that, I think that's all for now, and I'll leave the floor to Valeria. Well, again, thank you, Dan and everybody. Yeah. I also want to thank you a lot for this platform, this invitation. It was really nice.
5057090	5091320	134	A	0.39442	1:24:17	74	Really nice person and really nice conversation. I'm working with Anne Andy's project, so she already said, what's the next direction? What. I can add in this I think would be on the theoretical side also start engaging with more closely to bodily reactions to meditation because the body boundaries dissolution is just one part of it. It's like one part of the phenomenology but it's not the only thing that happens during meditation.
5092220	5162110	135	A	0.99999	1:24:52	172	There is a lot of potential that can be discovered on this because the body boundary solution again, it's really study a lot, but it's a phenomenon and there is so many other things that happens in our body while we meditate and I speak for first person experience, but in the community it's really like already said, other kinds of also more healing traditions like breath work, for example. There there is a lot of potential where people already work on that. But there is no bridge with the academic communities. So people work pragmatically with this intuitive knowledge about what happens in the body during these altered states of consciousness but still we need to bridge it with trying to make sense from a phonological and scientific point of view and experimental point of view as well. So I think I see myself in trying to step in this toward and bring insight from one world to the other and hoping to help myself and the other people around me.
5164260	5190440	136	B	0.99931	1:26:04	53	Awesome. Well, best of luck with the work. That sounds really exciting. Love the idea of the two way street with different bodily and cognitive practices and collaboration and conversation that can bring in all these different expertises that maybe don't have an fMRI study already, whatever that's worth. Thank you though, always.
5190590	5198870	137	B	0.99969	1:26:30	22	Any of you are welcome back and really appreciate that you all came out. Thank you. Daniel, thank you. See you soon.
