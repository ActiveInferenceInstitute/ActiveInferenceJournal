4680	5230	A	0.546256959438324	You.
7280	8620	B	0.872096598148346	Hello and welcome.
8770	19224	B	0.8781948685646057	It's July 27, 2023, and we're here in Acton, guest stream, number 15.1 with Valeria Beckhatini and Anna C unica.
19352	32080	B	0.9741084575653076	This is going to be a very interesting and cool presentation and discussion on selfless minds, unlimited bodies, homeostatic, bodily self regulation and meditative experiences.
32240	35584	B	0.9043112993240356	There will be a presentation followed by a discussion.
35632	40420	B	0.9712465405464172	So thank you both for joining and to you Valeria, for the presentation.
41740	43208	A	0.959549605846405	Thank you Diana, very much.
43294	45924	A	0.9904927611351013	I'm very happy to be here with Anna.
45972	52090	A	0.8239815831184387	Presenting pathavara wider project.
52540	60840	A	0.9130670428276062	This is a paper about what happened in selfless state from a Homo Sapie bodily self regulation perspective.
61180	71040	A	0.765795886516571	So it's as I said, it's part of a wider project that consists in both theoretical and experimental components.
74260	79600	A	0.7985150814056396	Today we're going to look at meditation.
80440	89620	A	0.8037474751472473	So for people that are not really familiar with that, meditation is a practice that engaged attention to self regulate physiological and cognitive activity.
90280	112140	A	0.6689760684967041	What we're interested here is that people that meditate with a certain experience, so for example, meditating in the past two years with regularly, like some hours per week, they consistently report losing one sense of the self or having selfless experiences.
112720	118480	A	0.576311469078064	But not only that, they also report to have bodily alterations.
119220	121744	A	0.8223006725311279	So alterations in the procession of the body.
121782	127372	A	0.8667558431625366	That has been called expansion, oceanic boundlessness, dissolution of body boundaries.
127516	137696	A	0.7484390139579773	And since you are particularly interested in this kind of phenomenal experience, we have proposed to frame them unlimited body, just for clarity.
137888	140308	A	0.8224040865898132	So our question here is what exactly?
140394	152250	A	0.6045376658439636	And the question that will follow the whole presentation in the background is what exactly is lost when experienced meditators report losing their self and the body?
152940	160476	A	0.8887023329734802	So let's first look very briefly at what the self is, or the sense of self is.
160658	168800	A	0.7584633231163025	So this concept is so complex and so wide that has been debated since the beginning of philosophy.
169780	175260	A	0.5792765617370605	And of course, it might be so intuitive that it's also very hard to define.
175420	183760	A	0.6437389850616455	But one very old and used definition is the unitary or unique individual eye.
183840	188656	A	0.8880360722541809	The first person perspective, that Latin was called the subjectin.
188688	199320	A	0.8811202049255371	So something that lay under all our stream of experience, thoughts and whatever else happens to us, that's the subject.
200300	211992	A	0.7468881607055664	However, more recently in cognitive science, we are appealing to a more common definition of sense of self, a bit more exhaustive, that is defined as a multidimensional construct.
212056	219890	A	0.8403727412223816	And here we will come back on this concept later and we'll unpack it a bit more.
221300	237296	A	0.6141445636749268	So the aim of this presentation will be to first of all, lay down the fact that in self experiences, the biological organism, so to speak, the human body remains successfully repregulated.
237488	266190	A	0.7286006808280945	And this might be very intuitive but it needs us then to see that during selfless experiences what we propose is that they may be tacitly accompanied or implicitly underlined by enhanced connectedness with this successful self regulation that we propose to link it with a perceptually attenuated body or what has been already called transparent body.
268500	291430	A	0.7011174559593201	And this allows us to propose but it's of course on a working process and we are very open to feedback at any stage of this presentation that the term selfless states may be misleading because what is lost is an ordinary way to mentally model the self relation to the body and the world.
292860	305660	A	0.8554747104644775	So our roadmap is composed as follows first I will passing through debates and definitions of losing oneself and body.
305730	326720	A	0.662661612033844	So that means I will go through alterations in these three dimension during massive state and then I will introduce Keen concept of predictive process in the active infrastructure framework that are useful in our explanation.
328100	340710	A	0.9017993807792664	So that then I can unpack the role of the biological self organization and homostatic self regulation in constituting our sense of self.
341640	354148	A	0.8068233728408813	And then pass to our more claim that the processes like somatosensory, attenuation and transparent self modeling are a key mechanism underlying the phenomenology of deep mathematical states.
354334	360380	A	0.8055670857429504	And this then will allow us to draw our conclusions and present ongoing related projects.
363280	366430	A	0.7566671967506409	So let's come back to the sense of self.
367140	387456	A	0.7897965908050537	So when one has to investigate the sense of self, of course, as I said it's so wide concept that so many definitions and characterization of the sense of self has come up in philosophy and cognitive science.
387488	395128	A	0.8563965559005737	So we have terms like minimal self experience, selfhood sense of ownership and all of this.
395294	417000	A	0.8790788054466248	And for other part I think we have just to stick to a common definition that comes for example from a similar paper from Gallagher 2000 that defines as a multidimensional construct composed by minimal or embodied components and narrative or reflective components.
417080	430420	A	0.8848831057548523	So to unpack a little bit these two concepts the minimal or embodied experience of the sense of self is the basic implicit functioning of the body of the ongoing moment.
430490	437812	A	0.8801390528678894	So the stream of experience that happens to me right now can be defined as my minimal sense of self.
437866	446760	A	0.7667282223701477	So I don't really need to have an explicit knowledge about myself to have this kind of dimension.
447740	457272	A	0.8965545296669006	And these can be further unpacked through the concept of prereflective self consciousness that comes from a phenomenological tradition.
457416	473472	A	0.7199855446815491	Tracing back from peak argue that parts of our self conscious does not need any reflection to happen there or explicit thought.
473606	481440	A	0.8864556550979614	It happens in a way tambourian is consistently before reflection.
481600	487168	A	0.7772465944290161	And then on top of this we build our narrative or our reflections about ourself.
487264	495844	A	0.8822695016860962	And this is more linked to self identification processes or self monitoring, self recognition and introspection.
495892	502436	A	0.7777062654495239	Introspection, it's the ability of introspection.
502468	507870	A	0.8837200403213501	So perceive yourself or reflect about yourself in an explicit way.
508240	516430	A	0.887564480304718	So you do need to have that biography or an explicit memory about yourself in order to tackle this aspect of the sense of self.
517780	530592	A	0.8620779514312744	So in deep meditative states there is alterations in the sense of self and it's up to debate which dimension are affected by that.
530726	541830	A	0.5311597585678101	And it's far from clear what actually happens to this kind of dimension and more and many more other dimensional sense of self.
542380	546490	A	0.8407971262931824	And we are here to unpack a little bit this.
546860	560632	A	0.8442214131355286	We proposed these quotations from Fashion 2008 where it suggested that enduring deep massive states one experiences oneself as these very moments of consciousness.
560776	569904	A	0.9009164571762085	This is quotation that may reveal some position about the debate what happens to the sense of self.
570022	576556	A	0.8314701318740845	So in this case it's argued that meditation reveal a very moment of consciousness.
576588	585152	A	0.87953120470047	So there is something that is true consciousness or something that is the real consciousness.
585296	589632	A	0.7282271981239319	And this actually has broke through the concept of pure consciousness.
589776	599576	A	0.8077431321144104	So something that stayed there and it's purified by everything, by also the body.
599678	603364	A	0.8019068241119385	And there is so many definition of this pure consciousness.
603412	610990	A	0.6014698147773743	We brought some example like ownerless consciousness, the consciousness that doesn't have an owner, that doesn't have a self.
611360	617760	A	0.6001682281494141	So it doesn't have a proper sense of self that walked or that owns this consciousness.
618420	626560	A	0.8063405156135559	Mastinger has worked on the minimal phenomenal experience defining aspecial a temporal dimensional consciousness.
627060	634080	A	0.9187466502189636	And this is very supportive because it's consistent with the Buddhist philosophical stance of no self.
634150	640340	A	0.8398311138153076	So for most tradition of Buddhism, there is no self.
640410	642640	A	0.5985299944877625	The self, it's an illusion.
642720	654890	A	0.8708445429801941	And it comes to our psychology when we enter in contact with the world and with the sensations of the world and certain patterns of behavior that elicit the sense that we have a self.
656080	671440	A	0.6158703565597534	So, as I said, meditation allows us to access this pure consciousness for supporters of this thesis and rebuilds one choose an essential nature of subjective and we bring this into debate.
673460	685436	A	0.6443294882774353	There are also people that argue against this and it has been called by Matthew in their special issues, the Ubitiquity thesis.
685628	703610	A	0.7231537699699402	So the UBIT thesis claim that essential self is ubiquitous to all states of consciousness and sometimes it appeals to the immunity to error through misidentification argument of self ascription reports, which is simpler than this long name.
704400	720812	A	0.9471847414970398	And it's basically the fact that I can say that I had a wonderful experience and this wonderful experience may be true or false on this weekend.
720956	735892	A	0.47259336709976196	I can do mistakes, I can make mistakes, but I cannot not say that I didn't have these wonderful experiences because the moment in which I report I have a perspective on this.
735946	739300	A	0.6873981952667236	So I cannot really be mistaking on the fact that I'm reporting this.
739370	744576	A	0.49571171402931213	Maybe I was dreaming, maybe it wasn't a wonderful experience, but it's me that I'm reporting.
744608	748470	A	0.6787335872650146	So the moment I'm reporting this, it means that I have to be there.
748920	758700	A	0.8085998892784119	And this applies also to when I ascribe myself selfless state, I had a selfless state.
758850	760700	A	0.5829615592956543	This is very controversial.
761680	766728	A	0.7264262437820435	Other problems on top of that are cross cultural problems also addressed in the literature.
766904	782180	A	0.8435436487197876	So this experience selfless states may be influenced by certain vows or certain beliefs that meditator endorse, especially during especially expert meditators.
782520	799060	A	0.61605304479599	And the other thing is these all cross cultural analysis and debate about the self may be also partially due to a verbal misunderstanding.
799140	806968	A	0.5899699926376343	So that the western philosophy may have problems about the self that actually the Eastern probably philosophy is not really addressing.
807064	811548	A	0.6776115894317627	So there might be some incommensurability of problems there.
811714	824290	A	0.807881772518158	But as also we said in the paper, it's not that we want to address the Buddhist philosophical problems, rather we want to bring insight from these to our problems.
825940	831536	A	0.8587613701820374	So, given this debate, we want to propose a shift in the focus.
831638	839700	A	0.6702304482460022	So we don't want to start by looking at consciousness and trying to solve things about the self, but we want to start by focusing on the body.
839850	846630	A	0.8505532741546631	So we proposed a shift in focus in the bodily experience, examining this deep mercy state.
848940	858060	A	0.8637896180152893	So let's start by the subjective experience of the body or the study of the subjective experience of the body, which is phenomenology.
858480	861980	A	0.8351266384124756	In the tradition, our body has a unique status.
862560	868568	A	0.8475017547607422	So the anatomical structure of the body has been called by USA Kobe.
868664	873276	A	0.691987156867981	So the living body, the body that I can observe and others can be observed.
873308	877168	A	0.8148578405380249	So it's the object among the other object, they would say.
877334	882628	A	0.5156576037406921	But it's not only that because it's an object that I can live from inside.
882794	888950	A	0.8847672939300537	So it has been called the light, the lived body or the body as I leave it from inside, as I said.
890440	893972	A	0.621192216873169	So what happens to these kind of dimension?
894036	899544	A	0.8972695469856262	Again, we can unpack this and see how the meditative states affect them.
899742	908876	A	0.8407151103019714	So from the point of view of the life believed body, we already know, and I will unpack a little bit more.
908978	921260	A	0.8456845283508301	So we have already said that we have called unlinuated body experiences the reports that spoke about this fading of the body boundaries.
921420	928156	A	0.8797711133956909	So the body boundary has been defined as a cognitive emotional perception of one's body surface.
928268	929836	A	0.6904804706573486	That's just a definition.
930028	932704	A	0.8467051982879639	We can also debate about this.
932822	939072	A	0.7109889984130859	But what it's important about for us that our sense of body boundaries is flexible and dynamic.
939136	944410	A	0.645940363407135	It's not fixed because we are in the realm of the body as felt from inside.
945820	959228	A	0.8988007307052612	There is an interesting study that exemplified this concept in relation to meditation by Jumpren in 2016, though it has worked late further on on this as well.
959394	974796	A	0.7988940477371216	But I find it interesting to look at this image because this is part of a self report measurement that they used on a sample of people that had been trained in meditation, in particular with body scanning.
974908	981010	A	0.6629118323326111	So that people had to systematically scan sensation running the body.
981540	1001528	A	0.6136724352836609	And the result is that in less than four months of practice, so not actually not the expert, they really started to report an increased tendency to go towards the almost imperceptible perception of the body.
1001694	1011960	A	0.8422032594680786	So they conclude that meditation can be actually studied in this sense where it affects our sense of body boundaries.
1012040	1025916	A	0.8915296196937561	And they saw significant results also in relation to increased mood, happiness and decreased anxiety and rumination.
1025948	1030070	A	0.6616644263267517	But this is just another story that will come back later.
1031320	1042740	A	0.8264653086662292	So I find interesting also this quotation by Fink here in this paper it's talking about why ego dissolution may be better understood as ego expansion.
1044920	1050200	A	0.6370914578437805	And then ego dissolution comes in a later interpretation.
1051980	1053496	A	0.6332367658615112	And so I will read it.
1053598	1062300	A	0.7181183695793152	It's not the feeling of self that dissolves, but the boundary between a feeling of self and the feeling of anything else in consciousness.
1062720	1079010	A	0.7064943909645081	So here again Pink is talking about consciousness but from our perspective this quotation is pretty informing because it goes in our direction as well because he says it's not that you're losing really yourself.
1079720	1088724	A	0.7726724147796631	This experience is dependent on how you actually perceive your boundary with you and what you don't consider you.
1088762	1094120	A	0.7496324181556702	So self fading of the self other distinction ability.
1096380	1116780	A	0.5684527158737183	So here it comes predictive processing acting framework because we want to basically breach this phenomenal subjective experience to cognitive phenomena and underlying mechanistic explanation.
1118260	1122892	A	0.8968393206596375	Indeed, predictive processing activities have recently used for this purpose.
1122956	1129148	A	0.8574843406677246	Also meditation research and psychopathology research and so on.
1129334	1137552	A	0.8089592456817627	So in this presentation I will use them in an interchangeable way but following certain trends.
1137616	1153080	A	0.7270492911338806	But it doesn't have to be, it's also under debate and I will also give API purely I don't know how to say theoretical perspective on that I will not go too much technical.
1154620	1179164	A	0.8771001100540161	So briefly, this framework considers brains as predictive machine or as Friesen likes to say, consider brain as a fantastic organ which is because it's not only able to do amazing things, but also because it really generates fantasies about the world.
1179302	1202490	A	0.8302243947982788	And this is because in order to act, interact with itself and the world around, the brain constantly anticipate the current state of affairs in order to make sense of the sensorium or the stream of experiences that happens.
1204480	1221952	A	0.8861688375473022	So it possess or embody or utilizes, it depends on the commitment a generative model which is a model that keep tracks of regularity of the world and forms predictions out of it in a hierarchical way.
1222086	1239670	A	0.787213921546936	So highly rated prediction goes down to match sensory data and sensory data goes up to map to affect the predictions, to update the model.
1240600	1249124	A	0.5145548582077026	However, every prediction comes with a degree of error which sometimes is called prediction errors.
1249252	1275970	A	0.7002280950546265	So the prediction error is a discrepancy between prediction and sensory input so that a new model is generated and they say the first imperative or the only imperative of the system is actually minimizing the prediction errors so that the model can most efficiently cope and interact and act in the world.
1276580	1302200	A	0.796087920665741	However, it's not the only imperative because as I will introduce in this slide, the system has also to estimate the confidence or likelihood or precision of prediction in order to evaluate the prediction errors that are coming from the discrepancy.
1302860	1329512	A	0.542058527469635	So that the generative model has to compute in a fine way how much precision to assign to the prediction or prediction errors and I choose this image because it renders well how the distribution are set depending on the precision citation.
1329596	1337872	A	0.7467325329780579	So if you have a precise prediction error then the posterior distribution will be closer to the prediction error.
1337936	1365180	A	0.5180140137672424	Well, the imprecise prediction error have little effect on the prior, so does the posture distribution will be closer to the prior and this is very important because if the precision estimator are not weighted correctly then the system generates false inference that will not able to the system to interact efficiently and update the model efficiently.
1366400	1375680	A	0.7908388376235962	So, so far we have mostly talked about prediction error minimization by updating the model.
1375830	1391396	A	0.7879059910774231	However, the system can also active sample the world active modify the prediction error or the world in order to fit the prediction errors to the world.
1391578	1412300	A	0.7827375531196594	And this comes into play active inference that builds upon the free energy principle where it's based on the idea that living organisms maintain themselves with an optimal set of states that comes from the second low thermodynamics of schrodinger.
1414800	1427820	A	0.8861578702926636	So given that it comes into play how attention is analyzed or examined under this framework.
1428320	1455308	A	0.8291419148445129	So given that that the organism has to maintain within these optimal assessor states by maintaining an optimal balance between computation and precision optimization so wasting between prediction and prediction errors, attention comes into place as a modulation of this precision of sensory data working as a search light.
1455474	1460376	A	0.49636709690093994	So in other words, it optimizes signal to noise ratio.
1460408	1493320	A	0.5504562258720398	It's one of the way that we have to put in place this local optimization of precision estimates and this is very important why we bring into attention because meditation has a systematic and use of attention resources and we will come back into that a bit further on in this presentation.
1494780	1515390	A	0.7846992015838623	And given that we are interested in okay, we have seen the lived body, what happens to the phenomenal experience now we're interested in what happens to the corporate, what happens to believing body that can be observed by the organism during medicine states.
1516480	1539456	A	0.7460561990737915	In this we bring into play other two important concepts in active inference which is way to self regulate that underlie all embassy experience, so all subjective experience, so two ways or one way that then is also active.
1539568	1550628	A	0.850257396697998	So the first way is homeostasis which is the maintenance of required optimal state by survival and reproduction of self organizing biological systems.
1550644	1564456	A	0.48303306102752686	So for example, I cold and I use my internal resources to keep my states into optimal state so I start shivering.
1564568	1573196	A	0.6757622361183167	However, I can also put in place active modification in the world so that I'm not cold anymore.
1573388	1576556	A	0.7959035038948059	So for example, I take a blank, this is called allostasis.
1576588	1584500	A	0.7116428017616272	So it's active engagements and modification about the environment in order to maintain myself in optimal state for survival.
1585560	1598200	A	0.8819915056228638	So we can say of course, human bodies are self organizing biological system aiming at keeping these internal states within a certain viable range for survival.
1598940	1604170	A	0.8092166185379028	Now, given that we will come back again to the phenomenology of touch.
1605360	1612750	A	0.7646272778511047	I'm going to do this for the second time to then wrap up everything again.
1615200	1618850	A	0.8842344284057617	So, we have talked about fermology of the body.
1619300	1629280	A	0.763158917427063	However, we haven't underlined the importance that the touch and proximal sound has for our lip.
1631140	1642650	A	0.842645525932312	Our as Nikka and colleagues has already proposed, our proximal sense are central for our minimal sense of self.
1643500	1655336	A	0.8689063787460327	And on top of that, we bring into play the fact that different kinds of touch can convey different experience of the sense of self or sense of boundaries.
1655448	1667810	A	0.8222672939300537	So for example, imagine yourself that you are in a city of Portugal or California, you touching the whole environment with your body.
1668340	1676848	A	0.5222228169441223	You may feel that you have a sense of immersiveness or that your body boundaries are slowly a bit becoming less clear.
1677014	1690656	A	0.7596189975738525	And this experience, it's actually a bit similar to the experiences of sensory deprivation states where people are put in a salty water and they let them flow for some moments.
1690848	1702650	A	0.7406807541847229	Sensory deprivation states are not really all deprived because you have other activities in the body and movements that produce signals that you are actually aware of.
1703020	1708876	A	0.6519625782966614	However, in both these experiences, the body boundary seems to fade a little bit.
1709058	1721376	A	0.7470687627792358	However, if you're in the sea and you're swimming and then you touch the rock with your hand, you clearly will feel yourself as separated as something different from what you're actually touching, right?
1721478	1722720	A	0.6950520873069763	Sense of separation.
1724580	1735680	A	0.8925809860229492	This phenomenology can be brought into active inference through the mechanism of some of the sensory attenuation which comes from the sensory tinuation.
1736120	1743160	A	0.5654797554016113	So this process happens when the systemicates its own action.
1743980	1756556	A	0.8773865699768066	So for example, I take a glass and in this moment my rena has already created afferent copies of this action and the sensory consequences of this.
1756658	1768880	A	0.7275703549385071	So whenever I grab this glass, the sensory constant that happens to my body are slightly attenuated.
1769220	1775344	A	0.8305435180664062	And this is why we cannot tickle ourselves because the prediction errors comes at.
1775382	1783972	A	0.6641072034835815	Not surprising this has implication for our embodied experience in the world.
1784026	1788564	A	0.7857150435447693	Because we feel that we are in immediate contact with ourselves in the world.
1788602	1796404	A	0.795710027217865	And this is because our conscious experience are mediated by transparent or non perceived cognitive processes.
1796532	1802920	A	0.6837741732597351	So that the system can leave behind or disatten self related sensory processing.
1803500	1810990	A	0.8550922274589539	And these allow to allocate resources to perception and action involved in the processing of the object of interest.
1811440	1830850	A	0.5762956738471985	So for example, when LeMans confiscated this example of the cherry, when I have to take object salient for me, I'll be much more interested in picking the object and I will not really focus on my arm moving in picking that.
1831240	1839060	A	0.8534123301506042	So that the system needs to compute and maintain a fine balance between external and internal components of somatosensory attenuation.
1839400	1842630	A	0.5406874418258667	And this is very important for a sense of self as well.
1843020	1851448	A	0.8216431736946106	So we need to understand and it's not that we need, but in order for us to have a sense of self.
1851534	1856284	A	0.8259967565536499	We normally have a sense of what we are and what we are not.
1856402	1866040	A	0.8653077483177185	But for the brain as agents end up with the brain, we compute this distinction.
1866120	1873730	A	0.8306721448898315	So where the self ends and where do work begins or do I move my arm or my arm is moved by something or someone?
1874980	1884100	A	0.8745961785316467	So central attenuation plays a role in these distinctions in building multisensory bodily self representations.
1884680	1890976	A	0.853300154209137	So that the sense of the self embody is subject to the and phenomenally transferred.
1891168	1901192	A	0.5108606815338135	That means that when we act in the world and we interact, we normally disattend the way we are in the world.
1901326	1904792	A	0.7235977649688721	Because we need to be in contact, in direct contact with the world.
1904846	1919152	A	0.6411047577857971	If we always attend it to our body and ourself in the sense that we will be hyper reflexive then we will be actually will be impaired in what we normally do.
1919206	1922530	A	0.8671953678131104	And this is actually a condition that we will talk about later.
1924020	1930052	A	0.8899309039115906	So that in active images the sense of self is an ongoing inferential process centering the body.
1930106	1942948	A	0.8289012312889099	So what we propose is what is lost during selfless experience is an ordinary way to mentally model self in relation to the body and the world.
1943114	1956940	A	0.7823860049247742	So that if we think about the self as I propose here the iceberg where the narrative self is what we see but the renewal self is what we actually are composed of and it's actually larger but we are not aware of.
1957090	1966620	A	0.5955342650413513	Similarly, when we have self experience we may have also this inferential process where we think we have lost ourselves.
1969220	1982580	A	0.5570846199989319	However, we have gathered some evidence in the fact that meditation facilitate autonomic regulation involved in homostatic processes.
1983080	1989590	A	0.5565984845161438	That means for example that meditation increase the synchronization of cardiac and respiratory system.
1991320	1999140	A	0.7243435978889465	This is connected with reduced levels of blood glucose or blood pressure and heart rate variability.
1999220	2003770	A	0.762438178062439	So there is a success.
2004140	2014220	A	0.5039876103401184	Medication helps to successfully self regulate the body especially in comparison to stress that actually does the opposite.
2016560	2024320	A	0.6213014125823975	And on top of that, meditation help us to attune us to our physiological interceptive awareness.
2024900	2050970	A	0.6300807595252991	And it does it so they say, by enhancing the processing of extraceptive interceptive stimuli which doesn't have to be understanded as a maladaptive increased body awareness, but rather an adaptive body awareness which is a distinction that we can come back later if people are interested or they ask about.
2054480	2061032	A	0.6915440559387207	These evidence are also in line with evidence of meditation that promotes self regulation of pain and pain and pleasantness.
2061096	2086950	A	0.6476710438728333	So three day attentional training, the meditation allow you're actually able to self regulate the pain and not really like the sensation of the pain because actually it gets very fewer but the automatic behavioral patterns that comes in association with the pain.
2087480	2094170	A	0.8515828251838684	So there is a lot of also self regulation on emotions and so on.
2095420	2110460	A	0.8147057294845581	So the body does not literally disappear actually it stays at the very center as I propose here at the center as we propose it in the paper and I propose it through this image at the center of a cycling.
2111520	2124780	A	0.7691674828529358	So self regulatory processes allow the subjective experience to lose oneself so that the sense of the body remains present in the background.
2124940	2140820	A	0.6377612948417664	And this for example, it's very clear from this report from a person undergoing this kind of experience that they say that there remains a sense that there is a body without any experience of a sense of boundary.
2144700	2160860	A	0.8961565494537354	So this is not very last slide but we come to our wrap up of our claim attenuating the self and limiting the body which is also the title of our paper.
2160930	2176960	A	0.8426826000213623	So, starting from the fact that all medicine practices across the tradition require systematic and carefully fully crafted body preparation to enter this deep method selfless state.
2177110	2188880	A	0.6832010746002197	So it doesn't happen that all of a sudden you just have a selfless state which actually may happen more similarly with psychedelic.
2188960	2201960	A	0.8565942049026489	But with meditation you need to pass through gradually a many different state or many different level of concentration.
2203820	2216088	A	0.7910379767417908	That happens when you have around a predictable environment and you do so by building prior expectation.
2216264	2219980	A	0.8601940274238586	So you have to keep your body in a certain position of posture.
2220060	2229904	A	0.8014756441116333	As you say in this image, the person is seated with a very straight, not very, but a straight back relaxed.
2229952	2233670	A	0.6963526606559753	This is very important meditation, banded legs and so on.
2234360	2249400	A	0.6814624667167664	And then you need at least in the most part of your practice, you need safe predictable environments with temperature that enables you to maintain your homostatic processes.
2250860	2256120	A	0.8105589747428894	So all these conditions are necessary for your successful homostatic self regulation.
2257180	2280240	A	0.8175309300422668	In this sense when parts of preparation to enter then after the state of confrontation, the meditator can let go and leave behind self related processes and process the body transported or it can attenuate them attenuate the body can be attenuated.
2281620	2294790	A	0.8388816714286804	So our claim is that a transfer essential self and body may underline the phenomenology of losing oneself and blurring body boundaries as reported during meditative states.
2297820	2306970	A	0.8311262726783752	So our conclusion is that we have proposed a shift in focus on homostatic body self regulation in examining deep meditative states.
2308140	2314750	A	0.5672141909599304	The experience of having a body living self organism biological system is never lost in this process.
2315280	2323200	A	0.7470241189002991	Rather it stay transferred at its very center, self attenuated yet very much present and hands alive.
2323780	2330480	A	0.8048401474952698	So that the self model is attenuated to become transparent and hands processed in the background.
2331720	2335860	A	0.8557021021842957	Now giving this conclusion now I'm going to present related project.
2336010	2342068	A	0.8411710858345032	The first one is still on the theoretical side.
2342234	2346616	A	0.7023276090621948	So we are in the realm of active inference model in meditation research.
2346798	2375330	A	0.8861462473869324	There is a radio literature about that that have studied different kinds of meditation techniques like focused attention, open monitoring, nondual awareness and they all study from Laconin in 2023 or Laconin and Lactar in 2021.
2376900	2399512	A	0.7114449739456177	They have for example showed that these attention techniques profoundly alter typical mental experiences and for example focus meditation is meditation that engage attention on one specific object experience.
2399646	2425792	A	0.7682491540908813	For example the breath and in active inference term it means that precision is estimated one sensory input which means that it reduce the impact of the other thoughts and parallel processes that are going on or often open monitoring meditation is the engaging of attention to one's experience as a whole.
2425846	2431090	A	0.8640206456184387	So the whole stream of experience without selecting anything in particular.
2431540	2443936	A	0.8551585674285889	So that in an activatory terms it has been described as assigning equal precision to all these experiencing promoting non reactive sensing.
2443968	2451290	A	0.5976241230964661	And this is connected also why medicine are good in self regulated regulate pain.
2453100	2465500	A	0.6471849083900452	So we will also build our model on self modeling based on the previous literature which is integration.
2467600	2490660	A	0.7430045008659363	And then going experimental we want to bring into the table application of what we're researching and potential benefit may be for cases of people or individual that suffer from disrupted body awareness or disrupted self awareness.
2491000	2501880	A	0.8669998645782471	And there is a relatively recent condition that has been studied that is depersonalization.
2502780	2533140	A	0.5282025933265686	So depersonization is the disruption of both body and self awareness and it's a very heterogeneous condition, there is a lot of different dimensions that occurs but generally it's connected with feelings of heaviness disconnection feeling the body as an object, rather they're a transfer and medium of experience which simply is called disembodiment.
2533960	2542580	A	0.8435885906219482	It is linked with difficulties in concentration and attention, often comorbid with depression, rumination and anxiety.
2543000	2552760	A	0.6216839551925659	And recently Chow Nuka and colleagues has also proposed AIDS characterized by failures in attenuating somatosentry signals.
2553980	2571680	A	0.9126663208007812	So based on what we have previously said and based on how this condition affects large number of population, we want to test certain hypotheses.
2572580	2591860	A	0.7770637273788452	So the first one would be that higher somasocentric attenuation Correlate with more feeling of aliveness and wide openness in experienced meditators and rather lowest somascentric attenuation Correlate with feelings of unrealness thatness in people experience deeper solidation.
2593420	2604424	A	0.8948320746421814	And on the other hand, severe homostatic dysregulation of bodily states during deep meditative states may lead to negative emotional outcomes and Abernant self experience.
2604622	2626050	A	0.6868047714233398	This comes from to the fact that depression and meditation can both create stressing negative outcomes and it's interesting to see how this happened and what are the commonalities and differences in that.
2626980	2641460	A	0.6032341718673706	And also we have dealt in the realm of spatial temporal perception which is connected also with mood disorders or like depression and anxiety and also with depersonalization.
2642520	2655792	A	0.6903941631317139	However, in depersonalization there is no specific items in the questionnaire that is usually used for measuring which is the Cambridge Depressionization scale.
2655876	2668780	A	0.8391556739807129	So we want to test this as well and we want to test it in people reporting selfless and disembodied experience so both pathological and non pathological conditions.
2670180	2690564	A	0.9043063521385193	So part of this hypothesis we are really going through this is our team coming from Humboldt University where I come from as well Simon Wendelman, but also University College London with Ines and Joseph first study is as I said about.
2690602	2691600	A	0.8148172497749329	Time perspective.
2691680	2707880	A	0.5746159553527832	So we want to analyze how people with high traits of depression correlate with dimension of the time perspective so they are more future oriented or more negative oriented.
2707960	2727420	A	0.5612678527832031	Our hypothesis that they're more negative past oriented so they're stuck in a very long present moment, but also they're the tendency of ruminating.
2727500	2730560	A	0.7603371739387512	So always going to past negative memories.
2732920	2750424	A	0.9026183485984802	Since this is titled Last in Dark Times the Effect of the Personalization Experience in on Time Perspective And these we are already in the analysis of the data but it's an ongoing steel study.
2750622	2753930	A	0.908764123916626	So we have preliminary data on this.
2755340	2769308	A	0.7323302626609802	While studies too we are in the recruitment phases but we are almost there and encompass the high traits of people individual into high traits of depression and meditators.
2769484	2780444	A	0.8958925008773804	I want to see through a set of questionnaires and a behavioral task how they may differ in the sense of self, body and motion.
2780492	2791430	A	0.6300193667411804	Of course, they are very wide and concepts so there is always room for feedback and replications and so on.
2795240	2815390	A	0.913615882396698	We have selected these tasks, the embody tasks adopted from new menma where individual participants has to color parts of the body in relation to activation that they feel by reading certain emotional story.
2816000	2825820	A	0.7271321415901184	So these stories are supposed to validate it to elicit certain emotions in the body and then people colors parts of the body.
2825890	2832820	A	0.8804616332054138	And then we will see how people with hydrates and the visualization may say will differ in this.
2832890	2845400	A	0.9057651162147522	And we will also compare with other questionnaires that we have put this and potential title is emotional Body Maps of Thought Detachment, Interpersonalization and Meditation.
2845820	2850344	A	0.9569972157478333	And with this I thank you all and that's it.
2850462	2852708	A	0.6092597246170044	We are open for discussion.
2852804	2853690	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
2858480	2859324	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
2859522	2860444	B	0.9599630236625671	Thank you very much.
2860482	2862904	A	0.6823930144309998	Valeria, you are muted.
2862952	2863740	C	0.667864203453064	Donna.
2864400	2864876	D	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
2864898	2865740	B	0.6035107970237732	Valeria.
2866160	2866910	B	0.7671424746513367	Great.
2867680	2872720	B	0.9534658789634705	Well, very fascinating presentation.
2873140	2877212	B	0.8862791061401367	Perhaps Anna first and then our other colleagues who have joined.
2877276	2885990	B	0.9497033357620239	Would be awesome to hear your path to be here on this work and any reflection or questions you have on it.
2890020	2891360	C	0.8790724873542786	Is it my turn?
2891510	2891872	B	0.4753468334674835	Sure.
2891926	2892720	C	0.5952695608139038	Did I miss?
2892870	2893570	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2895380	2900790	C	0.5610132813453674	So obviously I don't have many questions because it's like we wrote this together.
2902680	2948604	C	0.5058069825172424	But I think what I would like just to add not really a question is I really like to see so for instance like in ideal world would be nice to get all the traditions of the meditative experiences and how they relate to the body and make a very precise prediction on what exactly they will kind of predict in terms of certain sensory experiences and how this can be interpreted through different theoretical lenses.
2948652	2972812	C	0.6331658363342285	I think that could be really interesting because I think one of the problems, the challenges that we have right now is that we have so many concepts, so many approaches and kind of, like, scattered all over the map, and I think would be really nice to narrow down, because, as you said, Daniel so everybody knows what meditation is.
2972946	2983724	C	0.7313623428344727	Everybody knows at least one person that meditates in life and everything, but it's really unclear what exactly we are after and why.
2983762	2992172	C	0.487712025642395	In certain cases, this is kind of like beneficial, and in other cases, basically it has negative consequences.
2992236	2998960	C	0.7891658544540405	And this is why precisely we are doing this project on depersonalization and meditation.
2999120	3007190	C	0.5225207805633545	And I can share with you informally, Scoop, but data is here, so we kind of like can share with.
3007560	3015092	C	0.6178070306777954	So what we did in this project, basically we took people with typical controls that don't have depersonalization and never meditated.
3015156	3015384	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3015422	3018216	C	0.6423407793045044	So it's kind of like, yeah, never did that.
3018318	3027160	C	0.8660998344421387	And then we took people that meditated, and then we looked at whether they have kind of like high or low traits of depersonization.
3027240	3031240	C	0.6499007940292358	And then we took people with depersonization that never meditate.
3031320	3031950	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
3034240	3042640	C	0.8316320776939392	So we have this inclusion and exclusion criteria and yeah, it's really interesting to find what our findings is.
3042710	3053104	C	0.73451828956604	It's really difficult to find people that have experience and low depersonalization skills, low depersonization traits.
3053152	3053652	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
3053786	3057760	C	0.6274110078811646	So most of them, they actually have high depersonalization.
3057840	3064264	C	0.7151615023612976	But then it's interesting to see how that contrasts with the people that have depersonalization and no vegetation experience.
3064382	3065050	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
3065900	3073850	C	0.7858002781867981	So that's something I would like to carry on to reach the community.
3076700	3079016	C	0.7779548168182373	That's something we'll definitely carry on with.
3079118	3086640	C	0.8882309794425964	Valerian the next steps and also with some people that I have here in the chat, julia and Simone.
3087220	3090080	C	0.7880812287330627	So Simone will going to work with us on also.
3090150	3097504	C	0.8419656157493591	Somatosensory attenuation through different have some without scooping.
3097552	3101190	C	0.9724631309509277	We have also some very interesting results coming up.
3101720	3105408	C	0.8808779716491699	We just finished data collection on intentional binding and depersonization.
3105504	3108420	C	0.8130902051925659	So related to the sense of agency.
3110120	3114104	C	0.653163492679596	That's all for me for now.
3114142	3124780	C	0.5251573324203491	We're kind of like in between because Valerie represented very well, like the theory part and the studies are literally just getting hot from the oven now.
3124850	3130284	C	0.5437908172607422	And we hope that in September it's like we're going to get them out.
3130402	3135920	C	0.9768661856651306	Yeah, but the data is in the box, so that's very exciting and yeah, we have the results.
3137860	3140368	C	0.9849737882614136	Thank you, Danielle, again for this platform.
3140454	3141104	C	0.9820848107337952	It's really nice.
3141142	3152228	C	0.8846744894981384	And as I said, I really hope that after this discussion, we'll have more opportunities to change, exchange and discuss.
3152314	3162504	C	0.8348001837730408	We also plan to organize something around alteration of self consciousness across various conditions and also decarbonization in Lisbon next year.
3162542	3168948	C	0.8191070556640625	So maybe you can cross the pond and check for yourself that we have a nice airport in Lisbon.
3169044	3169690	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3171600	3171964	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
3172002	3175608	B	0.918231725692749	Well, good to get the appetizer before the entree.
3175704	3194770	B	0.96059650182724	So that's very awesome about just how much theory and even unconventional scientific theory, like world knowledge traditions come into play and then what it looks like to take that experimental step to make it scientific is definitely what I saw in the talk.
3195540	3200630	B	0.9106430411338806	Julia or Simone, do you want to give any reflection or any thoughts or questions?
3201240	3201990	D	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3202520	3203476	D	0.8097810745239258	Can you hear me?
3203578	3204230	B	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3205000	3207990	D	0.7735361456871033	I actually have three questions I noted down.
3209080	3220650	D	0.7104967832565308	I think the first one because it's just for me personally, I'm curious about that is that those deep meditative selfless states I think that can also be reached while doing yoga, right?
3221260	3223784	D	0.6449523568153381	Basically the opposite of sitting still.
3223822	3226520	D	0.6996194124221802	It's like a sort of repetitive movement actually.
3226670	3233192	D	0.763849139213562	So I'm wondering do those movements have to be perfectly predictable in order to be attenuated and then reaching the same state?
3233246	3240160	D	0.8331205248832703	Or is that like a different different concept or how do you put that in your framework?
3244500	3251296	A	0.8531484007835388	I think here you brought mainly two topics.
3251408	3258980	A	0.8774272203445435	One is, is it possible to reach deep matter states also not sitting in a still position?
3259050	3260490	A	0.6056202054023743	And the answer is yes.
3263820	3266216	A	0.6213877201080322	However, there is not so much research on that.
3266318	3282120	A	0.6822840571403503	So I can talk about anecdotal knowledge, but I did not read so much about walking meditation effect, usually walking meditation or of course you talk about yoga.
3282200	3291520	A	0.8838437795639038	I know, but that's what I would say, that walking meditation is used as a complementary practice through the sitting.
3292260	3299140	A	0.5602223873138428	So I would say it's hard to reach deep meditative states only by walking meditation.
3302200	3306176	A	0.5497074127197266	In regarding to yoga, also yoga means unity.
3306368	3319480	A	0.8982753157615662	So what we think about yoga now, we think about movement, but it's always accompanied by reaching state of concentration through meditation.
3320540	3325980	A	0.7174904346466064	So you cannot have yoga without meditation, otherwise you'll be stretching or pilates.
3326720	3336560	A	0.7300437092781067	But second topic is that can it happen when you don't have prediction of movement?
3337300	3338096	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3338278	3342096	D	0.6784412860870361	No, I meant like because in yoga at least I don't really do yoga, right?
3342118	3350096	D	0.8990586996078491	But I can imagine that when people reach those states doing yoga, then they kind of do it almost like in a trance type of way.
3350118	3354704	D	0.5143271684646606	They're always doing the same movement over and over and over again so that they don't have to attend to those movements.
3354752	3356532	D	0.5459858775138855	But it's just like an automatic process.
3356586	3360950	D	0.8735935688018799	I was wondering if that also can I jump in?
3361880	3364200	C	0.6383523344993591	Actually, this is precisely the opposite.
3364620	3369156	C	0.5975699424743652	What Valerie was saying is so Valerie was saying this is precisely the opposite.
3369188	3372360	C	0.8164022564888	You want to reach through yoga just like the opposite of automatic.
3372800	3379292	C	0.7750889658927917	So basically when you do this movements, you need to be united with yourself doing it.
3379346	3394492	C	0.6388594508171082	So you really need to I'm doing yoga so the past ten years and precisely this is like they're trying to tell us don't do it on automatic.
3394556	3399652	C	0.849440336227417	Because it's like when you have your thinking happening there and your body is doing some stuff there, right.
3399786	3403808	C	0.8646024465560913	You need to basically be presence in every single type of moon.
3403824	3410470	C	0.7743488550186157	So you have like fully, fully presence if you do it automatically, that's more like gymnastic or something.
3411720	3413152	C	0.6864383816719055	But it's interesting.
3413306	3433950	C	0.657956063747406	So your point is really interesting because then would be really nice to have a control condition where we have people doing like movement, meditation and yoga and then contrast with the phenomena of some other sense retenuation and whether they have what type of embodiment and disembodiment and gentivity experiences they have.
3436960	3440384	D	0.5652814507484436	Okay, I don't know exactly what I was trying to get it.
3440502	3447888	D	0.8381851315498352	But I think it was also more related to because you said that when meditating you have to sort of let yourself letting go.
3448054	3448864	D	0.778684139251709	Letting go, exactly.
3448902	3452660	D	0.550024151802063	And the idea is that everything has to be perfectly sort of predictable, right?
3452730	3454148	D	0.8018485903739929	That's the idea behind it.
3454234	3466356	D	0.8597722053527832	So then I'm thinking so within yoga, don't you have to do the exact same movements in order for it to be predictable, in order for you to let go and not overatten to the environment?
3466468	3467690	D	0.7228710055351257	Does that make sense?
3470460	3495984	A	0.794474184513092	I thought when we both and Simon were speaking I think on one side you, Simon, maybe you're referring to the implicit procedural knowledge that you can acquire through yoga and you, Ana, are talking about doing things without being aware, which is also automatic and left.
3496102	3506004	A	0.7558904886245728	And you both are right, I think in this because on one Anna, you would say like if you do yoga, you learn how to do yoga, right?
3506122	3521256	A	0.8288353681564331	So you learn how to move yourself in this way so that when you do a certain position that you have to arrange your body and for arrange your dirty, you always have to keep monitoring yourself.
3521358	3529996	A	0.9040124416351318	So there is a continuous going back to your body, keeping track of your body and continue to monitor yourself.
3530178	3538736	A	0.7410842180252075	But in this way because you have learned to do this going back and being aware on yourself.
3538838	3551364	A	0.8135794401168823	And this comes also when you do your movement, you have learned that certain posture are made in a certain way so that it becomes more or less predictable actually what you're going to do.
3551482	3551812	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
3551866	3567384	A	0.6854462027549744	But it doesn't mean that you don't have to be awareness and actually there is a trick ribbon here because you're very attentive with what's going on but at the same time the more you're attentive, the more somatosensory attenuation may happen.
3567502	3572510	A	0.8715866208076477	And actually it's what we are trying to argue in our active inference model.
3573600	3579660	A	0.664010226726532	The more predictable it gets, the more it gets attenuated, but doesn't mean that you're not aware.
3582640	3586828	A	0.9490835666656494	Thank you for this input because it helps us elaborate this.
3586914	3594240	D	0.9512084126472473	I think it's super interesting because it's like when you look at people that climb or surf or whatever, any type of sports, right?
3594310	3602004	D	0.6552039980888367	In the beginning, in order to learn the skill, you have to put a lot of attention to the individual movements but then later on, in order to actually be good at it, you have to take the attention away.
3602122	3612024	D	0.8756025433540344	And then in those moments is when the people report that they're actually feeling sort of selfless states and these flow is when the movements are internalized, so to speak.
3612142	3613944	D	0.9814318418502808	I think that's super interesting.
3614142	3616024	D	0.8001949191093445	Can I just shoot the other two questions I had?
3616062	3619544	D	0.8690217733383179	They're sort of different or should we go to Julia first?
3619742	3621160	A	0.7917411923408508	Maybe it's Julia.
3624460	3625384	E	0.6114868521690369	Hi, sorry.
3625502	3630190	E	0.9069141745567322	Yeah, sorry for the lighting and sorry because I'm in the lab, so it's probably not the best position.
3630640	3631116	C	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
3631138	3639584	E	0.9881227612495422	Varia it was very interesting and I'm really looking forward to look at the results you have in your study.
3639782	3650130	E	0.9745791554450989	Especially since as Anna mentioned, we had something interesting with the international binding and depersonalization and yeah, kind of happy about that.
3651080	3655044	E	0.7056540846824646	I'm really sorry because I listened kind of doing something else.
3655082	3658420	E	0.6925555467605591	Unfortunately in the lab I was busy while you were talking.
3658570	3660310	E	0.9003554582595825	But I kind of like this idea.
3661240	3661700	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3661770	3667892	E	0.7467837929725647	Does the self is attenuated or not or increasing and kind of goes back to just Simon.
3667956	3670920	E	0.8922411799430847	The last comment from Simon about expertise.
3672460	3678936	E	0.8361780047416687	I think in term of motor interaction there is some literal jobability expert.
3678968	3687440	E	0.7510651350021362	I was trying to Google that, but I attended a workshop last year, and I think it was about once you're an expert.
3688900	3700790	E	0.5962963700294495	At the beginning, you have this kind of flexible you have a better understanding consciousness, and then at the end, you kind of learn to let it go, to ride the flow of the motion, kind of.
3701880	3703572	E	0.6463459730148315	And I think it's probably the same.
3703626	3714890	E	0.7028964757919312	I don't know about attention in meditation is that you have to maybe more like not focus attentional state but more like open.
3716220	3719252	E	0.5473423600196838	Sorry, I forgot the name of the meditation type of meditation.
3719316	3721668	A	0.7775278687477112	But open meditation, open monitoring.
3721844	3722810	A	0.5121256113052368	Yeah, exactly.
3723340	3724328	E	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
3724494	3733212	E	0.5154381394386292	So it would be interesting and I suggested to see what type of meditation maybe changed the sense of the self.
3733266	3738080	E	0.8134147524833679	Maybe at the beginning it's more acute because you really scrutinize your sensation.
3739380	3740320	E	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
3740470	3742610	E	0.8881992101669312	This is something that you plan to do, right?
3745300	3763560	A	0.8503000736236572	Should I go or do you want to go on the the first question was there is a body of evidence that actually say that in expert meditators tension start decreasing.
3764620	3769700	A	0.6665362119674683	But there is also because you allocate less and less attention.
3769860	3781260	A	0.5365938544273376	But I would be careful with that with this because they say there is decreased activity in anterior singleet cortex.
3782560	3789890	A	0.7509726285934448	So they make inference about it as meditators as well.
3790500	3807920	A	0.473016619682312	And having to know other people that are more experienced than me, they would never say we lose our attention to that because our experience is so rich of sensory signals and related thought process that you cannot afford to not be attentive.
3808080	3811956	A	0.7513713836669922	However, we can bring into the plate different kinds of attention.
3812068	3821048	A	0.862593948841095	As you said, there is focused attention or there's an attention that requires more explicit thought about it.
3821134	3828616	A	0.7229759693145752	So more explicit kind of way to focus on things and there is more like a bare attention.
3828728	3844284	A	0.6029861569404602	So when you focus on the whole experience and you let it go with a non judgmental attitude and more open attitude and it's actually these attitudes, they're very stressed in meditation techniques, that's why they're a bit underlooked.
3844332	3853552	A	0.6641687750816345	And in research I feel because it's a lot about how we use attention but not the attention but not how we use intention.
3853696	3870650	A	0.6463654637336731	So the attitude of the meditator has to be very open and very non judgmental and these reduce the nonreactive senses for example and reduce the ability to self regulate your experience.
3873280	3874860	A	0.8114227056503296	Partially answered.
3876160	3900876	E	0.5541592836380005	Yeah, I kind of like the idea that you link that with attention and just I think maybe it would be interesting to look at different type of attention because maybe there is a difference between I don't know, different type of meditation may develop different type of maybe the open meditation is more prone.
3900908	3907152	E	0.6588647961616516	I don't know because you mentioned the insula cortex and to me it's more associated with certain type of attention.
3907216	3916616	E	0.6940237879753113	Like more like maybe more prone for feedback or negativity or these kind of error monitoring process.
3916798	3919092	E	0.5033220648765564	So it's not like your attention, you lose your attention.
3919156	3926044	E	0.5653873682022095	It's just it's more like in the background and then when there is a mistake or something it kind of pops up more quickly.
3926162	3926876	E	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
3926978	3932312	E	0.6601564288139343	And you may have more frontal or sustain attention.
3932376	3932716	E	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
3932738	3934824	E	0.6473154425621033	I mean I'm not a specialist of attention at all.
3934882	3937440	E	0.7799709439277649	So please take that with a grain of salt.
3937940	3938304	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3938342	3948924	E	0.5092353820800781	I was wondering if this is something, I don't know obviously because you're not planning to do any EEG or neurophysiological measurement.
3948972	3949570	A	0.5664745569229126	Right.
3950340	3954148	E	0.8868839740753174	So this is maybe like a follow up study that would be interesting.
3954314	3959180	C	0.8102390766143799	Not yet, but in the pipeline.
3959280	3959688	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3959774	3960264	C	0.584351658821106	Okay.
3960382	3975176	C	0.7430963516235352	What we really want with Valeria is and other collaborators is to basically push against this idea that you can have selfless experiences.
3975288	3980220	C	0.5157430171966553	I know it's controversial and many people talk about oh, selfless experience blah.
3981760	3991808	C	0.7110015749931335	So basically we want to say radically speaking okay, so that works if you bite the bullet and you're mind body dualist and somehow consider that actually the body kind of like disappears in the process.
3991894	4019956	C	0.7578727006912231	But if you're not mind body dualist then you need to basically put the body into equation and realize that actually what allows the mind to disappear is the fact into the pureness of the experience is the fact that the impure body is kind of like put in a stable condition in such a way that basically you can afford to leave it in the background and to have this type of experience arising.
4020068	4027848	C	0.6505993008613586	But without that in place you can't really afford to go through this selfless experiences.
4027944	4049940	C	0.5121104717254639	And this is why we want to be provocative in the titles that well actually maybe the experience of selfless experiences actually comes necessarily as two sign of the same coin of this experience of having an unlimited body that actually expands through the world.
4050010	4051044	C	0.7333941459655762	But the body is there.
4051082	4068504	C	0.744083821773529	I mean the thing, the entity that has the experience of no experience is that a body that kind of is self regulated in a certain way like the homeostasis is put at like a set point.
4068622	4081356	C	0.7232564687728882	And when you're using this metaphor of think of a cyclone, right, moving cyclone so you have the steel eye of the cyclone in the middle doesn't mean that actually it's not there.
4081458	4084440	C	0.5597781538963318	It's just like it's around everything.
4084610	4088320	C	0.8363134860992432	And because we are self organizing biological systems.
4091220	4095280	C	0.7603991031646729	This animal, this thing needs to keep track of this internal bodily states.
4095350	4100390	C	0.5625700354576111	And a successful system does this all the time.
4100920	4107364	C	0.8356425762176514	All the time, literally from second one, when we basically get from one cell to the self.
4107402	4115424	C	0.9527168273925781	So this is some sort of fascinating self organization that is happening on the cellular level already and it needs to be.
4115562	4117752	C	0.6570407152175903	And death is basically this is what is happening.
4117806	4122600	C	0.7737224698066711	It's like disintegration of this self organization.
4123200	4127132	C	0.5113438963890076	But clearly that's not what is happening on meditation, right?
4127186	4130104	C	0.5510367751121521	Because hopefully you don't die when you meditate.
4130232	4131324	C	0.7184202075004578	In that sense.
4131442	4142060	C	0.7379791736602783	There is disintegration of a certain way to experience yourself in relation to the body in the world, but clearly there's something that stays there and needs to stay there for you to have those experiences.
4142140	4146012	C	0.6469250917434692	So that's a bit of controversial, radical claim that we like to defend.
4146076	4150390	C	0.831825852394104	And yeah, we already had this discussion with several people.
4150760	4158704	C	0.7924236059188843	For instance, like Valerie and I, we went to Enlightenment, this workshop on phrenology neurocompetition.
4158752	4163472	C	0.7257686257362366	We met there with people like Thomas Betziger and everything and obviously they have a different opinion.
4163536	4182750	C	0.818751871585846	So we kind of, like, have a lively discussion about why we think it's like, what does it mean to actually lose yourself and what is the self and what is a pure experience and why we basically need whether we're like it or not, the connection with the impure body to make sure that you can have, at a certain point, a pure experience.
4183600	4187024	C	0.6595110297203064	But then again, this is something that just speculation at the theory level.
4187062	4200790	C	0.8490991592407227	And this is why I have this brilliant team here that we can do some studies and actually measure stuff, put the finger on it, put the number and see what we get.
4203160	4207380	B	0.9753446578979492	These are awesome points and there's so many ways it could go.
4207450	4210740	B	0.8972585797309875	I'll read a question from the live chat.
4210900	4223688	B	0.8758928775787354	So G Pagnani wrote, the notion of increased Somatosensory transparency in experienced meditators associated with increased liveliness of the experience is intriguing.
4223864	4236892	B	0.8604717254638672	Can you say something about which levels in the hierarchical structure of the internal model are more likely to be affected by the meditative attentional task in terms of precision deployment?
4237036	4248260	B	0.7543470859527588	Do you think the attenuation of Somatosensory prediction error concerns more intermediate levels in a way increase meta awareness rather than sheer sensory attention?
4250520	4251924	C	0.6627545952796936	I can take this one.
4252042	4257796	C	0.7364968657493591	So I can give a fuzz go and then you can go.
4257978	4260680	A	0.7128303647041321	No, I just wanted to ask rather than ensuring.
4263100	4266040	B	0.6049532890319824	Rather than sheer sensory attention.
4267580	4269290	A	0.6792023181915283	Yeah, you can go on now, please.
4272320	4287344	C	0.6845535635948181	Yeah, so this is something I'm trying to develop this idea right now with a PhD student of mine, Libetise, basically.
4287542	4297936	C	0.8712120652198792	And this is why it's connected with the question that you ask, you'll see, is that your platform is active inference, right?
4297958	4309444	C	0.7332688570022583	And so people kind of know lately kind of realize, wait a minute, actually we are active and we need to explain action in the world and everything kind of like comes late, right?
4309482	4317252	C	0.8892387747764587	But if you look going back to the animal, basically the action and the movement is there from the very beginning.
4317316	4328940	C	0.65217125415802	So this means that this is why it's so important to basically relate the self organization, self awareness, self perception necessarily related with movement.
4329680	4334732	C	0.611224353313446	So movement an action is not something that you add on the top of this, right?
4334786	4337064	C	0.74971604347229	Like some of intention.
4337192	4342352	C	0.8400660157203674	So you can have an intention, but basically the first movements are kind of like automatic and need to be there, right?
4342406	4348564	C	0.7830723524093628	And basically our body moves all the time because we breathe all the time and our heart beats all the time.
4348682	4356372	C	0.7143211364746094	So this means that for me, this type of attenuation is happening at the sensory level because that's the basic one.
4356426	4359832	C	0.7583639621734619	So can you have sensory stuff without metacognitive stuff?
4359886	4360344	C	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
4360462	4362872	C	0.7493085265159607	Can you have metacognitive stuff without sensory stuff?
4362926	4363288	E	0.4936186671257019	No.
4363374	4383564	C	0.6115027666091919	So it's like what is basic that's the first things needs to be attenuated and then there has to be a balance between metacognitive and sensory attenuation because this is precisely what I think it is happening in Depersonalization because if you focus too much, right?
4383602	4398770	C	0.7793281078338623	So you lose the balance between then it's kind of like this type of you cannot afford to self forget yourself.
4399300	4405350	C	0.777333676815033	And then it's kind of like the self stands in the way and that gets you even more disconnected, so to speak.
4406520	4429676	C	0.8177152276039124	So this is why I think it's important to contrast different type of meditative experiences and meditative practices to see which one of them actually has more focus on what you do with metacognitive, metawareness awareness of awareness and which one are actually involving more like sensory movement, for instance, let's say.
4429698	4433496	C	0.8239104747772217	Yeah, so that's something that needs to be empirically tested.
4433528	4447120	C	0.8779147267341614	But I would speculate and then obviously we can put it at test, either by doing a simulation or actually collecting data to see how that plays into this distinction.
4451840	4455324	C	0.6978086233139038	I think Simon wants to say something, but I'm not the moderator.
4455372	4456800	C	0.7316133379936218	So Daniel, you decide.
4457540	4457856	D	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4457878	4459090	B	0.7166335582733154	Valeria first.
4463140	4464480	A	0.8898884057998657	Thank you, Anna.
4466840	4470100	A	0.5021546483039856	I don't have so much more to say because I agree with her.
4470170	4488408	A	0.6590948700904846	But I thought when Daniel you were reading the question for me the answer was more or less clear in the sense that as I say, the Somatosens continuation happens the very low level predictions.
4488584	4517168	A	0.83718341588974	So in a very pre reflective self consciousness, so that the person was asking in the meditation techniques, when you put the attention on, for example, your bodily signals there, you have a top down modulation of this, of precision wasting, but the top down modulation is on low level predictions.
4517344	4523024	A	0.7429876327514648	So you're not putting top down on what you think about your body is you're actually doing the opposite.
4523072	4535050	A	0.706061065196991	You're trying to forget about your previous expectations about the body because you're trying to have this non judgmental awareness about what's going on in your experience.
4535680	4545180	A	0.7502663731575012	And then with this, let's say, less biased way to attend your body.
4545330	4556956	A	0.8040189743041992	You start piercing and perceiving bodily sensations in your body or other kind of experiences.
4557068	4574020	A	0.5488650798797607	So I would say this increasing precision on somatosensory signals happens at the low level of the Yerarchy that then attenuates the sensory consequences of the posterior.
4575960	4587300	A	0.6029478907585144	And the meta awareness comes when you learn, I think, when you start having increased body awareness.
4587460	4589356	A	0.5974631905555725	So you make more experience.
4589458	4602448	A	0.8254735469818115	I think then you start developing meta awareness about how your body is actually about higher representation of the body of your body.
4602534	4609308	A	0.545078456401825	But in the moment when this happens, I think it really happens at the low level, subpersonal beliefs.
4609404	4622740	A	0.8053539395332336	And then later on, on the longer time scales, then it starts becoming more abstract and ingrained at the personal level of your beliefs.
4623480	4624768	A	0.7032950520515442	That's how I say it.
4624794	4631576	A	0.7287179827690125	But of course, if Simon has something to do with it, it's really I.
4631598	4632660	D	0.5407618880271912	Didn'T I didn't want to comment.
4632740	4634408	D	0.7055279016494751	I just selfishly raised my hand to.
4634414	4639196	A	0.7099919319152832	Ask another question or Daniel, I don't know if you have an opinion on that.
4639218	4640910	A	0.9748679399490356	I'm happy to hear it as well.
4642480	4666950	B	0.6250080466270447	Well, certainly resonated with this comparative approach to studying the diversity of methods and protocols we already have for mind and body and attention, broadening the scope and just kind of putting darts in the space of what practices do people engage their mind and body in?
4667320	4674608	B	0.8822854161262512	And then, how can that territory be explored with also a variety of theoretical models?
4674784	4683400	B	0.9133022427558899	And how does that relationship connect to the kinds of empirical work that we might do in a brain scanner or with other kinds of measuring?
4684300	4705356	B	0.763914167881012	And I think one thing I want to explore more is in a hierarchical nested cognitive model, which we often speak of ourselves and other types of sophisticated entities as where's our awareness?
4705468	4708240	B	0.496658056974411	Where's awareness in that picture?
4712520	4725972	B	0.8880690336227417	And also to Simone's question about when we're moving, but we're expecting what we're moving, then how does the exteriorceptive flow?
4726116	4727400	B	0.8077991604804993	Like the visual field?
4727470	4743084	B	0.6549941301345825	You might be very familiar with walking, and so you might be able to proprioceptively kind of zero out on your walking, but there's this exteriorceptive flow of novelty in the world.
4743282	4754080	B	0.8915805816650391	So I think that how and then connect it back to the comparative and staring at a candle or a blank screen or darkness and all these different methods.
4758500	4762676	B	0.716404139995575	There's a lot that these questions bring up.
4762858	4763636	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4763818	4764736	C	0.8880262970924377	Thank you, Daniel.
4764768	4775936	C	0.7826040983200073	So I have something to add to that because I think it's super know, my background is like, embodied cognition and activists and everything.
4775978	4785204	C	0.633741021156311	And for me, it's really not at all surprising the fact that many of these techniques have been developed by people that kind of, like, lived in closed communities.
4785332	4785768	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4785854	4793048	C	0.8423298597335815	So it's like you have a space where people can meditate walking.
4793144	4793772	C	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
4793826	4795144	C	0.6555130481719971	And then they have this ritual.
4795192	4797630	C	0.8141458034515381	They wake up at this time and they do this thing.
4798080	4800732	C	0.7962790131568909	So you put yourself in yeah, it's a ritual.
4800796	4801024	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4801062	4803212	C	0.6327117681503296	Like all the rituals.
4803276	4806204	C	0.7175981998443604	So this means, as I said, it's like high predictability.
4806332	4807010	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4808340	4811460	C	0.7839458584785461	And then that's something super important.
4811610	4818260	C	0.9036083221435547	And even in the Wokie meditation, you need to follow a certain path.
4819880	4820292	C	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
4820346	4822470	C	0.9786132574081421	So that's super interesting.
4826220	4842190	B	0.9212648868560791	Well, in the last five or ten minutes, I would love to hear from each of you, like, what are your directions heading forward and what's exciting to you and where would you like to take this?
4844240	4849470	B	0.9018733501434326	Maybe Simone and Julia first, and then we'll kind of make our way back to the.
4853700	4856128	D	0.8178564310073853	Not myself, not working on the project.
4856214	4856704	D	0.5664745569229126	Right.
4856822	4878152	D	0.7749075293540955	But what I was really interested in sort of extending this is trying to understand because the way those deep meditative states are reported sometimes and the way people with depersonalization disorder report their experience is very similar.
4878286	4880808	D	0.7247704267501831	They almost use, like, the same words right.
4880974	4882760	D	0.7638567090034485	And to describe how they feel.
4882830	4892140	D	0.8833780884742737	And I wonder why one is experienced positively and one is experienced so negatively, as in it being a disorder and in completely disrupting someone's life.
4892290	4897230	D	0.5081126689910889	So that was like this comparison I think I'll be very curious about.
4901100	4901704	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
4901822	4904670	B	0.8590555787086487	Julia, if you want to add anything.
4907440	4909390	E	0.9570282101631165	Well, it's very interesting.
4910960	4928224	E	0.47917696833610535	Again, I'm not so involved in this study, so it's a bit hard, but I'm really interested in all the self is affected by our interaction with the world, external world, and I'm completely already spoiled with the result we have with the international binding.
4928272	4940872	E	0.820785403251648	So it's very if the self is attenuated or if it's disappeared, kind of I think that's the key question we want to answer.
4941006	4951784	E	0.8615904450416565	And yeah, I would be very curious to mean what Valeria found in data to see if we can have a common narrative about what's happening.
4951982	4953720	E	0.6695014238357544	Also with the personalization.
4955120	4955532	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4955586	4965570	E	0.824296236038208	It's very interesting to see how moving of body, attention to the body can really change the self, kind of or the way we process self information.
4966900	4967456	E	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4967558	4968770	E	0.9672727584838867	So very interesting.
4971140	4971696	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
4971798	4972640	B	0.6361703276634216	Anna.
4975320	4975732	C	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
4975786	4981590	C	0.9044682383537292	So it's like lots of work to do ahead, but that's exciting, right?
4982680	4983092	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4983146	4989670	C	0.5037421584129333	So, very short term, it's like we need to write up this result that we just got.
4990200	4991136	C	0.5108225345611572	So yeah.
4991178	4992232	C	0.7672351002693176	In relation to the body.
4992286	4994440	C	0.8599064946174622	So basically, we're going to have some numbers to show.
4994510	4996090	C	0.9885571002960205	So that's super nice.
4996780	5028764	C	0.8654926419258118	And then the next steps would be to create or develop computational model around this, basically contrast the real world data with, you know, simulation data and then have a multilayered type of approach with different methods, from physiological to behavioral to phenomenological to computational, potentially also neural.
5028812	5032660	C	0.9189109206199646	So that's something would be nice to do in the next steps.
5035720	5044280	C	0.8660896420478821	And apart from that, I think that's all for now, and I'll leave the floor to Valeria.
5045740	5050010	A	0.9513877034187317	Well, again, thank you, Dan and everybody.
5050640	5051436	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
5051618	5055144	A	0.9768573045730591	I also want to thank you a lot for this platform, this invitation.
5055192	5056940	A	0.9860551953315735	It was really nice.
5057090	5060060	A	0.9808312058448792	Really nice person and really nice conversation.
5062000	5067404	A	0.688814103603363	I'm working with Anne Andy's project, so she already said, what's the next direction?
5067532	5067776	A	0.48124951124191284	What.
5067798	5086708	A	0.760927677154541	I can add in this I think would be on the theoretical side also start engaging with more closely to bodily reactions to meditation because the body boundaries dissolution is just one part of it.
5086794	5091320	A	0.8378633856773376	It's like one part of the phenomenology but it's not the only thing that happens during meditation.
5092220	5122610	A	0.7193278074264526	There is a lot of potential that can be discovered on this because the body boundary solution again, it's really study a lot, but it's a phenomenon and there is so many other things that happens in our body while we meditate and I speak for first person experience, but in the community it's really like already said, other kinds of also more healing traditions like breath work, for example.
5123460	5127380	A	0.7201538681983948	There there is a lot of potential where people already work on that.
5127530	5131728	A	0.4878566265106201	But there is no bridge with the academic communities.
5131824	5148328	A	0.8294222354888916	So people work pragmatically with this intuitive knowledge about what happens in the body during these altered states of consciousness but still we need to bridge it with trying to make sense from a phonological and scientific point of view and experimental point of view as well.
5148414	5162110	A	0.6185937523841858	So I think I see myself in trying to step in this toward and bring insight from one world to the other and hoping to help myself and the other people around me.
5164260	5165008	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
5165174	5167984	B	0.9238985180854797	Well, best of luck with the work.
5168022	5169356	B	0.983788251876831	That sounds really exciting.
5169468	5188250	B	0.8933684229850769	Love the idea of the two way street with different bodily and cognitive practices and collaboration and conversation that can bring in all these different expertises that maybe don't have an fMRI study already, whatever that's worth.
5188780	5190440	B	0.9023188352584839	Thank you though, always.
5190590	5195530	B	0.9871298670768738	Any of you are welcome back and really appreciate that you all came out.
5196540	5197016	C	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
5197038	5198456	B	0.8566426634788513	Daniel, thank you.
5198478	5198870	B	0.5413564443588257	See you soon.
