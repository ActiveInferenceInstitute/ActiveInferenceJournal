00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,620
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,376
It's July 27, 2023, and we're

3
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:15,660
here in Acton, guest stream, number 15.1

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,364
with Valeria Beckhatini and Anna C

5
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,636
unica. This is going to be a very

6
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:23,292
interesting and cool presentation and

7
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:26,632
discussion on selfless minds, unlimited

8
00:00:26,696 --> 00:00:29,284
bodies, homeostatic, bodily self

9
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,080
regulation and meditative experiences.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,852
There will be a presentation followed by

11
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:37,364
a discussion. So thank you both for

12
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:39,636
joining and to you Valeria, for the

13
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:42,856
presentation. Thank you Diana, very

14
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:45,272
much. I'm very happy to be here with

15
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:51,012
Anna. Presenting pathavara

16
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:54,184
wider project. This is a paper about

17
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:57,624
what happened in selfless state from a

18
00:00:57,662 --> 00:00:59,828
Homo Sapie bodily self regulation

19
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:02,536
perspective. So it's as I said, it's

20
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:05,724
part of a wider project that consists in

21
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:08,080
both theoretical and experimental

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,040
components.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,600
Today we're going to look at meditation.

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,724
So for people that are not really

25
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:24,884
familiar with that, meditation is a

26
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:27,044
practice that engaged attention to self

27
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:28,784
regulate physiological and cognitive

28
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,184
activity. What we're interested here is

29
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:35,032
that people that meditate with a certain

30
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,850
experience, so for example,

31
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,464
meditating in the past two years with

32
00:01:41,582 --> 00:01:44,164
regularly, like some hours per week,

33
00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:48,444
they consistently report losing one

34
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,968
sense of the self or having selfless

35
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:54,396
experiences. But not only that, they

36
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:58,480
also report to have bodily alterations.

37
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,536
So alterations in the procession of the

38
00:02:01,558 --> 00:02:03,644
body. That has been called expansion,

39
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:06,256
oceanic boundlessness, dissolution of

40
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:08,464
body boundaries. And since you are

41
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:10,548
particularly interested in this kind of

42
00:02:10,554 --> 00:02:12,512
phenomenal experience, we have proposed

43
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:15,572
to frame them unlimited body,

44
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:18,932
just for clarity. So our question

45
00:02:18,986 --> 00:02:21,012
here is what exactly? And the question

46
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:24,484
that will follow the whole presentation

47
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:27,432
in the background is what exactly is

48
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:30,296
lost when experienced meditators report

49
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:33,956
losing their self and the body? So let's

50
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:38,364
first look very briefly at what the

51
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:41,390
self is, or the sense of self is. So

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,744
this concept is so complex and so wide

53
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,888
that has been debated since the

54
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:51,170
beginning of philosophy. And of course,

55
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,744
it might be so intuitive that it's also

56
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:57,264
very hard to define. But one very

57
00:02:57,462 --> 00:03:01,364
old and used definition is the

58
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:04,036
unitary or unique individual eye. The

59
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,236
first person perspective, that Latin was

60
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:09,636
called the subjectin. So something that

61
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:13,688
lay under all our stream of experience,

62
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:16,984
thoughts and whatever else happens to

63
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:19,320
us, that's the subject.

64
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,404
However, more recently in cognitive

65
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,180
science, we are appealing to a more

66
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,204
common definition of sense of self, a

67
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:30,136
bit more exhaustive, that is defined

68
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,284
as a multidimensional construct. And

69
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:36,156
here we will come back on

70
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:39,008
this concept later and we'll unpack it a

71
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:42,236
bit more. So the aim

72
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:46,690
of this presentation will be to

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,684
first of all, lay down the fact that in

74
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:51,712
self experiences, the biological

75
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,660
organism, so to speak, the human body

76
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,844
remains successfully repregulated. And

77
00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:01,044
this might be very intuitive but it

78
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:03,880
needs us then to see that during

79
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,064
selfless experiences what we

80
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,844
propose is that they may be tacitly

81
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:13,336
accompanied or implicitly underlined by

82
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:15,740
enhanced connectedness with this

83
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,372
successful self regulation that we

84
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,784
propose to link it with a perceptually

85
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:24,460
attenuated body or what has been already

86
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,190
called transparent body.

87
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,604
And this allows us to propose

88
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:34,800
but it's of course on a working process

89
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,000
and we are very open to feedback at any

90
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,768
stage of this presentation that the term

91
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,344
selfless states may be misleading

92
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:46,084
because what is lost is an ordinary way

93
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:49,716
to mentally model the self relation to

94
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:53,608
the body and the world. So our

95
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,560
roadmap is composed as follows

96
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,930
first I will passing through

97
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,648
debates and definitions of losing

98
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:07,244
oneself and body. So that means I will

99
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:10,844
go through alterations in these three

100
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:14,590
dimension during massive state

101
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,696
and then I will introduce Keen concept

102
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:20,248
of predictive process in the active

103
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:24,844
infrastructure framework that are useful

104
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:28,800
in our explanation. So that

105
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,184
then I can unpack

106
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,284
the role of the biological self

107
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,044
organization and homostatic self

108
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:40,084
regulation in constituting our sense of

109
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:43,930
self. And then pass to our more

110
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,728
claim that the processes like

111
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,184
somatosensory, attenuation and

112
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,472
transparent self modeling are a key

113
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,356
mechanism underlying the phenomenology

114
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:54,972
of deep mathematical states. And this

115
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:56,924
then will allow us to draw our

116
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:59,432
conclusions and present ongoing related

117
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:00,380
projects.

118
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,430
So let's come back to the sense of self.

119
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,912
So when

120
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:16,256
one has to investigate the sense of

121
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:18,764
self, of course, as I said it's so wide

122
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,910
concept that so many definitions and

123
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,532
characterization of the sense of self

124
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,072
has come up in philosophy and cognitive

125
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,384
science. So we have terms like minimal

126
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,176
self experience, selfhood sense of

127
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:37,432
ownership and all of this. And for other

128
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:40,088
part I think we have just to stick to a

129
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:43,256
common definition that comes for example

130
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:46,456
from a similar paper from Gallagher 2000

131
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:49,464
that defines as a multidimensional

132
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:52,732
construct composed by minimal or

133
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:55,564
embodied components and narrative or

134
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:57,948
reflective components. So to unpack a

135
00:06:57,954 --> 00:06:59,308
little bit these two concepts the

136
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:01,008
minimal or embodied experience of the

137
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:05,724
sense of self is the basic implicit

138
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:09,356
functioning of the body of

139
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:11,924
the ongoing moment. So the stream of

140
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:15,030
experience that happens to me right now

141
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,556
can be defined as my minimal sense of

142
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:20,916
self. So I don't really need to

143
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:23,450
have an explicit knowledge about myself

144
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,760
to have this kind of dimension.

145
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,172
And these can be further unpacked

146
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:33,044
through the concept of prereflective

147
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:35,708
self consciousness that comes from a

148
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:38,252
phenomenological tradition. Tracing back

149
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:41,980
from peak

150
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,368
argue that parts of our self conscious

151
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:50,892
does not need any reflection to happen

152
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:54,530
there or explicit thought. It happens

153
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,988
in a way tambourian is consistently

154
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:02,596
before reflection. And then on top of

155
00:08:02,618 --> 00:08:05,492
this we build our narrative or our

156
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:08,132
reflections about ourself. And this is

157
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:11,136
more linked to self identification

158
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,432
processes or self monitoring, self

159
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,844
recognition and introspection.

160
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:19,460
Introspection, it's the ability

161
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,364
of introspection. So perceive

162
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:26,684
yourself or reflect about yourself in an

163
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:30,124
explicit way. So you do need to have

164
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:31,944
that biography or an explicit memory

165
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,684
about yourself in order to tackle this

166
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,430
aspect of the sense of self.

167
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,304
So in deep meditative states there

168
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:45,072
is alterations in the sense of self and

169
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:49,200
it's up to debate which dimension are

170
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,652
affected by that. And it's

171
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:57,168
far from clear what actually happens

172
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:59,332
to this kind of dimension and more and

173
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:01,236
many more other dimensional sense of

174
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:05,368
self. And we are here to unpack a

175
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:07,864
little bit this. We proposed these

176
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:12,170
quotations from Fashion 2008 where

177
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,324
it suggested that enduring deep massive

178
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,792
states one experiences oneself as these

179
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:21,710
very moments of consciousness. This is

180
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,724
quotation that may reveal some position

181
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:29,008
about the debate what happens to

182
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:31,516
the sense of self. So in this case it's

183
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:35,040
argued that meditation reveal a very

184
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,184
moment of consciousness. So there is

185
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:42,004
something that is true consciousness or

186
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:44,180
something that is the real

187
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,756
consciousness. And this actually has

188
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:48,784
broke through the concept of pure

189
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:52,076
consciousness. So something that stayed

190
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:56,120
there and it's

191
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,176
purified by everything, by also the

192
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,296
body. And there is so many definition of

193
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:04,424
this pure consciousness. We brought some

194
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:07,464
example like ownerless consciousness,

195
00:10:07,512 --> 00:10:08,876
the consciousness that doesn't have an

196
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:11,836
owner, that doesn't have a self. So it

197
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:14,796
doesn't have a proper sense of self that

198
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:17,760
walked or that owns this consciousness.

199
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,276
Mastinger has worked on the minimal

200
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:24,220
phenomenal experience defining aspecial

201
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,560
a temporal dimensional consciousness.

202
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,076
And this is very supportive because it's

203
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,156
consistent with the Buddhist

204
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:35,010
philosophical stance of no self. So for

205
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,796
most tradition of Buddhism, there is

206
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:42,640
no self. The self, it's an illusion.

207
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,216
And it comes to our psychology when we

208
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,344
enter in contact with the world and with

209
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:51,000
the sensations of the world and certain

210
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,496
patterns of behavior that elicit the

211
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:56,748
sense that we have a self. So, as I

212
00:10:56,754 --> 00:11:00,412
said, meditation allows us to

213
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:03,436
access this pure consciousness for

214
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,008
supporters of this thesis and rebuilds

215
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:07,736
one choose an essential nature of

216
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:10,672
subjective and we bring this into

217
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:14,592
debate. There are also

218
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:18,224
people that argue against this and it

219
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:21,330
has been called by Matthew in their

220
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,436
special issues, the Ubitiquity thesis.

221
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:28,776
So the UBIT thesis claim that essential

222
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:30,836
self is ubiquitous to all states of

223
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,716
consciousness and sometimes it appeals

224
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:36,472
to the immunity to error through

225
00:11:36,606 --> 00:11:39,832
misidentification argument of self

226
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,004
ascription reports, which is simpler

227
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:45,630
than this long name. And it's basically

228
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,756
the fact that I can say that I had

229
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:54,252
a wonderful experience and

230
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:57,104
this wonderful experience may be true or

231
00:11:57,142 --> 00:12:00,812
false on this weekend.

232
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:03,788
I can do mistakes, I can make mistakes,

233
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:07,600
but I cannot not say that I didn't

234
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,720
have these wonderful experiences because

235
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,564
the moment in which I report I

236
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:16,752
have a perspective on this. So I cannot

237
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,436
really be mistaking on the fact that I'm

238
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,432
reporting this. Maybe I was dreaming,

239
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:22,500
maybe it wasn't a wonderful experience,

240
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,028
but it's me that I'm reporting. So the

241
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:27,204
moment I'm reporting this, it means that

242
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:31,824
I have to be there. And this applies

243
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:36,392
also to when I ascribe myself selfless

244
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,404
state, I had a selfless state. This is

245
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:42,796
very controversial. Other problems on

246
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:45,100
top of that are cross cultural problems

247
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,580
also addressed in the literature. So

248
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,688
this experience selfless states may be

249
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:54,140
influenced by certain vows

250
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,012
or certain beliefs that meditator

251
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,772
endorse, especially during

252
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:03,076
especially expert meditators. And the

253
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:06,308
other thing is these

254
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:10,032
all cross

255
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,756
cultural analysis and debate about the

256
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:16,336
self may be also partially due to a

257
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:20,424
verbal misunderstanding. So that the

258
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,232
western philosophy may have problems

259
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:24,244
about the self that actually the Eastern

260
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,252
probably philosophy is not really

261
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,124
addressing. So there might be some

262
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:31,548
incommensurability of problems there.

263
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:35,256
But as also we said in the paper, it's

264
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:37,272
not that we want to address the Buddhist

265
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,016
philosophical problems, rather we want

266
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:43,632
to bring insight from these to our

267
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:46,690
problems. So,

268
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,544
given this debate, we want to propose a

269
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:52,804
shift in the focus. So we don't want to

270
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:54,756
start by looking at consciousness and

271
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:56,692
trying to solve things about the self,

272
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:59,156
but we want to start by focusing on the

273
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:02,356
body. So we proposed a shift in focus in

274
00:14:02,378 --> 00:14:04,820
the bodily experience, examining this

275
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,630
deep mercy state.

276
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,564
So let's start by the subjective

277
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:14,796
experience of the body or the study of

278
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:16,412
the subjective experience of the body,

279
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,956
which is phenomenology. In the

280
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:21,980
tradition, our body has a unique status.

281
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,380
So the anatomical structure of the body

282
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,128
has been called by USA Kobe. So the

283
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:31,708
living body, the body that I can observe

284
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,920
and others can be observed. So it's the

285
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,336
object among the other object, they

286
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,480
would say. But it's not only that

287
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,844
because it's an object that I can live

288
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,276
from inside. So it has been called the

289
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:46,916
light, the lived body or the body as I

290
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:48,950
leave it from inside, as I said.

291
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,496
So what happens to these kind of

292
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,232
dimension? Again, we can unpack this and

293
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,836
see how the meditative states affect

294
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:01,880
them. So from the point of view of the

295
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,610
life believed body,

296
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,836
we already know, and I will unpack a

297
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,844
little bit more. So we have already said

298
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:13,900
that we have called unlinuated body

299
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,552
experiences the reports that spoke about

300
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:21,260
this fading of the body boundaries.

301
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,616
So the body boundary has been defined as

302
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:26,640
a cognitive emotional perception of

303
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,896
one's body surface. That's just a

304
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:32,192
definition. We can also debate about

305
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:34,724
this. But what it's important about for

306
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:37,492
us that our sense of body boundaries is

307
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:40,304
flexible and dynamic. It's not fixed

308
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,612
because we are in the realm of the body

309
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,488
as felt from inside. There is an

310
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:48,392
interesting study that exemplified this

311
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:51,688
concept in relation to meditation by

312
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:55,710
Jumpren in 2016, though it has worked

313
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,228
late further on on this as well.

314
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:01,836
But I find it interesting to look at

315
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:05,244
this image because this is part of a

316
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:08,912
self report measurement that they used

317
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,264
on a sample of people that had been

318
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:13,008
trained in meditation, in particular

319
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:16,624
with body scanning. So that people had

320
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:20,128
to systematically scan sensation running

321
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:24,100
the body. And the result is that in less

322
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,956
than four months of practice, so not

323
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:30,724
actually not the expert, they really

324
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:34,308
started to report an increased tendency

325
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:38,120
to go towards the almost

326
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,528
imperceptible perception of the body.

327
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:46,472
So they conclude that meditation

328
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:48,830
can be actually studied in this sense

329
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,372
where it affects our sense of body

330
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:55,660
boundaries. And they saw significant

331
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,620
results also in relation to increased

332
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,700
mood, happiness and decreased

333
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,664
anxiety and rumination. But this is just

334
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:10,070
another story that will come back later.

335
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,644
So I find interesting also this

336
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:17,652
quotation by Fink here in this paper

337
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,872
it's talking about why ego dissolution

338
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:21,776
may be better understood as ego

339
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:25,728
expansion. And then ego

340
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,770
dissolution comes in a later

341
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,536
interpretation. And so

342
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,228
I will read it. It's not the feeling of

343
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:38,008
self that dissolves, but the boundary

344
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:39,916
between a feeling of self and the

345
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,436
feeling of anything else in

346
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,996
consciousness. So here again Pink is

347
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:47,712
talking about consciousness but from our

348
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:50,096
perspective this quotation is pretty

349
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,912
informing because it goes in our

350
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:56,416
direction as well because he says

351
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:58,320
it's not that you're losing really

352
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,720
yourself. This experience is dependent

353
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,436
on how you actually perceive your

354
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,936
boundary with you and what you don't

355
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:11,824
consider you. So self fading of the self

356
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,120
other distinction ability.

357
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,916
So here it comes predictive

358
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:23,544
processing acting framework because we

359
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:27,484
want to basically

360
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:30,456
breach this phenomenal subjective

361
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:34,092
experience to cognitive phenomena and

362
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,780
underlying mechanistic explanation.

363
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,220
Indeed, predictive processing activities

364
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,892
have recently used for this purpose.

365
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,210
Also meditation research and

366
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,780
psychopathology research and so on. So

367
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,516
in this presentation I will use them in

368
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:55,472
an interchangeable way but following

369
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:59,296
certain trends. But it doesn't

370
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:02,772
have to be, it's also under debate and

371
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:06,852
I will also give API purely

372
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,400
I don't know how to say theoretical

373
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,056
perspective on that I will not go too

374
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:16,200
much technical. So briefly,

375
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,928
this framework considers brains

376
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:24,376
as predictive machine or as Friesen

377
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:27,596
likes to say, consider brain

378
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:31,504
as a fantastic organ which is

379
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:34,816
because it's not only able to do amazing

380
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:36,896
things, but also because it really

381
00:19:36,998 --> 00:19:39,164
generates fantasies about the world.

382
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:42,324
And this is because in order to act,

383
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:44,932
interact with itself and the world

384
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:52,832
around, the brain constantly anticipate

385
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:56,616
the current state of affairs in

386
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:59,144
order to make sense of the sensorium or

387
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:02,490
the stream of experiences that happens.

388
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,776
So it possess or embody or utilizes,

389
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,940
it depends on the commitment a

390
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,110
generative model which is a model that

391
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,292
keep tracks of regularity of the world

392
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:20,736
and forms predictions out of it in a

393
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:23,116
hierarchical way. So highly rated

394
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:26,896
prediction goes down to match

395
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:30,304
sensory data and sensory

396
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:35,152
data goes up to map

397
00:20:35,216 --> 00:20:38,896
to affect the predictions, to update

398
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:42,204
the model. However, every prediction

399
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:46,120
comes with a degree of error

400
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,356
which sometimes is called prediction

401
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:51,828
errors. So the prediction error

402
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:54,250
is a discrepancy between prediction and

403
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,516
sensory input so that a new model is

404
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:02,620
generated and they say the first

405
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,516
imperative or the only imperative of the

406
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:07,456
system is actually minimizing the

407
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:10,752
prediction errors so that the model can

408
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:14,784
most efficiently cope and interact and

409
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:17,970
act in the world. However, it's not

410
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,844
the only imperative because as I will

411
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:23,300
introduce in this slide,

412
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,224
the system has also to estimate

413
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:32,512
the confidence or likelihood or

414
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:35,656
precision of prediction in order to

415
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:39,096
evaluate the prediction errors that are

416
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:42,200
coming from the discrepancy.

417
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,172
So that the generative model has to

418
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:49,756
compute in a fine way how

419
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:53,068
much precision to assign to the

420
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:56,252
prediction or prediction errors and

421
00:21:56,306 --> 00:22:00,412
I choose this image because it renders

422
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:04,348
well how the distribution

423
00:22:04,444 --> 00:22:08,028
are set depending

424
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:11,076
on the precision citation. So if you

425
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:14,756
have a precise prediction error then

426
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:16,196
the posterior distribution will be

427
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:18,548
closer to the prediction error. Well,

428
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,964
the imprecise prediction error have

429
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:23,750
little effect on the prior, so does the

430
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,096
posture distribution will be closer to

431
00:22:27,118 --> 00:22:28,968
the prior and this is very important

432
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:32,836
because if the precision

433
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:34,984
estimator are not weighted correctly

434
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:37,928
then the system generates false

435
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,796
inference that will not able to the

436
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,436
system to interact efficiently and

437
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,180
update the model efficiently.

438
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,644
So, so far we have mostly

439
00:22:49,692 --> 00:22:51,836
talked about prediction error

440
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:55,136
minimization by updating the

441
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:58,130
model. However, the system can also

442
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,408
active sample the world active modify

443
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:06,244
the prediction error or the world in

444
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:10,064
order to fit the prediction

445
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:12,664
errors to the world. And this comes into

446
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:16,084
play active inference that builds upon

447
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:20,884
the free energy principle where it's

448
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,316
based on the idea that living organisms

449
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:26,172
maintain themselves with an optimal set

450
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:29,324
of states that comes from the second low

451
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:32,300
thermodynamics of schrodinger.

452
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,764
So given that it

453
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:42,620
comes into play how attention

454
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,732
is analyzed or examined under

455
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:51,108
this framework. So given that that the

456
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:53,956
organism has to maintain within these

457
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,104
optimal assessor states by maintaining

458
00:23:57,152 --> 00:24:00,400
an optimal balance between computation

459
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,028
and precision optimization so wasting

460
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:07,844
between prediction and prediction

461
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:10,328
errors, attention comes into place as a

462
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:12,324
modulation of this precision of sensory

463
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:16,876
data working as a search light. So in

464
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:19,468
other words, it optimizes signal to

465
00:24:19,554 --> 00:24:22,364
noise ratio. It's one of the way that we

466
00:24:22,402 --> 00:24:27,936
have to put

467
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:31,376
in place this local optimization of

468
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:34,224
precision estimates and this is very

469
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:37,404
important why we bring into attention

470
00:24:37,532 --> 00:24:41,004
because meditation has a systematic

471
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:45,040
and use of attention

472
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,724
resources and we will come

473
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:52,424
back into that a bit further on in this

474
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:56,088
presentation. And given that

475
00:24:56,174 --> 00:24:59,530
we are interested in okay,

476
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,456
we have seen the lived body, what

477
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:04,476
happens to the phenomenal experience now

478
00:25:04,498 --> 00:25:05,996
we're interested in what happens to the

479
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:08,360
corporate, what happens to believing

480
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,900
body that can be observed by the

481
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,390
organism during medicine states.

482
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,490
In this we bring into play other two

483
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,004
important concepts in active inference

484
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:29,828
which is way to self regulate that

485
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:32,404
underlie all embassy experience, so all

486
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:37,236
subjective experience, so two ways or

487
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,988
one way that then is also active. So the

488
00:25:39,994 --> 00:25:43,416
first way is homeostasis which is

489
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:45,748
the maintenance of required optimal

490
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:48,312
state by survival and reproduction of

491
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:50,872
self organizing biological systems. So

492
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:54,730
for example, I cold and I use my

493
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,730
internal resources to keep my

494
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,436
states into optimal state so I

495
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,884
start shivering. However, I can also put

496
00:26:05,922 --> 00:26:09,424
in place active modification in the

497
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:13,196
world so that I'm not cold anymore.

498
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:15,616
So for example, I take a blank, this is

499
00:26:15,638 --> 00:26:17,756
called allostasis. So it's active

500
00:26:17,788 --> 00:26:19,536
engagements and modification about the

501
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:21,648
environment in order to maintain myself

502
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,500
in optimal state for survival.

503
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,804
So we can say of course,

504
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,864
human bodies are self organizing

505
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:33,476
biological system aiming at keeping

506
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,850
these internal states within a certain

507
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,304
viable range for survival. Now,

508
00:26:39,342 --> 00:26:41,656
given that we will come back again to

509
00:26:41,678 --> 00:26:44,170
the phenomenology of touch.

510
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,230
I'm going to do this for the second time

511
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,750
to then wrap up everything again.

512
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,936
So, we have talked about fermology of

513
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:00,050
the body. However,

514
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,900
we haven't underlined the importance

515
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,632
that the touch and proximal sound has

516
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:09,280
for our lip.

517
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,470
Our as Nikka and colleagues has already

518
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,384
proposed, our proximal sense are central

519
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,650
for our minimal sense of self.

520
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,688
And on top of that, we bring

521
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,156
into play the fact that different kinds

522
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:32,920
of touch can convey different experience

523
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,716
of the sense of self or sense of

524
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,696
boundaries. So for example, imagine

525
00:27:36,728 --> 00:27:40,510
yourself that you are in a city

526
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,020
of Portugal or California,

527
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,056
you touching the whole environment with

528
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:50,096
your body. You may feel that you have a

529
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:52,512
sense of immersiveness or that your body

530
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:55,884
boundaries are slowly a bit becoming

531
00:27:55,932 --> 00:27:58,828
less clear. And this experience, it's

532
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:01,350
actually a bit similar to the

533
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,744
experiences of sensory deprivation

534
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:07,184
states where people are put in a salty

535
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:09,716
water and they let them flow for some

536
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:12,584
moments. Sensory deprivation states are

537
00:28:12,622 --> 00:28:15,992
not really all deprived because you have

538
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:18,408
other activities in the body and

539
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:21,336
movements that produce signals that you

540
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:24,632
are actually aware of. However, in both

541
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:26,904
these experiences, the body boundary

542
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:29,836
seems to fade a little bit. However, if

543
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:31,192
you're in the sea and you're swimming

544
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:33,244
and then you touch the rock with your

545
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:36,524
hand, you clearly will feel yourself as

546
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:39,456
separated as something different from

547
00:28:39,478 --> 00:28:41,376
what you're actually touching, right?

548
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:42,720
Sense of separation.

549
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,264
This phenomenology can be brought into

550
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:51,212
active inference through the mechanism

551
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:53,280
of some of the sensory attenuation which

552
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,680
comes from the sensory tinuation.

553
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,084
So this process happens when the

554
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:03,160
systemicates its own action.

555
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,192
So for example, I take a glass and

556
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:11,640
in this moment my rena has already

557
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,696
created afferent copies of this action

558
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:16,556
and the sensory consequences of this.

559
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:21,644
So whenever I grab this

560
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:23,324
glass, the sensory constant that happens

561
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:27,572
to my body are slightly

562
00:29:27,736 --> 00:29:30,396
attenuated. And this is why we cannot

563
00:29:30,428 --> 00:29:34,236
tickle ourselves because the prediction

564
00:29:34,268 --> 00:29:38,608
errors comes at. Not surprising this

565
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:42,084
has implication for our

566
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,972
embodied experience in the world.

567
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:47,024
Because we feel that we are in immediate

568
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:48,564
contact with ourselves in the world.

569
00:29:48,602 --> 00:29:51,724
And this is because our conscious

570
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,956
experience are mediated by transparent

571
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:56,404
or non perceived cognitive processes.

572
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:59,384
So that the system can leave behind or

573
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:02,004
disatten self related sensory

574
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:05,556
processing. And these allow to allocate

575
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:07,624
resources to perception and action

576
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,820
involved in the processing of the object

577
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,816
of interest. So for example, when LeMans

578
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:15,816
confiscated this example of the cherry,

579
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:19,852
when I have to take object salient

580
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:22,930
for me, I'll be much more interested in

581
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,872
picking the object and I will not really

582
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:29,904
focus on my arm moving in

583
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:32,836
picking that. So that the system needs

584
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:34,944
to compute and maintain a fine balance

585
00:30:34,992 --> 00:30:37,408
between external and internal components

586
00:30:37,424 --> 00:30:39,956
of somatosensory attenuation. And this

587
00:30:39,978 --> 00:30:42,036
is very important for a sense of self as

588
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:45,704
well. So we

589
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:48,184
need to understand and it's not that we

590
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,728
need, but in order for us to have a

591
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:53,480
sense of self. We normally have a sense

592
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,284
of what we are and what we are not.

593
00:30:56,402 --> 00:31:00,750
But for the brain as

594
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,936
agents end up with the brain, we compute

595
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:07,416
this distinction. So where the self ends

596
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,336
and where do work begins or do I move my

597
00:31:10,358 --> 00:31:13,136
arm or my arm is moved by something or

598
00:31:13,158 --> 00:31:16,572
someone? So central attenuation

599
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:20,160
plays a role in these distinctions

600
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,044
in building multisensory bodily self

601
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:26,196
representations. So that the sense of

602
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,508
the self embody is subject to the and

603
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,824
phenomenally transferred. That means

604
00:31:31,882 --> 00:31:33,992
that when we act in the world and we

605
00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:38,410
interact, we normally disattend the

606
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,232
way we are in the world. Because we need

607
00:31:42,286 --> 00:31:44,456
to be in contact, in direct contact with

608
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:46,536
the world. If we always attend it to our

609
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,356
body and ourself in

610
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:52,744
the sense that we will be hyper

611
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:56,156
reflexive then we will be actually will

612
00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:59,152
be impaired in what we normally do.

613
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:01,136
And this is actually a condition that we

614
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:02,530
will talk about later.

615
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,216
So that in active images the sense of

616
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:09,040
self is an ongoing inferential process

617
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,792
centering the body. So what we propose

618
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:15,604
is what is lost during

619
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:19,172
selfless experience is an ordinary way

620
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:21,716
to mentally model self in relation to

621
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:24,208
the body and the world. So that if we

622
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,890
think about the self as I propose here

623
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,736
the iceberg where the narrative self is

624
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:31,576
what we see but the renewal self is what

625
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:34,608
we actually are composed of and it's

626
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:36,940
actually larger but we are not aware of.

627
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,356
Similarly, when we have self experience

628
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:43,704
we may have also this inferential

629
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:45,736
process where we think we have lost

630
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:46,620
ourselves.

631
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,970
However,

632
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,376
we have gathered some evidence in the

633
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:57,196
fact that meditation facilitate

634
00:32:57,228 --> 00:33:00,724
autonomic regulation involved in

635
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:03,876
homostatic processes. That means for

636
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,748
example that meditation increase the

637
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:08,164
synchronization of cardiac and

638
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:12,484
respiratory system. This is connected

639
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,100
with reduced levels of blood glucose

640
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,328
or blood pressure and heart rate

641
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:23,770
variability. So there is a success.

642
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,004
Medication helps to successfully self

643
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:30,924
regulate the body especially in

644
00:33:30,962 --> 00:33:33,196
comparison to stress that actually does

645
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:34,220
the opposite.

646
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,416
And on top of that, meditation help us

647
00:33:40,438 --> 00:33:42,492
to attune us to our physiological

648
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:47,504
interceptive awareness. And it

649
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:50,064
does it so they say, by enhancing the

650
00:33:50,102 --> 00:33:52,256
processing of extraceptive interceptive

651
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:55,044
stimuli which doesn't have to be

652
00:33:55,082 --> 00:33:58,340
understanded as a maladaptive

653
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,904
increased body awareness, but rather an

654
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,730
adaptive body awareness which is a

655
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,690
distinction that we can come back later

656
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,344
if people are interested or they ask

657
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:10,970
about.

658
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,316
These evidence are also in line with

659
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:18,248
evidence of meditation that promotes

660
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:20,444
self regulation of pain and pain and

661
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:23,768
pleasantness. So three day attentional

662
00:34:23,864 --> 00:34:29,010
training, the meditation allow

663
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,316
you're actually able to self regulate

664
00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:35,776
the pain and not really like the

665
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,424
sensation of the pain because actually

666
00:34:37,462 --> 00:34:42,304
it gets very fewer but the automatic

667
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:44,996
behavioral patterns that comes in

668
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:48,676
association with the pain. So there is

669
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:52,104
a lot of also self regulation on

670
00:34:52,142 --> 00:34:54,170
emotions and so on.

671
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,420
So the body does not literally disappear

672
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,944
actually it stays at the very center as

673
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:04,216
I propose here at the center as we

674
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:05,964
propose it in the paper and I propose it

675
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:09,324
through this image at the center of a

676
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:14,108
cycling. So self

677
00:35:14,194 --> 00:35:16,684
regulatory processes allow the

678
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:20,624
subjective experience to lose oneself so

679
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:23,356
that the sense of the body remains

680
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,696
present in the background. And this for

681
00:35:25,718 --> 00:35:27,712
example, it's very clear from this

682
00:35:27,766 --> 00:35:31,296
report from a person undergoing

683
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:34,004
this kind of experience that they say

684
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:36,964
that there remains a sense that there is

685
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,844
a body without any experience of a sense

686
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:40,820
of boundary.

687
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,680
So this is not

688
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,644
very last slide but we come to our wrap

689
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:56,636
up of our claim attenuating the

690
00:35:56,658 --> 00:35:58,876
self and limiting the body which is also

691
00:35:58,978 --> 00:36:01,550
the title of our paper. So,

692
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,760
starting from the fact that all medicine

693
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,136
practices across the tradition require

694
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:11,196
systematic and carefully fully crafted

695
00:36:11,228 --> 00:36:14,204
body preparation to enter this deep

696
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:18,240
method selfless state. So it doesn't

697
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,644
happen that all of a sudden you just

698
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:25,972
have a selfless state which actually may

699
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:28,880
happen more similarly with psychedelic.

700
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,216
But with meditation you

701
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:34,680
need to pass through gradually a many

702
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:40,488
different state or many different level

703
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:41,960
of concentration.

704
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,230
That happens when you have around

705
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,808
a predictable environment

706
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:55,064
and you do so by building prior

707
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,616
expectation. So you have to keep your

708
00:36:57,638 --> 00:36:59,980
body in a certain position of posture.

709
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,664
As you say in this image, the person is

710
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:07,116
seated with a very straight,

711
00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:09,904
not very, but a straight back relaxed.

712
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:11,792
This is very important meditation,

713
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:15,428
banded legs and so on. And then you need

714
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:19,012
at least in the most

715
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:21,232
part of your practice, you need safe

716
00:37:21,296 --> 00:37:23,160
predictable environments with

717
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,516
temperature that enables you to maintain

718
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:29,400
your homostatic processes.

719
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,092
So all these conditions are necessary

720
00:37:33,156 --> 00:37:35,192
for your successful homostatic self

721
00:37:35,246 --> 00:37:39,370
regulation. In this sense when

722
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,044
parts of preparation to enter

723
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:46,744
then after the state of confrontation,

724
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,120
the meditator can let go and leave

725
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,712
behind self related processes and

726
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:55,216
process the body transported or it can

727
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:58,784
attenuate them attenuate the body

728
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:02,272
can be attenuated. So our

729
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:04,724
claim is that a transfer essential self

730
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:07,936
and body may underline the phenomenology

731
00:38:07,968 --> 00:38:11,296
of losing oneself and blurring

732
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:13,652
body boundaries as reported during

733
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:14,790
meditative states.

734
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,784
So our conclusion is that we have

735
00:38:19,822 --> 00:38:22,820
proposed a shift in focus on homostatic

736
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,844
body self regulation in examining deep

737
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:29,176
meditative states. The experience of

738
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:31,672
having a body living self organism

739
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:34,124
biological system is never lost in this

740
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:37,404
process. Rather it stay transferred at

741
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:40,752
its very center, self attenuated yet

742
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:43,200
very much present and hands alive.

743
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,056
So that the self model is attenuated to

744
00:38:47,078 --> 00:38:49,388
become transparent and hands processed

745
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:52,852
in the background. Now giving this

746
00:38:52,906 --> 00:38:54,580
conclusion now I'm going to present

747
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:59,910
related project. The first one is still

748
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,108
on the theoretical side. So we are in

749
00:39:03,114 --> 00:39:05,176
the realm of active inference model in

750
00:39:05,198 --> 00:39:07,716
meditation research. There is a radio

751
00:39:07,748 --> 00:39:13,528
literature about that that

752
00:39:13,614 --> 00:39:17,084
have studied different kinds of

753
00:39:17,282 --> 00:39:20,056
meditation techniques like focused

754
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:22,328
attention, open monitoring,

755
00:39:22,504 --> 00:39:25,884
nondual awareness and

756
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:29,244
they all study from

757
00:39:29,282 --> 00:39:32,956
Laconin in 2023 or Laconin and

758
00:39:32,978 --> 00:39:35,330
Lactar in 2021.

759
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,828
They have for example showed that these

760
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:44,384
attention techniques profoundly alter

761
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:49,270
typical mental experiences and

762
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,088
for example focus meditation is

763
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:56,708
meditation that engage attention

764
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:59,512
on one specific object experience.

765
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:03,588
For example the breath and in active

766
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:06,280
inference term it means that precision

767
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,644
is estimated one sensory input which

768
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:12,364
means that it reduce the impact of the

769
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:14,744
other thoughts and parallel processes

770
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:18,252
that are going on or often

771
00:40:18,306 --> 00:40:21,984
open monitoring meditation is

772
00:40:22,022 --> 00:40:24,684
the engaging of attention to one's

773
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:27,088
experience as a whole. So the whole

774
00:40:27,254 --> 00:40:29,692
stream of experience without selecting

775
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:32,704
anything in particular. So that in an

776
00:40:32,742 --> 00:40:36,176
activatory terms it has been described

777
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:40,070
as assigning equal precision to all

778
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,056
these experiencing promoting non

779
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:44,864
reactive sensing. And this is connected

780
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:47,992
also why medicine are good

781
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:51,290
in self regulated regulate pain.

782
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,940
So we will also build our

783
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,670
model on self modeling based

784
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,460
on the previous literature which is

785
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:08,184
integration. And then

786
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:11,264
going experimental we want to bring into

787
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,212
the table application of what we're

788
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:19,072
researching and potential benefit may be

789
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:23,284
for cases of people or individual that

790
00:41:23,322 --> 00:41:27,060
suffer from disrupted body awareness

791
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,604
or disrupted self awareness. And there

792
00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:35,956
is a relatively recent

793
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:39,816
condition that has been studied that

794
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,280
is depersonalization. So depersonization

795
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,444
is the disruption of both body and self

796
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:51,944
awareness and it's a very heterogeneous

797
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:53,772
condition, there is a lot of different

798
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:57,420
dimensions that occurs but

799
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,444
generally it's connected with feelings

800
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:03,296
of heaviness disconnection feeling the

801
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:05,776
body as an object, rather they're a

802
00:42:05,798 --> 00:42:10,544
transfer and medium of experience which

803
00:42:10,582 --> 00:42:13,140
simply is called disembodiment.

804
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,484
It is linked with difficulties in

805
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:19,028
concentration and attention, often

806
00:42:19,114 --> 00:42:21,796
comorbid with depression, rumination and

807
00:42:21,818 --> 00:42:25,448
anxiety. And recently Chow Nuka and

808
00:42:25,614 --> 00:42:27,880
colleagues has also proposed AIDS

809
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,060
characterized by failures in attenuating

810
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,760
somatosentry signals.

811
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,244
So based on what we have

812
00:42:37,442 --> 00:42:40,732
previously said and based on

813
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:45,260
how this condition affects

814
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,248
large number of population, we want to

815
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,680
test certain hypotheses.

816
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,512
So the first one would be that higher

817
00:42:54,566 --> 00:42:56,912
somasocentric attenuation Correlate with

818
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:59,116
more feeling of aliveness and wide

819
00:42:59,148 --> 00:43:02,832
openness in experienced meditators and

820
00:43:02,886 --> 00:43:05,040
rather lowest somascentric attenuation

821
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,312
Correlate with feelings of unrealness

822
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:10,864
thatness in people experience deeper

823
00:43:10,912 --> 00:43:14,536
solidation. And on

824
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,804
the other hand, severe homostatic

825
00:43:16,852 --> 00:43:19,112
dysregulation of bodily states during

826
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,936
deep meditative states may lead to

827
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,364
negative emotional outcomes and Abernant

828
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:26,124
self experience. This comes from to the

829
00:43:26,162 --> 00:43:31,100
fact that depression and meditation

830
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,180
can both create stressing negative

831
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,584
outcomes and it's interesting to see how

832
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:43,248
this happened and what are the

833
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:46,050
commonalities and differences in that.

834
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,472
And also we have dealt in the realm of

835
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,484
spatial temporal perception which is

836
00:43:52,682 --> 00:43:55,876
connected also with mood disorders or

837
00:43:55,978 --> 00:43:59,172
like depression and anxiety and also

838
00:43:59,226 --> 00:44:01,460
with depersonalization.

839
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,664
However, in depersonalization there is

840
00:44:04,702 --> 00:44:08,884
no specific items in the questionnaire

841
00:44:08,932 --> 00:44:13,176
that is usually used for measuring which

842
00:44:13,198 --> 00:44:15,252
is the Cambridge Depressionization

843
00:44:15,316 --> 00:44:18,750
scale. So we want to test this as well

844
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,620
and we want to test it in people

845
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,504
reporting selfless and disembodied

846
00:44:24,552 --> 00:44:27,096
experience so both pathological and non

847
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:31,104
pathological conditions. So part

848
00:44:31,142 --> 00:44:33,920
of this hypothesis we are really going

849
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,632
through this is our team coming from

850
00:44:37,686 --> 00:44:40,256
Humboldt University where I come from as

851
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,770
well Simon Wendelman, but also

852
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,144
University College London with Ines and

853
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:50,164
Joseph first study is as I said

854
00:44:50,282 --> 00:44:52,692
about. Time perspective. So we want to

855
00:44:52,746 --> 00:44:56,452
analyze how

856
00:44:56,506 --> 00:44:58,428
people with high traits of depression

857
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:01,912
correlate with dimension of the time

858
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:04,520
perspective so they are more future

859
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,204
oriented or more negative oriented. Our

860
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:10,936
hypothesis that they're more negative

861
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:15,064
past oriented so they're stuck

862
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:20,830
in a very long

863
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,716
present moment, but also they're

864
00:45:25,768 --> 00:45:28,208
the tendency of ruminating. So always

865
00:45:28,294 --> 00:45:30,560
going to past negative memories.

866
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,732
Since this is titled Last in Dark Times

867
00:45:35,786 --> 00:45:37,360
the Effect of the Personalization

868
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,852
Experience in on Time Perspective And

869
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:43,736
these we are already in the analysis of

870
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:47,156
the data but it's

871
00:45:47,188 --> 00:45:50,424
an ongoing steel study.

872
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,930
So we have preliminary data on this.

873
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,756
While studies too we are in the

874
00:45:57,778 --> 00:45:59,948
recruitment phases but we are almost

875
00:46:00,034 --> 00:46:04,396
there and encompass the high

876
00:46:04,418 --> 00:46:06,156
traits of people individual into high

877
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:09,308
traits of depression and meditators.

878
00:46:09,484 --> 00:46:13,312
I want to see through a set

879
00:46:13,366 --> 00:46:16,668
of questionnaires and a behavioral task

880
00:46:16,764 --> 00:46:19,280
how they may differ in the sense of

881
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,896
self, body and motion. Of course, they

882
00:46:20,918 --> 00:46:23,764
are very wide and concepts so there is

883
00:46:23,802 --> 00:46:28,000
always room for feedback

884
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,430
and replications and so on.

885
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,952
We have selected these tasks, the embody

886
00:46:38,016 --> 00:46:42,900
tasks adopted from new menma where

887
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,316
individual participants has to color

888
00:46:46,418 --> 00:46:50,124
parts of the body in relation to

889
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:53,352
activation that they feel by reading

890
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:57,084
certain emotional story. So these

891
00:46:57,122 --> 00:47:00,924
stories are supposed to validate it to

892
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:03,116
elicit certain emotions in the body and

893
00:47:03,138 --> 00:47:05,820
then people colors parts of the body.

894
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,764
And then we will see how people with

895
00:47:08,802 --> 00:47:10,644
hydrates and the visualization may say

896
00:47:10,722 --> 00:47:13,684
will differ in this. And we will also

897
00:47:13,722 --> 00:47:15,796
compare with other questionnaires that

898
00:47:15,818 --> 00:47:20,032
we have put this and potential

899
00:47:20,176 --> 00:47:22,852
title is emotional Body Maps of Thought

900
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,536
Detachment, Interpersonalization and

901
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:28,024
Meditation. And with this I thank you

902
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:31,400
all and that's it. We are open

903
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,690
for discussion. Thank you.

904
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,420
Awesome. Thank you very much. Valeria,

905
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,876
you are muted. Donna. Thank you.

906
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:48,430
Valeria. Great. Well,

907
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,932
very fascinating presentation. Perhaps

908
00:47:54,076 --> 00:47:56,524
Anna first and then our other colleagues

909
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:58,336
who have joined. Would be awesome to

910
00:47:58,358 --> 00:48:02,176
hear your path to be

911
00:48:02,198 --> 00:48:04,436
here on this work and any reflection or

912
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:05,990
questions you have on it.

913
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,570
Is it my turn? Sure. Did I miss? Yeah.

914
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,540
So obviously I don't have many questions

915
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,164
because it's like we wrote this

916
00:48:20,202 --> 00:48:20,790
together.

917
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,436
But I think what I would

918
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:29,088
like just to add not really a question

919
00:48:29,194 --> 00:48:32,984
is I really like to

920
00:48:33,022 --> 00:48:38,552
see so

921
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:42,156
for instance like in ideal world would

922
00:48:42,178 --> 00:48:50,264
be nice to get all the traditions

923
00:48:50,312 --> 00:48:52,076
of the meditative experiences and how

924
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:54,496
they relate to the body and make a very

925
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:56,416
precise prediction on what exactly they

926
00:48:56,438 --> 00:49:00,130
will kind of predict in terms of certain

927
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,664
sensory experiences and how this can be

928
00:49:05,782 --> 00:49:07,376
interpreted through different

929
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:09,316
theoretical lenses. I think that could

930
00:49:09,338 --> 00:49:11,684
be really interesting because I think

931
00:49:11,722 --> 00:49:14,804
one of the problems, the challenges that

932
00:49:14,842 --> 00:49:16,676
we have right now is that we have so

933
00:49:16,698 --> 00:49:19,012
many concepts, so many approaches and

934
00:49:19,066 --> 00:49:21,016
kind of, like, scattered all over the

935
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:23,930
map, and I think would be really nice to

936
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,168
narrow down, because, as you said,

937
00:49:28,254 --> 00:49:31,476
Daniel so everybody knows

938
00:49:31,508 --> 00:49:34,716
what meditation is. Everybody knows at

939
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,900
least one person that meditates in life

940
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,376
and everything, but it's really unclear

941
00:49:40,408 --> 00:49:43,724
what exactly we are after and why.

942
00:49:43,762 --> 00:49:46,450
In certain cases, this is kind of like

943
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,532
beneficial, and in other cases,

944
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:52,172
basically it has negative consequences.

945
00:49:52,236 --> 00:49:54,544
And this is why precisely we are doing

946
00:49:54,582 --> 00:49:57,812
this project on depersonalization and

947
00:49:57,946 --> 00:50:01,188
meditation. And I can share with you

948
00:50:01,274 --> 00:50:04,580
informally, Scoop, but data

949
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,564
is here, so we kind of like can share

950
00:50:06,602 --> 00:50:09,092
with. So what we did in this project,

951
00:50:09,146 --> 00:50:11,712
basically we took people with typical

952
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:12,996
controls that don't have

953
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:15,092
depersonalization and never meditated.

954
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:17,208
Right? So it's kind of like, yeah,

955
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:19,304
never did that. And then we took people

956
00:50:19,342 --> 00:50:23,100
that meditated, and then we looked

957
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,484
at whether they have kind of like high

958
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,388
or low traits of depersonization. And

959
00:50:27,394 --> 00:50:30,120
then we took people with depersonization

960
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,950
that never meditate. Right.

961
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,276
So we have this inclusion and exclusion

962
00:50:37,308 --> 00:50:40,144
criteria and yeah, it's really

963
00:50:40,182 --> 00:50:42,284
interesting to find what our findings

964
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:45,136
is. It's really difficult to find people

965
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:49,170
that have experience and

966
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,904
low depersonalization skills, low

967
00:50:51,942 --> 00:50:55,252
depersonization traits. Right. So most

968
00:50:55,306 --> 00:50:56,964
of them, they actually have high

969
00:50:57,002 --> 00:50:58,448
depersonalization. But then it's

970
00:50:58,464 --> 00:51:00,176
interesting to see how that contrasts

971
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:01,364
with the people that have

972
00:51:01,402 --> 00:51:03,724
depersonalization and no vegetation

973
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:07,256
experience. Right. So that's something I

974
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:12,504
would like to carry on to

975
00:51:12,622 --> 00:51:13,850
reach the community.

976
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,276
That's something we'll definitely carry

977
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,132
on with. Valerian the next steps and

978
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:23,452
also with some people that I have here

979
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:26,640
in the chat, julia and Simone.

980
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,776
So Simone will going to work with us on

981
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:32,592
also. Somatosensory attenuation through

982
00:51:32,646 --> 00:51:36,428
different have some

983
00:51:36,614 --> 00:51:39,268
without scooping. We have also some very

984
00:51:39,354 --> 00:51:42,244
interesting results coming up. We just

985
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:44,016
finished data collection on intentional

986
00:51:44,048 --> 00:51:46,624
binding and depersonization. So related

987
00:51:46,672 --> 00:51:48,420
to the sense of agency.

988
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:54,104
That's all for me for now.

989
00:51:54,142 --> 00:51:56,392
We're kind of like in between because

990
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,264
Valerie represented very well, like the

991
00:51:58,302 --> 00:52:01,272
theory part and the studies are

992
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,424
literally just getting hot from the oven

993
00:52:04,472 --> 00:52:07,736
now. And we hope that in September it's

994
00:52:07,768 --> 00:52:10,284
like we're going to get them out.

995
00:52:10,402 --> 00:52:12,844
Yeah, but the data is in the box, so

996
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:14,896
that's very exciting and yeah, we have

997
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:18,336
the results. Thank you,

998
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:20,716
Danielle, again for this platform. It's

999
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:22,016
really nice. And as I said, I really

1000
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,676
hope that after this discussion, we'll

1001
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:27,968
have more opportunities

1002
00:52:28,064 --> 00:52:32,228
to change, exchange and discuss.

1003
00:52:32,314 --> 00:52:33,940
We also plan to organize something

1004
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,864
around alteration of self consciousness

1005
00:52:36,992 --> 00:52:39,604
across various conditions and also

1006
00:52:39,642 --> 00:52:42,696
decarbonization in Lisbon next year. So

1007
00:52:42,718 --> 00:52:46,104
maybe you can cross the pond and check

1008
00:52:46,142 --> 00:52:48,196
for yourself that we have a nice airport

1009
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:49,690
in Lisbon. Yeah.

1010
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,472
Cool. Well, good to get the appetizer

1011
00:52:54,536 --> 00:52:56,780
before the entree. So that's very

1012
00:52:56,850 --> 00:53:00,572
awesome about just how much theory and

1013
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:03,032
even unconventional scientific theory,

1014
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,936
like world knowledge traditions come

1015
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:08,176
into play and then what it looks like to

1016
00:53:08,198 --> 00:53:10,944
take that experimental step to make it

1017
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:14,048
scientific is definitely what I saw in

1018
00:53:14,054 --> 00:53:17,156
the talk. Julia or Simone, do you want

1019
00:53:17,178 --> 00:53:19,696
to give any reflection or any thoughts

1020
00:53:19,728 --> 00:53:23,476
or questions? Yes. Can you hear me?

1021
00:53:23,578 --> 00:53:27,076
Yes. I actually have three questions I

1022
00:53:27,098 --> 00:53:30,048
noted down. I think the first one

1023
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:31,156
because it's just for me personally,

1024
00:53:31,188 --> 00:53:34,360
I'm curious about that is that those

1025
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:37,096
deep meditative selfless states I think

1026
00:53:37,118 --> 00:53:39,240
that can also be reached while doing

1027
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:42,868
yoga, right? Basically the opposite

1028
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:44,696
of sitting still. It's like a sort of

1029
00:53:44,718 --> 00:53:47,176
repetitive movement actually. So I'm

1030
00:53:47,198 --> 00:53:49,976
wondering do those movements have to be

1031
00:53:49,998 --> 00:53:51,448
perfectly predictable in order to be

1032
00:53:51,454 --> 00:53:52,904
attenuated and then reaching the same

1033
00:53:52,942 --> 00:53:54,160
state? Or is that like a different

1034
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:58,450
different concept or how do you put that

1035
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,160
in your framework?

1036
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:10,644
I think here you brought mainly two

1037
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:13,764
topics. One is, is it possible to reach

1038
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:17,616
deep matter states also not sitting

1039
00:54:17,648 --> 00:54:19,864
in a still position? And the answer is

1040
00:54:19,902 --> 00:54:20,490
yes.

1041
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,560
However, there is not so much research

1042
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,916
on that. So I can talk about anecdotal

1043
00:54:29,108 --> 00:54:32,360
knowledge, but I did

1044
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:35,556
not read so much about walking

1045
00:54:35,588 --> 00:54:38,296
meditation effect, usually walking

1046
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:41,484
meditation or of course you talk about

1047
00:54:41,522 --> 00:54:44,992
yoga. I know, but that's what I would

1048
00:54:45,046 --> 00:54:48,464
say, that walking meditation is used as

1049
00:54:48,502 --> 00:54:50,736
a complementary practice through the

1050
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:55,200
sitting. So I would say it's hard

1051
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:58,004
to reach deep meditative states only by

1052
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,140
walking meditation.

1053
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,156
In regarding to yoga, also yoga means

1054
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:08,736
unity. So what we think about yoga

1055
00:55:08,768 --> 00:55:11,628
now, we think about movement, but it's

1056
00:55:11,664 --> 00:55:15,492
always accompanied by reaching

1057
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:18,440
state of concentration through

1058
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:21,948
meditation. So you

1059
00:55:21,954 --> 00:55:23,672
cannot have yoga without meditation,

1060
00:55:23,736 --> 00:55:25,164
otherwise you'll be stretching or

1061
00:55:25,202 --> 00:55:28,940
pilates. But second

1062
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,764
topic is that can

1063
00:55:32,802 --> 00:55:35,576
it happen when you don't have prediction

1064
00:55:35,608 --> 00:55:38,956
of movement? Right? No, I meant

1065
00:55:38,988 --> 00:55:41,148
like because in yoga at least I don't

1066
00:55:41,164 --> 00:55:43,036
really do yoga, right? But I can imagine

1067
00:55:43,068 --> 00:55:45,168
that when people reach those states

1068
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:47,856
doing yoga, then they kind of do it

1069
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:50,096
almost like in a trance type of way.

1070
00:55:50,118 --> 00:55:51,344
They're always doing the same movement

1071
00:55:51,392 --> 00:55:53,076
over and over and over again so that

1072
00:55:53,098 --> 00:55:54,356
they don't have to attend to those

1073
00:55:54,378 --> 00:55:55,396
movements. But it's just like an

1074
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,276
automatic process. I was wondering if

1075
00:55:58,298 --> 00:56:00,950
that also can I jump in?

1076
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,416
Actually, this is precisely the

1077
00:56:03,438 --> 00:56:06,552
opposite. What Valerie was saying is so

1078
00:56:06,606 --> 00:56:08,856
Valerie was saying this is precisely the

1079
00:56:08,878 --> 00:56:10,484
opposite. You want to reach through yoga

1080
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:13,260
just like the opposite of automatic. So

1081
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:15,160
basically when you do this movements,

1082
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,316
you need to be united with yourself

1083
00:56:18,498 --> 00:56:26,008
doing it. So you really need to I'm

1084
00:56:26,024 --> 00:56:29,280
doing yoga so the past ten years and

1085
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,616
precisely this is like they're trying to

1086
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,492
tell us don't do it on automatic.

1087
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:35,968
Because it's like when you have your

1088
00:56:36,054 --> 00:56:37,744
thinking happening there and your body

1089
00:56:37,782 --> 00:56:40,036
is doing some stuff there, right. You

1090
00:56:40,058 --> 00:56:42,436
need to basically be presence in every

1091
00:56:42,538 --> 00:56:44,580
single type of moon. So you have like

1092
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:47,236
fully, fully presence if you do it

1093
00:56:47,258 --> 00:56:49,076
automatically, that's more like

1094
00:56:49,098 --> 00:56:52,576
gymnastic or something. But it's

1095
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:54,376
interesting. So your point is really

1096
00:56:54,398 --> 00:56:56,312
interesting because then would be really

1097
00:56:56,366 --> 00:56:58,344
nice to have a control condition where

1098
00:56:58,382 --> 00:57:00,244
we have people doing like movement,

1099
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:04,152
meditation and yoga and then contrast

1100
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:07,052
with the phenomena of some other sense

1101
00:57:07,106 --> 00:57:09,724
retenuation and whether they have what

1102
00:57:09,762 --> 00:57:11,756
type of embodiment and disembodiment and

1103
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:13,950
gentivity experiences they have.

1104
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,456
Okay, I don't know exactly what I was

1105
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,472
trying to get it. But I think it was

1106
00:57:21,526 --> 00:57:23,456
also more related to because you said

1107
00:57:23,478 --> 00:57:25,570
that when meditating you have to sort of

1108
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,624
let yourself letting go. Letting go,

1109
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:30,260
exactly. And the idea is that everything

1110
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,304
has to be perfectly sort of predictable,

1111
00:57:32,352 --> 00:57:34,580
right? That's the idea behind it. So

1112
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:38,272
then I'm thinking so within yoga,

1113
00:57:38,336 --> 00:57:40,504
don't you have to do the exact same

1114
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:41,816
movements in order for it to be

1115
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:44,200
predictable, in order for you to let go

1116
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,356
and not overatten to the environment?

1117
00:57:46,468 --> 00:57:47,690
Does that make sense?

1118
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,804
I thought when we both and Simon were

1119
00:57:53,842 --> 00:57:56,204
speaking I think on one side you,

1120
00:57:56,242 --> 00:57:58,430
Simon, maybe you're referring to the

1121
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,404
implicit procedural knowledge that you

1122
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:08,788
can acquire through yoga and you, Ana,

1123
00:58:08,824 --> 00:58:11,648
are talking about doing things without

1124
00:58:11,734 --> 00:58:15,440
being aware, which is also automatic and

1125
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,016
left. And you both are right, I think in

1126
00:58:18,038 --> 00:58:21,364
this because on one Anna, you would

1127
00:58:21,402 --> 00:58:24,244
say like if you do yoga, you learn how

1128
00:58:24,282 --> 00:58:27,924
to do yoga, right? So you learn how

1129
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:31,830
to move yourself

1130
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,424
in this way so that when you do a

1131
00:58:34,462 --> 00:58:36,664
certain position that you have to

1132
00:58:36,702 --> 00:58:38,088
arrange your body and for arrange your

1133
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:39,864
dirty, you always have to keep

1134
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:42,236
monitoring yourself. So there is a

1135
00:58:42,258 --> 00:58:44,988
continuous going back to your body,

1136
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:48,572
keeping track of your body and continue

1137
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:51,388
to monitor yourself. But in this way

1138
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:55,070
because you have learned to do this

1139
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,736
going back and being aware on yourself.

1140
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:01,344
And this comes also when you do your

1141
00:59:01,382 --> 00:59:03,424
movement, you have learned that certain

1142
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:06,544
posture are made in a certain way so

1143
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:09,440
that it becomes more or less predictable

1144
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,364
actually what you're going to do.

1145
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:13,684
Right. But it doesn't mean that you

1146
00:59:13,722 --> 00:59:15,828
don't have to be awareness and actually

1147
00:59:15,914 --> 00:59:18,756
there is a trick ribbon here because

1148
00:59:18,858 --> 00:59:21,056
you're very attentive with what's going

1149
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:23,668
on but at the same time the more you're

1150
00:59:23,684 --> 00:59:25,956
attentive, the more somatosensory

1151
00:59:25,988 --> 00:59:28,072
attenuation may happen. And actually

1152
00:59:28,126 --> 00:59:30,456
it's what we are trying to argue in our

1153
00:59:30,558 --> 00:59:34,300
active inference model. The more

1154
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,940
predictable it gets, the more it gets

1155
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,728
attenuated, but doesn't mean that you're

1156
00:59:38,744 --> 00:59:39,660
not aware.

1157
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,732
Thank you for this input because it

1158
00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:47,608
helps us elaborate this. I think it's

1159
00:59:47,624 --> 00:59:50,396
super interesting because it's like when

1160
00:59:50,418 --> 00:59:52,736
you look at people that climb or surf or

1161
00:59:52,758 --> 00:59:54,496
whatever, any type of sports, right? In

1162
00:59:54,518 --> 00:59:55,648
the beginning, in order to learn the

1163
00:59:55,654 --> 00:59:56,656
skill, you have to put a lot of

1164
00:59:56,678 --> 00:59:58,380
attention to the individual movements

1165
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,936
but then later on, in order to actually

1166
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:01,108
be good at it, you have to take the

1167
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:03,124
attention away. And then in those

1168
01:00:03,162 --> 01:00:04,756
moments is when the people report that

1169
01:00:04,778 --> 01:00:05,924
they're actually feeling sort of

1170
01:00:05,962 --> 01:00:09,316
selfless states and these flow is when

1171
01:00:09,418 --> 01:00:11,568
the movements are internalized, so to

1172
01:00:11,594 --> 01:00:13,944
speak. I think that's super interesting.

1173
01:00:14,142 --> 01:00:15,592
Can I just shoot the other two questions

1174
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,704
I had? They're sort of different or

1175
01:00:17,742 --> 01:00:20,376
should we go to Julia first? Maybe it's

1176
01:00:20,398 --> 01:00:21,160
Julia.

1177
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,616
Hi, sorry. Yeah, sorry for the lighting

1178
01:00:26,648 --> 01:00:28,316
and sorry because I'm in the lab, so

1179
01:00:28,338 --> 01:00:30,190
it's probably not the best position.

1180
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,348
Thank you. Varia it was very interesting

1181
01:00:32,434 --> 01:00:35,936
and I'm really looking forward to look

1182
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:39,584
at the results you have in your study.

1183
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:42,736
Especially since as Anna mentioned, we

1184
01:00:42,758 --> 01:00:44,336
had something interesting with the

1185
01:00:44,438 --> 01:00:45,536
international binding and

1186
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:49,056
depersonalization and yeah, kind of

1187
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,892
happy about that. I'm really sorry

1188
01:00:51,946 --> 01:00:54,372
because I listened kind of doing

1189
01:00:54,426 --> 01:00:56,132
something else. Unfortunately in the lab

1190
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:58,996
I was busy while you were talking. But I

1191
01:00:59,018 --> 01:01:02,372
kind of like this idea. Yeah. Does the

1192
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:05,340
self is attenuated or not or increasing

1193
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,892
and kind of goes back to just Simon.

1194
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,912
The last comment from Simon about

1195
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:13,176
expertise. I think in

1196
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:16,264
term of motor interaction there is some

1197
01:01:16,302 --> 01:01:19,484
literal jobability expert. I was trying

1198
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:22,716
to Google that, but I attended a

1199
01:01:22,738 --> 01:01:25,176
workshop last year, and I think it was

1200
01:01:25,218 --> 01:01:27,440
about once you're an expert.

1201
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,416
At the beginning, you have this kind of

1202
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:33,564
flexible you have a better understanding

1203
01:01:33,612 --> 01:01:35,712
consciousness, and then at the end, you

1204
01:01:35,846 --> 01:01:38,436
kind of learn to let it go, to ride the

1205
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:40,790
flow of the motion, kind of.

1206
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,748
And I think it's probably the same. I

1207
01:01:43,754 --> 01:01:47,136
don't know about attention in meditation

1208
01:01:47,248 --> 01:01:49,924
is that you have to maybe more like not

1209
01:01:49,962 --> 01:01:53,304
focus attentional state but more

1210
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,890
like open.

1211
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,024
Sorry, I forgot the name of the

1212
01:01:58,062 --> 01:01:59,784
meditation type of meditation. But open

1213
01:01:59,822 --> 01:02:02,184
meditation, open monitoring. Yeah,

1214
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:05,256
exactly. I don't know. So it would be

1215
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:09,964
interesting and I suggested to see what

1216
01:02:10,002 --> 01:02:12,412
type of meditation maybe changed the

1217
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:13,708
sense of the self. Maybe at the

1218
01:02:13,714 --> 01:02:15,264
beginning it's more acute because you

1219
01:02:15,302 --> 01:02:18,080
really scrutinize your sensation.

1220
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,456
I don't know. This is something that you

1221
01:02:21,478 --> 01:02:22,610
plan to do, right?

1222
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:31,490
Should I go or do you want to go on the

1223
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,816
the first question was there

1224
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:38,976
is a body of evidence that actually say

1225
01:02:38,998 --> 01:02:42,472
that in expert meditators tension start

1226
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:46,056
decreasing. But there is also

1227
01:02:46,238 --> 01:02:48,984
because you allocate less and less

1228
01:02:49,022 --> 01:02:51,384
attention. But I would be careful with

1229
01:02:51,422 --> 01:02:54,764
that with this because they

1230
01:02:54,802 --> 01:02:58,264
say there is decreased

1231
01:02:58,312 --> 01:03:01,260
activity in anterior singleet cortex.

1232
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:07,650
So they make inference about it as

1233
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:11,360
meditators as well. And having

1234
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,712
to know other people that are more

1235
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:16,512
experienced than me, they would never

1236
01:03:16,566 --> 01:03:18,340
say we lose our attention to that

1237
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:21,364
because our experience is so rich of

1238
01:03:21,402 --> 01:03:23,684
sensory signals and related thought

1239
01:03:23,722 --> 01:03:27,124
process that you cannot afford to not be

1240
01:03:27,162 --> 01:03:30,024
attentive. However, we can bring into

1241
01:03:30,062 --> 01:03:31,956
the plate different kinds of attention.

1242
01:03:32,068 --> 01:03:34,836
As you said, there is focused attention

1243
01:03:35,028 --> 01:03:37,300
or there's an attention that requires

1244
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,048
more explicit thought about it.

1245
01:03:41,134 --> 01:03:44,504
So more explicit kind of way to

1246
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:47,364
focus on things and there is more like a

1247
01:03:47,502 --> 01:03:50,908
bare attention. So when you focus on the

1248
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,036
whole experience and you let it go with

1249
01:03:53,138 --> 01:03:57,232
a non judgmental attitude and more open

1250
01:03:57,286 --> 01:03:58,592
attitude and it's actually these

1251
01:03:58,646 --> 01:04:00,656
attitudes, they're very stressed in

1252
01:04:00,678 --> 01:04:02,256
meditation techniques, that's why

1253
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:04,816
they're a bit underlooked. And in

1254
01:04:04,838 --> 01:04:08,004
research I feel because it's a lot about

1255
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:10,404
how we use attention but not the

1256
01:04:10,602 --> 01:04:13,552
attention but not how we use intention.

1257
01:04:13,696 --> 01:04:17,236
So the

1258
01:04:17,258 --> 01:04:19,172
attitude of the meditator has to be very

1259
01:04:19,226 --> 01:04:21,972
open and very non judgmental and these

1260
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:24,856
reduce the nonreactive senses for

1261
01:04:24,878 --> 01:04:28,296
example and reduce the ability to

1262
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:30,650
self regulate your experience.

1263
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,812
Partially answered. Yeah,

1264
01:04:36,946 --> 01:04:38,796
I kind of like the idea that you link

1265
01:04:38,818 --> 01:04:41,756
that with attention and just I think

1266
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:43,532
maybe it would be interesting to look at

1267
01:04:43,586 --> 01:04:45,490
different type of attention because

1268
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,648
maybe there is a difference between I

1269
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,532
don't know, different type of meditation

1270
01:04:53,596 --> 01:04:57,088
may develop different type of maybe the

1271
01:04:57,174 --> 01:05:00,544
open meditation is more

1272
01:05:00,582 --> 01:05:01,808
prone. I don't know because you

1273
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,348
mentioned the insula cortex and to me

1274
01:05:03,354 --> 01:05:06,004
it's more associated with certain type

1275
01:05:06,042 --> 01:05:09,652
of attention. Like more like maybe more

1276
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:13,312
prone for feedback or negativity

1277
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,956
or these kind of error monitoring

1278
01:05:15,988 --> 01:05:17,976
process. So it's not like your

1279
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:19,092
attention, you lose your attention.

1280
01:05:19,156 --> 01:05:20,776
It's just it's more like in the

1281
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:22,696
background and then when there is a

1282
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:25,196
mistake or something it kind of pops up

1283
01:05:25,298 --> 01:05:27,644
more quickly. I don't know. And you may

1284
01:05:27,682 --> 01:05:31,020
have more frontal or

1285
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:33,004
sustain attention. I don't know. I mean

1286
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:34,556
I'm not a specialist of attention at

1287
01:05:34,578 --> 01:05:36,656
all. So please take that with a grain of

1288
01:05:36,678 --> 01:05:39,616
salt. Yeah. I was wondering if this is

1289
01:05:39,638 --> 01:05:41,376
something, I don't know obviously

1290
01:05:41,558 --> 01:05:44,352
because you're not planning to do any

1291
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:48,332
EEG or neurophysiological

1292
01:05:48,396 --> 01:05:51,456
measurement. Right. So this is maybe

1293
01:05:51,558 --> 01:05:53,556
like a follow up study that would be

1294
01:05:53,578 --> 01:05:55,270
interesting. Not yet,

1295
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,264
but in the pipeline. Yeah. Okay.

1296
01:06:00,382 --> 01:06:04,490
What we really want with Valeria is

1297
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,704
and other collaborators is to basically

1298
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:13,260
push against this idea that you can have

1299
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,848
selfless experiences. I know it's

1300
01:06:15,864 --> 01:06:17,932
controversial and many people talk about

1301
01:06:17,986 --> 01:06:20,220
oh, selfless experience blah.

1302
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,832
So basically we want to say radically

1303
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,536
speaking okay, so that works if you bite

1304
01:06:26,568 --> 01:06:28,284
the bullet and you're mind body dualist

1305
01:06:28,332 --> 01:06:30,048
and somehow consider that actually the

1306
01:06:30,054 --> 01:06:31,488
body kind of like disappears in the

1307
01:06:31,494 --> 01:06:33,232
process. But if you're not mind body

1308
01:06:33,286 --> 01:06:36,544
dualist then you need to basically put

1309
01:06:36,582 --> 01:06:39,412
the body into equation and realize that

1310
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:42,036
actually what allows the mind to

1311
01:06:42,058 --> 01:06:45,024
disappear is the fact into the pureness

1312
01:06:45,072 --> 01:06:47,364
of the experience is the fact that the

1313
01:06:47,402 --> 01:06:50,644
impure body is kind of like put in

1314
01:06:50,682 --> 01:06:53,576
a stable condition in such a way that

1315
01:06:53,598 --> 01:06:54,888
basically you can afford to leave it in

1316
01:06:54,894 --> 01:06:58,552
the background and to have this type of

1317
01:06:58,686 --> 01:07:01,224
experience arising. But without that in

1318
01:07:01,262 --> 01:07:04,952
place you can't really afford to

1319
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:07,848
go through this selfless experiences.

1320
01:07:07,944 --> 01:07:09,276
And this is why we want to be

1321
01:07:09,298 --> 01:07:11,052
provocative in the titles that well

1322
01:07:11,106 --> 01:07:14,510
actually maybe the experience of

1323
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:19,088
selfless experiences actually comes

1324
01:07:19,254 --> 01:07:22,604
necessarily as two sign of the same coin

1325
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:25,520
of this experience of having an

1326
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:28,944
unlimited body that actually expands

1327
01:07:29,072 --> 01:07:30,836
through the world. But the body is

1328
01:07:30,858 --> 01:07:34,180
there. I mean the thing, the entity that

1329
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,910
has the experience of no experience

1330
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,024
is that a body that kind of

1331
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:45,400
is self regulated in a certain way

1332
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:47,704
like the homeostasis is put at like a

1333
01:07:47,742 --> 01:07:50,104
set point. And when you're using this

1334
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:53,996
metaphor of think of a

1335
01:07:54,018 --> 01:07:56,108
cyclone, right, moving cyclone so you

1336
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,636
have the steel eye of the cyclone in the

1337
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,156
middle doesn't mean that actually it's

1338
01:08:00,178 --> 01:08:03,676
not there. It's just like it's around

1339
01:08:03,778 --> 01:08:06,160
everything. And because we are self

1340
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:08,320
organizing biological systems.

1341
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,216
This animal, this thing needs to keep

1342
01:08:13,238 --> 01:08:15,280
track of this internal bodily states.

1343
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:19,028
And a successful system does this

1344
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:22,144
all the time. All the time, literally

1345
01:08:22,192 --> 01:08:24,884
from second one, when we basically get

1346
01:08:24,922 --> 01:08:28,212
from one cell to the self. So this is

1347
01:08:28,266 --> 01:08:30,804
some sort of fascinating self

1348
01:08:30,842 --> 01:08:32,276
organization that is happening on the

1349
01:08:32,298 --> 01:08:34,948
cellular level already and it needs to

1350
01:08:34,954 --> 01:08:37,336
be. And death is basically this is what

1351
01:08:37,358 --> 01:08:39,284
is happening. It's like disintegration

1352
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:42,600
of this self organization.

1353
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,676
But clearly that's not what is happening

1354
01:08:45,778 --> 01:08:48,376
on meditation, right? Because hopefully

1355
01:08:48,408 --> 01:08:50,780
you don't die when you meditate. In that

1356
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,388
sense. There is disintegration of a

1357
01:08:53,394 --> 01:08:55,436
certain way to experience yourself in

1358
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:57,452
relation to the body in the world, but

1359
01:08:57,506 --> 01:08:59,276
clearly there's something that stays

1360
01:08:59,308 --> 01:09:01,008
there and needs to stay there for you to

1361
01:09:01,014 --> 01:09:02,896
have those experiences. So that's a bit

1362
01:09:02,918 --> 01:09:05,216
of controversial, radical claim that we

1363
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:07,796
like to defend. And yeah, we already had

1364
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:10,390
this discussion with several people.

1365
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,500
For instance, like Valerie and I, we

1366
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:16,150
went to Enlightenment, this workshop on

1367
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,364
phrenology neurocompetition. We met

1368
01:09:19,402 --> 01:09:21,248
there with people like Thomas Betziger

1369
01:09:21,264 --> 01:09:22,708
and everything and obviously they have a

1370
01:09:22,714 --> 01:09:24,264
different opinion. So we kind of, like,

1371
01:09:24,302 --> 01:09:26,024
have a lively discussion about why we

1372
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:29,464
think it's like, what does it mean

1373
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:31,096
to actually lose yourself and what is

1374
01:09:31,118 --> 01:09:33,256
the self and what is a pure experience

1375
01:09:33,358 --> 01:09:36,056
and why we basically need whether we're

1376
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,804
like it or not, the connection with the

1377
01:09:37,842 --> 01:09:40,524
impure body to make sure that you can

1378
01:09:40,562 --> 01:09:42,104
have, at a certain point, a pure

1379
01:09:42,152 --> 01:09:44,716
experience. But then again, this is

1380
01:09:44,738 --> 01:09:46,448
something that just speculation at the

1381
01:09:46,454 --> 01:09:48,864
theory level. And this is why I have

1382
01:09:48,902 --> 01:09:51,952
this brilliant team here that we can do

1383
01:09:52,006 --> 01:09:55,632
some studies and actually measure stuff,

1384
01:09:55,686 --> 01:09:58,164
put the finger on it, put the number and

1385
01:09:58,202 --> 01:10:00,790
see what we get.

1386
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,388
These are awesome points and there's so

1387
01:10:06,394 --> 01:10:08,116
many ways it could go. I'll read a

1388
01:10:08,138 --> 01:10:11,752
question from the live chat. So G

1389
01:10:11,806 --> 01:10:15,272
Pagnani wrote, the notion of

1390
01:10:15,326 --> 01:10:17,944
increased Somatosensory transparency in

1391
01:10:17,982 --> 01:10:20,232
experienced meditators associated with

1392
01:10:20,286 --> 01:10:22,428
increased liveliness of the experience

1393
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:25,084
is intriguing. Can you say something

1394
01:10:25,202 --> 01:10:27,912
about which levels in the hierarchical

1395
01:10:27,976 --> 01:10:31,244
structure of the internal model are more

1396
01:10:31,282 --> 01:10:33,832
likely to be affected by the meditative

1397
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,996
attentional task in terms of precision

1398
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:38,380
deployment? Do you think the attenuation

1399
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,652
of Somatosensory prediction error

1400
01:10:40,716 --> 01:10:43,728
concerns more intermediate levels in a

1401
01:10:43,734 --> 01:10:46,384
way increase meta awareness rather than

1402
01:10:46,422 --> 01:10:48,260
sheer sensory attention?

1403
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,964
I can take this one. So I

1404
01:10:55,002 --> 01:10:57,796
can give a fuzz go and then you can go.

1405
01:10:57,978 --> 01:10:59,832
No, I just wanted to ask rather than

1406
01:10:59,886 --> 01:11:00,680
ensuring.

1407
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,040
Rather than sheer sensory attention.

1408
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,290
Yeah, you can go on now, please.

1409
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,024
Yeah, so this is something I'm

1410
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:18,812
trying to develop this idea right now

1411
01:11:18,866 --> 01:11:22,796
with a PhD student of

1412
01:11:22,818 --> 01:11:23,420
mine,

1413
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,336
Libetise, basically. And this is why

1414
01:11:28,358 --> 01:11:29,744
it's connected with the question that

1415
01:11:29,782 --> 01:11:35,968
you ask, you'll see, is that your

1416
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:37,936
platform is active inference, right?

1417
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:42,384
And so people kind of know lately

1418
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:44,064
kind of realize, wait a minute,

1419
01:11:44,112 --> 01:11:45,988
actually we are active and we need to

1420
01:11:45,994 --> 01:11:47,396
explain action in the world and

1421
01:11:47,418 --> 01:11:49,184
everything kind of like comes late,

1422
01:11:49,232 --> 01:11:51,896
right? But if you look going back to the

1423
01:11:51,918 --> 01:11:55,096
animal, basically the action and the

1424
01:11:55,118 --> 01:11:56,856
movement is there from the very

1425
01:11:56,878 --> 01:11:58,696
beginning. So this means that this is

1426
01:11:58,718 --> 01:12:00,536
why it's so important to basically

1427
01:12:00,718 --> 01:12:04,664
relate the self organization,

1428
01:12:04,792 --> 01:12:06,664
self awareness, self perception

1429
01:12:06,792 --> 01:12:09,996
necessarily related with movement. So

1430
01:12:10,018 --> 01:12:12,716
movement an action is not something that

1431
01:12:12,738 --> 01:12:15,244
you add on the top of this, right? Like

1432
01:12:15,362 --> 01:12:18,236
some of intention. So you can have an

1433
01:12:18,258 --> 01:12:19,696
intention, but basically the first

1434
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:21,376
movements are kind of like automatic and

1435
01:12:21,398 --> 01:12:22,960
need to be there, right? And basically

1436
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:25,344
our body moves all the time because we

1437
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,804
breathe all the time and our heart beats

1438
01:12:27,852 --> 01:12:30,212
all the time. So this means that for me,

1439
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:33,604
this type of attenuation is happening at

1440
01:12:33,642 --> 01:12:35,796
the sensory level because that's the

1441
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:38,372
basic one. So can you have sensory stuff

1442
01:12:38,426 --> 01:12:40,744
without metacognitive stuff? Yes. Can

1443
01:12:40,782 --> 01:12:42,152
you have metacognitive stuff without

1444
01:12:42,206 --> 01:12:44,824
sensory stuff? No. So it's like what is

1445
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:46,936
basic that's the first things needs to

1446
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:50,164
be attenuated

1447
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:53,332
and then there has to be a balance

1448
01:12:53,396 --> 01:12:55,316
between metacognitive and sensory

1449
01:12:55,428 --> 01:12:57,944
attenuation because this is precisely

1450
01:12:57,992 --> 01:12:59,196
what I think it is happening in

1451
01:12:59,218 --> 01:13:02,428
Depersonalization because if you focus

1452
01:13:02,514 --> 01:13:06,140
too much, right? So you lose the balance

1453
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:12,668
between then it's

1454
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:16,236
kind of like this type of you cannot

1455
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:19,876
afford to self forget yourself. And then

1456
01:13:19,898 --> 01:13:21,316
it's kind of like the self stands in the

1457
01:13:21,338 --> 01:13:23,348
way and that gets you even more

1458
01:13:23,434 --> 01:13:27,236
disconnected, so to speak. So this is

1459
01:13:27,258 --> 01:13:30,884
why I think it's important to contrast

1460
01:13:30,932 --> 01:13:34,052
different type of meditative experiences

1461
01:13:34,196 --> 01:13:36,264
and meditative practices to see which

1462
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:40,600
one of them actually has more focus on

1463
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:43,444
what you do with metacognitive,

1464
01:13:43,492 --> 01:13:45,564
metawareness awareness of awareness and

1465
01:13:45,602 --> 01:13:47,308
which one are actually involving more

1466
01:13:47,394 --> 01:13:49,128
like sensory movement, for instance,

1467
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,292
let's say. Yeah, so that's something

1468
01:13:51,346 --> 01:13:53,496
that needs to be empirically tested.

1469
01:13:53,528 --> 01:13:56,112
But I would speculate and then obviously

1470
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:58,368
we can put it at test, either by doing a

1471
01:13:58,374 --> 01:14:01,344
simulation or actually collecting data

1472
01:14:01,462 --> 01:14:05,184
to see how that plays into

1473
01:14:05,382 --> 01:14:07,120
this distinction.

1474
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,984
I think Simon wants to say something,

1475
01:14:14,102 --> 01:14:15,836
but I'm not the moderator. So Daniel,

1476
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:19,090
you decide. Yeah. Valeria first.

1477
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,480
Thank you, Anna.

1478
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,204
I don't have so much more to say because

1479
01:14:29,242 --> 01:14:33,270
I agree with her. But I thought

1480
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,576
when Daniel you were reading the

1481
01:14:35,598 --> 01:14:39,048
question for me the answer was

1482
01:14:39,214 --> 01:14:42,584
more or less clear in the sense that as

1483
01:14:42,622 --> 01:14:45,348
I say, the Somatosens continuation

1484
01:14:45,444 --> 01:14:48,408
happens the very low level predictions.

1485
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:51,884
So in a very pre

1486
01:14:51,922 --> 01:14:55,468
reflective self consciousness, so that

1487
01:14:55,634 --> 01:15:01,456
the person was asking in

1488
01:15:01,478 --> 01:15:04,576
the meditation techniques, when you put

1489
01:15:04,598 --> 01:15:06,144
the attention on, for example, your

1490
01:15:06,182 --> 01:15:09,344
bodily signals there, you have a top

1491
01:15:09,382 --> 01:15:12,524
down modulation of this, of precision

1492
01:15:12,572 --> 01:15:15,364
wasting, but the top down modulation is

1493
01:15:15,402 --> 01:15:18,004
on low level predictions. So you're not

1494
01:15:18,042 --> 01:15:20,596
putting top down on what you think about

1495
01:15:20,618 --> 01:15:22,596
your body is you're actually doing the

1496
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,776
opposite. You're trying to forget about

1497
01:15:24,878 --> 01:15:28,952
your previous expectations about

1498
01:15:29,006 --> 01:15:31,064
the body because you're trying to have

1499
01:15:31,102 --> 01:15:33,464
this non judgmental awareness about

1500
01:15:33,502 --> 01:15:36,044
what's going on in your experience. And

1501
01:15:36,082 --> 01:15:38,270
then with this,

1502
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,804
let's say, less biased way

1503
01:15:43,842 --> 01:15:46,920
to attend your body. You start piercing

1504
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,600
and perceiving bodily

1505
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,712
sensations in your body or other

1506
01:15:55,766 --> 01:15:59,936
kind of experiences. So I would say this

1507
01:16:00,038 --> 01:16:02,992
increasing precision on somatosensory

1508
01:16:03,056 --> 01:16:05,796
signals happens at the low level of the

1509
01:16:05,818 --> 01:16:09,156
Yerarchy that then attenuates the

1510
01:16:09,178 --> 01:16:12,980
sensory consequences of the

1511
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:17,216
posterior. And the meta

1512
01:16:17,248 --> 01:16:21,130
awareness comes when you learn,

1513
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,956
I think, when you start having increased

1514
01:16:26,068 --> 01:16:28,956
body awareness. So you make more

1515
01:16:28,978 --> 01:16:31,340
experience. I think then you start

1516
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:35,228
developing meta awareness about how your

1517
01:16:35,314 --> 01:16:39,856
body is actually about higher

1518
01:16:40,038 --> 01:16:42,448
representation of the body of your body.

1519
01:16:42,534 --> 01:16:45,536
But in the moment when this happens, I

1520
01:16:45,558 --> 01:16:47,456
think it really happens at the low

1521
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:50,080
level, subpersonal beliefs. And then

1522
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,528
later on, on the longer time scales,

1523
01:16:52,624 --> 01:16:56,228
then it starts becoming more

1524
01:16:56,394 --> 01:17:00,756
abstract and ingrained at

1525
01:17:00,778 --> 01:17:02,740
the personal level of your beliefs.

1526
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,504
That's how I say it. But of course, if

1527
01:17:06,542 --> 01:17:09,316
Simon has something to do with it, it's

1528
01:17:09,348 --> 01:17:12,328
really I. Didn'T I didn't want to

1529
01:17:12,334 --> 01:17:14,296
comment. I just selfishly raised my hand

1530
01:17:14,318 --> 01:17:17,464
to. Ask another question or Daniel,

1531
01:17:17,512 --> 01:17:19,036
I don't know if you have an opinion on

1532
01:17:19,058 --> 01:17:20,910
that. I'm happy to hear it as well.

1533
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,768
Well, certainly resonated

1534
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:28,944
with this comparative approach to

1535
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:32,876
studying the diversity of methods

1536
01:17:32,908 --> 01:17:35,152
and protocols we already have for mind

1537
01:17:35,206 --> 01:17:38,016
and body and attention, broadening the

1538
01:17:38,038 --> 01:17:41,396
scope and just kind of putting darts in

1539
01:17:41,418 --> 01:17:44,132
the space of what practices do people

1540
01:17:44,186 --> 01:17:46,950
engage their mind and body in?

1541
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,244
And then, how can that territory be

1542
01:17:50,282 --> 01:17:53,012
explored with also a variety of

1543
01:17:53,066 --> 01:17:55,944
theoretical models? And how does that

1544
01:17:56,062 --> 01:17:58,104
relationship connect to the kinds of

1545
01:17:58,142 --> 01:18:00,088
empirical work that we might do in a

1546
01:18:00,094 --> 01:18:02,616
brain scanner or with other kinds of

1547
01:18:02,638 --> 01:18:06,250
measuring? And I think one thing

1548
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:11,208
I want to explore more

1549
01:18:11,294 --> 01:18:14,712
is in a hierarchical nested cognitive

1550
01:18:14,776 --> 01:18:17,080
model, which we often speak of ourselves

1551
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,892
and other types of sophisticated

1552
01:18:20,956 --> 01:18:25,356
entities as where's our awareness?

1553
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:28,240
Where's awareness in that picture?

1554
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,116
And also to Simone's question about when

1555
01:18:36,138 --> 01:18:40,688
we're moving, but we're expecting

1556
01:18:40,784 --> 01:18:43,736
what we're moving, then how does the

1557
01:18:43,758 --> 01:18:47,012
exteriorceptive flow? Like the visual

1558
01:18:47,076 --> 01:18:48,952
field? You might be very familiar with

1559
01:18:49,006 --> 01:18:51,704
walking, and so you might be able to

1560
01:18:51,742 --> 01:18:55,080
proprioceptively kind of zero out on

1561
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:58,280
your walking, but there's this

1562
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:02,072
exteriorceptive flow of novelty

1563
01:19:02,136 --> 01:19:06,924
in the world. So I think that how and

1564
01:19:06,962 --> 01:19:09,052
then connect it back to the comparative

1565
01:19:09,116 --> 01:19:11,132
and staring at a candle or a blank

1566
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:12,864
screen or darkness and all these

1567
01:19:12,902 --> 01:19:14,080
different methods.

1568
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,972
There's a lot that these questions bring

1569
01:19:22,026 --> 01:19:25,972
up. Yeah. Thank you, Daniel. So I have

1570
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:27,348
something to add to that because I think

1571
01:19:27,354 --> 01:19:33,044
it's super know,

1572
01:19:33,082 --> 01:19:34,448
my background is like, embodied

1573
01:19:34,464 --> 01:19:35,936
cognition and activists and everything.

1574
01:19:35,978 --> 01:19:37,416
And for me, it's really not at all

1575
01:19:37,438 --> 01:19:39,784
surprising the fact that many of these

1576
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:41,864
techniques have been developed by people

1577
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:44,340
that kind of, like, lived in closed

1578
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:47,404
communities. Right. So it's like you

1579
01:19:47,442 --> 01:19:52,184
have a space where people can meditate

1580
01:19:52,312 --> 01:19:54,396
walking. I don't know. And then they

1581
01:19:54,418 --> 01:19:56,076
have this ritual. They wake up at this

1582
01:19:56,098 --> 01:19:58,844
time and they do this thing. So you put

1583
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:01,024
yourself in yeah, it's a ritual. Right.

1584
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:04,144
Like all the rituals. So this means,

1585
01:20:04,262 --> 01:20:05,424
as I said, it's like high

1586
01:20:05,462 --> 01:20:09,056
predictability. Right. And then

1587
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:12,356
that's something super important. And

1588
01:20:12,538 --> 01:20:15,764
even in the Wokie meditation, you need

1589
01:20:15,802 --> 01:20:18,260
to follow a certain path.

1590
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,470
Yes. So that's super interesting.

1591
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:29,704
Well, in the last five

1592
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:31,752
or ten minutes, I would love to hear

1593
01:20:31,806 --> 01:20:33,944
from each of you, like, what are your

1594
01:20:33,982 --> 01:20:39,336
directions heading forward and what's

1595
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:41,084
exciting to you and where would you like

1596
01:20:41,122 --> 01:20:45,704
to take this? Maybe Simone

1597
01:20:45,752 --> 01:20:47,676
and Julia first, and then we'll kind of

1598
01:20:47,778 --> 01:20:49,470
make our way back to the.

1599
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,128
Not myself, not working on the project.

1600
01:20:56,214 --> 01:20:59,008
Right. But what I was really interested

1601
01:20:59,094 --> 01:21:01,364
in sort of extending this is trying to

1602
01:21:01,402 --> 01:21:04,550
understand because

1603
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,244
the way those deep meditative states are

1604
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:13,424
reported sometimes and the way people

1605
01:21:13,482 --> 01:21:16,168
with depersonalization disorder report

1606
01:21:16,254 --> 01:21:18,680
their experience is very similar. They

1607
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,808
almost use, like, the same words right.

1608
01:21:20,974 --> 01:21:23,128
And to describe how they feel. And I

1609
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:26,084
wonder why one is experienced positively

1610
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:28,008
and one is experienced so negatively,

1611
01:21:28,104 --> 01:21:30,236
as in it being a disorder and in

1612
01:21:30,258 --> 01:21:32,140
completely disrupting someone's life.

1613
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:35,116
So that was like this comparison I think

1614
01:21:35,138 --> 01:21:37,230
I'll be very curious about.

1615
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,076
Awesome. Julia, if you want to add

1616
01:21:44,098 --> 01:21:44,670
anything.

1617
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,390
Well, it's very interesting.

1618
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,024
Again, I'm not so involved in this

1619
01:21:53,062 --> 01:21:55,068
study, so it's a bit hard, but I'm

1620
01:21:55,084 --> 01:21:58,384
really interested in all the self is

1621
01:21:58,422 --> 01:22:00,848
affected by our interaction with the

1622
01:22:00,854 --> 01:22:03,964
world, external world, and I'm

1623
01:22:04,012 --> 01:22:05,684
completely already spoiled with the

1624
01:22:05,722 --> 01:22:07,744
result we have with the international

1625
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:13,220
binding. So it's very if

1626
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:16,464
the self is attenuated or if it's

1627
01:22:16,512 --> 01:22:18,536
disappeared, kind of I think that's the

1628
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:21,690
key question we want to answer. And

1629
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,456
yeah, I would be very curious to mean

1630
01:22:24,478 --> 01:22:28,216
what Valeria found in data to

1631
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:30,164
see if we can have a common narrative

1632
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:32,776
about what's happening. Also with the

1633
01:22:32,798 --> 01:22:35,996
personalization. Yeah. It's very

1634
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:39,020
interesting to see how moving of body,

1635
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:42,864
attention to the body can really change

1636
01:22:42,902 --> 01:22:44,640
the self, kind of or the way we process

1637
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:48,144
self information. Yeah. So very

1638
01:22:48,182 --> 01:22:48,770
interesting.

1639
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,640
Cool. Anna.

1640
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,932
Yes. So it's like lots of work

1641
01:22:58,986 --> 01:23:00,848
to do ahead, but that's exciting,

1642
01:23:00,944 --> 01:23:05,140
right? Yeah. So, very short

1643
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:07,892
term, it's like we need to write up this

1644
01:23:07,946 --> 01:23:11,384
result that we just got. So yeah. In

1645
01:23:11,422 --> 01:23:12,696
relation to the body. So basically,

1646
01:23:12,718 --> 01:23:14,104
we're going to have some numbers to

1647
01:23:14,142 --> 01:23:17,496
show. So that's super nice. And then the

1648
01:23:17,518 --> 01:23:24,204
next steps would be to create

1649
01:23:24,322 --> 01:23:27,820
or develop computational model around

1650
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:31,624
this, basically contrast

1651
01:23:31,752 --> 01:23:34,350
the real world data with, you know,

1652
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:39,424
simulation data and then have

1653
01:23:39,462 --> 01:23:41,792
a multilayered type of approach with

1654
01:23:41,846 --> 01:23:44,464
different methods, from physiological to

1655
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:46,544
behavioral to phenomenological to

1656
01:23:46,582 --> 01:23:48,764
computational, potentially also neural.

1657
01:23:48,812 --> 01:23:51,364
So that's something would be nice to do

1658
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:52,660
in the next steps.

1659
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,184
And apart from that, I think that's all

1660
01:23:58,222 --> 01:24:02,280
for now, and I'll leave

1661
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:04,280
the floor to Valeria.

1662
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,128
Well, again, thank you, Dan and

1663
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:12,636
everybody. Yeah. I also want to

1664
01:24:12,658 --> 01:24:14,684
thank you a lot for this platform, this

1665
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:17,404
invitation. It was really nice. Really

1666
01:24:17,442 --> 01:24:19,164
nice person and really nice

1667
01:24:19,202 --> 01:24:23,128
conversation. I'm working with Anne

1668
01:24:23,144 --> 01:24:24,944
Andy's project, so she already said,

1669
01:24:25,062 --> 01:24:28,096
what's the next direction? What. I can

1670
01:24:28,118 --> 01:24:31,696
add in this I think would be on

1671
01:24:31,718 --> 01:24:34,556
the theoretical side also start engaging

1672
01:24:34,668 --> 01:24:38,320
with more closely

1673
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,400
to bodily reactions to meditation

1674
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,184
because the body boundaries dissolution

1675
01:24:45,232 --> 01:24:47,616
is just one part of it. It's like one

1676
01:24:47,658 --> 01:24:49,096
part of the phenomenology but it's not

1677
01:24:49,118 --> 01:24:50,424
the only thing that happens during

1678
01:24:50,462 --> 01:24:53,940
meditation. There is a lot of potential

1679
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:59,112
that can be discovered on this because

1680
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:01,544
the body boundary solution again, it's

1681
01:25:01,592 --> 01:25:04,156
really study a lot, but it's a

1682
01:25:04,258 --> 01:25:07,052
phenomenon and there is so many other

1683
01:25:07,106 --> 01:25:08,876
things that happens in our body while we

1684
01:25:08,898 --> 01:25:12,190
meditate and I speak for first person

1685
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,588
experience, but in the community it's

1686
01:25:14,604 --> 01:25:17,072
really like already said, other kinds of

1687
01:25:17,126 --> 01:25:20,992
also more healing traditions like

1688
01:25:21,046 --> 01:25:24,256
breath work, for example. There there is

1689
01:25:24,278 --> 01:25:26,260
a lot of potential where people already

1690
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:29,488
work on that. But there is no bridge

1691
01:25:29,664 --> 01:25:32,340
with the academic communities. So people

1692
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:35,072
work pragmatically with this intuitive

1693
01:25:35,136 --> 01:25:36,884
knowledge about what happens in the body

1694
01:25:36,922 --> 01:25:38,148
during these altered states of

1695
01:25:38,154 --> 01:25:40,376
consciousness but still we need to

1696
01:25:40,398 --> 01:25:43,736
bridge it with trying to make sense from

1697
01:25:43,758 --> 01:25:46,056
a phonological and scientific point of

1698
01:25:46,078 --> 01:25:47,944
view and experimental point of view as

1699
01:25:47,982 --> 01:25:51,244
well. So I think I see myself in trying

1700
01:25:51,282 --> 01:25:54,504
to step in this toward and bring insight

1701
01:25:54,552 --> 01:25:58,220
from one world to the other and hoping

1702
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:01,164
to help myself and the other people

1703
01:26:01,202 --> 01:26:02,110
around me.

1704
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:07,808
Awesome. Well, best of luck with the

1705
01:26:07,814 --> 01:26:09,744
work. That sounds really exciting. Love

1706
01:26:09,782 --> 01:26:12,800
the idea of the two way street with

1707
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:16,480
different bodily and cognitive practices

1708
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:20,576
and collaboration and conversation that

1709
01:26:20,598 --> 01:26:22,208
can bring in all these different

1710
01:26:22,294 --> 01:26:25,372
expertises that maybe don't have an fMRI

1711
01:26:25,436 --> 01:26:28,250
study already, whatever that's worth.

1712
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:31,304
Thank you though, always. Any of you are

1713
01:26:31,342 --> 01:26:34,216
welcome back and really appreciate that

1714
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:37,016
you all came out. Thank you.

1715
01:26:37,038 --> 01:26:38,870
Daniel, thank you. See you soon.
