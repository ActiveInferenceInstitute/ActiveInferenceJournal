1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,300
hello and welcome it's July 27 2023 and

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,660
we're here in actin guest stream number

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,480
50.1 with Valeria becatini and Anna C

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,580
Unica this is going to be a very

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,400
interesting and cool presentation and

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,760
discussion on selfless Minds unlimited

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,160
bodies homeostatic bodily

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,960
self-regulation and meditative

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,780
experiences there will be a presentation

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,780
followed by a discussion so thank you

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,540
both for joining and to you Valeria for

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,700
the presentation

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,280
thank you Diana very much I'm very happy

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,520
to be here with Anna presenting a path

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,870
of our

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,200
[Music]

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,660
um

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,899
wider project is a paper about what

19
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,199
happened in Southwest state from a homo

20
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,699
suffering body self-regulation

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,199
perspective

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,480
so it's as I said it's part of a wider

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,119
project that consists in both

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,880
theoretical and experimental

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,860
um

26
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,500
components and

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,260
So today we're gonna look at

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,119
meditation

29
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,799
so for people that are not really

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,780
familiar with that organization is

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,820
attracted engaged attention to

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,439
self-regulate physiological and

33
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,939
cognitive activity

34
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,640
and what we're interested here is that

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,100
people that meditate with a certain

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,780
experience so for example meditating in

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,780
the past few years with regularly like

38
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,020
some hours per week they can

39
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,360
consistently report losing oneself uh

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,939
one sense of the self or having selfless

41
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,740
experiences

42
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,960
but only not only that they also report

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,280
to have uh bodily uh alterations

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
so alterations in the procession of the

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
body that has been called expansion

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,360
Oceanic boundlessness dissolution of

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,520
body boundaries and since you are

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,679
particularly interested in this kind of

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,660
phenomenal experience we have proposed

50
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,620
to frame them as unlimited body just uh

51
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,000
for clarity

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,760
so our question here is what exactly and

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,160
the question there was we'll follow the

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,260
whole uh presentation in the background

55
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,860
is what exactly exactly is lost when I

56
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,020
experience many faces report losing

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,940
their self and the body

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,420
so let's first looks uh very briefly uh

59
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,920
what what

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,620
um the self is or the sounds of selfies

61
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,459
so this content is so complex and so

62
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,980
wide that as we debated since the

63
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,739
beginning of philosophy

64
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,560
um and of course it's so it might be so

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
intrusive that it's also very hard to

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,440
Define but one very old uh old and used

67
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,300
definition is

68
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,900
um

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,200
the unitary or unique individual I the

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,260
first person perspective that laughing

71
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,540
was called the subjectum so something

72
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,200
that lay under or uh stream of

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,019
experience thoughts and whatever else

74
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,879
happens to us

75
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,340
that's the subject

76
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,560
um however more recently in cognitive

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,540
signs we are appealing to a more common

78
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,879
definition of sense of self a bit more

79
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,780
exhaustive that is um defined as a

80
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,019
multi-dimensional construct and here uh

81
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,540
we will come back on this on this

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,300
concept later and we'll unpack it a bit

83
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,879
more

84
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,959
so the aim of this presentation will be

85
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,500
to first of all lay down the fact that

86
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,840
in self-experiences the biological

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,780
organism so to speak the the human body

88
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,480
remains successful that self-regulated

89
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,599
and this uh might be very intuitive but

90
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,299
it needs them to see that

91
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,200
during selfless uh experiences what we

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,019
propose is that they may be uh tacitally

93
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,319
a compiler yeah implicitly underlined by

94
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,680
enhanced connectedness with this

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,500
successful self-regulation that we

96
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,899
proposed to Lincoln with a perceptually

97
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,479
attenuated body or what has been already

98
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,860
called transparent body

99
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,820
uh and this uh allows it to

100
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,440
propose it's of course in a working

101
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,080
process and we're very open to uh

102
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,940
feedback at any stage of this

103
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,520
presentation that the term selfless

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,160
States may be misleading because what is

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,580
lost is an ordinary way to mentally

106
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,759
models the self relation to the body and

107
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,400
the world

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,460
so I wrote my is composed as uh as

109
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,840
follows

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,660
first I will um

111
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,360
passing through uh debates and

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,639
definitions of losing oneself and body

113
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,740
so that means they'll go through

114
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,460
alterations in these um three-dimension

115
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,780
uh during that deep massive state

116
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,840
and then I will introduce King concept

117
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,820
of predictive process interactive info

118
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,039
framework

119
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,960
that are

120
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,199
useful in our explanation

121
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,340
so that then I can uh

122
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,820
um unpack the role of the biological

123
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,840
self-organization and homostatic

124
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,300
self-regulation in constituting our

125
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,639
sense of self

126
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,660
and then Pastor or uh claim that the so

127
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,520
much process is like some other sensory

128
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
attenuation and transparent self

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,720
modeling our key mechanism underlying

130
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,639
the phenomenology of the Methodist

131
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,880
States

132
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,160
our conclusion and present uh ongoing

133
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,120
related projects

134
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,759
so let's back come back to the sensor

135
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,080
itself

136
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,979
so uh in the

137
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:11,940
um

138
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,960
in when one has to uh investigate the

139
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,120
sense of self of course it as I said

140
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,639
it's a wide concept there so many

141
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
definitions and

142
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,539
um characterization of the sensor cell

143
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,699
has come up uh in philosophy and

144
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,819
cognitive science so we have uh terms

145
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,759
like minimal self self experience

146
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,680
self-hood sense of ownership and all of

147
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,479
this and

148
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,479
for author I think we have just to stick

149
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,120
to a common definition

150
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,919
that comes for example from from a

151
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,620
similar paper from Gallagher to thousand

152
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,500
that defines it as a multi-dimensional

153
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,740
construct composed by minimal or

154
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,560
embodied components and narrative or

155
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,080
reflective components so to unpack a

156
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
little bit these two concepts the

157
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,380
minimal embodied experience of the sense

158
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,560
of self is the basic

159
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
um implicit functioning of the um by the

160
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,220
YouTube of the ongoing moment so the

161
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,039
stream of experience that happens uh to

162
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,800
me right now uh can be defined as my

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,639
minimal sense of self so I don't really

164
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,860
need to have an explicit knowledge about

165
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,479
myself

166
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,680
to have this kind of Dimension uh and

167
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,560
these uh can be further unpacked through

168
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,120
the accounts of our pre-reflective

169
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,880
self-consciousness that comes uh from a

170
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,580
phonological tradition tracing back from

171
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,139
uh about to

172
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,440
uh uh argue that uh parts of our

173
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,539
self-conscious does not does not really

174
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,240
need any reflection to to happen there

175
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,940
or in place an explicit thought it

176
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,440
happens

177
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,440
um in a way tambrian uh is

178
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,160
conservatively before uh reflection and

179
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,960
then on top of this we build our

180
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,599
narrative or our Reflections about

181
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,380
ourselves and this is more linked to uh

182
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,300
self-identification processes or

183
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,300
self-monitoring self-recognition and

184
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,780
introspection introspection it's it's um

185
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,599
the ability of

186
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,240
introspect so perceive yourself or

187
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,360
reflect about yourself in an explicit

188
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,319
way

189
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,319
so you do need to have a biography or an

190
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,539
explicit memory about yourself in order

191
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,580
to tackle this this aspect of this

192
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,740
answer so

193
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,719
so indeed massive States uh the there is

194
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,720
alterations in sense of cell and it's up

195
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,120
to debate what which

196
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,440
um Dimension are affected by that and

197
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,959
it's far from Clear what

198
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,180
um actually

199
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,100
happens to these kind of Imagine a more

200
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,140
and many more other dimensional sense

201
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,519
itself uh and we are here uh to unpack a

202
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,899
little bit this

203
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,480
we propose these quotations from Fashion

204
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,620
2008 uh where

205
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,080
um it suggested that one in doing deep

206
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,600
messy stage one experiences oneself and

207
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,300
this very moment of Consciousness this

208
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,260
is a quotation that may reveal some uh

209
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,540
position about this

210
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,399
um the debate what happened to the sense

211
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,160
of self so in this case it's disarged

212
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,180
that meditation reveal a very moment of

213
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,240
conscience so there is something uh that

214
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,040
is true consciences

215
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,279
or uh something that is the real

216
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,740
Consciousness and this actually has

217
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,899
breaks to the concept of pure

218
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,260
Consciousness so something that it stays

219
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,720
there and uh

220
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,880
um it's

221
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,160
um purified by everything by almost to

222
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,740
the body and there is so many uh

223
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,899
definition of this pure Consciousness we

224
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,899
brought some example like uh ownerless

225
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,640
Consciousness the conscious that doesn't

226
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,459
have an owner that doesn't have a self

227
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,980
so it doesn't have as proper sense of

228
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,980
self that walked or that owns this

229
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,060
constant uh nothing it has worked on the

230
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,920
minimal phenomenal experience defining

231
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,620
it a special a temporal dimensional

232
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,060
consciousness

233
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,760
and this is uh very supportive because

234
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,860
it's consistent with the Buddhist

235
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,779
philosophy philosophical standard of no

236
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:37,200
self so for the uh most tradition of

237
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,180
Buddhism the

238
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,180
um there is no self the self in is an

239
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,240
illusion and it comes uh to our

240
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,220
psychology when we enter in contact with

241
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,680
the world and with the sensations of the

242
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,019
world and certain uh patterns of

243
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,180
behavior the analysis the tension we

244
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,040
have a self

245
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,000
so as it's that many patient it

246
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,800
allows us to access this pure

247
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,560
Consciousness for for supporting to this

248
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,899
thesis and reveals one to choose an

249
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,959
essential nature or subjective and we

250
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,880
bring this into debate

251
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,440
uh

252
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,660
there are also uh people that argue

253
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,540
against this and it's called Uh it has

254
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,620
been called by Imagine their

255
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,680
special issues the ubiquity thesis

256
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,440
so the ability thesis claim that

257
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,540
essential cells is ubiquitous to all

258
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,360
states of Consciousness and sometimes it

259
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,740
appeals to the immunity to error through

260
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,360
misidentification

261
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,100
argument of self-ass position reports

262
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,519
which is simpler than this long name

263
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,380
um and it's basically

264
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,440
the fact that I can say that I had a

265
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,959
wonderful experience or I can and this

266
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,180
wonderful experience may be true or

267
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,079
false this is uh this on this weekend uh

268
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,600
I can do mistakes I can make mistakes

269
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,459
but I cannot not say that I didn't uh

270
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,620
had this wonderful experience because

271
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,680
the moment in which I report

272
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,620
uh I have a perspective on this so I

273
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,540
cannot really be mistaken on the fat end

274
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,579
reporting this maybe I was dreaming

275
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,500
maybe it wasn't a wonderful experience

276
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,079
but it's me there remember party so the

277
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,300
moment I'm reporting this it means that

278
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,980
I have to be there

279
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,300
and this is uh for uh applies also to uh

280
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,260
when I ascribe myself a selfless State I

281
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,779
had a self-estate this this is very

282
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,640
controversial

283
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,820
other problems on top of that are

284
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,959
cross-cultural problems also addressed

285
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,079
in the leadership so this experience

286
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:53,040
selfless state may be influenced by uh

287
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,500
certain vows or certain beliefs that

288
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,839
meditators are endorsed

289
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,540
uh especially in during especially

290
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,519
expert meditators

291
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,839
and the other uh thing is uh these uh

292
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:07,860
all

293
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,720
um

294
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,540
um cross-cultural analysis and debate

295
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,420
about yourself maybe also uh actually

296
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,079
due to our verbal

297
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,220
misunderstanding so that the western

298
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,560
western employee may have problems about

299
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,300
the self that actually the Asian

300
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,279
probably philosophy is not really

301
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,200
addressing so there might be some

302
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,740
incommensurability of of problems there

303
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,560
but as also we said in the in the paper

304
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,779
uh it's not there we want to address the

305
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,240
Buddhist philosophical problems but

306
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,120
rather we want to bring inside from from

307
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,959
these two to our to our problems

308
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,399
so the

309
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,800
um given this debate uh we want to

310
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,440
propose a shift in the focus so we don't

311
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,940
want to start by looking at

312
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,040
Consciousness and trying to solve things

313
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,959
about the self but we want to start by

314
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,420
the by focusing on the body so we

315
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,000
proposed a shift in focus in the bodily

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,339
experience examining this uh the

317
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,300
imaginative state

318
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,320
so

319
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,079
let's start by the subjective experience

320
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,420
of the body or the study or this ability

321
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,920
to experience of the body which is

322
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,180
phenomenology

323
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,880
uh in the tradition our body has a

324
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,500
unique stages

325
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,160
so the anatomical structure of the body

326
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,220
uh has been called by user cup so the

327
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,620
living body the body that I can observe

328
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,019
and others can be observous is the

329
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,600
object among the other object they would

330
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,380
say

331
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,899
but it's not only that because

332
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,240
uh it's an object that I can live from

333
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,639
inside so it has been called the live

334
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,519
the live body or the body as I leave it

335
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,279
from inside as I said

336
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,639
so what happens uh to these kind of

337
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,459
Dimension again we can unpack this and

338
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,920
see how the meditative States affect

339
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,820
them

340
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,519
so from the point of view of the life

341
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,600
believed body uh we already know and I

342
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,440
will unpack a little bit more so we have

343
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,240
already said that uh we have called

344
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,079
unlimited body experiences uh the three

345
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,320
parts that spoke about this

346
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,139
um fading of the body boundaries so the

347
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,120
body bungee has been defined as a

348
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,000
cognitive emotional perception of uh

349
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,699
one's body surface that just finishing

350
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:33,480
we can also debate about this but well

351
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,420
it's important for us that our sense of

352
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,060
body boundaries is flexible and dynamic

353
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,519
it's not fixed because we are in the

354
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,899
realm of the body as Fells from inside

355
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,579
there is an interesting study that

356
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,680
exemplifies this concept in relation to

357
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,740
meditation in its uh by John brand in

358
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,760
2016 though it has worked uh late

359
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,420
further on on this um as well but I find

360
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,519
it interesting to look at this image

361
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,540
because

362
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,079
this is part of a self-report management

363
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,040
that they use on a sample of people that

364
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,839
has been trained in meditation in

365
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,480
particular with the body scanning so

366
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,839
that people had to systematically scan

367
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,540
sensation rise in the body

368
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,600
and the result is that in the less than

369
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,440
four months of practice so no actually

370
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,100
not the expert they already started to

371
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,760
report an increased tendency to go

372
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,620
towards the

373
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,860
almost imperceptible

374
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,459
perception of the body so they conclude

375
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,339
that um meditation can be actually

376
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,519
studied in this sense where it affects

377
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,060
our sense of body boundaries and uh they

378
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,779
say they saw significant uh results also

379
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,940
in relation to increased mood happiness

380
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,919
and

381
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,240
decreased anxiety and regulation but

382
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,939
this is uh yes another story that we'll

383
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,339
come back later

384
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,819
so I find interesting also this

385
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,579
quotation by I think uh here in this

386
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,559
paper is talking about why in good

387
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,480
dissolution may be better understood as

388
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,660
ego expansion and then

389
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,640
um and then either the solution becomes

390
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,040
an a later uh

391
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,440
interpretation

392
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,320
um and so I will read it it's it's not

393
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,380
the feeling of self that dissolves with

394
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,360
the boundary between a feeling of self

395
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
and the feeling of anything else in

396
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,780
consciousness

397
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,340
so here again I think he's talking about

398
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,740
consciousness but

399
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,260
from our perspective this conversation

400
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,559
is pretty uh informing because it goes

401
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,160
in our interaction as well because

402
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,020
he says it's not that you're losing

403
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,020
really yourself is this this experience

404
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,840
is uh dependent on how you actually

405
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,380
perceive your boundary with uh you and

406
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,780
what you don't consider you so

407
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,240
self or fading of the self other

408
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,840
distinction ability

409
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,240
so

410
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,260
here it comes uh processing acting from

411
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,200
framework because we want to

412
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,460
um

413
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,480
basically breach these phenomenal

414
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,419
subjects you experience to having this

415
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:35,160
phenomena and underlying mechanics

416
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,520
explanation

417
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,740
uh indeed the processing activities I

418
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,380
have recently used for this purpose also

419
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,679
meditation research and uh

420
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,460
Psychopathology research and so on so in

421
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,860
this presentation I will use them in an

422
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,559
interchangeable way but following

423
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,160
certain uh Trends but it's not it

424
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,539
doesn't have to be it's also under

425
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,980
debate

426
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,200
um and I will also give if I uh purely I

427
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
don't know how to say

428
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,840
um theoretical

429
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
perspective on that I will not go too

430
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,700
much technical

431
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,820
um so briefly uh this framework

432
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,360
considers uh

433
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,120
brains as predictive machine or as a

434
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,480
freezing likes to say as a considered

435
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,620
brain is a fantastic organ uh which is

436
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,380
because not it's not only uh able to do

437
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,720
amazing things but also because it

438
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,820
really generates fantasies about the

439
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,940
world and this is because the in order

440
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,700
to act interact with your with Excel and

441
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,880
the world around the brain constantly uh

442
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,919
anticipate

443
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,539
um

444
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,299
the few anticipate the state current

445
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,280
state of affairs

446
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,860
in order to make sense of the sensorium

447
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,980
or the stream of experiences that

448
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,600
happens

449
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,679
um so on uh so it possessed or embody or

450
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,020
uh utilizes it depends on the commitment

451
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,500
uh a generative model which is a model

452
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,100
that keep tracks or regularity of the

453
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,700
world and forms prediction out of it in

454
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,980
a hierarchical way so highly

455
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,299
reproduction uh goes down to match uh

456
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,520
sensory data

457
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,500
um and sensory data goes up to uh

458
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,760
um map to affect the predictions to

459
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,620
update the model

460
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,059
however every prediction comes with a

461
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:47,640
degree of error which sometimes is

462
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,700
called prediction errors so

463
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,799
this predictionaries the discrepancy

464
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,419
between prediction and

465
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,539
um sensory input so that a new model is

466
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:02,100
generated and uh they say the

467
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,799
um first imperative or the only

468
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,299
imperative of the system is actually

469
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,299
minimizing the prediction errors so that

470
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,020
the model can most efficiently uh cope

471
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,559
when interacting uh and act in the world

472
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,840
however it's not um

473
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,780
the only imperative because the as I

474
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,520
will introduce in this Slide the

475
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,120
the system uh has also to

476
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,460
estimate the confidence or likelihood or

477
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,760
Precision of prediction in order to

478
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,059
evaluate the prediction errors uh that

479
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,500
are coming from

480
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,900
the discrepancy

481
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,200
so that the generative model has to

482
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,860
compute enough a fine way uh how how

483
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,159
much Precision to assign the to the

484
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,860
prediction or prediction errors

485
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,400
and I choose this image because it

486
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,740
renders well

487
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,400
um

488
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,179
how the distribution are

489
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,940
um set depending on the prestigious

490
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,059
sedation so if you have a precise

491
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,880
medication error

492
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,320
then the posterior distribution will be

493
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,140
closer to the prediction error well the

494
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,720
imprecise prediction have lethal effect

495
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,240
on the prior so that the procedure the

496
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,940
the pursuit distribution will be closer

497
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,039
to the prior and this is very important

498
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,260
because if the

499
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,020
um that Precision estimate are not

500
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,539
weighted correctly then the system

501
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,720
generates false inference that will not

502
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,840
able to the system to interact

503
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,320
efficiently and update model efficiently

504
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,340
so so far we have uh mostly talked about

505
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,059
uh prediction error minimization uh by

506
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:57,179
updating uh the model however the system

507
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,659
can also uh active samples or active

508
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,840
modifying the prediction error of the

509
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,340
world

510
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,640
um in order to fit

511
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,640
uh the prediction errors to the world

512
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,500
and this comes into play active

513
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,240
inference

514
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,860
um that builds upon the free energy

515
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,419
principle where uh that um is based on

516
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,220
the idea that living organism

517
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,200
maintaining themselves with an optimal

518
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,539
State set of states

519
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,299
that comes from the second low dynamics

520
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,900
of shortening Schrodinger

521
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,799
um

522
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,340
so given that

523
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,799
it comes into play uh how attention is

524
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,120
uh

525
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,360
analyzer examine it under this framework

526
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,500
so given that uh the organism has to

527
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,780
maintain uh Within These optimal

528
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,419
assessor states by maintaining an

529
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,179
optimal balance between uh computation

530
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,840
uh and precision optimization SO waiting

531
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,200
between uh prediction and

532
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,780
um prediction errors attention comes

533
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,460
into place as a modulation of these

534
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,340
Precision of sensory data working as a

535
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,880
Searchlight so in other words it

536
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,760
optimize the signal to noise ratio it's

537
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,280
the one of the way that we have to uh

538
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,400
put in place in place these local

539
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,419
optimization of precision estimate

540
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,120
and this is very important uh why we

541
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,539
bring into attention because meditation

542
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,020
has a systematic energy

543
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,159
reservative use of attention resources

544
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:47,880
um

545
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,900
and we will come back into that

546
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,260
further on in this presentation

547
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,799
uh and given that we are interested in

548
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,580
okay we have seen the live body what

549
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,559
happens to the funeral experience now

550
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,120
we're interested in what happens to the

551
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,280
corporate what happens to the living

552
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,580
body that can be observed by the the

553
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,500
organism that during medicine States

554
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,720
in these bring we brings into play in

555
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,380
other two uh important concept uh in

556
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,559
active immigrants which is a way to uh

557
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,480
self-regulate

558
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,159
um

559
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,919
the underlying all and what experience

560
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,200
Soul subjective experience

561
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
so two ways uh

562
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,960
or one way that then is also active so

563
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,779
the first way is homos little homostasis

564
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,419
which is the maintenance of required

565
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,059
optimal Say by survival and reproduction

566
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:50,940
of self-organizing biological system so

567
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,260
for example I'm cold and I use my

568
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,299
internal resources to keep my

569
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,600
state into this into optimal state so I

570
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,000
start shivering however I can also put

571
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,480
in place uh active modification in the

572
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,400
world so that

573
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,440
um I'm not cold anymore

574
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,720
so for example I take a blank this is

575
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,880
called elasticity so it's active

576
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,679
engagement and modification about the

577
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,380
environment in order to maintain myself

578
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,620
in optimal States for survival

579
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,659
so we can say

580
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,120
uh of course human bodies are

581
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,340
self-organizing biological system and

582
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,679
aiming at keeping these internal States

583
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,440
within a certain uh viable range for

584
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,940
survival

585
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,460
now given that we will come back again

586
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,080
to phenomenology

587
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,640
off touch I will go I'm going to to do

588
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,500
this for the second time

589
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,320
uh to then wrap up everything again

590
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,720
uh so we have talked about film all

591
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,220
video of the body

592
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,360
however uh we haven't uh underlined

593
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,020
important is that the touch and proximal

594
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,840
sense has for our lip body

595
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,220
so

596
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,919
our as Technica and colleagues has

597
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,940
already

598
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,860
um

599
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,340
proposed our proximal sense are Central

600
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,520
for our minimal sense of self

601
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,480
and on this on on top of that we bring

602
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,419
important to play the fact that

603
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,400
different kinds of touch can convey

604
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,840
different experience of this and so

605
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,059
stuff or sense of boundaries so for

606
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,820
example imagine yourself that you are

607
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,919
um in a c

608
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:44,480
of partial or California and

609
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,159
you touching the whole environment with

610
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,179
your body

611
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,760
you may feel that you have a sense of

612
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,620
immersiveness or that your body

613
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,940
boundaries are

614
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,480
slowly a bit becoming less clear and

615
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,179
this experience it's actually a bit

616
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,240
similar to the experiences of sensory

617
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,120
deprivation States where people are put

618
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,419
in a salty water and they let them flow

619
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:10,919
for some moments

620
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,020
sensory deprivation states are not

621
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,960
really really all deprived because you

622
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,480
have other activities in the body and

623
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,480
movements that produce signals that you

624
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,980
are actually aware of

625
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,279
however in both these experiences the

626
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,260
body boundaries seems to fade a little

627
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,980
bit

628
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,140
however if you're in the cnu's meeting

629
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,360
and then you touch the rock with your

630
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,240
hand uh you clearly will feel yourself

631
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,179
as separated as uh something different

632
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,340
from what you're actually touching like

633
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,418
sense of separation

634
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,310
things phenomology can be both

635
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,799
[Music]

636
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,760
interactive inference through the

637
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,440
mechanism of some of the sensory

638
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,020
attenuation which comes from the sensory

639
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,100
attenuation

640
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,419
so this process happens when uh the

641
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,480
system depicts your its own action

642
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,220
uh so for example I take a glass

643
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,039
uh and in this moment my Rena has

644
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,159
already created a different copies of

645
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,960
this action and the sensory consequences

646
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,200
of this so whenever I grab the

647
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,919
um these this class the sensory concept

648
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,799
that happens to my uh but they are

649
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,840
slightly

650
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,340
um attenuated

651
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,020
and this is why we cannot tickle

652
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,760
ourselves

653
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,460
because the prediction errors comes at

654
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,100
not surprising

655
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,080
this has a implication for our embodied

656
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,880
experience in the world because we are

657
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,100
feel that we are immediate immediate

658
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,840
content with ourselves in the world and

659
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,820
this is because

660
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,279
our country experience are mediated by

661
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,620
transcript or non-perceived cognitive

662
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,500
processes so that the system leads can

663
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,100
leave behind or this attend self-related

664
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,179
sensory processing

665
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,640
so and these allowed to allocate your

666
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,740
resources to perception and action

667
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,960
involved in the processing of the object

668
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,520
of Interest

669
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,000
so for example when uh limousine as this

670
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,820
example of the Cherry when I have to uh

671
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,760
take a object that Italian for me I'll

672
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,760
be much more interested in the uh

673
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,919
picking the object and I will not really

674
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,039
focus on my arm boring

675
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,320
in picking that

676
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,960
so that the system needs to compute and

677
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,880
maintain a fine balance between external

678
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,919
and internal comp components of some

679
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,480
other sensory attenuation

680
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,580
and this is very important for the sense

681
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,020
of self as well

682
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,399
so it uh we need to understand and

683
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,399
result that we need but in order for us

684
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,220
to have a sense of self we normally have

685
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,380
a sense of what we are when we don't and

686
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,260
what we are not but for the brain it has

687
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,360
to uh or as as uh agents end up with the

688
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,480
brain we compute this distinction so

689
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,940
where the self ends and where do work

690
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,120
begins or do I move my arm or my arm is

691
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,500
moved by something or someone

692
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,919
play the role in this uh distinctions

693
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,260
and involved in building multi-sensory

694
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,720
bodily self-representations

695
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,320
so that the sense of the self and body

696
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,120
is uh subjectively and phenomenally

697
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,399
transferred that's that that means that

698
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,620
when we act in the world and we interact

699
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,299
we normally these attend uh the

700
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,299
way we are in the world because we need

701
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,700
to be in contact Direct contact with the

702
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,860
world if we always attend it to our body

703
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,720
and our our

704
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
um ourselves in to in the sense that we

705
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,899
will be hyper reflexive then we will be

706
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:57,779
actually uh will be impaired

707
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:00,179
in what we normally do and this is

708
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:01,740
actually a condition that we will talk

709
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,020
about later

710
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,700
so that

711
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,679
in our students in the sense of selfies

712
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,419
and ongoing inferential process center

713
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,320
in the body so what we propose is

714
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,440
uh what is lost during selfish selfless

715
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,919
experience is an ordinary way to mental

716
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,960
mentally model self in relation to the

717
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,480
body in the world so that if we think

718
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,880
about the self as as I propose here then

719
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,279
I uh the iceberg where the narrative

720
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,080
cells is what we see but the renewal

721
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,840
self is what we actually are composed of

722
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,120
and it's actually larger but we are not

723
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,059
aware of similarly when we have software

724
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,860
experience we may have also these uh

725
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,419
inferential process where we think we'll

726
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,500
have lost ourselves

727
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,799
um however

728
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,500
uh we have gathered some evidence in the

729
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,539
fact that meditation facilitate all

730
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,899
genomic regulation involved in

731
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,059
homostatic processes

732
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,919
that means for example that meditation

733
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:08,100
increase the synchronization of cardiac

734
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,640
and respiratory system

735
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,279
uh this is connected with reduced levels

736
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,279
of blue blood glucose or blood pressure

737
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,659
and heart rate variability so there is a

738
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:22,919
um

739
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,620
successful medication helps to

740
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,059
successfully self-regulated the body uh

741
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,760
especially in comparison to stress that

742
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,220
actually does the opposite

743
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,539
um

744
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:40,620
and on top of that uh meditation help us

745
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,600
to attune us to our physiological

746
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,740
interceptive awareness uh and this

747
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,919
um it does it so they say by enhancing

748
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,779
the processing of extra effective

749
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,600
interceptive stimuli which it doesn't

750
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,140
have to be understanded as a maladaptive

751
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,919
uh increased body awareness but rather a

752
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,440
adaptive body awareness which is very

753
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,899
distinguish distinction that we can come

754
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,520
back later if you

755
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,440
if people are interested or they ask

756
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,560
about

757
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,339
um

758
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,440
these evidence are also in line with

759
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,239
evidence communication that promotes

760
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,580
self-regulation of pain and pain and

761
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,139
pleasing and so

762
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,659
three-day attentional training the

763
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,480
meditation

764
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,399
in allow uh you're actually able to

765
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,859
self-regulate the pain and not not

766
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,839
really like the sensation of the pain

767
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:40,020
because it actually gets very clear but

768
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,560
the uh automatic behavioral patterns

769
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,020
that comes uh in association with the

770
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,460
with the pain

771
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,899
so there is also also self uh regulation

772
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:55,440
on emotions and so on

773
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,540
so the body doesn't know literally

774
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,420
disappears actually it stays as a very

775
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,060
centered uh as a first year at the

776
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,339
center as we propose it in the paper and

777
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,800
I proposition through this image at the

778
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,520
center of a cycling

779
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,060
so self-regular

780
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,920
self-regulatory processes allow the

781
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,339
subjective experience to lose oneself

782
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,619
so the percent of the body

783
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,440
remains present in the background and

784
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,180
these for example can it's very here

785
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,780
from these reports from a

786
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,980
person undergoing this kind of

787
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,920
experience that they uh say that there

788
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,560
remains a sense that there is a body

789
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,200
without any experience of a sense of

790
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,618
boundary

791
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,380
so

792
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,119
this is

793
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,859
not very last slide but we come to our

794
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:55,140
wrap up of our claim

795
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,900
uh attenuating the self unlimiting the

796
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,480
body which is also the title for our

797
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,460
paper so

798
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,500
starting from the fact that all medicine

799
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,260
practices across the three Traditions

800
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,359
require

801
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:11,280
systematic and parallel fully crafted

802
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,220
body preparation to enter these deep

803
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,640
method self-state self-estate so it

804
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,560
doesn't

805
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,140
happen that all of like all of a sudden

806
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,780
you just have a selfless state

807
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,359
which actually may happen more similarly

808
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,480
with a psychedelic bubble meditation you

809
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,859
need

810
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:34,800
you need to pass through gradually many

811
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,460
different uh state or many of different

812
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,380
um

813
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,560
level of concentration

814
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,859
that happens when you have around a

815
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:51,800
predictable

816
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,599
environment and you do so by building

817
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,540
prior expectations so you have to keep

818
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,520
your body in a certain position of

819
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,980
posture as you say this in this image

820
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,540
the person is seated with a very

821
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,820
straight but not very but a straight

822
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,859
back relaxed this is very important

823
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:14,400
realization when it lags and so on

824
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,780
and then you need at least uh in in the

825
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,300
most part of your practice you need safe

826
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,040
predictable environments with

827
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,099
temperature that are enables you to

828
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,260
maintain your homostatic analysis and

829
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,900
processes

830
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,119
so all these conditions are necessary

831
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,040
for your successful homeostatic

832
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,140
self-regulation

833
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,160
in this sense when this part first part

834
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,540
of the preparation to Andrew then after

835
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,520
the state of concentration the meditator

836
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,460
can let go and leave behind self-related

837
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,700
processes and process the body

838
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,339
transported or it can attenuate them

839
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:59,099
just attenuate its body the body cannot

840
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,680
can be attenuated

841
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,200
so our claim is that a transfer

842
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,240
essential cells and body May underline

843
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,579
the phenomenal phenomenology of losing

844
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,700
one cells one self and blurring body

845
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,220
boundaries as reported during meditative

846
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,440
States

847
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,940
um

848
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,980
so our conclusion is that we have

849
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,980
proposed a shifting focus on homeostatic

850
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,920
body self-regulation in examining the

851
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,740
majority States

852
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,420
the experience of having ability a

853
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,640
living self-organism biological system

854
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,160
is never lost in this process

855
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,920
rather it stays transported at its very

856
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,140
center

857
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,820
self-attenuated yeah very much present

858
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,920
in a handful life

859
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,380
so that the self model is attenuated to

860
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,180
a big week to become transparent

861
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,660
enhanced processed in the background

862
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,240
now giving this conclusion now I'm gonna

863
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,220
present related project the first one is

864
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,000
still uh on the theoretical side so we

865
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,740
are in the real of active inference

866
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,500
model in meditation research there is a

867
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,599
radio literature about that

868
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,579
um that

869
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:15,720
um base that have studied different

870
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,619
kinds of meditation techniques like

871
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:22,220
focused attention open monitoring

872
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,839
non-dual awareness

873
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:27,839
2021

874
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,920
um they have for example uh showed that

875
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,260
these uh attention techniques profoundly

876
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,140
and alter typical mental experiences

877
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,820
and

878
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,099
for example Focus meditation is the

879
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,960
meditation

880
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,020
um that engage attention on one specific

881
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,700
object experience for example the breath

882
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,099
uh and in active events there we mean

883
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:08,280
that Precision is uh estimated one

884
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,440
century input which means that it

885
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,560
reduced the impact of the other thoughts

886
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,339
and parallel processes that going on

887
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:20,220
or often open monitoring meditation is

888
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,900
the uh is the engaging of attention to

889
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,000
one's experience as a whole so the whole

890
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,760
stream of experience with us selecting

891
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,940
anything in particular so that in an

892
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,359
active intertherens it has been

893
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,720
described as assigning equal Precision

894
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,900
to all these experiencing promoting

895
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,000
non-reactive sensing and it is connected

896
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,740
also why meditators

897
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:53,040
are good in self-regulated regulate pain

898
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,079
so in we will also build our model our

899
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,940
us on self modeling based uh on the

900
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,740
previous literature which is in

901
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,220
preparation

902
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:10,740
and then going experimental uh we want

903
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,500
to bring into the table uh applications

904
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,339
of what we we're researching and

905
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:21,300
potential benefits may be for a case or

906
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,940
people or yeah individuals that suffer

907
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,500
from disrupted body awareness uh or

908
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,020
disruptive self-awareness

909
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,980
and there is a

910
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,680
relatively recent condition that has

911
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,720
been

912
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,040
studied that is across the

913
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,839
personalization

914
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:45,420
so the personalization

915
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,359
um is their destruction of both body and

916
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,960
self-awareness and it's a very

917
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,339
heterogeneous condition there is a lot

918
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:56,640
of different dimensions uh that occurs

919
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,119
but generally uh it's connected with

920
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,220
feelings of Happiness disconnection

921
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,040
feeling the body isn't the as an object

922
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,020
rather than a transparent medium of

923
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,980
experience uh which is uh switching

924
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,980
release called disembodiment

925
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,400
it is linked with difficulties in

926
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,260
concentration and attention often

927
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,900
comorbid with depression rumination and

928
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,980
anxiety

929
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,820
and recently and colleagues that also

930
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,240
propose a uh characterized by failures

931
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,900
in attenuating so much a sensory signals

932
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,400
so

933
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,660
based on what we have uh previously said

934
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,359
and based on how these

935
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:46,200
um condition affects uh

936
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,140
a large number of population we want to

937
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,680
test certain hypotheses

938
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,720
so the first one would be the highest

939
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,940
somatocentric attenuation correlate with

940
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,220
more feeling of aliveness and wide

941
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,520
openness in experienced meditators

942
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,740
and rather lowest from other Century

943
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,359
attenuation could relate with feelings

944
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:09,300
of unrealness Badness in people

945
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,500
experience uh decorationalization

946
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,980
and on the other hand severe homeostatic

947
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,140
disregulation or bodily States during

948
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,060
deep Methodist States may lead to

949
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,220
negative emotional outcomes and other

950
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,280
self-experience this comes from to the

951
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,680
fact that

952
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,420
the personalization and meditator and

953
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,740
meditation has some has uh can both

954
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,660
create stressing negative outcomes and

955
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,180
it's interesting to see how these happen

956
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,819
and what are the commonalities and

957
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:46,980
differences in that

958
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,560
and also we have now in the realm of

959
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,920
spatial temporal perception which is uh

960
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,980
connected also with mood disorders or

961
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,339
like depression and anxiety uh and also

962
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:02,099
with the personalization

963
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,619
uh however in the precise station there

964
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:08,160
is no specific items in the

965
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,400
questionnaire that is usually uh used

966
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,099
for measuring so we're which is a Camry

967
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,380
Cambridge the personalization scale so

968
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,920
we want to test this as well uh and we

969
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,660
want to test it uh

970
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,119
in people reporting selfless and

971
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,880
disembodied experience so both

972
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,180
pathological non-pathological conditions

973
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,000
so path of this hypothesis we are

974
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,640
already going through

975
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,280
this is our team coming from Humboldt

976
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,520
University where I come from the month

977
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,760
but also a university Hall and College

978
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,940
London with anus and Joseph

979
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,880
first study is as I said about time

980
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,060
perspective so we want to analyze uh

981
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,020
um how people with high rates of the

982
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,880
crystallization can relate with

983
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,880
dimension of the time perspective so

984
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,720
there are more future oriented or more

985
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,240
negative oriented our hypothesis that

986
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,260
they're more negative past

987
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,940
oriented so they're stuck in

988
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:19,920
a very

989
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,599
long present moment that but also the

990
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:27,720
the their the tendency of ruminating so

991
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,859
always going to pass negative memories

992
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:33,000
um

993
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,119
this is a title lost in dark times the

994
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:37,380
effect of the personalization

995
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,440
experiencing on time perspective

996
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,680
and these we are already in the analysis

997
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,540
of the data but

998
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,740
um

999
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,619
it's on ongoing still

1000
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:53,400
study so we we have preliminary data on

1001
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,660
this

1002
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,900
uh while studies two we're in the

1003
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,940
recruitment phases but we are almost

1004
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,240
there and encompassed the

1005
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,060
uh hydrates or people individual with

1006
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,040
high traits of the personalization and

1007
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,480
meditators

1008
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,359
I want to see through a set of questions

1009
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:17,819
and a behavioral task how they may

1010
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,280
differ in the sense of self body and

1011
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,079
motion of course they're very wide and

1012
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,119
conflict Concepts so there is always

1013
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,020
room for for

1014
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,520
feedback and

1015
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,420
replication and so on uh we want to just

1016
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,500
we wanted to we have selected this tasks

1017
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,900
the embody task that I've adopted from

1018
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,880
newmanma

1019
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,300
uh where individuals have participants

1020
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,420
has two colors parts of the body

1021
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,020
um

1022
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,920
in relation to activation that they feel

1023
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,040
by reading certain emotional story

1024
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,859
so these stories at least are supposed

1025
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:02,099
and validated to at least see certain

1026
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,200
emotions in the body and then people

1027
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,599
colors parts of the body and then we

1028
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,480
will see how people with high traits and

1029
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,119
visualization limit heaters will will

1030
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,160
different this and we will also compare

1031
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,040
with other questions that we have put

1032
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,420
this and

1033
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,599
uh potential title is emotional body

1034
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,300
maps of solid Detachment personalization

1035
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,859
and meditation

1036
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:30,000
and with this I thank you all and that's

1037
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,240
it now we are open for discussion thank

1038
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,359
you

1039
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,940
awesome thank you very much Valeria

1040
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,700
your music down

1041
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,079
thank you Valeria

1042
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,119
great of course well

1043
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:54,180
very fascinating presentation perhaps uh

1044
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,980
on up first and then our other

1045
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,839
colleagues who have joined would be

1046
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,180
awesome to hear your

1047
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,920
after

1048
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,720
be here on this work and and any

1049
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,578
reflection or questions you have on it

1050
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,119
is it my turn sure did I missed yeah

1051
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,339
yeah so um obviously I don't have many

1052
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,440
questions because it's like we

1053
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,079
brought this together so

1054
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:22,680
um

1055
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,240
but um I I think what I'd like just to

1056
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,880
add that really a question is

1057
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,740
um

1058
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,560
I really like to see

1059
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,560
um

1060
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,579
um so for instance like in um an ideal

1061
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:44,400
world would be nice to you know uh get

1062
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,300
all the

1063
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,319
um

1064
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,180
the tradition of the meditative

1065
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,040
experiences and how they relate to the

1066
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,440
body and make a very precise prediction

1067
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,480
on what exactly they will kind of like

1068
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,780
predict in terms of uh certain

1069
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,740
um

1070
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,400
uh sensory experiences and how this can

1071
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,680
be interpreted through different like

1072
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,660
theoretical lenses I think that could be

1073
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,579
really really interesting because I

1074
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:13,440
think one of the problems

1075
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,599
uh the challenges that we have right now

1076
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,880
is that we have so many Concepts so many

1077
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,160
approaches and kind of like scattered

1078
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,619
all over the map and I think would be

1079
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:24,359
really nice to

1080
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,960
um you know a narrow down because as you

1081
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,940
said Daniel

1082
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,640
um so everybody knows what meditation is

1083
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,900
everybody knows at least one person

1084
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,940
meditates in in life and everything but

1085
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,280
uh it's really unclear what exactly we

1086
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,400
are um we are after and why in certain

1087
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,920
cases this is kind of like

1088
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,560
um beneficial and one in another cases

1089
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,200
basically it has a negative consequences

1090
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,599
and this is why precisely we are doing

1091
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:57,300
this our project on the personalization

1092
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,200
and meditation and I can share with you

1093
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,700
informally scoop but data is here so it

1094
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,099
kind of like I can share with you so

1095
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:09,900
what we did in this project basically we

1096
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,660
took people with typical controls that

1097
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,579
don't have the personalization and never

1098
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,380
meditate it right so it's kind of like

1099
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,260
yeah never did that and then we took

1100
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,839
people that meditated but

1101
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,180
um and then we looked at whether they

1102
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,700
have kind of like high or low traits of

1103
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,740
depressurization and then we took people

1104
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,260
with deeper sizes that never meditate

1105
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,700
right

1106
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,200
um so

1107
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,240
so I have this like

1108
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,700
um inclusion in exclusion criteria and

1109
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,220
um yeah it's it's really interesting to

1110
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,079
find what our finance is like it's

1111
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:46,020
really difficult to find people that

1112
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:50,160
have experienced meditators and low

1113
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,960
depersonalization skills low

1114
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,440
depersonalization traits right so most

1115
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,180
of them they actually have ID

1116
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,500
personalization but then it's

1117
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,240
interesting to see how that contrasts

1118
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,680
with like the people that have the

1119
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,660
personalization and no meditation

1120
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,760
experience right

1121
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,559
um so that's that's something I would

1122
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,579
like to

1123
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:11,099
um Carry On and

1124
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:15,240
um yeah so to reach the community and

1125
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,559
um yeah

1126
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,240
and that's something we will definitely

1127
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,059
carry on with Valerian the next steps

1128
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:22,980
and also with some people that I have

1129
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,780
here in the chat uh Julia and Simon so

1130
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,880
Simone will going to work with us on

1131
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,400
also smarter sense retaliation yeah

1132
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,339
through different senses and Julia we

1133
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:37,980
have some um without scooping we have

1134
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,140
also some very very interesting results

1135
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,880
coming up

1136
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,680
um we just finished data collection on

1137
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,700
intentional binding and

1138
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,220
depersonalization so related to the

1139
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,079
sense of agency yeah so yeah so that's

1140
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:54,480
all from here just like for now we're

1141
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,059
kind of like in between because well I

1142
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:58,859
represented very well like the theory

1143
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:02,760
part and the studies are literally just

1144
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,460
getting hot from the oven now and we

1145
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:08,460
hope that in September it's like we're

1146
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,819
going to get the mode there yeah but the

1147
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:13,500
data is in the box so that's very

1148
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,900
exciting and yeah we have the results

1149
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,880
yeah

1150
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,280
thank you Danielle again for uh this

1151
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,839
platform it's really nice and as I said

1152
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,579
I really hope that after this discussion

1153
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:25,440
we'll have more

1154
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,020
um um you know

1155
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,260
opportunities to change exchange and um

1156
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,660
yeah discuss we also plan to organize

1157
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,880
something around a duration of

1158
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,300
self-consciousness in across various

1159
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,500
conditions and also the personalization

1160
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,500
in Elizabeth next year so maybe you can

1161
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,680
cross the pond and check for yourself

1162
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,900
that we have a nice airport in Lisbon

1163
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,420
yeah

1164
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,540
cool well good to uh get the appetizer

1165
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,240
before the entree so that's very awesome

1166
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,140
about just how much Theory and um even

1167
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,420
unconventional scientific theory like

1168
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,579
World Knowledge traditions

1169
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:07,800
come into play and then what it looks

1170
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,680
like to take that experimental step to

1171
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,660
make it scientific is is definitely what

1172
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,619
I

1173
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,720
saw on the talk

1174
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,940
um Julia or Simone do you want to give

1175
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,920
any reflection or any thoughts or

1176
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,180
questions

1177
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,400
yes I actually have a can you hear me

1178
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,579
yep yeah I actually have uh three

1179
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:29,099
questions I know it down

1180
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:30,480
um I think the first one because it's

1181
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,980
just for me personally I'm curious about

1182
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,460
that is that those deep meditative

1183
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,980
selfless States I think that can also be

1184
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,220
reached while doing yoga right

1185
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,740
basically the opposite of like sitting

1186
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,420
still is like a sort of repetitive

1187
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,240
movement actually so I'm wondering do

1188
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,460
those movements have to be perfectly

1189
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,960
predictable in order to be attenuated

1190
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,640
and then reaching the same state or is

1191
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,740
that like a different uh different

1192
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,960
concept or how do you how do you put

1193
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,819
that in the in your in your framework

1194
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,599
um

1195
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,579
mainly to

1196
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,660
uh to talk to topics one is is it

1197
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,119
possible to reach deep Methodist States

1198
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,960
also uh not sitting in a steel position

1199
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,059
and the answer is yes

1200
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:23,700
uh

1201
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,980
however there is not so much research on

1202
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,619
that so I can talk about anatical

1203
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:30,480
knowledge

1204
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,280
but I did not read so much about uh

1205
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,319
World communication effects

1206
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,800
usually works meditation or yeah of

1207
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,020
course you talk about yoga I know but

1208
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,960
that's what I uh would say that walking

1209
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,500
meditation is used uh as a complementary

1210
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,260
practice through the same thing

1211
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,420
so I would say

1212
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:58,079
hard to reach deep Melody stage only by

1213
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,180
World communication

1214
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,980
um

1215
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,220
in regarding to yoga also yoga means

1216
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,359
Unity so what we think about yoga now we

1217
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,619
think about movement but it's always

1218
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:16,020
uh occupied by reduced state of

1219
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,000
conscious concentration

1220
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,520
through meditation

1221
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,099
so you cannot have yoga without

1222
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:25,079
meditation otherwise we'll be stretching

1223
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:26,400
your glasses

1224
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,540
but uh second topic

1225
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:34,500
is that can it happen when you have when

1226
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,260
you don't have prediction of movement

1227
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,559
right no I meant like because in yoga I

1228
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,059
mean at least I don't really do yoga

1229
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:44,040
right but I can imagine that what when

1230
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,079
people reach those States doing yoga

1231
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,780
then they kind of do it almost like in a

1232
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,579
in a trance type of way they're always

1233
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:51,960
doing the same movement over and over

1234
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,700
and over again so that they don't have

1235
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,079
to attend to those movements but it's

1236
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:57,000
just like an automatic process I was

1237
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,240
wondering if it if that also can I can I

1238
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,680
jump in so

1239
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,540
um um actually this is precisely the

1240
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,760
opposite what is what what Valeria was

1241
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,339
saying is so but I was saying this is

1242
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:09,960
precisely the opposite you want to reach

1243
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,579
through yoga just like the opposite of

1244
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:14,460
automatic Yeah so basically when you do

1245
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,099
this movements you need to be United

1246
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:20,520
with your self-training it so you really

1247
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,839
need to

1248
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,940
um yeah uh so yeah I'm doing yoga so

1249
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,339
they they the past 10 years and

1250
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:31,800
precisely this is like they're trying to

1251
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,079
tell us it's like don't don't do it on

1252
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,579
automatic because it's like when you

1253
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:37,559
have your thinking happening there and

1254
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:39,180
your body is doing some stuff there

1255
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,280
right you need to be basically be

1256
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,099
presents in every single type of moon so

1257
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:46,559
you have like a fully fully a presence

1258
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,420
if you do it automatically that's like

1259
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,099
that's more like gymnastic or something

1260
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:53,700
yeah so um but it's interesting uh so

1261
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,960
your point is really interesting because

1262
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,300
then would be really nice to have a

1263
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,099
control condition where we have people

1264
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:01,619
doing like movement meditation and yoga

1265
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:05,160
and then um contrast with the phenomenon

1266
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,059
of like

1267
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:08,099
um uh some other sense retineration and

1268
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:10,319
uh whether they have what type of light

1269
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,359
embodiment and disembodiment adjectivity

1270
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:14,339
experiences they have

1271
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:15,780
yeah

1272
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,319
okay but yeah I don't know exactly what

1273
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:21,420
I was trying to get it but I think it

1274
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,400
was also more related to because you

1275
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,960
said that when meditating you have to

1276
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,099
sort of

1277
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:27,559
let yourself

1278
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:29,880
letting go exactly the ideas then

1279
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,859
everything has to be perfectly sort of

1280
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:33,599
predictable right that's that's the idea

1281
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,300
behind it so then I I'm I'm thinking so

1282
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,000
you always within yoga don't you have to

1283
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,160
do like the exact same movements in

1284
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,720
order for it to be predictable in order

1285
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,119
for for you to let go and not over

1286
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,220
attend to the environment does that make

1287
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,020
sense or

1288
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:53,220
if I thought when when were you both uh

1289
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,740
on the Simo we're speaking I think on

1290
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,300
one side you see more maybe you're

1291
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,980
referring to the implicit procedural map

1292
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,380
implicit procedural knowledge that can

1293
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,640
uh you can acquire through yoga and you

1294
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,339
and I are talking about doing things

1295
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:14,460
without being aware which is also

1296
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,400
automatic and left and you both are

1297
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,200
right I think in this because on one

1298
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,079
hand if you and you would say like if

1299
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,559
you do yoga you learn how to to do yoga

1300
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:29,880
right so you learn how to uh

1301
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,660
um

1302
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,480
move yourself in this in this way so

1303
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,059
that when you do a certain position you

1304
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:37,500
know then you have to arrange your body

1305
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,540
and for a ranger that you always have to

1306
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,359
keep monitoring yourself so there is a

1307
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:44,760
continuous going back to your body

1308
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,660
keeping track of your body and continue

1309
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,299
to monitor yourself but in this way

1310
00:58:51,299 --> 00:58:54,319
because you have learned to do this

1311
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,660
these um constant constant going back

1312
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,460
and being aware on yourself and these

1313
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,859
comes also when you you do your movement

1314
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:03,480
you have learned that you certain

1315
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,720
posture are made in a certain way so

1316
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,359
that it becomes more or less predictable

1317
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,180
actually what you're gonna do right but

1318
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,099
it doesn't mean that you you don't have

1319
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:16,680
to be aware and actually there is a

1320
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,559
trick uh reload here because you're a

1321
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:22,079
very attentive with what's going on but

1322
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,240
at the same time the more your attentive

1323
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,579
the more so much a sensory attenuation

1324
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:29,220
may happen and actually it's what we are

1325
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,440
trying to argue in our active uh

1326
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,780
inference model

1327
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,000
the the more a predictable it gets the

1328
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,520
more it gets attenuated but doesn't mean

1329
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,859
that you're not aware that's that's uh

1330
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:43,619
yeah that's good thank you for this

1331
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:46,680
input because it helps us elaborate this

1332
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,540
I think it's super interesting because

1333
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,819
it's like when you when when you look at

1334
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:52,799
like people that climb or surf or

1335
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,720
whatever any type of sports right in the

1336
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,920
beginning in order to learn the skill

1337
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,180
you have to put a lot of attention to

1338
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,099
the individual movements but then later

1339
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:00,599
on in order to actually be good at it

1340
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:02,579
you have to take the attention away and

1341
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,140
then in those moments is when the people

1342
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,520
report that they're actually feeling

1343
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,200
sort of selfless days in this flow

1344
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,540
States right which is when the the

1345
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,540
movements are internalized so to speak I

1346
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,740
think that's that's super interesting

1347
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,480
can I can I just shoot the other two

1348
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,220
questions I had they're like sort of

1349
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,740
different or should we go to Julia first

1350
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:23,598
maybe it's true yes I don't know

1351
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,760
I sorry um yeah sorry for the lighting

1352
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,619
and sorry because I'm in the lab so it's

1353
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:31,140
probably not the best position uh thank

1354
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,880
you very it was very interesting and I'm

1355
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,700
really uh looking forward to um yeah

1356
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,280
look at the uh yeah the results you you

1357
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,099
have in your study especially yeah I

1358
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,960
mean since uh as and I mentioned we had

1359
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,280
something interesting with the

1360
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,839
international Banking and the

1361
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:49,200
personalization and um yeah kind of

1362
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,420
happy about that and what I do so I'm

1363
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,059
really sorry because I listened kind of

1364
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:55,859
doing something else unfortunately in

1365
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:57,960
the lab I was busy um while you were

1366
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,780
talking but I kind of like the idea of

1367
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,380
um

1368
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,380
yeah that's the self is attenuated or

1369
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,839
not or increasing and kind of goes back

1370
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:09,299
to just Simon the last comment from

1371
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:11,579
Simon about expertise

1372
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:12,359
um

1373
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:15,660
I think in terms of motto uh interaction

1374
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,020
there is some literal tribality

1375
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:21,180
expert I was trying to Google that

1376
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,880
um that I attended a workshop last year

1377
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,760
and I think it was about once you're an

1378
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,040
expert

1379
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,540
you at the beginning you have this kind

1380
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,000
of flexical you you you have a better

1381
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,980
understanding Consciousness and then at

1382
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,440
the end you kind of learn to let it go

1383
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,440
to write the flow of the motion kind of

1384
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,480
so it's not that you are and I think

1385
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,920
it's probably maybe the same I don't

1386
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,559
know whether yeah but attention in

1387
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,319
meditation is that you have this maybe

1388
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:51,660
more like not focused

1389
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:56,040
uh it does not stay but more like open

1390
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,079
um sorry I forgot the name of the

1391
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,579
meditation type of mission you know but

1392
01:01:59,579 --> 01:02:02,160
open meditation and monitoring yeah yeah

1393
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,140
exactly so you I mean I don't know it's

1394
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,420
uh so it would be interesting and I

1395
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,140
suggested to see what kind of meditation

1396
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,480
what type of meditation maybe change the

1397
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,980
sense of the self maybe at the beginning

1398
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,660
it's more acute because you really

1399
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:19,260
scrutinize your sensation and and then

1400
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,180
after I don't know this is something

1401
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,618
that you plan to do right or

1402
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,000
should I go or do you want to go on

1403
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,119
uh the

1404
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,960
the first question was I know ah there

1405
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,119
is a body of evidence they actually say

1406
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,000
that in expert meditators uh attention

1407
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,640
to start decreasing

1408
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,480
but there is also because you allocate

1409
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,940
less and less attention but I would be

1410
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,880
careful with that because with with this

1411
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,240
because they say there is an uh decrease

1412
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,520
that uh decrease activity in anterior

1413
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,640
singlet cortex

1414
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,180
so they make inference about it

1415
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:11,099
um as as a meditators as well uh and

1416
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:13,559
having to know other people there are

1417
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:15,599
more experienced than me

1418
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,640
they would never say we lose our

1419
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,980
attention to that because our experience

1420
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,980
is so rich our Sanctuary signals and

1421
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,140
related thought process that you cannot

1422
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:29,460
afford to not be attentive however we

1423
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,380
can drink into the play different kinds

1424
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,480
of attention as you said there is

1425
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,119
focused attention or there's an

1426
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:39,420
attention that requires more explicit uh

1427
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,540
thought about that some more explicit

1428
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,599
kind of uh way to focus on things and

1429
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,540
there is more like a bear bear attention

1430
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,240
so when you focus on the whole

1431
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,760
experience and you let things go with a

1432
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,359
non-judgmental attitude and more open

1433
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,160
attitude and is actually this attitude

1434
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,200
we're very stressed in meditation

1435
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,000
techniques that's why they're a bit

1436
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,700
under lock and in research I feel

1437
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,640
because it's it's a lot about how we use

1438
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,339
attention but not the intent attention

1439
01:04:11,339 --> 01:04:15,599
but not how we use intention so our

1440
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,480
attitude has the attitude that mediters

1441
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,599
has to be very open and very

1442
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:23,160
non-judgmental and these reduce the

1443
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,319
non-reactive incentive for for example

1444
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:29,160
and reduce the ability to self-regulate

1445
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,200
the your experience

1446
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,299
your life yeah I have

1447
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:36,119
partially answered

1448
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:38,099
you know I mean I kind of like the idea

1449
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:39,720
that you you linked that with attention

1450
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,359
and um it's just I think maybe it will

1451
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:44,220
be interesting to look at different type

1452
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,900
of attention because

1453
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,640
um

1454
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,920
whether you know you have like so maybe

1455
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,900
there is a difference between I don't

1456
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,819
know different type of meditation May

1457
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:56,160
develop different type of I don't know

1458
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,319
if maybe the open

1459
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,940
um meditation

1460
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,980
he's more prone I don't know because you

1461
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,540
mentioned the Instagram cortex into me

1462
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,119
it's more associated with a certain type

1463
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:08,880
of attention like more like maybe

1464
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,299
um more prone for like a feedback

1465
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:14,700
um or negativity or these kind of you

1466
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,520
know error monitoring process so it's

1467
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,839
not like your attention you lose your

1468
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:20,819
attention it's just it's more like in

1469
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:22,859
the background and then when there is a

1470
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:25,079
mistake or something it kind of pops up

1471
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:27,780
more quickly I don't know and you may

1472
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:31,799
have more like uh frontal or a sustain

1473
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:33,540
attention I don't know I mean I'm not

1474
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,700
especially of attention at all so please

1475
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,099
take that little bit of self

1476
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:39,780
um yeah I was wondering if this is

1477
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,760
something I don't know obviously I mean

1478
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,740
because it's only you're not trying to

1479
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:48,359
do any EG or or narrow physiological

1480
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:51,319
measurement right

1481
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:59,640
yeah but in the in the pipeline yeah

1482
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,359
okay but we really want uh with um with

1483
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,280
Valeria is

1484
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,660
um

1485
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:09,780
and other collaborators is to basically

1486
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,960
push against this idea that uh you can

1487
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,900
have selfless experiences I know it's

1488
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,880
controversial and many people talk about

1489
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,660
oh selfless experience below

1490
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:24,059
uh so basically we want to say radically

1491
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:26,099
speaking okay though so that works if

1492
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:28,020
you buy the bullet in your mind what you

1493
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:29,760
do a list and somehow consider that

1494
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,780
actually the body kind of like

1495
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,579
disappears in the process but if you're

1496
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:35,460
not mind body dualist then you need to

1497
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,559
make basically put the body into the

1498
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:40,140
equation and realize that actually what

1499
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,680
allows the mind to disappear is the fact

1500
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,920
into the pureness of the experiences the

1501
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,440
fact that the impure body is kind of

1502
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,720
like put in a

1503
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,700
stable condition in such a way that

1504
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,200
basically can afford to live it in the

1505
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,960
background and yeah to have like this

1506
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,480
type of like um experience arising but

1507
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,359
without that in place uh you it can't

1508
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,460
cannot really afford to you know go

1509
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,220
through the selfless experiences and

1510
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:10,079
this is why we want to be provocative in

1511
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,500
the titles that well actually maybe the

1512
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,720
experience of like selfless

1513
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,059
um you know selfless experiences

1514
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:19,579
actually comes

1515
01:07:19,579 --> 01:07:22,559
necessarily as to sign of the same coin

1516
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,680
of this experience of like having a

1517
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,099
unlimited body that actually expands to

1518
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:31,020
through the world but the body is there

1519
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:34,200
I mean the the thing the The Entity that

1520
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:39,359
has the experience of no experience is

1521
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:43,200
that a body that kind of like is

1522
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,839
um self-regulated in a certain way like

1523
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,000
the homeostasis is put at like a set

1524
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,220
point and when you're using this

1525
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:53,700
metaphor of like think of um

1526
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,339
a cyclone Right Moving Cyclone so you

1527
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:58,859
have the steel eye of the cyclone in the

1528
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:00,539
middle doesn't mean that actually is not

1529
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:03,599
there it's just like it's around

1530
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,000
everything and because we are

1531
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,480
self-organized in biological systems uh

1532
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,839
we kind of like this animal this thing

1533
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,640
needs to keep track of this internal

1534
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,399
bodily states and their I mean just a

1535
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:20,479
successful system does this all the time

1536
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,279
all the time literally from second one

1537
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,100
when we basically get from one cell to

1538
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,040
you know the substanceism some sort of

1539
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,620
like fascinating self-organization that

1540
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,120
is happening on the cellular level

1541
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,060
already and it like needs to be yeah and

1542
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,620
death is basically this is what is

1543
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,698
happening it's like a single

1544
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:41,100
disintegration of like this

1545
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,738
um you know self-organization and um but

1546
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:45,359
that's clearly that's not what is

1547
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,520
happening on meditation right because

1548
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,560
you do hopefully you don't die when you

1549
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,560
meditate in that sense there is a

1550
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,479
disintegration of a certain way to

1551
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,160
experience yourself in relation to the

1552
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,380
body in the world but clearly there's

1553
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,420
something that stays there needs to stay

1554
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,979
there for you to have those experiences

1555
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:04,738
so that's a bit of controversial radical

1556
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:07,080
claim that we like to defend and uh yeah

1557
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,479
we already had this discussion several

1558
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,359
people for instance like whatever and I

1559
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:15,299
we've been to uh Enlighten and this

1560
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:18,359
workshop on um of knowledge and neural

1561
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:20,279
computation we met there with people

1562
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:21,899
like Thomas betsiger and everything and

1563
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:23,759
they always have a different opinion so

1564
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,319
kind of like have a lively discussion

1565
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:28,100
about why we think it's like

1566
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,120
what does it mean to actually Lose

1567
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,279
Yourself and what is the self and what

1568
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:34,920
is the pure experience and why we

1569
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,660
basically need whether we're like it or

1570
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,299
not the connection with the impure body

1571
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:41,279
to make sure that it can have at a

1572
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,620
certain point of pure experience but

1573
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,060
then but then again this is something

1574
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,859
that just speculation at the theory

1575
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:49,259
level and this is why I have this

1576
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:51,960
brilliant team here that we we can do

1577
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,320
some uh studies and actually measure

1578
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,060
stuff put the finger on it put the

1579
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,580
number yeah and see

1580
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,480
what we get

1581
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,340
these are these are awesome

1582
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,199
points and there's so many ways it could

1583
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,080
go I'll read a question from the live

1584
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,040
chat so G pagnani wrote

1585
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,920
the notion of increased somata sensory

1586
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,199
transparency in experienced meditators

1587
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:22,020
associated with increased liveliness of

1588
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,659
the experience is intriguing can you say

1589
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,239
something about which levels in the

1590
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:29,400
hierarchical structure of the internal

1591
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,120
model are more likely to be affected by

1592
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,159
the meditative attentional tasks in

1593
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:37,560
terms of precision deployment do you

1594
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,719
think the attenuation of somatosensory

1595
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:41,940
prediction error concerns more

1596
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:44,760
intermediate levels in a way increased

1597
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,460
meta awareness rather than sheer sensory

1598
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,940
attention

1599
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,880
I just wanted to ask rather than

1600
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,659
ensuring

1601
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,100
but rather than sheer sensory attention

1602
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:11,159
yeah you can go on now please yeah so uh

1603
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:12,300
um

1604
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,080
yeah so this is something I I'm I'm

1605
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,780
trying to develop this idea right now

1606
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:19,980
with

1607
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,480
um

1608
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,699
um a PhD student of mine

1609
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:27,300
um uh Libby uh Liberty service basically

1610
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,159
uh and this is why it's connected with

1611
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:31,440
the question that you ask you'll see is

1612
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,920
that um

1613
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,380
you know your platform is active

1614
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,300
inference right and so people are kind

1615
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,600
of like you know um

1616
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,040
lately kind of like realize wait a

1617
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,020
minute actually we're active and we need

1618
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,520
to explain action in the world and

1619
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,199
everything is kind of like comes late

1620
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,659
right but uh if you look uh going back

1621
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:53,640
to the animal basically

1622
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,100
um the action and the movement is there

1623
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,199
from the very beginning so this means

1624
01:11:58,199 --> 01:11:59,940
that this is why it's so important to

1625
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,620
basically relate the um um you know

1626
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,760
self-organization self-awareness

1627
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,219
self-perception necessarily related with

1628
01:12:08,219 --> 01:12:12,120
movement not so movement so on action is

1629
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,280
not something that you add on the top of

1630
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,199
this right like uh and some people like

1631
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,659
intention so you can have an intention

1632
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:20,400
but basically the first movements are

1633
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,900
kind of like automatic and need to be

1634
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,940
there right and basically our body moves

1635
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,100
all the time because we breathe all the

1636
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,159
time and our heart beats all the time so

1637
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:31,140
this means that for me this type of like

1638
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:34,020
attenuation it's happening at the

1639
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,179
sensory level because that's the basic

1640
01:12:36,179 --> 01:12:38,400
one so can you have sensory stuff

1641
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,860
without metacognitive stuff yes can you

1642
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,719
have the cognitive stuff without sensory

1643
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,480
stuff no so it's like what what is basic

1644
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,540
that's the first things needs to be um

1645
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:52,800
um uh alternated and then then it has to

1646
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,840
be a balance between meta cognitive and

1647
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,659
sensory attenuation because uh this is

1648
01:12:57,659 --> 01:12:59,100
precisely what I think it is happening

1649
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,780
in the personalization here because if

1650
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:04,199
you if you focus too much right so if

1651
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:07,140
you lose the the balance right between

1652
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,860
then you you basically

1653
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:11,400
um

1654
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,540
yeah it's it's kind of like this type of

1655
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,060
you cannot afford to sell forget

1656
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,460
yourself yeah and then it's kind of like

1657
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,440
the self-standing way and that gets to

1658
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,780
get you even more disconnected so to

1659
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,840
speak yeah uh so this is why I think

1660
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,460
it's important to

1661
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,460
um uh contrast different type of like a

1662
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,100
meditative experiences and meditative

1663
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,080
practices to see which one of them

1664
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,699
actually

1665
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:41,820
um has more focus on what you do with

1666
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:44,280
the metacognitive metal Oneness

1667
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,320
awareness of awareness and which one are

1668
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,239
actually involving more like sensory

1669
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:49,739
movement for instance like let's say

1670
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:51,840
yeah so that's that's something that

1671
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,179
needs to be um empirically tested but I

1672
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,460
would speculate and then obviously we

1673
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,560
can put a test either by doing a

1674
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,239
simulation or you know actually

1675
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,060
collecting data to see how that

1676
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:08,900
um uh plays into this uh distinction

1677
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,460
I think Simon wants to say something but

1678
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,140
I'm not the moderator So Daniel you

1679
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:17,580
decide

1680
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,360
yeah Valeria first and then um

1681
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,980
okay uh

1682
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:27,659
yeah thank you Anna that was very uh I

1683
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:29,520
don't have so much more to say because I

1684
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,159
agree with her but uh

1685
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,520
I thought when Jani and you were reading

1686
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,719
the question I for me the answer was

1687
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,880
more or less clear in the sense that

1688
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,420
um as I say the somatician continuation

1689
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,400
happens are the very low level

1690
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,040
predictions so

1691
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,679
in a very uh pre-reflective

1692
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:56,520
self-consciousness uh so that the person

1693
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,340
was asking uh

1694
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,100
if you know at least in the meditation

1695
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,860
techniques with the when you put the

1696
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:06,719
attention on for example your bodily

1697
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,600
signals there you have a top down

1698
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,480
modulation of this uh of precision

1699
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,719
racing but the top 10 modulation is on

1700
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:17,400
low level predictions

1701
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,280
so you're not putting top down on what

1702
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,080
you think about your body is you're

1703
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,400
actually doing the opposite you're

1704
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,620
trying to forget about your uh previous

1705
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,120
expectations about the body because

1706
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,500
you're trying to have this

1707
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,840
non-judgmental awareness about what's

1708
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,580
going on in your experience

1709
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:38,940
and then uh with this

1710
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:44,159
um let's say uh less uh biased uh way to

1711
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,460
attend your body you start piercing and

1712
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,920
perceiving uh

1713
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,640
um

1714
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,300
bodily uh Sensations in your body or

1715
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,600
yourself or other kind of experiences so

1716
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,280
I would say

1717
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,060
this increasing Precision on

1718
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,100
somatosensory signals happens at the low

1719
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,860
level of the hierarchy

1720
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:09,780
um that then attenuates the sensory

1721
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,580
consequences of this

1722
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:15,060
um of the first year

1723
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:15,780
um

1724
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:20,580
and the math awareness comes uh when you

1725
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,480
learn

1726
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,900
the when you're I think when you start

1727
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:28,080
having increased body awareness so you

1728
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,719
you'll make more experience I think then

1729
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,940
you start developing meta awareness

1730
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:37,140
about how your body is actually

1731
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:37,820
um

1732
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:41,520
about higher representation of the body

1733
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,159
of your body but in the moment when this

1734
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,920
happens uh I think it really happens

1735
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,199
that the low levels of personal beliefs

1736
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,380
and then later on the longer time scales

1737
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:57,060
then it starts becoming uh more abstract

1738
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:01,080
and ingrained in your personal uh at the

1739
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,420
personal level of your beliefs

1740
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:06,840
that's how I stay but of course uh if

1741
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,520
Simon has something to do with it um

1742
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,040
yeah it's really open

1743
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,719
I know I didn't I didn't want to comment

1744
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,580
that I just selfishly erased my hand to

1745
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:17,460
ask another question Yeah okay or Daniel

1746
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,080
I don't know if you have an opinion on

1747
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:22,440
that I'm happy to hear it as well

1748
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,739
well certainly

1749
01:17:24,739 --> 01:17:27,960
resonated with uh this comparative

1750
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,960
approach to studying the the diversity

1751
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,179
of

1752
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:34,739
methods and protocols we already have

1753
01:17:34,739 --> 01:17:37,320
for mind and body and attention

1754
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,560
broadening the scope and just kind of

1755
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,360
pointing putting darts in the space of

1756
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,880
of what practices do people engage their

1757
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,440
mind and body in and then how can that

1758
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,440
territory be explored with also a

1759
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,500
variety of theoretical models and how

1760
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,840
does that relationship connect to the

1761
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,940
kinds of empirical work that we might do

1762
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:02,159
in a brain scanner or um with other

1763
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,320
kinds of measuring

1764
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,140
um and I think one thing I

1765
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,060
I I

1766
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,780
want to explore more is like in a

1767
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,120
hierarchical nested cognitive model

1768
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,520
which we often speak of ourselves and

1769
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,300
other uh types of sophisticated entities

1770
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,340
as

1771
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:26,460
where's our awareness where's awareness

1772
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:31,760
Matt picture and um

1773
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,340
and and also to Simone's question about

1774
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,400
um when we're moving

1775
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:42,719
but we're expecting what we're moving

1776
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,900
then how does the exteroceptive flow

1777
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,360
like the visual field you might be very

1778
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,000
familiar with walking and so you might

1779
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,420
be able to proprioceptively kind of zero

1780
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,120
out on your walking

1781
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,140
but there's this extra receptive

1782
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,300
um flow of novelty in the world

1783
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,060
so I think that that how

1784
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,699
um and then connected back to the

1785
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:10,920
comparative and staring at a candle or a

1786
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,900
blank screen or darkness and all these

1787
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:15,239
different methods

1788
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:17,360
um

1789
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:21,060
it's it's there's a lot that that

1790
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,739
these questions bring up

1791
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:23,820
yeah

1792
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,460
thank you Daniel so I I have something

1793
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,659
to add to that because I think it's

1794
01:19:27,659 --> 01:19:30,060
super important so um

1795
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:33,480
so for me it's not so you know my

1796
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,219
background is like in body cognition and

1797
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:36,719
activists and everything and for me it's

1798
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,400
really not at all surprising the fact

1799
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,800
that many of these techniques have been

1800
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,840
developed by people that kind of like

1801
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,440
lived in closed communities right so

1802
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,800
it's like you have a space where people

1803
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,640
can you know meditate walking I don't

1804
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,500
know and then they have this ritual they

1805
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,239
wake up at this time and they do this

1806
01:19:57,239 --> 01:20:00,239
thing so you put yourself in a yeah it's

1807
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,400
a ritual right like all the

1808
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,679
to reach also so this means it's like as

1809
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:06,239
I said it's like high predictability

1810
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,980
right

1811
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,719
um and then that's that's something

1812
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:12,300
super super uh important yeah and even

1813
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,219
if even in the

1814
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:16,620
walking meditation you need to

1815
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,540
um follow a certain path

1816
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:21,719
um uh yeah so that's that's super

1817
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:24,380
interesting

1818
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:27,900
well

1819
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,719
um in in the last uh five or ten minutes

1820
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,880
I would love to hear from each of you

1821
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,580
like what are your directions heading

1822
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,880
forward and and what's the um

1823
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,860
what's exciting to you and where would

1824
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,880
you like to take this

1825
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:47,040
maybe um Simone and Julia first and then

1826
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,199
we'll kind of make our way back to the

1827
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,678
authorship

1828
01:20:51,739 --> 01:20:55,140
I mean I mean I'm not not myself not

1829
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,420
working on the project right but like

1830
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,340
what I what I was really interested in

1831
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,380
sort of extending this is trying to

1832
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,600
understand

1833
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,159
um because the way

1834
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,320
the way those deep meditative states are

1835
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,140
reported sometimes and the way

1836
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,060
um people with depersonalization

1837
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:17,760
disorder report their experience is very

1838
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,860
similar they almost did like the same

1839
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:22,500
words right and to describe how they

1840
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,219
feel and I wonder why one is experienced

1841
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:27,360
positively and one is experience so

1842
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,300
negatively as in it being a disorder and

1843
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,340
completely disrupting someone's life

1844
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,980
so that was like this this comparison I

1845
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:38,900
think I would be very uh curious about

1846
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,219
awesome Julia if you want to add

1847
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:46,460
anything

1848
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,380
um we're not it's it's very interesting

1849
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,440
and um yeah I mean again I'm not so

1850
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,120
involved in this study so it's a bit

1851
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,920
hard but I mean I'm really interested in

1852
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,219
the I mean all the Selfies affected by

1853
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:01,080
yeah our interaction with the world

1854
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:04,440
external world so uh and I'm completely

1855
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,719
already spoiled with the result we have

1856
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,420
with the international binding so um

1857
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:12,540
uh it's very interesting I mean yeah

1858
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:16,320
it's the self is attenuated or um if

1859
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,420
it's disappear kind of I think that's

1860
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,760
the key uh question we want to ensure

1861
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,000
and uh yeah I would be very curious to

1862
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,140
know I mean what very I found in uh data

1863
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,699
uh to see if we can have a common

1864
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:32,159
narrative about what's happening

1865
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:35,219
um also with the personalization

1866
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:37,739
um yeah it's very interesting to see how

1867
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:40,800
moving or body I mean attention uh to

1868
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,620
the body can really change the self kind

1869
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,940
of for the way we process sales

1870
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:46,860
information

1871
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:50,599
um yeah so very interesting

1872
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,320
or honor

1873
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,760
yes so

1874
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,820
um there's like lots of work to do ahead

1875
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:02,100
but that's exciting right

1876
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:02,699
um

1877
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:06,719
yeah so very short term it's like we

1878
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,060
need to write up this results that we

1879
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,260
just got

1880
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:12,600
um so yeah in relation to the body so

1881
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,219
basically going to have some numbers to

1882
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:16,920
show so that's that's super nice

1883
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,679
um and then the next steps would be to

1884
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:20,699
um you know

1885
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:22,500
um

1886
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:23,520
um

1887
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,480
create or develop a computational model

1888
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:31,440
around this yeah with basically contrast

1889
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,960
you know the real world data with you

1890
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,239
know um

1891
01:23:35,239 --> 01:23:39,540
simulation data and then uh yeah so have

1892
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,820
a multi-layer type of like approach with

1893
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:44,460
different methods from physiological to

1894
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,560
behavioral to phenomenological to

1895
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,080
computational potential also neural so

1896
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,239
that's something with would be nice to

1897
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:54,420
do in the next steps yeah

1898
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:55,860
um so yeah

1899
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,960
um and apart from that I think that's

1900
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,860
all for now uh and I'll let uh I'll

1901
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:05,760
leave uh the flow to Valeria

1902
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,940
well again thank you again

1903
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:12,300
and I know everybody uh yeah I I also

1904
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,860
wanted to thank you a lot for this

1905
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:15,960
platform this invitation it was yeah

1906
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,300
really nice a really nice person and

1907
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,239
really nice conversation

1908
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:21,960
um

1909
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:24,179
I'm working with on in these projects so

1910
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:26,040
she already said what what's the the

1911
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,860
next Direction on what I can add in this

1912
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:31,320
I think would be

1913
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,600
on the theoretical side also start

1914
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,699
engaging with

1915
01:24:35,699 --> 01:24:36,980
um

1916
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:41,760
more closely to bodily reactions to

1917
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,760
meditation because the body boundaries

1918
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,159
the solution is just one part of it it's

1919
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:48,900
like one part of the phenomenology but

1920
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,159
it's not the only thing that happens

1921
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:52,260
during meditation

1922
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:54,540
um there is a lot of potential that can

1923
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:57,900
be discovered uh on this because

1924
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,620
um

1925
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,300
because the body boundary is the

1926
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,640
solution again it's really study a lot

1927
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,659
but it's a phenomenon and there is so

1928
01:25:06,659 --> 01:25:08,280
many other things that happens in our

1929
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,560
body while we meditate and you I I speak

1930
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,800
for first first person experience but in

1931
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,480
the community it's really like already

1932
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,500
sad other kinds of also um uh more

1933
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,199
healing Traditions like breath work for

1934
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:23,340
example

1935
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,679
there there is a lot of potential where

1936
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:28,560
people already work on that but there is

1937
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,140
no Bridge uh with the academic

1938
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,840
communities so people work pragmatically

1939
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,000
with this intuitive knowledge as well

1940
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,500
what happens in the body during these

1941
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,600
alternate States Of Consciousness but

1942
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,719
still we need to rage it with uh trying

1943
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:45,060
to make sense from a phonological and

1944
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,100
scientific point of view an experimental

1945
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,620
point of view as well so I think I see

1946
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:52,380
myself in yeah trying to step in this

1947
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,080
tour then like bring Insight from one

1948
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,260
world to the other and

1949
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:01,080
opening uh to help myself and the other

1950
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:04,100
people around me yeah

1951
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,420
awesome well

1952
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,580
it's the Vlog with the work that sounds

1953
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:11,280
really exciting love the idea of the the

1954
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:15,060
two-way street with different bodily and

1955
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:18,360
cognitive practices and

1956
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,820
collaboration and conversation that can

1957
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:23,040
bring in all these different expertises

1958
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,860
that that maybe don't have an fmri study

1959
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:26,820
already

1960
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,800
whatever that's worth

1961
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,320
thank you though always um any of you

1962
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,020
are welcome back and really appreciate

1963
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,540
that you all came out

1964
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:37,980
thank you Daniel

1965
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:41,059
thank you see you soon
