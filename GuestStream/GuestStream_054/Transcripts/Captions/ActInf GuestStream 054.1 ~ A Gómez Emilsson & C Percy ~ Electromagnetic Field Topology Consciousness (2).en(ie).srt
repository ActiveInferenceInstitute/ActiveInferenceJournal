1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,639
hello and welcome everyone this is

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,460
active inference live stream guest

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,340
stream number 54.1

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,460
it's August 25th

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,420
2023. today we're going to be hearing

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,000
about electromagnetic field topology as

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,100
a solution to the boundary problem of

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,340
Consciousness this is going to be a

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,460
co-presentation followed by a discussion

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,040
with our guests here so I will leave it

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,140
to everyone to introduce themselves and

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,840
present and discuss however they prefer

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,480
and thank you again for joining please

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,579
thank you so much uh for having us

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,160
Daniel uh yeah I mean there is a

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,960
co-founder of quality Research Institute

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,500
and uh yeah uh I'm here with a Chris and

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,360
eliebert Chris clother release paper and

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,719
and the Lieber volunteer and uh Wiki

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,879
extraordinaire for a qri but yeah go

21
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,000
ahead uh Chris and Hillary yes

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,459
no no no no no more to say that that's

23
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,199
plenty let's let's get into the detail

24
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,140
yeah I'm good working with qri and a lot

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,180
into active in France so I'm and I'm

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,140
trying to unify with active influence a

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,220
lot and yeah

28
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,540
beautiful uh yeah I mean essentially

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,439
yeah next next slide essentially our

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,479
um

31
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,040
outline of this presentation is gonna

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,079
essentially walk you through some of the

33
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,060
key ideas of the paper

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,100
um and kind of like trying to illustrate

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,600
them or making them a little bit more

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,400
intuitive

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,380
um fairly high level although we will

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,180
actually present kind of the the core

39
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,159
the core argument

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,259
um the main thing to to to point out

41
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,640
here uh next slide is that

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,079
the genetic theories of Consciousness

43
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,899
you know I guess like 20 years ago they

44
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,500
sounded like a total total crackpot type

45
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,000
yeah I've still got a good connection so

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,040
we can give him a moment or two yeah if

47
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,140
not I'll I'll pick up from

48
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,399
what was the crackpot

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,980
vehicle next oh my gosh

50
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,239
um sorry please repeat from crackpot

51
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,959
oh yeah oh my God yeah uh over the last

52
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,640
20 years however there's been an

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,040
explosion of interest in electromagnetic

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,780
theories of Consciousness and serious

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,640
peer-reviewed Publications about them

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,620
especially the last 10 and then five

57
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,019
years kind of like a variable

58
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:53,160
exponential explosion in terms of a

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,720
number of like serious articles

60
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
published and one of the very very kind

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,860
of like key amazing kind of like

62
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,519
contributions that something like

63
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:03,599
Connecticut magnetic Theory Of

64
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,540
Consciousness can offer to the overall

65
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,540
ecosystem of philosophy of mind is that

66
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,959
it provides a way to solve

67
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,260
question for how information can be

68
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,180
combined I mean essentially when you

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,920
have information specifically

70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,019
distributed how is it possible that they

71
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,599
can be simultaneously part of some kind

72
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,159
of like unified whole

73
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,900
and electromagnetic theories of

74
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,360
Consciousness are just very proud to say

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,599
well the electromagnetic field is

76
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,500
ontologically unitary it's already

77
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,720
unified so there's not much of a problem

78
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,980
here

79
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,500
um if however you know once you kind of

80
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,340
like have this this uh Unity uh then the

81
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,720
question becomes well but how do you

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,400
actually draw a boundary around it so

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,140
actually you just traded one problem for

84
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,760
another so

85
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,099
it's the guy yeah dig into the details

86
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,220
there

87
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,140
oh should I take us through the

88
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,239
literature reviewers context for this

89
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,700
and then Andrews will come back to kind

90
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,319
of give you the the solution that we

91
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,540
think can fit with electromagnetic

92
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,860
fields

93
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,080
so yeah the boundary problem let's so

94
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,879
binding problem you heard just now into

95
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,858
a first approximation that is

96
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,298
whatever you think might make up

97
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,399
Consciousness maybe it's neurons firing

98
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,340
maybe it's some sort of magical choir at

99
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,540
the bottom of the universe whatever you

100
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,820
think it is these small things need to

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,300
be bound together to ex to reflect the

102
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,699
complex phenomenology we have we see

103
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,440
lots of things all at once right now I'm

104
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm smelling the flowers outside I've

105
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,340
got the laptop screen in front of me

106
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,440
there's lots of stuff happening all at

107
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,720
once in a unified way so that's the

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,460
binding problem we won't do more on that

109
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,199
here we'll sort of assume some

110
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,880
familiarity with it but then the

111
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,460
boundary problem is well once you've got

112
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,500
a mechanism that creates The Binding

113
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,900
between these lower level entities

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,759
why would that mechanism ever stop

115
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,520
because clearly our awareness our

116
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,280
phenomenology doesn't go on forever we

117
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,479
don't know what's happening in Alpha

118
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,180
Century our awareness is not unbounded

119
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,919
and as soon as you realize that you need

120
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,900
boundaries around something

121
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,419
a number of things suddenly don't quite

122
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,479
make sense so Owen Schrodinger or

123
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,000
physics Fame flagged this up as one of

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,919
the things that he felt was completely

125
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,500
unresolved so despite his his kind of

126
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,940
vast intellect and his contributions

127
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,580
elsewhere he felt that this puzzle was

128
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,160
one of the things that he described as

129
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,259
when he turns his mind to it everything

130
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,180
just evaporates none of it none of it

131
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,919
makes sense anymore he can't get a grip

132
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,840
on the problem and he described the

133
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,740
problem

134
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,419
as you can see on the screen he was

135
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,660
saying why is it that my identity is at

136
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,060
the intermediate level this kind of

137
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,820
roughly human-shaped body

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,100
and you can say okay well mostly mean

139
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,419
the central nervous system but either

140
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,360
way this this broad entity has lots of

141
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,940
smaller things inside it cells organs

142
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,780
human bodies and lots of things above it

143
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,639
cities states solar systems universes

144
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,199
and so on

145
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,780
why is our self-consciousness always at

146
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,380
this always at this one level and if you

147
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,180
describe that as a problem to somebody

148
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,740
who's never heard of it before or never

149
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,180
thought of it before

150
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,039
they may if this happens to me just just

151
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,259
last Friday they might say

152
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,800
well it's obviously just like

153
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,919
the body stops like the skull stops here

154
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,440
or like my arm stops here like of of

155
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,300
course it's not going out to our first

156
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,360
century why why would it and that's it's

157
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,280
a very intuitive immediate human

158
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
reaction but you probe it a little bit

159
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,139
as Schrodinger did and it kind of falls

160
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,220
apart

161
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,600
because

162
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,699
if you're a you're on firing somewhere

163
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,620
in the central nervous system and you're

164
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,840
being

165
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,100
initiated by a neuron in the peripheral

166
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,380
nervous system well how do you know to

167
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,360
stop binding how do you know that

168
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,919
there's a boundary that stops at the

169
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,199
edge of the central nervous system or if

170
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,360
your if your fingers are holding onto a

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,740
tool and you're getting feedback from

172
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,660
that tool you're driving a car it can

173
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,280
feel like you're part of that car how

174
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,440
does where does the system know where

175
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
the boundary is because most of these

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,360
things that we observe have

177
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,819
only Observer dependent

178
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,120
boundaries if you've got a wheel in a

179
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,039
car rolling along the road from one

180
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,360
perspective it looks like the wheel is

181
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,400
separate from the road but if you're a

182
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,840
tiny ant or something and the car is

183
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,520
parked these things all may feel like

184
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,780
they're one object

185
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,400
and this was when when Schrodinger

186
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
turned his mind to this it puzzled him

187
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,360
so there's that's given the benefit of

188
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
the doubt that's let's say that there's

189
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,599
something real to be puzzled through

190
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,460
here

191
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,860
this issue applies both to the example I

192
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,360
started with around building up in small

193
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,699
units but also if you're a cosmo pan

194
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,259
psychist you believe that there is one

195
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,020
universal Consciousness and we are like

196
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,780
a god playing with its puppets

197
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,220
in that case you still have the same

198
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,120
question because you're still

199
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,580
demarcating boundaries you just get the

200
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,560
mirror image we'll mostly focus on the

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,120
idea of expanding up from small things

202
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,280
because that's closer to the Orthodoxy

203
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,860
but there's no you can't solve this

204
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,780
problem magically by by declaring a

205
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,940
single consciousness

206
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,880
okay so that's that's what that

207
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,560
and say much more about this he just

208
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,080
said that this was a this was a puzzle

209
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,780
the first person we found that really

210
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,060
formalized this and gave it the name

211
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,379
boundary problem

212
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,539
was Rosenberg and it was a number of

213
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,120
pieces late 90s early 2000s

214
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,819
and he uses the phrase sitter and

215
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,099
cryptus but it's exactly the same idea

216
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,219
as schroeding I had one of them is well

217
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,500
why aren't there lots of small things I

218
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,820
think that's I think that might have

219
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,320
been the Silla that might have been the

220
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,919
the the nine-headed monster and then on

221
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,940
the other hand what about the things

222
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,740
that we are nested within and we call

223
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,899
that the Caribbean and he said it's very

224
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,839
hard to posit

225
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,360
a genuinely robust mechanism that would

226
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,580
stop it in both directions

227
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,860
you can imagine a reason why lots of

228
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,420
small things get bound together but why

229
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,380
would the binding stop and yeah his view

230
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,240
in framing this problem is that no one

231
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,580
had solved it

232
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,360
winding on to Anders and I chatting

233
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,040
about this last year and building on

234
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,680
some of qri's foundational work in this

235
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,779
area we wanted to know well what's

236
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,660
happened since Rosenberg framed this and

237
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,580
schroding was so puzzled by it like

238
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,019
surely someone's come up with a few

239
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,880
solutions to it

240
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,740
so Q standards database driven

241
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,600
literature review and you've got the

242
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,019
details there that fairly standard stuff

243
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,240
what we what we looked looking across

244
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,980
the scopus database we only found five

245
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,839
papers that seem to be relevant about

246
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,420
the boundary problem compared to 92 on

247
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,160
The Binding

248
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,740
and 47 on the combination problem so

249
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,380
some of these related problems and in

250
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,820
our intro we kind of went straight from

251
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,800
binding to boundary they are so you know

252
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
if you're thinking about one you really

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,740
should be thinking about the other

254
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,360
well that is not reflected in the

255
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,260
literature

256
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,779
we did a bit more puzzling around

257
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,820
people don't seem to be referring to

258
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,320
this by other names or when they are

259
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,420
they haven't solved it either

260
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,740
um so

261
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,180
it felt that there was something worth

262
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,680
going out here and this is what what

263
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,860
initiated the paper

264
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,140
what we did find though in partly in

265
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,880
those five papers and partly in looking

266
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,660
around we do find families of possible

267
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,459
solutions

268
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,800
and there's no clear winner but maybe

269
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,600
philosophy rarely has a clear winner for

270
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,399
anything so maybe that's an unreasonable

271
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,320
expectation but there's definitely open

272
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,860
questions for each class of theories

273
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,300
that have been put out there to solve

274
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,560
this problem

275
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,560
so the first of these Loosely termed

276
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,779
algorithmic so computational causal

277
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,700
structure theories I'm just trying to

278
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,220
summarize them in into one term some of

279
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,899
the examples there IIT of course very

280
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,300
well known uh Global workspace Theory as

281
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,220
well

282
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,019
they will tend to say that things bind

283
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,820
together when they're in a particular

284
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,440
pattern so you might imagine a database

285
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,240
that references itself or the working

286
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,700
memory of a computer or as soon as

287
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,260
things are somehow linked together in a

288
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,540
causal sense in IIT there's a particular

289
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,120
type of pattern but nonetheless it's an

290
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,720
abstract informational relationship

291
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,540
those papers don't tend to be super

292
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,519
explicit about defining boundaries

293
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,920
normally they let's say IIT will

294
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,779
normally say here's our system

295
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,820
and now let's ask within that system

296
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,060
where is the highest Buy

297
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,620
they sort of just say take the

298
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,120
boundaries on that says no one has said

299
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,560
this take the whole universe as a system

300
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,420
that the math is already virtually

301
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,380
impossible at even even toy systems

302
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,600
but reading between the lines or reading

303
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,980
some of the other papers around it

304
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,600
there's something about

305
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,940
if you had a high quite area surrounded

306
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,440
by lots of low-fi areas well it's

307
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,700
natural that it's the it's the bit

308
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,320
that's high and there's this principle

309
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
of exclusion that says you take the

310
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,620
highest one in a system

311
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,420
maybe you have to specify a system

312
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,640
before it makes sense to ask that

313
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,220
and if you took the highest bit out

314
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,899
somehow you just remove some of those

315
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,120
causal interconnections that create that

316
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,560
that highness

317
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,360
whatever's left will have a slightly

318
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,120
lower bit of Phi and that is now where

319
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,640
the the the sort of locus of

320
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,740
Consciousness resides

321
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,899
this may well work kind of the maths

322
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,160
would need working out I think Andrews

323
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,380
and I are initially skeptical

324
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,140
um but because as best as we can see no

325
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,240
one's really created complicated maps

326
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,560
and discussed what would happen when

327
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,420
you've got different mixtures of

328
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,000
densities that are shifting over time

329
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,040
what stops it from being arbitrary

330
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,779
certainly there are there are questions

331
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:37,980
to be had and we should come back to

332
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,540
this a bit if we want to talk about it

333
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,820
further but suffice it to say

334
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,740
it's not a guaranteed solution and

335
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,660
there's one critique that we we cite

336
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,220
there

337
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,139
resonance theories

338
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,279
um

339
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,380
a link between those and electromagnetic

340
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,560
fields now as well in the the main

341
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,579
progenitor of these theories Tom Hunt

342
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,380
would say that the the main resonance

343
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,959
which he sees binding happening together

344
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,139
in human consciousness is enfields so

345
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,399
there are there are links between these

346
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,440
as well and maybe the informational

347
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,420
patterns are being encoded in resonance

348
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,639
or quantum entanglement or even feel so

349
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,920
there can be links between these as well

350
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,540
the resonance theory that says The

351
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,920
Binding happens when things are in the

352
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,220
same frequency simple enough or when

353
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,100
they are close enough and that's becomes

354
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,260
a little bit more debatable but there is

355
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,779
you know what does that really mean

356
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,240
the boundaries there is

357
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,760
a conceptual solution for this which is

358
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,560
the slowest shared resonance in a system

359
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,959
but many of the same issues applies with

360
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,180
as with the algorithmic

361
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,779
um but again if experimented it it may

362
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,220
be possible to create create one that

363
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,480
works there

364
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,180
uh quantum theories entanglement is what

365
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,620
binds it together at least in some of

366
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,200
them so what you know what causes two

367
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,360
experiences a blue cut and the shape of

368
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,800
the cup to be bound together into one

369
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,540
well it's that the blueness and the

370
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,100
cutness I'm obviously talking at a very

371
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,839
high level of abstraction but those are

372
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,279
somehow Quantum entangled with each

373
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,740
other that would indeed create

374
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,120
to the best of our physics knowledge

375
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,339
today a kind of ontologically real

376
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,660
binding and that's that's quite an

377
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,360
attractive part of the solution

378
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,579
well what would stop those boundaries

379
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,440
there is the monogamy principle things

380
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,480
can only be maximally entangled up to a

381
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,440
certain point

382
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,120
but there's a very very open question

383
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,740
about whether that sort of thing would

384
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,779
would enable the kind of macro

385
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,120
phenomenology we have but in the paper

386
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,639
we say all of these are worth exploring

387
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,120
like let's let's keep investigating

388
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,920
and then there's the one I I started

389
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,899
with an instruction like maybe it's the

390
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,459
boundary of the central nervous system

391
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,380
but hopefully even a small amount of

392
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,600
scrutiny causes that one to uh to

393
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,899
collapse

394
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,079
and most of these explicitly say that

395
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,120
more work is needed more maths is needed

396
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,620
and certainly that will be true of what

397
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,600
we're presenting here as well

398
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,459
what we want to do is add a new one to

399
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,620
this list

400
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,519
and

401
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,560
the

402
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,199
the inspiration for this is that well if

403
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,660
the EM field accounts presents a

404
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,399
solution to The Binding problem they

405
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,899
certainly believe they do there's lots

406
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,519
of literature on it

407
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,880
then maybe they can also provide a

408
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,320
solution to the boundary problem given

409
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,720
how closely related they are

410
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,180
when you read those accounts

411
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,399
they don't quite have it nailed yet the

412
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,320
most common explanation they give is a

413
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,720
kind of inverse Square law rule where

414
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,060
well the strength of the field just

415
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,800
becomes so small so quickly you know by

416
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,839
the time you're a centimeter out from

417
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,160
the thalamus or by the time you're at

418
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,320
the edges of the skull these fields have

419
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,560
just evaporated into they did cohered

420
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,880
they're indistinguishable from the

421
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,420
neural noise all around us

422
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,760
that might be okay if you're okay with a

423
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,199
fuzzy boundary and we'll come on to that

424
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,300
in a sec I always motivate a phase

425
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,620
transition a bit like quantum

426
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,540
entanglement or a bit like the exact

427
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,820
Resonance of resonance theories

428
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,620
but those phase transitions are pretty

429
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,320
speculative as well

430
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,519
so

431
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,279
the solution where we will come to an

432
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,279
unusual outline is a different aspect of

433
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,079
VM Fields it's not fuzzy boundaries and

434
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,880
it's not a vague phase transition it's

435
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,680
an entirely different topological

436
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,560
solution which we argue can solve the

437
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,779
problems

438
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,120
what we think is worth doing though is

439
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,620
to make that boundary problem more

440
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,820
explicit

441
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,620
what you've heard both from Schrodinger

442
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,660
and from Rosenberg is this idea of and

443
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,060
like why aren't the cells inside you

444
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,459
conscious or if they are conscious why

445
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,380
don't we ever experience that and what

446
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,420
again going up what about cities and

447
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,820
families and things all group charts or

448
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,240
football stadiums that sort of stuff

449
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,100
oh and there is a there is a scholar who

450
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,980
argues based on resonance theory that

451
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,600
actually when we are in a group chanting

452
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,759
or a group dancing situation our

453
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,680
Consciousness does in fact move to that

454
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,480
level as well and that's it's

455
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,920
speculative but you know there are

456
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,259
there's much to be thought about

457
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,740
so to make this problem more precise

458
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,480
we've got five and I'll just give you

459
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,439
the the one or two sentences on each

460
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,419
the hard boundary problem

461
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,520
is

462
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,459
this sense that a fuzzy boundary

463
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,079
probably isn't good enough and that's

464
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,959
it's kind of explain a bit more why if

465
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,119
you have something like a wave or the

466
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,500
example of the wheel I gave before

467
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,359
touching the ground or indeed any

468
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,119
connection between any physical atoms

469
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,220
the closer you look to it the less

470
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,160
obvious it is where it stops

471
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,440
the boundaries of my skull may feel very

472
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,500
precise to me but if there were an alien

473
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,200
the size of a solar system their ability

474
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,940
to perceive this would most likely just

475
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,100
blurs imperceptibly into its

476
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,679
surroundings like these things feel hard

477
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,020
but they're not really hard

478
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,760
um

479
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,940
at the edges of our awareness there's

480
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,919
this sense that things like might feel

481
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,480
fuzzy but at some point

482
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,940
it just sort of stops might feel like it

483
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,980
might feel Infamous there are states of

484
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,539
mind where we can we can feel an

485
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,940
infinite awareness but probably bring

486
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,340
that further it doesn't truly Encompass

487
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,500
everything and go on forever

488
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,720
at this Edge our assertion is that

489
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
sometimes this feels like a hard

490
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,900
boundary

491
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,059
and if it ever sometimes feels like a

492
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,500
hard boundary then you need some

493
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,380
mechanism that is capable of a hard Edge

494
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,179
in a way that these physical phenomena

495
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,740
typically ask

496
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,480
so that's the heart boundary definitely

497
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,400
happy to like drill into more of any of

498
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
this or any of the other five if they're

499
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,760
not making enough sense

500
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,400
in the Q a so lower levels we covered

501
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,260
that that's

502
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,919
I mean the the great example of this is

503
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,440
um we know that when we go to sleep some

504
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,760
part of our Consciousness at least a bit

505
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,860
that we remember switches off yet the

506
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,080
brain remains active the lower levels

507
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,760
boundary problem could be reinterpreted

508
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,280
as saying why isn't why doesn't our

509
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,679
awareness just shift to another part of

510
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,539
the brain at that point it certainly

511
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,120
doesn't seem to most of the time

512
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,580
higher level boundary problem

513
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,020
we've had that from the beginning that's

514
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,400
why doesn't it go up maybe it does

515
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,580
sometimes certainly doesn't normally

516
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,679
the private boundary problem so this is

517
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,120
now rather than going down into

518
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,299
ourselves or up into the universe in

519
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,400
which we are nested this is more take

520
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,760
two of those boundaries

521
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,000
me and you me and one other person

522
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,520
why can we not Bridge into each other's

523
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,380
minds at least not routinely those who

524
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,000
claim to do so have struggled to

525
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,320
replicate it and get it into the

526
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,340
mainstream

527
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,919
so this is privacy there appears to be

528
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,320
some limitation that stops

529
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,120
these mechanisms from connecting with

530
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,700
each other and yet if it is slower

531
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,860
shared resonance or if it is highest

532
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,980
informational Phi in IIT why is it not

533
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,500
possible to construct a system in which

534
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,960
the highest fires now interconnected one

535
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,120
and our Consciousness is collapsed maybe

536
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,440
it is possible and that's just a

537
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,760
technical Endeavor we haven't yet

538
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,039
achieved by the way there's something

539
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,919
that's challenging about it either as a

540
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,480
technical barrier or as a philosophical

541
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,200
one

542
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,179
the last one is the temporal boundary

543
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,980
problem because everything we've said so

544
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,880
far

545
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,559
is in space

546
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,140
but the kind of entities and experiences

547
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,039
we're talking about are not zero zero

548
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,100
time space-based activities they have

549
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,340
they have a temporal persistence so what

550
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,360
is it that puts boundaries around a

551
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,880
micro moment of experience what is it

552
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,640
that enables us to experience the end of

553
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,380
a note and still retain that idea of the

554
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,179
start of the notes and experience them

555
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,419
together

556
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,440
and how does this extend through through

557
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,260
border experiences of the self so those

558
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,260
are the five puzzles

559
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,240
hopefully that's enough of a qualitative

560
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,100
overview so that you know what we're

561
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,960
trying to solve at least

562
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,820
and if I hand back over to Andrews now

563
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,039
he will give you an entirely new

564
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,100
solution to these puzzles

565
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,600
yes

566
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,400
uh next slide they're going a little bit

567
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,840
uh yeah kind of like a little bit

568
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,059
broader too in that uh what the Queen's

569
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,020
first talked about is kind of the

570
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,780
criteria for the boundary problem kind

571
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,860
of like breaking down the boundary

572
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,900
problem into subcomponents and then

573
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,820
there's like also like more broadly like

574
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,860
things that you would want out of a

575
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,780
theory of Consciousness and so like the

576
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,760
solution to the boundary problem ideally

577
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,919
will also in a sense like satisfy these

578
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,460
constraints uh and these constraints are

579
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,320
framing variants not only phenomenalism

580
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,039
and no strong emergencies next slide

581
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,640
so framing variants essentially can be a

582
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,580
recap Lawrence invariance uh the fact

583
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,480
that like

584
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,820
whatever structure is giving rise to the

585
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,299
boundary shouldn't in a way be frame

586
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,159
specific shouldn't just depend on like

587
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,480
how you're looking at an object it

588
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,000
should be kind of like an intrinsic

589
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,500
objective property of the object that if

590
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,299
you move it around it it should in

591
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,280
principle you know be changing in that

592
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,120
way next slide

593
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,340
for those who are not familiar with the

594
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,500
term this is the idea that for a

595
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,840
particular conscious physical system the

596
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,460
corresponds and experience but that

597
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,799
there's no causal influence from that

598
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,539
conscious experience back into the

599
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,380
system

600
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,940
and there's like various ways of kind of

601
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,820
uh trying to ground the question of hey

602
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,120
why why is epiphenomenalism not the case

603
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,039
um there's kind of again differences in

604
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,320
emphasis by each of these questions but

605
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,520
they're roughly pointing in the same

606
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,900
direction like one one important

607
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,059
question is how is it possible that we

608
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,100
can talk in detail about our experience

609
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,320
but the the way we actually framed it in

610
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,520
the paper that we find the most

611
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
compelling is

612
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,480
how was Evolution able to recruit you

613
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,600
know coherent globally bound

614
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,919
States if they're not causally

615
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,360
significant right like if they're not

616
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,919
causally useful it would just be an

617
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,720
extraordinary coincidence that it just

618
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,659
happens to to happen simultaneously

619
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,220
along with something that seems to be

620
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,559
computationally significant and you know

621
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,539
Encompass a whole lot of information at

622
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,860
the same time uh next slide

623
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,960
uh and then we also have no strong

624
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,240
emergence uh there's these yeah quote

625
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,179
from David that says the lagrangian or

626
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,740
the standard of the standard model does

627
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,900
not break down inside one's own skull

628
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,600
meaning we want the laws of physics to

629
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,159
apply universally to whatever

630
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,740
explanation space we come up with that

631
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,539
we don't want to introduce the special

632
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,520
cases or say like oh there's like a

633
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,799
special different field in the brain or

634
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,039
anything of the sort we want to have a

635
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,559
homogeneous

636
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,780
set of physics that

637
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,820
you know as simple as it gets as

638
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,799
mainstream As It Gets In terms of uh

639
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,200
appealing to the standard physics uh

640
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,059
next slide

641
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,820
uh so yeah the overarching solution and

642
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,740
explanation space that

643
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,659
the thing is electromagnetic field

644
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,880
topology so first of all I will walk you

645
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,580
through in what way these explanation

646
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,159
space satisfies the kind of like three

647
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,900
constraints that I provided and then

648
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,700
increase is going to explain how it

649
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,679
addresses each of the sub problems so

650
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,900
next slide

651
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,419
so yeah uh next one

652
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,740
yeah if you actually kind of look at

653
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,799
this uh amazing reconstructions of the

654
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,900
electromagnetic field of Stellar bodies

655
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,900
you would see that nothing trivial about

656
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,220
it right it's like all of this

657
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,440
incredible complexity and richness uh in

658
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,659
structure uh a lot of it is very

659
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,100
counterintuitive you know not something

660
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,600
that you would see with a naked eye you

661
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,240
see kind of this you require

662
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
um superimposing a lot of pictures from

663
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,140
the different regions of the spectrum to

664
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,760
kind of like get a picture of what's

665
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,260
going on in the electromagnetic field

666
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,600
and yeah it has kind of this

667
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,900
elongated weird plasma tubes and you

668
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,640
know circular structures and loops and

669
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,100
and so on uh this is a you know very

670
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,220
structurally rich environment uh next

671
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,780
slide

672
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,559
and you know the way in which you know

673
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,780
something like the topology of that

674
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,000
field will satisfy the criteria that

675
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,460
weight line is as follows so

676
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,679
if you look at the electromagnetic field

677
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,539
of the sun sometimes this phenomena

678
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:10,740
called magnetic reconnection happens and

679
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,500
this is actually responsible for solar

680
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,780
flares and kernel Mass ejections it has

681
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,539
to do with when plasma tubes that are

682
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:19,400
the

683
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,980
electromagnetic confinement structures

684
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,020
uh touch with each other and so they can

685
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,539
you know open up and spray plasma into

686
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,880
the the outer space

687
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,640
um the key thing to point uh about here

688
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,740
is that this is actually a topological

689
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,740
change to the field is it's not just any

690
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,419
kind of physical change you know when

691
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,580
you have a you know solar flare kernel

692
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,179
mass ejection that is the effect of a

693
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,539
top macroscopic gigantic topological

694
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:51,059
transformation what this slide is trying

695
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,940
to get at is that whether a system

696
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,299
experienced magnetic reconnection or not

697
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,799
will not depend on your frame of

698
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,020
reference and the very simple reason is

699
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,080
that lower ends transforms simply

700
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,779
squeeze and stretch but they never

701
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:11,340
actually you know reconnect or cut or um

702
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,140
you know add any kind of like

703
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,360
topological changes in other words a

704
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,279
Lawrence transform will leave a

705
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,760
topological event untouched so in that

706
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,559
sense okay like topology as an

707
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,980
explanation space for why

708
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,600
um why this is framing variant it

709
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,340
definitely fits the bill next slide

710
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,919
I importantly too yeah in the brain you

711
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,740
know this um we also can tackle the

712
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,539
question of like in what way the field

713
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,840
is not Epi phenomenal uh there's a lot

714
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,299
of research on local field Potentials in

715
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,600
the which are yeah little microscopic

716
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,580
electric oscillations

717
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,400
um and they do seem to actually have uh

718
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
causal effects on the activity of

719
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,720
neurons in other words uh

720
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,760
people might believe in a sense that hey

721
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,080
brain waves are kind of just a

722
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,720
reflection of neural activity but the

723
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,279
thing that something like transcranial

724
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,520
magnetic stimulation makes clear is that

725
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,620
on top of that they actually feed back

726
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,900
into the probability for neurons to fire

727
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,659
especially the probability for nearest

728
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,760
to fire in synchrony or in a in a state

729
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,400
of coherence in other words the actual

730
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,740
causal structure of electromagnetic

731
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,419
field and how it connects to neural

732
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:28,620
activity is this uh dual causal Arrow

733
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,539
where neural activity influences local

734
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,460
field potentials neural activity

735
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,679
influences activity via synapse

736
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,480
yeah we've been the victim of the

737
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,100
connection again let's hope it comes

738
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,020
back as quickly as as I did last time

739
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,220
hmm

740
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,500
yep

741
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,299
there's a lot to say but I won't

742
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,460
hopefully you've got some some hard

743
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,140
questions written down as we've been

744
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,419
we've been taking you through it

745
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,100
yeah just enough people who are

746
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,440
listening in the discussion

747
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,260
we'll uh look at some questions so

748
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,580
please feel free to write anything

749
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,419
personally I'm I'm curious whether the

750
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,960
awareness is gonna be the the light of

751
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,720
the Sun the heat of the Sun

752
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,059
the ejection

753
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,419
the loop structure the birth and death

754
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,140
of the star

755
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
yeah yeah I mean if that's

756
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,960
if the idea that you'll you'll see here

757
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
stands then you've got the idea that a

758
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,100
a closed topological pocket of

759
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,600
electromagnetic appeal that's that's

760
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,520
where awareness can take place that's

761
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,559
where a first person perspective that

762
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,419
kind of a lockers can exist but what

763
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,700
it's aware of well that's an entirely

764
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,039
different question and if there are

765
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,440
Pockets like that I mean we're not

766
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,820
asserting in this paper that the song

767
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,559
has these it's such a complex entity

768
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,600
it's very possible but that's you know

769
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,679
that is a different

770
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,960
but if to the extent they are there what

771
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,760
on Earth would be experienced within it

772
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,140
that's a

773
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,299
that's a different thing

774
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,159
the content

775
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:24,659
problem

776
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,880
it's not just for YouTubers

777
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,360
it's also for conscious systems

778
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,960
but yeah you've bound it all together

779
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,059
you've delimited a boundary

780
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,640
topologically

781
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,320
and then about what and so what

782
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,020
yeah yeah

783
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,419
it's me let me pick up a bit while we're

784
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,500
while we're waiting for him to comment

785
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,520
so

786
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,760
yeah this is and there's

787
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,679
really growing

788
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,480
kind of Neuroscience and biological

789
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,880
evidence for downward causation from

790
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,919
electromagnetic fields in the brain and

791
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,720
all we really do in this paper is

792
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,460
acknowledge that research literature

793
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,080
exists and say and therefore it's

794
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,760
possible for fields to be non-epi

795
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,260
phenomenal we don't get into the

796
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,880
specifics of it but they've been shown

797
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,679
in memory formation they've been shown

798
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,840
in the olfactory bulb your smells

799
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,880
they've appeared all over the place so

800
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,460
there's a ah Andres you're back yeah

801
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,419
just

802
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,179
making the case for non-effy phenomenal

803
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:27,539
feels fantastic really full yeah sorry

804
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,159
about that hopefully it doesn't happen

805
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,020
again okay next slide

806
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,340
yeah and uh

807
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,980
I mean think about like the immense

808
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,080
causal power that a topological change

809
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,140
in the field has in cosmological terms

810
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,120
you know like this

811
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,940
billions of tons of plasma being ejected

812
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,299
just because of you know otherwise like

813
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,159
maybe phenomenal magnetic reconnection

814
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:54,659
is like no no actually you know

815
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,539
topological Transformations are like

816
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:59,279
really really significant at a massive

817
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,080
massive scale uh next slide

818
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,460
yeah uh next one yeah just starting kind

819
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,360
of

820
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,840
how ridiculously powerful this can be

821
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,779
yeah and uh importantly too

822
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,299
um the actual fact

823
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,520
if you get an enclosure with a

824
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,820
topological transformation in a medium

825
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,080
also gives you this capacity to

826
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,960
essentially have holistic Behavior Uh

827
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,520
this is one of the things that to me was

828
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,840
kind of the most exciting about this

829
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,419
explanation space and like the moment

830
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,120
you can close field lines or you know do

831
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,140
a top formation waves will be confined

832
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,299
some kinds of waves can be confined

833
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,880
within a topological pocket when you

834
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,059
have confinement of waves then you have

835
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,740
resonant modes and when you have

836
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,559
resonant modes then you have these very

837
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,799
fantastic effect where the whole shape

838
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,220
of an object essentially is expressed in

839
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,140
the way every part of the object is

840
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,120
vibrating

841
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,059
in in which case yeah essentially you

842
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,000
have this reason why Evolution would

843
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,460
recruit you know these topological

844
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,860
objects is because it actually allows

845
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,860
organisms to behave as a unit so I think

846
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,899
yeah that might be a very key like piece

847
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:20,700
of the puzzle for for a phenomenalism

848
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,520
next to the slide uh these are just like

849
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,940
yeah kind of like some sketches of some

850
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,740
of the kinds of boundaries that in

851
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,600
principle you may have in the

852
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,820
electromagnetic field and what kind of

853
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,039
uh you know binding in Consciousness

854
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,200
they might correspond to

855
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,880
um but you know you don't have to you

856
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,200
know just speculate to the really

857
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,059
exciting thing here is that you can

858
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:44,039
actually play with simulations of the

859
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,779
electromagnetic field to try to make

860
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,820
sense of the topological Transformations

861
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,159
that happen in it uh so the next

862
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,559
following slides uh we can just go

863
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,000
through them fairly quickly

864
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,640
are essentially resonant modes of an

865
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,919
empty cavity electromagnetic resonance

866
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,039
modes of an empty Cube cavity where the

867
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,440
left side is the electric field and the

868
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,620
right side is the magnetic field

869
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,340
um

870
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,960
there are websites where you can check

871
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,700
this is uh called filestat.com embox

872
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,500
and the thing that it kind of like

873
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,440
really neatly shows is how the magnetic

874
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,840
field sometimes get this uh close

875
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,360
looping structure uh next slide yeah

876
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,860
just go through through them maybe like

877
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,740
five seconds for each of them

878
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,039
um and uh it also allows you to

879
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,500
essentially look at what happens when

880
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,539
you stack some of these resonant modes

881
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,360
and some combinations linear

882
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,799
combinations of these resonant modes

883
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,100
create intricate adding adding

884
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,640
uh headings and looks and twists that

885
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,100
loop around and create this topological

886
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,620
boundary very fleeting it has to do with

887
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,480
like the you know the frequency of

888
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,799
oscillation of the electric field you

889
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,059
know how many times per second you're

890
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,100
going to get this looping structure but

891
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,539
the fact that yeah you can show there's

892
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,940
some topologically closed objects uh

893
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,059
that appear there is quite remarkable

894
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:08,099
and overall the idea here would be that

895
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,320
well something like this is happening in

896
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,580
the brain and the brain is actually

897
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,800
recruiting this looping architectures

898
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,480
all right I'll hand it over to Chris

899
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,219
oh thank you very much yeah so we've

900
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,099
seen that electromagnetic fields can

901
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,500
form closed loops and people have used

902
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,760
that some of the sites in the paper

903
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,820
around people trapping knots of light

904
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,099
and it just kind of really remarkable

905
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,320
things happening at the edge of

906
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,040
um

907
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,899
sort of room temperature State physics

908
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,719
really incredible stuff

909
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,820
we know that in principle these fields

910
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,639
are capable of downward causation

911
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,379
um in massive context like the Sun but

912
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,119
also in very real human brain settings

913
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,219
so conceptually and we know that

914
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,899
topologies in general are frame and

915
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,060
variants so we've got we've got those

916
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,619
things in place we've got boundaries

917
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,180
that satisfy those those various

918
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,099
features that we wanted we don't know

919
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,480
exactly how they occur in the human

920
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,280
brain all we're presenting is a

921
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,080
conceptual solution that those things

922
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,460
are possible

923
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,500
but what we do say is well what would

924
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,540
what would such a solution look like to

925
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,020
those five uh boundary uh problems that

926
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,060
we just described

927
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,880
so taking them one by one

928
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,859
um or rather yeah taking them as a as a

929
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,020
group let's first say what

930
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,119
in such a theory

931
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,040
the first person perspective that kind

932
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,099
of phenomenal awareness the what it's

933
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,740
likeness that we experience in a very

934
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,520
normal

935
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,859
um everyday sense what could that

936
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:38,220
reflect what could that correspond to in

937
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,660
such a model and there are others but

938
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,160
we'll give one example and use that to

939
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,599
walk through the problems

940
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,339
so we would say that

941
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:47,760
once you've got a closed topology and it

942
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,920
may well require the time dimension for

943
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,960
it to be properly ontologically closed

944
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,880
and at that point

945
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,240
em energy of that specific Spectrum same

946
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,920
Spectra that's making up the boundary

947
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,020
can't pass through it well that's that's

948
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,640
the whole point about the closed loop

949
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,560
other things might pass through it the

950
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,420
sound wave might pass through it but

951
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,460
nonetheless for the entities that we're

952
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,339
interested in it is closed to itself and

953
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:12,480
that's where we get that's where we can

954
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,339
get this hard boundary

955
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,079
there may be lots of these being created

956
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,400
in the brain the brain is absolutely

957
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,320
chock-a-block with different bits of em

958
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,060
generating

959
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,780
um

960
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,060
underlying phenomena

961
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,040
so it's certainly plausible that some of

962
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,440
them are closed we don't know for this

963
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,700
to be true there must be at least one

964
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,380
but it's plausible that if there's one

965
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,359
there's probably several so you've got

966
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,280
several of these

967
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,500
by definition they are non-overlapping

968
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,680
they the boundaries cannot overlap but

969
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,060
they could well be multiple at the same

970
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,320
time one at the front run at the back

971
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,420
could be all over the place

972
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,640
it's probable though that only a subset

973
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,560
would be continually recreated in a

974
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,079
stable manner because the fact that

975
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,760
these brain these fields can have

976
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,320
downward causation they can do useful

977
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,440
things some of the sites in the paper

978
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,480
about information processing point to

979
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,339
some of the non-linearities you can

980
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,560
achieve through wave and field-based

981
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,320
resonant mode based

982
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,060
computations which may well have

983
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,980
benefits from from an information

984
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,260
process in perspective so in some cases

985
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,260
these will be continually recreated

986
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,599
only one of them because they cannot

987
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,000
overlap only one of them

988
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,880
can enclose let's call it an immediate

989
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,160
memory model as a conceptual Point not

990
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,079
not committing to what exactly that

991
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,140
might mean uh

992
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,119
we suspect these wouldn't last very long

993
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,400
and they probably don't extend over the

994
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,460
whole grain but who knows regardless it

995
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,740
would vary from period to period other

996
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,300
field theories might have other ways of

997
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,359
recruiting this concept for solving the

998
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,859
boundary problem but let's walk this one

999
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:48,780
through and see what it looks like as a

1000
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,520
response to those five things so what

1001
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,560
we're saying is

1002
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,900
this closed topological pocket that is

1003
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,000
kind of axiomatically the same as a

1004
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,680
first person awareness when you've got

1005
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,260
that you've got something that is a is

1006
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,780
capable of both Binding Together those

1007
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,940
micro bits of experience and presenting

1008
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,740
them within a boundary so they have some

1009
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,220
unified ontology

1010
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,720
so

1011
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,760
one by one and I think this is our last

1012
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,020
slide

1013
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,880
the hard boundary well that comes from

1014
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,500
what we've been talking about energy of

1015
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,180
the same Spectra can't pass through that

1016
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,160
the closed loop so that that happens

1017
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,440
quite naturally a bit like with the

1018
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,660
field solution to binding this is

1019
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,640
something you almost get for free as a

1020
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,619
result of using that

1021
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:35,400
low levels and higher levels

1022
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,680
well it because only one of them because

1023
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,000
of the non-overlapping point because

1024
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,560
only one of them can include the

1025
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,480
immediate memory model which is crucial

1026
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,400
for the next bits

1027
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,000
um

1028
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,380
then you can't have lower levels and

1029
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,480
higher levels there may well be mined

1030
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,280
dust at those levels which is this kind

1031
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,960
of lovely evocative concept maybe there

1032
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,099
may well be

1033
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,380
flashes of tiny bits of awareness that's

1034
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,280
kind of

1035
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,320
they never repeat the patterns just gone

1036
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,880
through there's nothing that links it

1037
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,460
into future versions of itself

1038
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,740
um just gone the universe may be replete

1039
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,060
with these things it's certainly got

1040
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,920
plenty of electrons in it why not plenty

1041
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,540
of these things who knows

1042
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,800
um

1043
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,440
but there's only one closed pocket

1044
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,320
that maybe I'll come back to four that

1045
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,020
can enclose this immediate memory module

1046
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,060
and that's crucial because it's what

1047
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,760
creates a temporal boundary that in any

1048
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,680
possible sense could reflect what we

1049
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,520
experience day-to-day because these tiny

1050
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,460
if you if you think of the

1051
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,520
these 4D Pockets if if one pocket were

1052
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,440
to last long enough to Encompass say a

1053
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,760
whole day's worth of your experience

1054
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,000
it's almost impossible but it's a very

1055
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,820
enough without breaking

1056
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,619
to actually contain all the types of

1057
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,079
complex phenomena we experienced during

1058
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,760
the day which is why we think it's much

1059
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,140
more likely they persist for a short

1060
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,940
period of time but nonetheless our

1061
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,440
experiences or things persisting for

1062
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,940
longer

1063
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,280
now the micro level persistence why is

1064
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,720
it non-zero because if something is

1065
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,280
infinitesimally small

1066
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,780
it probably doesn't help us if something

1067
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,339
is the equivalent of a geometric point

1068
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,260
no matter how many of them you put

1069
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,180
together in a physical setting you're

1070
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,040
not going to create a line we want some

1071
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,839
non-zero duration well we've got that

1072
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,119
for free because the closed Pockets has

1073
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,680
this for the ontological presence that's

1074
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,460
fine

1075
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,740
how would you get but it's but it may be

1076
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,839
really really short far shorter than we

1077
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,240
experience even this sentence

1078
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,280
so what ties that together well because

1079
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,780
it encloses

1080
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,940
each millisecond to millisecond it

1081
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,140
recreates

1082
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,640
each one is a different piece of

1083
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,060
awareness they are not in any way

1084
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,079
ontologically linked to each other they

1085
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,359
are each separate but because each one

1086
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,400
encloses the memory module which is just

1087
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,839
an information processing thing you can

1088
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,760
encode memory and pen and paper there's

1089
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,500
nothing magical about this by

1090
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,900
referencing it it knows what was just

1091
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,079
there before and that can create you can

1092
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,880
it may we could call it an illusion if

1093
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,560
you want whether that matters is a much

1094
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,180
more philosophical point but you create

1095
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,040
this pseudo-time Arrow you have unified

1096
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,020
insights because that's what Fields do

1097
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,180
they unify the insights in all the

1098
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,440
things that make it up

1099
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,380
no information is lost it is all bound

1100
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,760
together

1101
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,740
so now you've got the recent pasts and

1102
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,940
then you've got the bit before that from

1103
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,020
the previous pocket and a bit before

1104
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,000
that and a bit before that so it's all

1105
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,480
bound into each each individual presence

1106
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,880
as short as it may be it has the sense

1107
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,619
that it's something bigger

1108
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,780
now in terms of the macro level days

1109
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,940
years between interruptions

1110
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,560
this is one where

1111
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,420
where we're far more philosophically

1112
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,700
relaxed it it may well be that there is

1113
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,180
there is no kind of profound sense in

1114
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,619
which these things are the same entity

1115
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,900
it's maybe a ship of Theseus type type

1116
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,300
concept and it's all linked together by

1117
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,040
some fairly weak long-term memory and

1118
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,079
are we really the same person as we were

1119
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,960
a week ago a year ago we're far less

1120
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,339
philosophically concerned about that

1121
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,260
than we are by the micro level in the

1122
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,240
meter level but either way the solutions

1123
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,760
are the classic personal identity

1124
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,579
Solutions which have been gone over

1125
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:03,599
plenty of times

1126
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,700
if if you'll give us another five

1127
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,619
minutes before questions we'd love to

1128
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:08,880
share some more kind of speculative

1129
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,500
Thoughts with you

1130
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,760
um that's yeah getting a thumbs up

1131
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,400
wonderful in which case over to Andreas

1132
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,260
for some for some fun thought poking

1133
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,920
stuff well yeah awesome awesome yeah I

1134
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,599
mean it's just kind of like this uh yeah

1135
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,839
deeper question and uh don't wait for me

1136
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:27,240
if my internet yeah runs out for a

1137
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,740
second but uh yeah I mean essentially

1138
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,440
how how does this influence for example

1139
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,380
yeah relief of personal identity uh next

1140
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,099
slide I think uh once you start seeing

1141
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,619
the universe as a field and with maybe

1142
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:42,540
like fleeting topological pockets on it

1143
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,579
that actually varies significantly

1144
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:47,400
informs these classic questions in

1145
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,160
philosophy like who are you and do you

1146
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,720
continue to exist from one moment to the

1147
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,640
other and India the ship of the seers

1148
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,140
like is there any kind of like

1149
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,680
metaphysical enduring ego so to speak

1150
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,319
and I actually think that each of these

1151
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,240
um views of personal identity could

1152
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,460
actually be

1153
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,920
reinterpreted in terms of claims about

1154
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,859
the field and field topology so

1155
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:13,079
something like closed individualism this

1156
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,400
is the belief that you start existing

1157
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,839
when you're born stop existing when you

1158
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,520
die or you know maybe you go to heaven

1159
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,200
but the point is that you're

1160
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,480
kind of a separate self that endures

1161
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,980
over time that is different than other

1162
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,180
selves

1163
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,260
here we would want to find some kind of

1164
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,920
uh enduring sheath or enduring nested

1165
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,380
architecture that even though maybe each

1166
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,300
moment of awareness might be its own

1167
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,160
topological pocket maybe there's some

1168
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,339
kind of higher order topological Unity

1169
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:43,859
that does carry over a person's lifetime

1170
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:46,440
you know that would be a possible way of

1171
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,839
refining in a actual you know

1172
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:51,300
significant physical way the sense of

1173
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,640
identity over time of course completely

1174
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,319
speculative would be a matter of

1175
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:56,700
actually finding it in the fields but

1176
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,440
that's how you could I think still men

1177
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,440
this notion uh next slide

1178
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,319
then uh probably the most compatible and

1179
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,420
easy to justify view here would be empty

1180
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,760
individualism that every moment of

1181
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,460
experience is ontologically different

1182
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,960
and again here that would be possible

1183
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,599
because we would have these leading hard

1184
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,880
boundaries in the space-time Continuum

1185
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,640
and as a consequence you can yeah look

1186
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,680
at the Block universe and say okay

1187
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,540
there's a 40 pocket there there's a 40

1188
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,640
pocket over there and wherever you see a

1189
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,740
40 pocket that is going to be a subject

1190
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,500
of experience and you know any actual

1191
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,960
continuity between uh moments of

1192
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,220
experience are

1193
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,099
either just causal or kind of illusory

1194
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,079
constructed with the memory module as

1195
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,980
Chris was suggesting and then next slide

1196
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,200
and then finally open individualism

1197
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,060
there's this view that we are all one

1198
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,940
Consciousness we're all Krishna at the

1199
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,160
bottom bottom layers so to speak well

1200
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,440
the way we could justify this within the

1201
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,359
topological account is that well

1202
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,200
actually

1203
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,300
and at the deepest anthological level

1204
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,940
we're all the field which has happened

1205
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,060
to be on a given point in time a

1206
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,700
segmentation of that field that prevents

1207
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,500
the information propagation with other

1208
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,200
regions of the field so in this case

1209
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,960
kind of the the topological segmentation

1210
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,720
would actually be more of a

1211
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,040
epistemological boundary then it would

1212
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,780
actually be an ontological boundary it's

1213
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,040
like the idea that like deep down

1214
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,500
actually we are the field it's just that

1215
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,720
how the field knows itself is

1216
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,060
constrained by its topology in in which

1217
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,680
case yeah it's another way of Steel

1218
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,800
Manning we're all one Consciousness in a

1219
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,900
very physically grounded way and yeah I

1220
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,579
think I think that's it unless I put

1221
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,260
anything else in the next slide oh yeah

1222
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,819
yeah just the last kind of like

1223
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,400
speculation here is uh well okay if you

1224
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,339
are this topological pocket in the field

1225
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,980
uh electromagnetic field

1226
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,920
um how can you in a sense take a look at

1227
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,900
that pocket and then reconstruct what

1228
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,300
the experience feels like and here

1229
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,940
perhaps it's like a fun thought

1230
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,520
experiment that you could you could make

1231
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,800
is thinking about what it would be like

1232
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,660
to be an affordant trapped in a within a

1233
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,819
Hall of Mirrors uh there's this article

1234
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:15,720
uh I wrote yeah 2018 about how to

1235
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,020
replicate a hyperbolic space using just

1236
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,740
double mirrors and uh gradient index

1237
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,280
Optics uh and essentially within that

1238
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,560
structure that has those properties a

1239
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,480
photon would have no way of telling the

1240
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,640
fact that it is not in hyperbolic space

1241
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,200
in other words

1242
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,859
the index of refraction of a container

1243
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:39,839
would present itself as the actual

1244
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,900
geometry of the space from within so in

1245
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,599
our brain presumably like the actual the

1246
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,800
actual way in which the local field

1247
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,599
potentials are stitched together and the

1248
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,400
relative index of refraction

1249
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,380
could potentially give rise to really

1250
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,859
arbitrary possible internal geometrics

1251
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:57,240
where there's the illusion that you're

1252
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,280
in a space whether it's in hyperbolic

1253
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,020
space in spherical space on your regular

1254
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,599
geometry all of those could be emulated

1255
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,880
with these with these Paradigm and that

1256
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,220
may go a little bit uh a long way in

1257
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,300
actually explaining some of the most

1258
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,520
exotic experiences that people can have

1259
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,980
uh which usually would yeah challenge

1260
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,599
kind of theories of Consciousness here

1261
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,460
hear the story of us teaching them

1262
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,099
together to to explain them and I think

1263
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:22,680
yeah the last slide I believe

1264
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,720
yeah

1265
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,280
so this is yeah just illustrating that

1266
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,079
point I think I think this is it yeah

1267
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,220
yeah and we can leave this up on the

1268
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,420
screen this is just where we would go

1269
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,920
next with it but this seems like a good

1270
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,300
point to stop and

1271
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,200
hear your thoughts

1272
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,619
awesome great presentations

1273
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,800
well Bernie would you like to give a

1274
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,300
first reflection and I'll write down

1275
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,119
some questions and look in the live chat

1276
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,560
yeah sure

1277
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,280
um I've been thinking about about silver

1278
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,880
stuff like this recently and um

1279
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,200
um when it's I the paper presents how

1280
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,300
the functional theories have the problem

1281
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,839
of arbitraredness uh so for example with

1282
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,819
Market blanket that can Market blankets

1283
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:13,920
that could be the case uh when there's

1284
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,579
micro blankets ontological observers and

1285
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:20,940
I was thinking that maybe you need to

1286
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,980
find this with the micro blanket

1287
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,859
Paradigm is that

1288
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:27,960
that on the physical level is

1289
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,839
implemented as as using this topological

1290
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:33,480
bucket is is the conscious marker

1291
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,819
blicking so it's how you were referring

1292
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:37,740
the marking black and solves the content

1293
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,400
problem while the the topological

1294
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,980
boundary solves all the other problems

1295
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,500
like objects

1296
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,339
which is

1297
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,020
maybe at least

1298
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,160
yeah no that's something very quick to

1299
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,359
mention I mean obviously we're in the

1300
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:02,640
active inference Institute uh podcast I

1301
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,319
mean well absolutely one one thing to

1302
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,260
mention is that

1303
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,040
our perspective is not in itself

1304
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,540
necessary or is not necessarily

1305
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,079
sufficient actually to satisfy the you

1306
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,000
know that we have specified

1307
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
um however we actually think it's very

1308
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,400
very likely that topological pockets in

1309
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,920
the electromagnetic field do behave as

1310
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,980
marked with blankets and so it is in

1311
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,079
which you can actually interface these

1312
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,839
different paradigms where we would be

1313
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,839
saying that at the implementation level

1314
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,079
you know and then realize the

1315
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,359
immunization of free energy at the

1316
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,420
algorithmic level however we would be

1317
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,640
saying and maybe this would be a little

1318
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,319
bit of a Twist or a non-trivial

1319
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,560
implication that if you were to simulate

1320
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,440
a you know hierarchically structured

1321
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,260
Market blanket system in a computer it

1322
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,119
could very well be from a certain

1323
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:01,560
abstraction be minimizing free energy

1324
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,140
but it wouldn't have this it wouldn't be

1325
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,579
able to solve the boundary problem in

1326
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,619
other words it is sort of like there is

1327
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,319
a significant overlap but uh there are

1328
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,940
some slight places are very Divergence

1329
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,099
where you might say hey Marco blanket is

1330
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:15,420
actually not enough because it doesn't

1331
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,640
give you the implementation level

1332
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,540
explanation for how you get boundaries

1333
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,859
all right Chris if you want to add

1334
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:25,560
anything yeah yeah I mean just to just

1335
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,420
to agree with that I think this is the

1336
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,900
the if you go back to Mars three levels

1337
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,000
around kind of what

1338
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,599
substrate and

1339
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,240
we haven't discussed anything here about

1340
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,339
the algorithms that are actually taking

1341
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,260
place on

1342
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,880
or kind of within the brain that would

1343
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,520
ultimately get incorporated into the EMP

1344
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,319
Fields clearly you need that stuff as

1345
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,359
well none of this goes makes any

1346
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,160
contribution to solving these more

1347
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,200
content problems with Consciousness or

1348
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,660
how we make inferences about the world

1349
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,119
how we respond to those

1350
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:02,700
what it does say is that for

1351
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,619
if there are algorithms that solve those

1352
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:05,760
problems and there are some good

1353
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,000
candidates out there including yours

1354
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
they need to be

1355
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,220
implemented or they need to reflect back

1356
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,920
to a field for it to become part of

1357
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,599
someone's Unified

1358
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,480
macro phenomenological experience if you

1359
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,220
did a some sort of feed forward in

1360
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,220
silico version of this or you did it you

1361
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,160
implemented the algorithm using rocks

1362
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,079
just lots and lots of rocks laid out

1363
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:34,319
forever like that wonderful XKCD example

1364
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,579
that

1365
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:37,500
that is not going to create a bound

1366
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,599
first person perspective anywhere

1367
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,619
well a lot to say about that certainly

1368
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:49,200
Mark all blankets and just to Define it

1369
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,420
on a Bayesian graph so the map not the

1370
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,880
territory the Markov blanket is the set

1371
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,940
of nodes upon which two other sets of

1372
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,220
nodes are conditionally independent and

1373
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,040
that's a purely topological statement it

1374
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,559
doesn't matter how far if there even is

1375
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,540
a spatial Association or temporal

1376
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,420
Association it doesn't matter the

1377
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,099
distance which is to say the geometry

1378
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,839
but rather the blanket is a purely

1379
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:15,540
topological statement and that's what

1380
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,460
among other things we've been exploring

1381
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,680
with Chris fields in the physics is

1382
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,900
information processing and this question

1383
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,660
about the topology of communication for

1384
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,160
bounded Observers

1385
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,040
and as we kind of alluded to with that

1386
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,599
content problem

1387
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:34,380
the topology of communication is to use

1388
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,200
a geometric metaphor it's orthogonal to

1389
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,599
the the content you could have two

1390
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,160
people on the phone sharing different

1391
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,800
things you could have a video file with

1392
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,520
different contents and so there there's

1393
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,380
really a lot of layers that come into

1394
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,839
play and so I think from an

1395
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,940
instrumentalist View

1396
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,000
I read your paper as a call for the

1397
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,579
introduction of topology into what is

1398
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,980
often only modeled as geometric

1399
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,339
a call for the integration of

1400
00:53:04,339 --> 00:53:07,260
electromagnetism rather than a Reliance

1401
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,300
on one of the other of course as

1402
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,280
introduced from the outset of pluralism

1403
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,880
these are not exhaustive nor exclusive

1404
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,660
accounts and we don't know what the

1405
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,359
scope of the possible intelligences and

1406
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,420
awarenesses are so from a research

1407
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,180
perspective if not Beyond why would we

1408
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,119
want to limit when we're not only

1409
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,940
interested in understanding the

1410
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,059
properties of Any Given system as we see

1411
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:38,540
it today

1412
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:41,280
any thoughts or I can read a question in

1413
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,579
the chat

1414
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,640
yeah that sounds great

1415
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,579
TurnKey tyranny writes how does topology

1416
00:53:50,579 --> 00:53:54,540
show up phenomenologically

1417
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,300
yeah this is a excellent excellent

1418
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,119
question uh I'm happy to thank you to go

1419
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,099
back to your notes you know we've got

1420
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:08,359
that page of notes in there so Elizabeth

1421
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:10,800
because this this is because I I've

1422
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,480
asked a very similar question of Andreas

1423
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,700
and that these sort of notes is what

1424
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,800
resulted in in his attempts to explain

1425
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,800
it to me so let me tell you yes very I

1426
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,960
mean this is very speculative and uh but

1427
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,119
but

1428
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,040
one one wonderful resource I think I

1429
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,540
think hopefully I think is wonderful a

1430
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,440
very worth uh trying out is we made a

1431
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,980
um series of guided meditations about uh

1432
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,599
phenomenology they're not it's not

1433
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:37,500
really kind of like about secret

1434
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,940
spirituality it's more for the sake of

1435
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,619
exploring phenomenology uh with

1436
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,619
meditation the last one is called the

1437
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,079
phenomenology of ontology and that one

1438
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,500
helps you in a sense get a sense of

1439
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,059
I believe subordinary reality

1440
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:57,300
acts direct reality of course

1441
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,819
different to believe that new

1442
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:01,440
electromagnetic field or you're an

1443
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,220
electromagnetic but it feels like

1444
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:08,700
crystals or in a specific version of

1445
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,619
materialism or something like that so

1446
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:12,900
very different ontologies can give rise

1447
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,940
to very different feelings

1448
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,079
um and so there's definitely the worry

1449
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,760
that like well if you think a lot about

1450
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,440
the electromagnetic field aren't you

1451
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,540
maybe just interpreting your Sensations

1452
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,000
within that Paradigm but like it's kind

1453
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,700
of like you're overfeeding on top of it

1454
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,160
um but uh you know in a sense I would

1455
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,859
argue that actually it's the other way

1456
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:35,339
around with something as generative and

1457
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:37,140
structured as electromagnetic field you

1458
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,660
can think in principle explain the

1459
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,720
phenomenology of any ontology like why

1460
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,300
does it feel like for example that you

1461
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,900
um uh you can kind of like merge with

1462
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,700
the cosmos or something like that why

1463
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,900
does it feel like you can become one

1464
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,059
with everything in meditation let's say

1465
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,700
in various meditation States well with

1466
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,020
something like the topological

1467
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,140
explanation for uh the boundary problem

1468
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,140
the way we might interpret that is as

1469
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,660
the vanishing of internal boundaries and

1470
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,520
so there is a significant difference

1471
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,500
between a global boundary which is what

1472
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,579
we focused on the overall kind of the

1473
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:16,260
macroscopic division that says whether

1474
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,300
you're inside or outside your experience

1475
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,040
but something that the electromagnetic

1476
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,980
field also affords and gives us as kind

1477
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,839
of part of its Rich structure is the

1478
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,880
possibility of internal boundaries as

1479
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,240
well which would be not boundaries that

1480
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,160
encomp

1481
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,000
um that um wrap around a 4D object but

1482
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,160
rather lower dimensional boundaries like

1483
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,559
meeting points or convergence points of

1484
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,020
the field lines within the pocket and so

1485
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,240
in this account you know whenever you

1486
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,000
have like the sensation of solidity the

1487
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,800
feeling of well I am here you're there

1488
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,960
or there's a boundary between us

1489
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,300
that boundary would essentially be an

1490
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,280
internal boundary would be a region of

1491
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,740
the field well the field lines converge

1492
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,020
or they they align

1493
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,140
um but it's only along a certain

1494
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,300
cross-section meaning that you know

1495
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,520
actually your experience is still fully

1496
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,500
unified you can still go from one point

1497
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,740
to the other across a perceived barrier

1498
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,960
because they're still part of the the

1499
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,280
whole experience they're still connected

1500
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,319
in other words with this kind of data

1501
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:20,160
structure

1502
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,220
we can arrive at kind of like a lot of

1503
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,140
um phenomenological details and trying

1504
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,460
to explain them from from that

1505
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,140
perspective uh and I think it's going to

1506
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,660
be a enormous program in in the long

1507
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,940
term you know involving physicists and

1508
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,099
mathematicians and exotic States Of

1509
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:36,599
Consciousness to say like okay that

1510
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,339
particular feature of experience that

1511
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:40,980
happens on certain substance in such a

1512
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,720
such meditation state

1513
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,540
how does that uh map into the

1514
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,920
electromagnetic field and I think we

1515
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,119
will very likely find a lot of

1516
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:49,980
non-trivial connections with that that

1517
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,760
sort of paradigm

1518
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:58,079
press any thoughts on that

1519
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,559
uh just to make the link to this uh to

1520
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:03,240
some of the the diagrams on the page

1521
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,319
which is

1522
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,380
if you've got these

1523
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,180
non-4d closed boundaries but other types

1524
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,440
of boundaries the other types of shapes

1525
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,119
Andrews was talking about the drawings

1526
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,099
on the page are just examples of some of

1527
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:14,940
those

1528
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,760
but and and this is as Andrew said it's

1529
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,619
not really part of the solution but it's

1530
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:21,720
part of Imagine to be exploring where

1531
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,000
else it might go so if you've got you've

1532
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,099
got feature binding which is you know

1533
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:28,200
I'm seeing a cup in the cup is both blue

1534
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,760
and cup shaped

1535
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,200
that's feature binding and then the

1536
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,940
phenomenological binding is my whole

1537
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,160
experience being being unified you can

1538
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,500
imagine feature binding putting the

1539
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,420
blueness and the couplers together that

1540
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,680
might be something that happens along

1541
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,240
one of these types of internal

1542
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,339
boundaries it might not it might be that

1543
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:45,540
that can be done purely through

1544
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,000
informational associations where we're

1545
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,339
kind of agnostic on that but what's

1546
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:52,559
interesting about a 4D topology is

1547
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,819
within it you can have lots of other

1548
00:58:53,819 --> 00:58:56,700
complicated topologies provided they are

1549
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,680
not closed along the fourth dimension

1550
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,940
because then you've got you sort of

1551
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,760
created another little mini awareness oh

1552
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,740
Bernie go ahead yeah I'll jump back to

1553
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,440
the other page uh yeah I wanted to say

1554
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,299
something else uh not related to this

1555
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:12,119
exact question so if you have ended it

1556
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:14,099
maybe I'll yeah okay well in that case

1557
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:15,359
actually I'll mention one last thing

1558
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,420
about the how electromagnetic field may

1559
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,240
be related to phenomenology uh a very

1560
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,280
specific thing that happens on

1561
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,660
psychedelics and especially something

1562
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:27,799
like DMT is that you may end up having

1563
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:30,299
uh different regions of your experience

1564
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:33,359
have the exact same texture and have the

1565
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,880
feeling of synchronization between them

1566
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,160
and when that happens they sort of

1567
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,839
become the same object just like

1568
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,640
spatially distributed

1569
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,799
um the way I interpret this is whenever

1570
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:46,799
the exact same wave equation applies to

1571
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,200
two regions of your experience and waves

1572
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,700
can propagate from one region to the

1573
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,859
other that actually feels like they're

1574
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:55,079
the same object so one kind of like

1575
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:57,540
natural way in which yeah regions of

1576
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,520
your phenomenal world might be segmented

1577
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,240
out into phenomenal objects is by

1578
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,900
confining how waves can move within the

1579
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,880
world simulation and whenever you have a

1580
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,099
what feels like a bound object in your

1581
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:13,920
world simulation that I think is highly

1582
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,740
highly related to waves being able to

1583
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,480
smoothly travel within that object but

1584
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,520
not outside of that object some kind of

1585
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,980
wave confinement is happening

1586
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:26,040
I'll add in one more of course fun and

1587
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,740
speculative thought which is the

1588
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,400
aboutness the content of what this

1589
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,559
computation or what this process is

1590
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,140
unfolding the aboutness itself can be

1591
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:40,140
structure learning and so even for a

1592
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,260
fixed electromagnetic topology you can

1593
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,720
have variable informational topology

1594
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,599
case in point the Von Neumann computer

1595
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:51,900
the CPU architecture electromagnetically

1596
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,180
is not changing topologically we don't

1597
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,240
need to reroute the telephone

1598
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,500
connections for there to be different

1599
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,260
messages that spread and so there's a

1600
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,720
lot of richness in in the space you've

1601
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,720
you've sketched or surveyed because even

1602
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,599
for a fixed topology we might be able to

1603
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,640
do compositional

1604
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,099
um binding like blue and cup

1605
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:17,119
and then now we add in

1606
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,760
a dynamic multi-scale

1607
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,160
topological

1608
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,140
unfolding

1609
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,660
and then that may connect to different

1610
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,900
frequencies of for example measurements

1611
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,440
in the EEG which are really only picking

1612
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,099
up the synchrony in the outer shell

1613
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:40,020
which might actually play a role it's

1614
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:41,760
not like the skull matters you could

1615
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,680
have a skull removed it's not the scalp

1616
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,059
it's not your hair

1617
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:47,700
it's not necessarily the meningi but

1618
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,740
what is it well maybe it's something

1619
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:54,540
that's info topological that reflects

1620
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:57,420
kind of different regimes of attention

1621
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,240
that that actually does happen to

1622
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,480
correspond but it's also localized and

1623
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,540
that's that interplay with individuality

1624
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:10,079
and and Oneness that works like Wilbur's

1625
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,079
no boundary Point towards but then you

1626
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:14,460
got to come back from no boundary

1627
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:17,640
because that sentence has to end

1628
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,440
yeah

1629
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,299
Bernie

1630
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:24,299
yeah I wanted to mention that in

1631
01:02:24,299 --> 01:02:26,819
relation to the ongoing course on the

1632
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:29,520
physics and information processing that

1633
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:33,240
Chris Fields is is hosting is one one

1634
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,400
construct that Chris Phillips is using

1635
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,000
in in his papers with Michael and inspo

1636
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,020
is the is the notion of topological

1637
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,880
Quantum neural networks and topological

1638
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,220
Quantum field theories so it might be

1639
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:52,040
that those are the the the the the

1640
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,780
information processing in in this kind

1641
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,880
of topological Maps as well that you've

1642
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,020
mentioned Daniela the uh

1643
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:03,000
grounding for that or how Michael Levin

1644
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,339
is talking about how Bill electricity is

1645
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:09,000
a glue uh

1646
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:10,400
for for

1647
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,240
the various subsystems in the brain or

1648
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,880
uh based on placing some recent paper

1649
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,160
that was pretty late that that use

1650
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,859
there's this whole I I know I I found

1651
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:25,799
out recently which which I put the uh

1652
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:28,140
surprised up just recently that there is

1653
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,740
a whole whole field of people uh that

1654
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,380
are really trying uh to apply Quantum

1655
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,660
field theory on the brain and there was

1656
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:40,440
one paper on memory formation so how you

1657
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,859
Chris talked about uh memory in terms of

1658
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:46,319
the electromagnetic field that might be

1659
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,319
also great like for pointer so I'm just

1660
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:52,500
putting out uh different people and

1661
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,299
papers that I think might be

1662
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:57,000
interconnectable with this word

1663
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,400
yeah one one interesting thing you

1664
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,839
reflected it in your literature review

1665
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:04,020
is when people think about Quantum and

1666
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:08,280
cognitive systems the orc or and other

1667
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,040
Frameworks often are considering Quantum

1668
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,099
as being electronic scale and therefore

1669
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,839
a quantum theory of cognition or

1670
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,520
Consciousness would entail some kind of

1671
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,440
relationship between the way that

1672
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,480
electrons and photons behave and then

1673
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,040
some difference that makes a difference

1674
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,760
at the biological level and in a way

1675
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,220
what we've been exploring with Chris

1676
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,500
fields and others is like a bypass where

1677
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,680
it's like no the quantum formalism

1678
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,680
Quantum topology Quantum information

1679
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,480
simply and plainly describes cognitive

1680
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,819
processes where like order matters now

1681
01:04:41,819 --> 01:04:44,760
there may or may not be effects

1682
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,859
associated with differences that make a

1683
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:49,799
difference at the electronic scale but

1684
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:54,020
we don't need that in order to use like

1685
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:57,000
superposition and all of these diff

1686
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,059
different effects that empirically are

1687
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:02,040
the case in cognitive systems we're not

1688
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,020
waiting for some new mechanistic insight

1689
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:07,079
it'd be cool to find out but what you've

1690
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:10,980
presented is uh not waiting for a

1691
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,040
different kind of thing to exist

1692
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,040
so I'm curious what experiments or what

1693
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,880
are the unique experiments

1694
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,640
that you feel like would give

1695
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,880
a resounding feeling

1696
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,180
on what you're talking about

1697
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,579
yeah happy that they could uh take it on

1698
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:33,980
so uh

1699
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,900
uh one kind of like very awesome

1700
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,260
research lead and then I'll explain what

1701
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,760
a research Paradigm would look like but

1702
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,500
essentially a first of all like a very

1703
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,140
powerful lead is meditative cessations

1704
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:49,440
so one of the most insane chapters in

1705
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,119
mastering the core teachings of the

1706
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,400
Buddha by Daniel Ingram is the one

1707
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,980
called the three doors where he

1708
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,619
describes the phenomenology of

1709
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:00,599
experiencing a peak meditation State

1710
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:02,099
that's called a cessation where you

1711
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:04,020
blink out of reality for a second or

1712
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:05,640
well for a sub second moment but you

1713
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,040
just blink out fully and then you get

1714
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,540
reconstituted and when you get

1715
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:10,920
reconcited it tends to be a very

1716
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,720
Blissful very rejuvenating type

1717
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,859
experience

1718
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:15,359
but the things he highlights in that

1719
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,400
article is what it feels like to be

1720
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,740
really close to a cessation

1721
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:22,619
and it actually depends on what type of

1722
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:24,539
cessation it is there's roughly like

1723
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:26,460
three ways in which it can happen but

1724
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,160
the mind-blowing thing about that essay

1725
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,299
that chapter

1726
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:32,039
is he essentially describes different

1727
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:34,319
topologies of attention and awareness

1728
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,319
that may arise where in these moments

1729
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:38,880
close to Association if he says well in

1730
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,460
one of those you become kind of a Taurus

1731
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,099
and the Taurus flips the inside and then

1732
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:45,900
outside and it twists around and then it

1733
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,700
cancels out and compresses and then you

1734
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,380
vanish and then there's like another

1735
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,960
variety where you become a cone and then

1736
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,520
you all of your attention gets

1737
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,660
concentrated in the point of the

1738
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,520
chlorine of the cone and then that

1739
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,799
twists around and then vanishes and

1740
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,920
so there's like this reliable you know

1741
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,559
very very uh exotic kind of like

1742
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,420
topological Transformations that can

1743
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,280
happen to your attention and awareness

1744
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,220
and our guess would be that well a

1745
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,079
sensation you know an actual kind of

1746
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:16,859
full Vanishing might be related to the

1747
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:19,079
topological pocket that your brain is

1748
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:21,900
generating essentially opening up so

1749
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,319
that in some maybe non-trivial way the

1750
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:26,700
actual boundary between inside and

1751
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,740
outside gets dissolved or a fraction of

1752
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,140
a second then it gets reconstituted but

1753
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:32,819
something really special happens in that

1754
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:35,160
that moment that allows for deep Insight

1755
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,539
or something along the lines or

1756
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:38,940
relieving a lot of internal stress maybe

1757
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:40,740
like a coronal mass ejection there might

1758
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,900
be something something going on going on

1759
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,000
at the topological level

1760
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,520
um now in terms of yeah kind of like

1761
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,500
further you know more sophisticated

1762
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,200
research paradigms the thing that we're

1763
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,119
looking into

1764
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:55,980
um there's a lot more to be unpacked and

1765
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,359
developed here but is what kind of

1766
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,240
electromagnetic resonance modes that can

1767
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,460
supervene on particular graphs you know

1768
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,480
whether we're talking about their

1769
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,220
connectum or whether we're talking about

1770
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,559
you know the the geometric eigen modes

1771
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,119
more more recent work where you model

1772
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:14,099
the entire cortex essentiometric uh

1773
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:16,319
geometric surface and then you apply

1774
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,600
neural field Theory to that well so like

1775
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,238
what kind like all of that works so far

1776
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:23,160
essentially what it focuses on is

1777
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,738
oscillations in the electric field

1778
01:08:24,738 --> 01:08:27,839
without modeling the magnetic field so

1779
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,880
I'm actually you know I would suspect

1780
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,279
that many of the connective harmonics or

1781
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:35,640
eigen mode uh geometric eigen modes may

1782
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,100
be physically unrealizable simply

1783
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,859
because the magnetic field lines May

1784
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:42,899
collide with each other so like some of

1785
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:45,359
those may not be possible but one of the

1786
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,880
crazy fascinating unusual predictions

1787
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,799
that may come out of our whole Paradigm

1788
01:08:49,799 --> 01:08:52,380
is that once we have a really good

1789
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,738
mapping of what resonant modes

1790
01:08:55,738 --> 01:08:57,600
um arise in the brain on different

1791
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,759
states of Consciousness we would take

1792
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,000
that a when you're fully awake normally

1793
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,160
conscious there will be a very Central

1794
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,880
big topological Loop inside you that

1795
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,060
whenever you're let's say in deep Sleep

1796
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,920
you might see a kind of mind dust you

1797
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,899
might see lots of tiny little little

1798
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:17,939
pockets and maybe when you're in an

1799
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:20,660
ecstatic you know experience like like

1800
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:23,100
deep meditation

1801
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,899
it may do something else like the

1802
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:26,939
particular resonant modes there may

1803
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:29,580
create open field lines that don't form

1804
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,979
a loop so that is like the sort of crazy

1805
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:35,399
very novel type of prediction or at

1806
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:36,660
least research Paradigm that this

1807
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,080
enables

1808
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:40,979
that's that's really cool Chris anything

1809
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:43,319
out of that

1810
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:45,839
yeah I've just uh draw the link between

1811
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,060
the fourth bullet here and what Andrews

1812
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,620
is setting out

1813
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:52,080
I don't think any of this is there are

1814
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,759
some toy bits of modeling you could do

1815
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:55,320
that could increase confidence one way

1816
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,940
or another but in terms of an actual

1817
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,000
experimental prediction

1818
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,120
you would need to combine this with some

1819
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,580
theory of where which bits of the brain

1820
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,860
are doing this so if Ward and Guevara

1821
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,020
are right that it's the thalamus that's

1822
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,280
doing this stuff

1823
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,020
we would expect to see around the

1824
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,420
thalamus a closed pocket and it should

1825
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,520
be possible in principle like this is

1826
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,020
probably billions of pounds worth of

1827
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,880
efforts but to model the thalamus and

1828
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,620
the surrounding bits enough and you can

1829
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,239
find out if there would actually be a

1830
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,980
closed pocket if there would be one in

1831
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,360
theory you can see roughly where it

1832
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,400
would be it moves around a bit but it's

1833
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,260
normally around here you then should be

1834
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,420
able to I don't know if ethical consent

1835
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:34,800
is even possible for something like this

1836
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,620
but disrupt that with a very very

1837
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:40,920
targeted external em source

1838
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,080
think you know transcranial stimulation

1839
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:46,020
but just you know laser precise

1840
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,940
if we've now broken the bit around the

1841
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,260
thalamus but left everything else more

1842
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:52,500
or less untouched we predict if Warden

1843
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,140
Guevara plus us is correct we predict

1844
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,360
that your first person awareness would

1845
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,860
blink out like deep sleep like

1846
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,600
anesthesia like a meditative cessation

1847
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,360
if we're wrong or the combination of us

1848
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,520
is wrong then you'll still be conscious

1849
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,840
but you might just experience something

1850
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,699
really bloody weird but you'll still

1851
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:10,920
expect your contents have changed not

1852
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,659
the not the actual container of

1853
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:14,760
Consciousness hasn't blinked in and out

1854
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,739
and then you could apply that to other

1855
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,120
bits of the brain wherever you think

1856
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,640
there's I mean our other

1857
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,440
other prediction is that it must be

1858
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,540
enclosing the immediate memory model

1859
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:26,820
that we're unsure exactly where that is

1860
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,920
as well that that is also an outstanding

1861
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,100
research question so this is I mean it

1862
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,780
feels like doable in our lifetimes I

1863
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,940
think but none of this is you know give

1864
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,380
us 10 grand and we'll do it this summer

1865
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,260
none of it is that easy

1866
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:43,020
um yeah very interesting and

1867
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,699
neuroimaging

1868
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:47,780
already utilizes electromagnetic

1869
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,580
measurements and there are things that

1870
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:53,040
currently are described within a

1871
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,800
biomolecular paradigm like for example

1872
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,659
changes in effective connectivity

1873
01:11:57,659 --> 01:12:00,480
between different regions of the brain

1874
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,060
well there's already a tract let's just

1875
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,120
say between certain brain regions and so

1876
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,380
maybe if there's

1877
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:10,380
um if the action potential is traveling

1878
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:14,219
down that 100 Lane Highway

1879
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:17,219
or lines then it's going to be like this

1880
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:20,520
Rippling em continuity whereas if they

1881
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,179
were totally disarrayed along that tract

1882
01:12:23,179 --> 01:12:26,100
then you you wouldn't have those two

1883
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,440
regions contained but it'd be like kind

1884
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,940
of like two regions like blowing smoke

1885
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,520
rings at each other if they had enough

1886
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,300
synchrony to to push through the trouble

1887
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,340
and the friction

1888
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:41,699
such that there was a pocket that was

1889
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:44,699
able to you know you you squirt hot

1890
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:47,219
water into a cold pool

1891
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:49,620
there's ways to angle it and do it in

1892
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,179
all of the combinations of viscosity

1893
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:54,120
that it just diffuses instantly

1894
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,219
there's also ways where there would be a

1895
01:12:56,219 --> 01:12:57,659
high temperature

1896
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:00,719
toroidal form that could pass through a

1897
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,100
colder media

1898
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,199
because it maintains a topological

1899
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:05,699
boundary

1900
01:13:05,699 --> 01:13:07,920
a lot of these things are again

1901
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,860
described anatomically or molecularly or

1902
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,840
electronically

1903
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,659
but the magnetic The Duality between

1904
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:17,760
electronics and magnetism is not

1905
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,800
contentious

1906
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,340
so there may be a lot of phenomena

1907
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:24,719
that

1908
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,659
could be Revisited

1909
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:29,460
and I don't know whether that would

1910
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,520
provide indirect evidence with what we

1911
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,500
already know

1912
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,440
um or suggest new plausible experiments

1913
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,678
but

1914
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,260
it's an approach

1915
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:49,440
yeah welcome it and thanks Bernie as

1916
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,120
well for the points us towards like

1917
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,980
Chris fields and Michael Levin I may

1918
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:55,500
come back to you for the uh the qft and

1919
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,320
on memory formation in case I've spotted

1920
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,580
some stuff on that but I'm not sure I've

1921
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,020
spotted the one it sounded like you were

1922
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,480
referring to so yeah it's an exciting

1923
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:07,199
time this sort of research yeah one last

1924
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:08,520
connection there with with active

1925
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,440
inferences you have the electronic and

1926
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,840
the magnetic fields influencing each

1927
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,480
other that's the the basis of what

1928
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,860
philosophers

1929
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:18,840
might consider in terms of this Epi

1930
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:23,400
phenomenalism or not question and

1931
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,960
um if we had an active inference

1932
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,900
situation of two songbirds the act of

1933
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,760
states of one become the sensory of the

1934
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,420
other

1935
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,920
so if they were just passing messages

1936
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,620
every single time step to each other

1937
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,500
then they would both be engaged in their

1938
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,440
own blanketed perception on the inbound

1939
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,080
and action selection on the outbounds

1940
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,380
and so they could basically be in this

1941
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:50,400
continual oscillatory relationship with

1942
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,520
causal efficacy both ways again or you

1943
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,719
could design a situation where the

1944
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,880
causal efficacy only flows one way

1945
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,120
but the point is this is the topological

1946
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,120
approach that lets us explore that in a

1947
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,020
way that isn't only appealing to

1948
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:09,179
molecular

1949
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:12,420
or material phenomena and then leaving

1950
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:14,159
the whole question which is the whole

1951
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,560
question of the informational and the

1952
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,659
closure and The Binding leaving all

1953
01:15:18,659 --> 01:15:20,820
those to be resolved by slicing and

1954
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,980
dicing with a scalpel

1955
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:25,199
which is not even

1956
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,300
a viable option as far as we already

1957
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,600
understand

1958
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:33,600
Bernie and then the authors

1959
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,199
what are your closing thoughts or

1960
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,320
how would you suggest that people get in

1961
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,699
the game or what should they do with

1962
01:15:41,699 --> 01:15:44,780
their own topologies

1963
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,280
maybe I could note that Andres could

1964
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:54,500
expand on if he wants to know uh

1965
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:57,679
any link

1966
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,620
well yeah I mean I guess the at the PRI

1967
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:07,260
I mean has to be introduced by Mike in

1968
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:10,440
2015 on principia qualia but the their

1969
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,500
correspondence respondents between

1970
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,620
um

1971
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,460
uh yeah you know like

1972
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,860
of the tri for many years now you know

1973
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,659
you can see a 2020 presentation about it

1974
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:26,880
in this many more content about it but

1975
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,640
the the main idea the way it would

1976
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,600
actually you know work out here is the

1977
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,080
regions of the topologically closed uh

1978
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,480
field that behave like a smooth field

1979
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:42,300
May potentially correspond to a very

1980
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,640
Blissful experience so you know I'm very

1981
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,159
very optimistic of the potential of okay

1982
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:49,980
like something like a peak uh Blissful

1983
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:52,440
experience Big 5 mu DMT experience or

1984
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,960
something like that it would probably I

1985
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,120
suspect have like a very internally

1986
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,000
simplified topology

1987
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,560
where you know the geometry is as smooth

1988
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,239
as possible so that's kind of like an

1989
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:05,460
interesting yeah prediction or or angle

1990
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:08,100
and on all of these uh I think yeah

1991
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:12,179
maybe to to wrap up I would say that we

1992
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:14,480
you know would enormously welcome

1993
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,060
anybody who is uh technically Savvy for

1994
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:21,060
like uh doing interesting simulations of

1995
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,980
the electromagnetic field I mean we are

1996
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,780
we're doing ourselves some like really

1997
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:27,000
interesting experiments and in

1998
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,100
combination with a classical neural

1999
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,440
networks but anybody's kind of like a

2000
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,580
you know the intersection between

2001
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,159
machine learning uh electromagnetic

2002
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:38,400
fields and simulations and

2003
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,080
yeah you know statistics machine

2004
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,179
learning essentially that that kind of

2005
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:43,560
intersection is something that could

2006
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,719
really potentially accelerate these

2007
01:17:45,719 --> 01:17:47,520
research you know if you had the

2008
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,500
technical competency to yeah sort of

2009
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,640
like work on the analysis I was

2010
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,780
describing or finding the

2011
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,400
electromagnetic resonant modes of our

2012
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,980
graph and then analyzing its topology

2013
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:57,420
you know we would love to collaborate

2014
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,580
that's like the sort of content we

2015
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,679
we dream of producing and yeah in the

2016
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,540
next year or two so

2017
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,040
thank you and thank you for having us

2018
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,540
it's been fantastic really really

2019
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:07,860
appreciate it

2020
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:11,299
I appreciate that Chris

2021
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,500
you need nothing substantial to that

2022
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,960
just just just my thanks as well and you

2023
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,460
know I've I've scribbled down some

2024
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,500
thoughts about about the Marco blankets

2025
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,400
and about some of those different

2026
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,560
research areas as well so you know we're

2027
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,020
getting stuff from this as well so yeah

2028
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,760
and hopefully this helps reach a few new

2029
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,860
people who might come up with either a

2030
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:30,659
brilliant idea why something we'd Miss

2031
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:32,460
and this this just can't work for

2032
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,560
somebody we want to hear that as well

2033
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,659
um but even more constructively ways

2034
01:18:36,659 --> 01:18:38,520
that this could be tested or built out

2035
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,739
more gradually modeled

2036
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:41,520
um

2037
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,219
yeah thank you for having us cool new

2038
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,980
ways of thinking within even one

2039
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,679
topological frame enables new action

2040
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,980
selection in the area and the era of

2041
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,420
video chatting we've made new

2042
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,239
topological relationships new

2043
01:18:57,239 --> 01:19:01,080
connectivities that then disperse yet

2044
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,100
again

2045
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:07,159
and so it continues

2046
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:08,780
thank you all though

2047
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,239
thank you so much until next time thank

2048
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:15,919
you amazing stuff see ya bye
