1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,930
Hello and welcome,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,598
everyone. This is active inference

3
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:14,066
Livestream. Guest stream number 54.1.

4
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:17,042
It's August 25, 2023.

5
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:18,610
Today we're going to be hearing about

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,058
electromagnetic field topology as a

7
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,914
solution to the boundary problem of

8
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:25,122
consciousness. This is going to be a

9
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:28,450
copresentation, followed by a discussion

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,866
with our guests here. So I will leave it

11
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:33,994
to everyone to introduce themselves and

12
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:36,774
present and discuss however they prefer.

13
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:38,886
And thank you again for joining.

14
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:42,926
Please. Thank you so

15
00:00:42,948 --> 00:00:46,266
much for having us, Daniel. Yeah. I'm

16
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:48,302
Andres Co, founder of Qualia Research

17
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:52,014
Institute. And, yeah, I'm here with

18
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:54,078
Liber Chris, co author of this paper,

19
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:57,486
and Lieber, a volunteer and Wiki

20
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:59,666
extraordinaire for QRI. But yeah, go

21
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:03,282
ahead, Chris, and lieber. Yeah,

22
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:06,326
no more to say. That's plenty. Let's get

23
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:07,240
into the detail.

24
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,902
Yeah, I'm co working with QRI and a lot

25
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:15,094
into Active Instruments, and I'm trying

26
00:01:15,132 --> 00:01:18,666
to unify QRI with Active Instruments a

27
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:20,220
lot. And yeah.

28
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,020
Beautiful. Yeah.

29
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:33,334
Next slide. Essentially, our outline

30
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:35,294
of this presentation is going to

31
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:37,006
essentially walk you through some of the

32
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:39,790
key ideas of the paper and kind of like

33
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,806
trying to illustrate them or making them

34
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:45,154
a little bit more intuitive, fairly high

35
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,850
level, although we will actually present

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,330
kind of the core argument.

37
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,554
The main thing to point out here next

38
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:57,234
slide is that the magnetic theories

39
00:01:57,282 --> 00:01:59,862
of consciousness, I guess, like, 20

40
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,960
years ago, they sounded like a total

41
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,680
crackpot type.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,476
Yeah, I've still got a good connection,

43
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:22,656
so we can give him a moment or two, and

44
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:25,776
if not, I'll pick up from what was the

45
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:26,640
crackpot,

46
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,212
see if he reconnects. My gosh, sorry,

47
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:35,780
Andres, please repeat from crackpot.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,132
Oh, my God. Yeah. Over the last 20

49
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:41,444
years, however, there's been an

50
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:43,888
explosion of interest in electromagnetic

51
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:45,604
theories of consciousness and serious

52
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,464
peer reviewed publications about them,

53
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,464
especially the last ten and then five

54
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,076
years, kind of like a variable

55
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:53,208
exponential explosion in terms of a

56
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:55,376
number of serious articles published.

57
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,348
And one of the very kind of key,

58
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:01,916
amazing kind of contributions that

59
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,288
something like an electromagnetic theory

60
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:05,692
of consciousness can offer to the

61
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:08,672
overall ecosystem of philosophy of mind

62
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:12,320
is that it provides a way to solve

63
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,264
question for how information can be

64
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:17,984
combined. I mean, essentially, when you

65
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:21,136
have information distributed, how is it

66
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:23,484
possible that they can be simultaneously

67
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:25,184
part of some kind of, like, unified

68
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:27,684
whole? And electromagnetic theories of

69
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:29,876
consciousness are just very proud to

70
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:32,564
say, well, the electromagnetic field is

71
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:34,392
ontologically unitary, it's already

72
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,376
unified, so there's not much of a

73
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:40,168
problem here. However, once you

74
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:43,080
kind of have this unity,

75
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,336
then the question becomes, well, but how

76
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,844
do you actually draw a boundary around

77
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:48,444
it? So actually, you just traded one

78
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:49,630
problem for another.

79
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,470
Dig into the details there.

80
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,862
Cool. Shall I take us through the

81
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,990
literature review as context for this?

82
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,506
And then Andreas will come back to kind

83
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:07,394
of give you the solution that we think

84
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:10,210
can fit with electromagnetic fields.

85
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,154
So, yeah, the boundary problem. So

86
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,786
binding problem you heard just now into

87
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:17,222
a first approximation that is, whatever

88
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:18,802
you think might make up consciousness.

89
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:21,138
Maybe it's neurons firing. Maybe it's

90
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:23,238
some sort of magical qualia at the

91
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:24,438
bottom of the universe. Whatever you

92
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:26,746
think it is, these small things need to

93
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:30,822
be bound together to reflect the complex

94
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,938
phenomenology we have. We see lots of

95
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:35,238
things all at once. Right now, I'm

96
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:36,938
smelling the flowers outside. I've got

97
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,362
the laptop screen in front of me.

98
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,346
There's lots of stuff happening all at

99
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:42,558
once in a unified way. So that's the

100
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:44,238
binding problem. We won't do more on

101
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:46,078
that here. We'll sort of assume some

102
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:47,678
familiarity with it. But then the

103
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:50,186
boundary problem is, well, once you've

104
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:52,462
got a mechanism that creates the binding

105
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,154
between these lower level entities, why

106
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:57,154
would that mechanism ever stop? Because

107
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:59,346
clearly, our awareness, our

108
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:02,066
phenomenology doesn't go on forever. We

109
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:03,246
don't know what's happening in Alpha

110
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:04,774
Centurion. Our awareness is not

111
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:07,234
unbounded. And as soon as you realize

112
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:08,582
that you need boundaries around

113
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:11,634
something, a number of things suddenly

114
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:14,146
don't quite make sense. So Owen

115
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:16,946
Schroedinger of physics Fame flagged

116
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:18,426
this up as one of the things that he

117
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,746
felt was completely unresolved. So

118
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:23,226
despite his kind of vast intellect and

119
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:25,078
his contributions elsewhere, he felt

120
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:27,002
that this puzzle was one of the things

121
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:29,606
that he described it as. When he turns

122
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:31,610
his mind to it, everything just

123
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,534
evaporates. None of it makes sense

124
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:35,038
anymore. He can't get a grip on the

125
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:37,280
problem. And he described the problem,

126
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,166
as you can see on the screen. He was

127
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:42,386
saying, why is it that my identity is at

128
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,834
the intermediate level, this kind of

129
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:47,140
roughly human shaped body?

130
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,906
And you can say, okay, we mostly mean

131
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:51,394
the central nervous system. But either

132
00:05:51,432 --> 00:05:54,246
way, this broad entity has lots of

133
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:56,786
smaller things inside it cells, organs,

134
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:59,506
human bodies, and lots of things above

135
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:01,986
it cities, states, solar systems,

136
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:05,174
universes, and so on. Why is our self

137
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:08,620
consciousness always at this one level?

138
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,786
And if you describe that as a problem to

139
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,194
somebody who's never heard of it before

140
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:16,074
or never thought of it before this

141
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,014
happened to me just last Friday, they

142
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:21,438
might say, well, it's obviously just

143
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:24,890
like the body stops. Like, the skull

144
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,678
stops here, or like, my arm stops here.

145
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:30,058
Of course, it's not going out to Arthur

146
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:33,554
Centurion. Why would and it's a very

147
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:36,014
intuitive, immediate human reaction.

148
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:37,922
But you probe it a little bit, as

149
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:40,126
Schrodinger did, and it kind of falls

150
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:44,174
apart. Because if you're a neuron firing

151
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:45,814
somewhere in the central nervous system

152
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:49,266
and you're being initiated by a neuron

153
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,918
in the peripheral nervous system, well,

154
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:53,798
how do you know to stop binding? How do

155
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,174
you know that there's a boundary that

156
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,658
stops at the edge of the central nervous

157
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:59,790
system? Or if your fingers are holding

158
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,446
onto a tool and you're getting feedback

159
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:03,098
from that tool, you're driving a car,

160
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:04,506
it can feel like you're part of that

161
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:07,226
car. Where does the system know where

162
00:07:07,248 --> 00:07:08,846
the boundary is because most of these

163
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:12,782
things that we observe have only

164
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:15,770
observer dependent boundaries.

165
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,986
If you've got a wheel in a car rolling

166
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,186
along the road, from one perspective,

167
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:21,598
it looks like the wheel is separate from

168
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:23,986
the road. But if you're a tiny ant or

169
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,474
something and the car is parked, these

170
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,754
things all may feel like they're one

171
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,278
object. And this was when Schrodinger

172
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:31,666
turned his mind to this. It puzzled him.

173
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:33,298
So let's give him the benefit of the

174
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:34,918
doubt. Let's say that there's something

175
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,160
real to be puzzled through here.

176
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,614
This issue applies both to the example I

177
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:42,214
started with around building up in small

178
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,194
units. But also if you're a cosmo

179
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:45,686
panpsychist, you believe that there is

180
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,506
one universal consciousness, and we are

181
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,978
like a god playing with its puppets. In

182
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:53,114
that case, you still have the same

183
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:53,994
question because you're still

184
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:56,426
demarcating boundaries. You just get the

185
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:58,398
mirror image. We'll mostly focus on the

186
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:00,206
idea of expanding up from small things

187
00:08:00,308 --> 00:08:02,250
because that's closer to the orthodoxy.

188
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,942
But you can't solve this problem

189
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:06,942
magically by declaring a single

190
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:11,830
consciousness. Okay, so Schrodinger

191
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,394
didn't say much more about this. He just

192
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:16,514
said that this was a puzzle. The first

193
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:19,134
person we found that really formalized

194
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,374
this and gave it the name boundary

195
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:24,114
problem was Rosenberg. And it was a

196
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:25,926
number of pieces, late 90s, early two

197
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:29,234
thousand s. And he uses the phrase

198
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:31,366
siller and Cryptus, but it's exactly the

199
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:34,006
same idea as Schrodinger had. One of

200
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,118
them is, well, why aren't there lots of

201
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:38,678
small things? I think that might have

202
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,466
been the silla, that might have been the

203
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,818
nine headed monster. And then on the

204
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,018
other hand, what about the things that

205
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,698
we are nested within? And he called that

206
00:08:46,704 --> 00:08:49,486
the Cryptus. And he said, it's very hard

207
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:53,658
to posit a genuinely robust mechanism

208
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:55,790
that would stop it in both directions.

209
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,606
You can imagine a reason why lots of

210
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:00,306
small things get bound together, but why

211
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:04,146
would the binding stop? And his view

212
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,114
in framing this problem is that no one

213
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:10,194
had solved it. Winding on to

214
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:13,074
Andres and I chatting about this last

215
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:15,002
year and building on some of Qri's

216
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,366
foundational work in this area, we

217
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:18,982
wanted to know, well, what's happened

218
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,542
since Rosenberg framed this and

219
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:23,826
Schroding was so puzzled by it. Surely

220
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,286
someone's come up with a few solutions

221
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:28,860
to it. So Q standard

222
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,570
database driven literature review,

223
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,506
and you've got the details there.

224
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:38,522
Fairly standard stuff. What we looked

225
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,230
looking across the Scopus database, we

226
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,318
only found five papers that seemed to be

227
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:43,822
relevant about the boundary problem,

228
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:47,934
compared to 92 on the binding and 47

229
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:49,918
on the combination problem. So some of

230
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:52,446
these related problems, and in our

231
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:53,726
intro, we kind of went straight from

232
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:55,778
binding to boundary. They are. So if

233
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:56,914
you're thinking about one, you really

234
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:58,466
should be thinking about the other.

235
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:00,146
Well, that is not reflected in the

236
00:10:00,168 --> 00:10:02,414
literature. We did a bit more puzzling

237
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:04,946
around. People don't seem to be

238
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:06,646
referring to this by other names, or

239
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:08,006
when they are, they haven't solved it

240
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:11,286
either. So it felt that

241
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,646
there was something worth going at here.

242
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:15,580
And this is what initiated the paper.

243
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,066
What we did find, though, partly in

244
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:20,874
those five papers and partly in looking

245
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,538
around, we do find families of possible

246
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,246
solutions. And there's no clear winner.

247
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,014
But maybe philosophy rarely has a clear

248
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:31,646
winner for anything, so maybe that's an

249
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:33,626
unreasonable expectation. But there's

250
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:35,982
definitely open questions for each class

251
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,446
of theories that have been put out there

252
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:41,746
to solve this problem. So the first of

253
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,194
these loosely termed algorithmic, so

254
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,542
computational causal structure theories,

255
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:49,042
I'm just trying to summarize them into

256
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,674
one term. Some of the examples there

257
00:10:50,712 --> 00:10:53,246
IIT, of course, very well known global

258
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,718
workspace theory as well. They will

259
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:58,454
tend to say that things bind together

260
00:10:58,572 --> 00:11:00,034
when they're in a particular pattern.

261
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:01,446
So you might imagine a database that

262
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:03,506
references itself or the working memory

263
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,994
of a computer, or as soon as things are

264
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,446
somehow linked together in a causal

265
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:09,674
sense, in IIT, there's a particular type

266
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,946
of pattern, but nonetheless it's an

267
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:14,220
abstract informational relationship.

268
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,302
Those papers don't tend to be super

269
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:20,586
explicit about defining boundaries.

270
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:23,546
Normally, IIT will normally say, here's

271
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:26,222
our system, and now let's ask within

272
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:28,990
that system, where is the highest phi?

273
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,566
They sort of just say, take the

274
00:11:31,588 --> 00:11:32,946
boundaries on that. No one has said,

275
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,258
let's take the whole universe as a

276
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:36,222
system. The math is already virtually

277
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:39,570
impossible, even toy systems.

278
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,446
But reading between the lines or reading

279
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:44,002
some of the other papers around it,

280
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:46,434
there's something about if you had a hi

281
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,546
fi area surrounded by lots of lo fi

282
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:50,358
areas, well, it's natural that it's the

283
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:51,766
bit that's high. And there's this

284
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:53,446
principle of exclusion that says you

285
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:55,894
take the highest one in a system, maybe

286
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:58,026
you have to specify a system before it

287
00:11:58,048 --> 00:12:00,362
makes sense to ask that. And if you took

288
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,986
the highest bit out, somehow you just

289
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:04,406
remove some of those causal

290
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:06,394
interconnections that create that

291
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:08,826
highness. Whatever's left will have a

292
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:10,814
slightly lower bit of phi, and that is

293
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:14,446
now where the sort of locus of

294
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,454
consciousness resides. This may well

295
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:19,006
work, kind of the maths would need

296
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:20,286
working out, I think Andres and I are

297
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:23,506
initially skeptical, but because as

298
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:25,490
best as we can see, no one's really

299
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,646
created complicated maps and discussed

300
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,026
what would happen when you've got

301
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,026
different mixtures of densities that are

302
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:33,474
shifting over time. What stops it from

303
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:36,386
being arbitrary? Certainly there are

304
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:37,526
questions to be had, and we can come

305
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,046
back to this a bit if we want to talk

306
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:41,494
about it further. But suffice it to say

307
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,558
it's not a guaranteed solution. And

308
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,494
there's one critique that we cite.

309
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:48,570
There resonance theories,

310
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,326
a link between those and electromagnetic

311
00:12:52,358 --> 00:12:54,618
fields now as well, in that the main

312
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:56,630
progenitor of these theories. Pam Hunt

313
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,918
would say that the main resonance which

314
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,454
he sees binding happening together in

315
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:04,206
human consciousness is en fields. So

316
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:05,886
there are links between these as well,

317
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:07,966
and maybe the informational patterns are

318
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,186
being encoded in resonance or quantum

319
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:11,918
entanglement or Em fields. So there can

320
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,066
be links between these as well. The

321
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,646
resonance theory that says that binding

322
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:16,882
happens when things are in the same

323
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:20,194
frequency, simple enough, or when they

324
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,526
are close enough, and that becomes a

325
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:25,926
little bit more debatable. But what does

326
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:28,886
that really mean, the boundaries? There

327
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,150
is a conceptual solution for this,

328
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,086
which is the slowest shared resonance in

329
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:36,202
a system, but many of the same issues

330
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:39,434
apply as with the algorithmic. But

331
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:42,746
again, if experimenters, it may be

332
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,940
possible to create one that works there

333
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,946
quantum theories entanglement is what

334
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:49,386
binds it together, at least in some of

335
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:52,954
them. So what causes two experiences, a

336
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:54,718
blue cup and the shape of the cup to be

337
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:56,606
bound together into one? Well, it's that

338
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,058
the blueness and the cupness, I'm

339
00:13:58,074 --> 00:13:59,294
obviously talking at a very high level

340
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:00,986
of abstraction, but those are somehow

341
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:03,026
quantum entangled with each other that

342
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:05,346
would indeed create, to the best of our

343
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:07,170
physics knowledge today, a kind of

344
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,198
ontologically real binding. And that's

345
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:10,866
quite an attractive part of the

346
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:13,426
solution. Well, what would stop those

347
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:15,566
boundaries? There is the monogamy

348
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:17,314
principle. Things can only be maximally

349
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,606
entangled up to a certain point, but

350
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:21,286
there's a very, very open question about

351
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,650
whether that sort of thing would enable

352
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,798
the kind of macro phenomenology we have.

353
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:28,826
But in the paper we say all of these are

354
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:31,402
worth exploring, let's keep

355
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:34,250
investigating. And then there's the one

356
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,994
I started with an instruction like maybe

357
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:38,138
it's the boundary of the central nervous

358
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:39,854
system, but hopefully even a small

359
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,030
amount of scrutiny causes that one to

360
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,070
collapse.

361
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,894
And most of these explicitly say that

362
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:50,618
more work is needed, more math is

363
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:52,146
needed, and certainly that will be true

364
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:54,020
of what we're presenting here as well.

365
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,306
What we want to do is add a new one to

366
00:14:56,328 --> 00:15:01,794
this list. And the

367
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:04,150
inspiration for this is that, well, if

368
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,754
the Em field accounts present a solution

369
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:08,550
to the binding problem they certainly

370
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,766
believe they do, there's lots of

371
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:13,686
literature on it, then maybe they

372
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,318
can also provide a solution to the

373
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:16,646
boundary problem. Given how closely

374
00:15:16,678 --> 00:15:19,594
related they are. When you read those

375
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:22,426
accounts, they don't quite have it

376
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:24,166
nailed yet. The most common explanation

377
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:26,602
they give is a kind of inverse square

378
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,466
law rule where, well, the strength of a

379
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:31,406
field just becomes so small so quickly.

380
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:33,678
By the time you're a centimeter out from

381
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,006
the thalamus or by the time you're at

382
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:37,166
the edges of the skull these fields have

383
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:40,394
just evaporated into they've decohered.

384
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:41,726
They're indistinguishable from the

385
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:45,442
neural noise all around us. That might

386
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:47,774
be okay if you're okay with a fuzzy

387
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,218
boundary and we'll come on to that in a

388
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:51,534
SEC. Others motivate a phase transition,

389
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:53,414
a bit like quantum entanglement or a bit

390
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,554
like the exact resonance of resonance

391
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:58,098
theories. But those phase transitions

392
00:15:58,114 --> 00:16:00,120
are pretty speculative as well.

393
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,726
So the solution we will

394
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:07,274
come to and andrews will outline is a

395
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:09,066
different aspect of em fields. It's not

396
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,646
fuzzy boundaries and it's not a vague

397
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,294
phase transition. It's an entirely

398
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:15,114
different topological solution which we

399
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:17,020
argue can solve the problems.

400
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,518
What we think is worth doing, though,

401
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,414
is to make that boundary problem more

402
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:24,846
explicit. What you've heard both from

403
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:26,446
Schrodinger and from Rosenberg is this

404
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:28,766
idea of kind of like why aren't the

405
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,530
cells inside you conscious? Or if they

406
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,882
are conscious, why don't we ever

407
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:35,026
experience that? And again, going up,

408
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:37,346
what about cities and families and

409
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:38,974
things or group chants or football

410
00:16:39,022 --> 00:16:43,186
stadiums, that sort of stuff. And there

411
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,630
is a scholar who argues, based on

412
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,366
resonance theory, that actually when we

413
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:48,854
are in a group chanting or a group

414
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:51,154
dancing situation, our consciousness

415
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:53,302
does in fact move to that level as well.

416
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:56,426
And it's speculative, but there's much

417
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,274
to be thought about. So to make this

418
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:02,522
problem more precise, we've got five,

419
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:04,346
and I'll just give you the one or two

420
00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:07,462
sentences on each. The hard

421
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:12,142
boundary problem is this

422
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:14,654
sense that a fuzzy boundary probably

423
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:16,910
isn't good enough. And let's kind of

424
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,406
explain a bit more why. If you have

425
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,406
something like a wave or the example of

426
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:22,978
the wheel I gave before touching the

427
00:17:22,984 --> 00:17:24,962
ground or indeed any connection between

428
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:28,066
any physical atoms, the closer you look

429
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,034
to it, the less obvious it is where it

430
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:33,666
stops. The boundaries of my skull may

431
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:36,566
feel very precise to me, but if there

432
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,422
were an alien the size of a solar

433
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,694
system, their ability to perceive this

434
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:42,626
would most likely just blurs

435
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:44,798
imperceptibly into its surroundings.

436
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:47,274
These things feel hard, but they're not

437
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:48,220
really hard.

438
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,766
At the edges of our awareness, there's

439
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:56,166
this sense that things might feel fuzzy,

440
00:17:56,198 --> 00:17:58,950
but at some point it just sort of stops,

441
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,858
might feel like it might feel infinite.

442
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,878
There are states of mind where we can

443
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:05,706
feel an infinite awareness, but probing

444
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:08,154
that further, it doesn't truly encompass

445
00:18:08,202 --> 00:18:10,974
everything and go on forever. At this

446
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:12,770
edge. Our assertion is that sometimes

447
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,274
this feels like a hard boundary. And if

448
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,114
it ever sometimes feels like a hard

449
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:19,854
boundary, then you need some mechanism

450
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:22,866
that is capable of a hard edge in a way

451
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:24,542
that these physical phenomena typically

452
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,938
aren't. So that's the hard boundary

453
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:28,918
definitely happy to drill into more of

454
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:30,886
any of this or any of the other five if

455
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:33,254
they're not making enough sense in the Q

456
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:38,086
A. So lower levels we've covered mean

457
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:41,146
the great example of this is we know

458
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,578
that when we go to sleep, some part of

459
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:44,698
our consciousness, at least the bit that

460
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:46,966
we remember, switches off, yet the brain

461
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:48,918
remains active. The lower levels

462
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:50,586
boundary problem could be reinterpreted

463
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:53,886
as saying why doesn't our awareness just

464
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:56,206
shift to another part of the brain at

465
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:58,382
that point? It certainly doesn't seem to

466
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:01,354
most of the time. Higher level boundary

467
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:03,378
problem, we've had that from the

468
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:04,674
beginning. That's why doesn't it go up?

469
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:06,322
Maybe it does sometimes. Certainly

470
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:09,566
doesn't normally the private boundary

471
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:11,266
problem. So this is now, rather than

472
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:13,910
going down into ourselves or up into the

473
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,806
universe in which we are nested, this is

474
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:19,750
more take two of those boundaries,

475
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,840
me and you, me and one other person.

476
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,386
Why can we not bridge into each other's

477
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:28,266
minds, at least not routinely? Those who

478
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:29,946
claim to do so have struggled to

479
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,178
replicate it and get it into the

480
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:33,546
mainstream. So this is privacy. There

481
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:37,046
appears to be some limitation that stops

482
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:38,986
these mechanisms from connecting with

483
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:41,538
each other. And yet if it is slowest

484
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:43,882
shared resonance or if it is highest

485
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:46,814
informational phi in IIT, why is it not

486
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,534
possible to construct a system in which

487
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:51,658
the highest phi is now an interconnected

488
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:53,534
one and our consciousness has collapsed?

489
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:55,218
Maybe it is possible, and that's just a

490
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:56,594
technical endeavor we haven't yet

491
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:58,526
achieved. But either way, there's

492
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:00,258
something that's challenging about it,

493
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:02,738
either as a technical barrier or as a

494
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,238
philosophical one. The last one is a

495
00:20:05,244 --> 00:20:06,854
temporal boundary problem because

496
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:09,382
everything we've said so far is in

497
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:12,406
space. But the kind of entities and

498
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:15,420
experiences we're talking about are not

499
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,450
zero time, space based activities.

500
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,874
They have a temporal persistence. So

501
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:26,380
what is it that puts boundaries around

502
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,658
a micro moment of experience? What is it

503
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:32,478
that enables us to experience the end of

504
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:34,286
a note and still retain that idea of the

505
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:36,094
start of the note and experience them

506
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:39,674
together? And how does this extend

507
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:42,226
through broader experiences of the self.

508
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:45,890
So those are the five puzzles.

509
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,142
Hopefully that's enough of a qualitative

510
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,998
overview so that you know what we're

511
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:52,786
trying to solve at least. And if I hand

512
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:54,246
back over to Andrews now, he will give

513
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:57,126
you an entirely new solution to these

514
00:20:57,148 --> 00:20:59,800
puzzles. Yes.

515
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,210
Next slide. Going a little bit broader

516
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,166
too, in that what Chris just talked

517
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:08,586
about is kind of the criteria for the

518
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:10,118
boundary problem, kind of like breaking

519
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:11,226
down the boundary problem into

520
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:13,610
subcomponents. And then there's also,

521
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,090
more broadly, things that you would want

522
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,302
out of a theory of consciousness. And so

523
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:20,190
the solution to the boundary problem

524
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,506
ideally will also, in a sense, satisfy

525
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:24,666
these constraints. And these constraints

526
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:27,562
are framing variance nominated

527
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:30,138
phenomenalism and no strong emergence.

528
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:33,930
Next slide. So framing variance

529
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,846
essentially can be recapariance.

530
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:40,914
The fact that whatever structure is

531
00:21:40,952 --> 00:21:42,786
giving rise to the boundary shouldn't in

532
00:21:42,808 --> 00:21:46,514
a way, be frame specific, shouldn't just

533
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:47,926
depend on how you're looking at an

534
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:49,046
object. It should be kind of like an

535
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:51,526
intrinsic objective property of the

536
00:21:51,548 --> 00:21:53,686
object that if you move it around, it

537
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,978
shouldn't, in principle, be changing in

538
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:57,450
that way. Next slide.

539
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,418
Non epiphenomenalism. For those who are

540
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:02,826
not familiar with the term, this is the

541
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:05,414
idea that for a particular conscious

542
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:07,466
physical system, there corresponds an

543
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:09,826
experience, but that there's no causal

544
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:11,486
influence from that conscious experience

545
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:13,886
back into the system. And there's like,

546
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:16,234
various ways of kind of trying to ground

547
00:22:16,362 --> 00:22:18,286
the question of, hey, why is

548
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:21,738
epiphenomenalism not the case? There's

549
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,434
kind of differences in emphasis by each

550
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:25,726
of these questions, but they're roughly

551
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,426
pointing in the same direction. One

552
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:29,490
important question is how is it possible

553
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,554
that we can talk in detail about our

554
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:33,574
experience, but the way we actually

555
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:35,206
framed it in the paper that we find the

556
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,842
most compelling is how was evolution

557
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:40,514
able to recruit? Coherent, globally

558
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:43,794
bound states. If they're not causally

559
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:45,714
significant, if they're not causally

560
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:46,746
useful, it would just be an

561
00:22:46,768 --> 00:22:48,730
extraordinary coincidence that it just

562
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,074
happens to happen simultaneously along

563
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:53,146
with something that seems to be

564
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:55,066
computationally significant and

565
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,598
encompass a whole lot of information at

566
00:22:57,604 --> 00:22:59,790
the same time. Next slide.

567
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,790
And then we also have no strong

568
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,938
emergence. There's this quote from David

569
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:09,758
that says, the Lagrangian of the

570
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,438
standard model does not break down

571
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:14,242
inside one's own skull. Meaning we want

572
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:16,542
the laws of physics to apply universally

573
00:23:16,606 --> 00:23:18,914
to whatever explanation space we come up

574
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:21,134
with that we don't want to introduce

575
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:22,978
special cases or say like, oh, there's

576
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:25,078
like a special different field in the

577
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:27,206
brain, or anything of the sort. We want

578
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:31,366
to have a homogeneous set

579
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:34,986
of physics that as simple as it

580
00:23:35,008 --> 00:23:37,082
gets, as mainstream as it gets in terms

581
00:23:37,136 --> 00:23:40,346
of appealing to standard physics. Next

582
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:43,878
slide. So, yeah, the overarching

583
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:47,498
solution and explanation space, that is

584
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:49,386
electromagnetic field topology. So,

585
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:51,566
first of all, I will walk you through in

586
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:53,790
what way this explanation space

587
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,014
satisfies the kind of like three

588
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:57,774
constraints that I provided. And then

589
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,486
Chris is going to explain how it

590
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:01,326
addresses each of the sub problems.

591
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:02,510
Next slide.

592
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,660
So, yeah, next one.

593
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,514
Yeah, if you actually kind of look at

594
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:13,506
these amazing reconstructions of the

595
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,682
electromagnetic field of stellar bodies,

596
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,726
you would see that nothing trivial about

597
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,354
it. There's like all of this incredible

598
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:23,110
complexity and richness in structure.

599
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,394
A lot of it is very counterintuitive,

600
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:26,770
not something that you would see with a

601
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,142
naked eye. You require superimposing,

602
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:32,602
a lot of pictures from the different

603
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:34,746
regions of the spectrum to kind of get a

604
00:24:34,768 --> 00:24:36,218
picture of what's going on in the

605
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,366
electromagnetic field. And yeah, it has

606
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:41,626
kind of these elongated, weird plasma

607
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:44,442
tubes and circular structures and loops

608
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:47,898
and so on. So it's a very structurally

609
00:24:47,994 --> 00:24:50,770
rich environment. Next slide.

610
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,810
And the way in which something

611
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,274
like the topology of that field will

612
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:00,946
satisfy the criteria that wet line is as

613
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:03,686
follows. So if you look at the

614
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,110
electromagnetic field of the sun,

615
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,666
sometimes this phenomena called magnetic

616
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:11,174
reconnection happens. And this is

617
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:13,666
actually responsible for solar flares

618
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:15,786
and kernel mass ejections. It has to do

619
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:18,860
with when plasma tubes that are the

620
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,090
electromagnetic confinement structures

621
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,114
touch with each other and so they can

622
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,498
open up and spray plasma into the outer

623
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:32,222
space. The key thing to point about

624
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:33,774
here is that this is actually a

625
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,746
topological change to the field. It's

626
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:38,814
not just any kind of physical change

627
00:25:38,932 --> 00:25:41,554
when you have a solar flare coronal mass

628
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:45,298
ejection that is the effect of a

629
00:25:45,464 --> 00:25:48,462
macroscopic gigantic topological

630
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:50,674
transformation. What this slide is

631
00:25:50,712 --> 00:25:53,446
trying to get at is that whether a

632
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,746
system experienced magnetic reconnection

633
00:25:55,778 --> 00:25:58,566
or not will not depend on your frame of

634
00:25:58,588 --> 00:26:00,998
reference. And the very simple reason is

635
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:04,846
that Lorentz transforms simply squeeze

636
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,340
and stretch, but they never actually

637
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,394
reconnect or cut or add

638
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:14,394
any kind of topological change. In other

639
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:17,190
words, a Lorentz transform will leave a

640
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,574
topological event untouched. So in that

641
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,366
sense okay, like topology as an

642
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:26,446
explanation space for why this

643
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:28,026
is framing variant, it definitely fits

644
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:29,630
the bill. Next slide.

645
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,610
Importantly, too, in the brain, we also

646
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,274
can tackle the question of, like, in

647
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:41,170
what way the field is not epiphenomenal.

648
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,194
There's a lot of research on local field

649
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:47,398
potentials in the which are little

650
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,886
microscopic electric oscillations, and

651
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:53,714
they do seem to actually have causal

652
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,478
effects on the activity of neurons. In

653
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:59,098
other words, people might believe, in a

654
00:26:59,104 --> 00:27:00,506
sense, that, hey, brainwaves are kind of

655
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:02,582
just a reflection of neural activity.

656
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:04,506
But the thing that something like

657
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:06,810
transcranial magnetic stimulation makes

658
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,534
clear is that on top of that, they

659
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:11,770
actually feed back into the probability

660
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,686
for neurons to fire, especially the

661
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:16,174
probability for neurons to fire in

662
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:18,410
synchrony or in a state of coherence.

663
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,686
In other words, the actual causal

664
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:23,266
structure of electromagnetic field and

665
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,394
how it connects to neural activity is

666
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:29,214
this dual causal arrow where neural

667
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:30,674
activity influences local field

668
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:33,122
potentials, neural activity influences

669
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,950
activity via synapse.

670
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,308
Yeah, we've been the victim of the

671
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:49,876
connection. Again, let's hope it comes

672
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:52,310
back as quickly as it did last time.

673
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,512
Yes, there's a lot to say,

674
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:00,600
but I won't.

675
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,800
Hopefully you got some harsh questions

676
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,316
written down as we've been taking you

677
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:10,716
through it. Yeah, just enough people who

678
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:13,996
are listening in the discussion will

679
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:16,636
look at some questions, so please feel

680
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:17,950
free to write anything.

681
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,610
It personally, I'm curious whether the

682
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,756
awareness is going to be the light of

683
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:34,084
the sun, the heat of the sun, the

684
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:37,620
ejection, the loop structure,

685
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,070
the birth and death of the star.

686
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,546
Yeah. If the

687
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:49,418
idea that you'll see here stands, then

688
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:51,686
you've got the idea that a closed

689
00:28:51,718 --> 00:28:53,766
topological pocket of electromagnetic

690
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,994
field, that's where awareness can take

691
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:57,722
place. That's where a first person

692
00:28:57,776 --> 00:28:59,238
perspective, a kind of a locus, can

693
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,806
exist. But what it's aware of? Well,

694
00:29:01,828 --> 00:29:03,486
that's an entirely different question.

695
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:06,160
And if there are pockets like that,

696
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,398
we're not asserting in this paper that

697
00:29:08,404 --> 00:29:10,006
the sun has these it's such a complex

698
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:12,706
entity. It's very possible, but that is

699
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,706
a different but if to the extent they

700
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:16,626
are there, what on Earth would be

701
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:19,586
experienced within it? That's a

702
00:29:19,608 --> 00:29:23,960
different thing. The content problem,

703
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,462
it's not just for YouTubers, it's also

704
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,822
for conscious systems. But yeah,

705
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:34,406
you've bound it all together, you've

706
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:39,002
delimited a boundary topologically and

707
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:42,060
then about what? And so what?

708
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:43,980
Yeah,

709
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,334
let me pick up a bit while we're while

710
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:49,760
we're waiting for him to come in.

711
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,046
And there's really growing kind of

712
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:58,350
neuroscience and biological evidence for

713
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,538
downward causation from electromagnetic

714
00:30:00,554 --> 00:30:02,286
fields in the brain. And all we really

715
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:04,546
do in this paper is acknowledge that

716
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:06,434
research literature exists and say, and

717
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,018
therefore, it's possible for fields to

718
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:09,906
be non epipenomenal. We don't get into

719
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:11,506
the specifics of it, but they've been

720
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:13,366
shown in memory formation. They've been

721
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:15,174
shown in the olfactory bulb for your

722
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:17,046
smells. They've appeared all over the

723
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:20,150
place. Andres, you're back.

724
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,026
Just making the case for non

725
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:25,786
epiphenomenal fields in the brain. Oh,

726
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:27,594
fantastic. Beautiful. Yeah. Sorry about

727
00:30:27,632 --> 00:30:29,034
that. Hopefully, it doesn't happen

728
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:31,210
again. Okay. Next slide.

729
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,742
Yeah. And think about

730
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:39,118
the immense causal power that a

731
00:30:39,124 --> 00:30:41,790
topological change in the field has in

732
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,882
cosmological terms, like these billions

733
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:48,094
of tons of plasma being ejected just

734
00:30:48,132 --> 00:30:52,106
because of otherwise epiphenomenal

735
00:30:52,138 --> 00:30:53,630
magnetic reconnection. It's like, no,

736
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,802
actually, topological transformations

737
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:59,054
are really significant at a massive,

738
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:01,330
massive scale. Next slide?

739
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,016
Yeah. Next one. Just showing

740
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:10,756
kind of how ridiculously powerful this

741
00:31:10,778 --> 00:31:14,624
can be. Yeah. And importantly,

742
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:18,480
too, the actual fact that

743
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,884
you get an enclosure with a topological

744
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:23,784
transformation in a medium also gives

745
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:25,704
you this capacity to essentially have

746
00:31:25,822 --> 00:31:28,616
holistic behavior. This is one of the

747
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:29,884
things that, to me, was kind of the most

748
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,870
exciting about this explanation space.

749
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,660
The moment you can close field lines or

750
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,164
do a top formation, waves will be

751
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:41,536
confined. Some kinds of waves can be

752
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:44,044
confined within a topological pocket.

753
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:46,556
When you have confinement of waves,

754
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:49,376
then you have resonant modes. And when

755
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:51,264
you have resonant modes, then you have

756
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:54,644
this very fantastic effect where the

757
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:57,780
whole shape of an object essentially is

758
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,276
expressed in the way every part of the

759
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:02,260
object is vibrating,

760
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,016
in which case, essentially, you have

761
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:09,720
this reason why evolution would recruit

762
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,696
these topological objects is because it

763
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:15,416
actually allows organisms to behave as a

764
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:17,528
unit. So I think, yeah, that might be a

765
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:19,640
very key piece of the puzzle for

766
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,876
epiphenomenalism. Next slide. These are

767
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:26,636
just kind of like some sketches of some

768
00:32:26,658 --> 00:32:28,508
of the kinds of boundaries that, in

769
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,316
principle, you may have in the

770
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:33,010
electromagnetic field and what kind of

771
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,296
binding in consciousness they might

772
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:38,608
correspond to. But you don't have to

773
00:32:38,694 --> 00:32:40,364
just speculate. The really exciting

774
00:32:40,412 --> 00:32:42,352
thing here is that you can actually play

775
00:32:42,406 --> 00:32:44,508
with simulations of the electromagnetic

776
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:46,340
field to try to make sense of the

777
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,340
topological transformations that happen

778
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,316
in it. So the next following slides we

779
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:53,670
can just go through them fairly quickly

780
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,344
are essentially resonant modes of an

781
00:32:56,382 --> 00:32:58,724
empty cavity, electromagnetic resonance

782
00:32:58,772 --> 00:33:01,736
modes of an empty cube cavity, where the

783
00:33:01,758 --> 00:33:04,216
left side is the electric field and the

784
00:33:04,238 --> 00:33:06,330
right side is the magnetic field.

785
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,428
The website where you can check this is

786
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:13,740
called Falstad.com EMBOX.

787
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,780
And the thing that it kind of really

788
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,628
neatly shows is how the magnetic field

789
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:22,604
sometimes get this closed looping

790
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:24,576
structure. Next slide. Yeah, just go

791
00:33:24,598 --> 00:33:27,056
through them, maybe like 5 seconds for

792
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:30,624
each of them. And it

793
00:33:30,662 --> 00:33:33,484
also allows you to essentially look at

794
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,348
what happens when you stack some of

795
00:33:35,354 --> 00:33:37,332
these resonant modes. And some

796
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:39,748
combinations, linear combinations of

797
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:42,420
these resonant modes create intricate

798
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,176
eddings and loops and twists that. Loop

799
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,876
around and create this topological

800
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:52,264
boundary very fleeting. It has to do

801
00:33:52,302 --> 00:33:54,888
with the frequency of oscillation of the

802
00:33:54,894 --> 00:33:56,456
electric field, how many times per

803
00:33:56,478 --> 00:33:57,796
second you're going to get this looping

804
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,736
structure. But the fact that yeah, you

805
00:33:59,758 --> 00:34:01,512
can show there's some topologically

806
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:03,996
closed objects that appear there is

807
00:34:04,098 --> 00:34:06,684
quite remarkable. And overall, the idea

808
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:09,276
here would be that well, something like

809
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,888
this is happening in the brain and the

810
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:12,560
brain is actually recruiting these

811
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,428
looping architectures. All right, I'll

812
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:15,680
hand it over to Chris.

813
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,144
Thank you very much. Yes, we've seen

814
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:23,232
that electromagnetic fields can form

815
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:25,596
closed loops and people have used that,

816
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:27,204
some of the sites in the paper around

817
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:30,516
people trapping knots of light. And it

818
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,372
just kind of really remarkable things

819
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:35,684
happening at the edge of sort of room

820
00:34:35,722 --> 00:34:37,144
temperature state physics. Really

821
00:34:37,182 --> 00:34:40,456
incredible stuff. We know that in

822
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,776
principle, these fields are capable of

823
00:34:42,798 --> 00:34:45,668
downward causation in massive contexts

824
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,112
like the sun, but also in very real

825
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,492
human brain settings. So conceptually,

826
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,112
and we know that topologies in general

827
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,884
are framing variants. So we've got those

828
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:55,496
things in place, we've got boundaries

829
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:57,516
that satisfy those various features that

830
00:34:57,538 --> 00:34:59,436
we wanted. We don't know exactly how

831
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,496
they occur in the human brain. All we're

832
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:03,376
presenting is a conceptual solution that

833
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:05,968
those things are possible. But what we

834
00:35:05,974 --> 00:35:08,256
do say is, well, what would such a

835
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:10,290
solution look like to those five

836
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,420
boundary problems that we just

837
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,030
described? So taking them one by one,

838
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,988
or rather yeah, taking them as a group.

839
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:23,540
Let's first say what in such a theory,

840
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,876
the first person perspective, that kind

841
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:28,948
of phenomenal awareness, the what it's

842
00:35:28,964 --> 00:35:31,544
likeness that we experience in a very

843
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:34,808
normal everyday sense, what could that

844
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:37,736
reflect, what could that correspond to

845
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:39,272
in such a model? And there are others,

846
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:40,868
but we'll give one example and use that

847
00:35:40,894 --> 00:35:42,876
to walk through the problems. So we

848
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:46,104
would say that once you've got a closed

849
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:48,764
topology and it may well require the

850
00:35:48,802 --> 00:35:50,632
time dimension for it to be properly

851
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:53,070
ontologically closed and at that point

852
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,928
em energy of that specific spectra, the

853
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:58,416
same spectra that's making up the

854
00:35:58,438 --> 00:36:00,640
boundary can't pass through it or not.

855
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,156
That's the whole point about the closed

856
00:36:02,188 --> 00:36:03,856
loop. Other things might pass through

857
00:36:03,878 --> 00:36:05,920
it, sound wave might pass through it.

858
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,036
But nonetheless, for the entities that

859
00:36:08,058 --> 00:36:10,324
we're interested in, it is closed to

860
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:12,804
itself. And that's where we can get this

861
00:36:12,842 --> 00:36:15,188
hard boundary. There may be lots of

862
00:36:15,194 --> 00:36:16,388
these being created in the brain. The

863
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:18,104
brain is absolutely chock a block with

864
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,200
different bits of em generating

865
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,064
underlying phenomena. So it's certainly

866
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:26,596
plausible that some of them are closed.

867
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:28,584
We don't know. For this to be true,

868
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:30,328
there must be at least one. But it's

869
00:36:30,344 --> 00:36:31,448
plausible that if there's one, there's

870
00:36:31,464 --> 00:36:33,976
probably several. So you've got several

871
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:36,776
of these. By definition they are non

872
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:39,384
overlapping, the boundaries cannot

873
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:41,576
overlap, but they could well be multiple

874
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:42,840
at the same time. One at the front, one

875
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,530
at the back could be all over the place.

876
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,596
It's probable though, that only a subset

877
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:49,376
would be continually recreated in a

878
00:36:49,398 --> 00:36:52,464
stable manner because the fact that

879
00:36:52,662 --> 00:36:53,964
these fields can have downward

880
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,812
causation, they can do useful things.

881
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:58,500
Some of the sites in the paper about

882
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,628
information processing point to some of

883
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:02,624
the nonlinearities you can achieve

884
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:04,816
through wave and field based resonant,

885
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,104
mode based computations which may well

886
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,920
have benefits from an information

887
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,172
processing perspective. So in some cases

888
00:37:13,236 --> 00:37:15,320
these will be continually recreated.

889
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,448
Only one of them, because they cannot

890
00:37:18,484 --> 00:37:22,440
overlap, only one of them can enclose,

891
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,604
let's call it an immediate memory model

892
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:27,084
as a conceptual point, not committing to

893
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:28,750
what exactly that might mean.

894
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,216
We suspect these wouldn't last very long

895
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,216
and they probably don't extend over the

896
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:38,124
whole brain, but who knows? Regardless,

897
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,108
it would vary from period to period.

898
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:41,776
Other field theories might have other

899
00:37:41,798 --> 00:37:44,704
ways of recruiting this concept for

900
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:46,076
solving the boundary problem, but let's

901
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:47,876
walk this one through and see what it

902
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,524
looks like as a response to those five

903
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:52,164
things. So what we're saying is this

904
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:54,996
closed topological pocket that is kind

905
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:56,964
of axiomatically the same as a first

906
00:37:57,002 --> 00:37:58,840
person awareness. When you've got that,

907
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,816
you've got something that is capable of

908
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:04,228
both binding together those micro bits

909
00:38:04,244 --> 00:38:06,184
of experience and presenting them within

910
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:08,820
a boundary so they have some unified

911
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,016
ontology. So one

912
00:38:13,038 --> 00:38:14,684
by one, and I think this is our last

913
00:38:14,722 --> 00:38:17,436
slide, the hard boundary, well, that

914
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:18,396
comes from what we've been talking

915
00:38:18,418 --> 00:38:20,216
about. Energy of the same spectra can't

916
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:22,812
pass through the closed loop. So that

917
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:25,056
happens quite naturally, a bit like with

918
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:27,536
the field solution to binding. This is

919
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,408
something you almost get for free as a

920
00:38:29,414 --> 00:38:32,656
result of using that lower levels and

921
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:36,560
higher levels well, because only

922
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,888
one of them, because of the non

923
00:38:37,904 --> 00:38:39,428
overlapping point, because only one of

924
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:41,056
them can include the immediate memory

925
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,852
model, which is crucial for the next

926
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:46,128
bit, then you can't have lower levels

927
00:38:46,144 --> 00:38:47,844
and higher levels. There may well be

928
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:49,896
mind dust at those levels which is this

929
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:51,736
kind of lovely evocative concept. There

930
00:38:51,758 --> 00:38:54,536
may well be flashes of tiny bits of

931
00:38:54,558 --> 00:38:57,364
awareness that kind of they never repeat

932
00:38:57,412 --> 00:38:58,628
the patterns just gone for it. There's

933
00:38:58,644 --> 00:39:00,324
nothing that links it into future

934
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:03,356
versions of itself, just gone. The

935
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:04,796
universe may be replete with these

936
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:06,284
things. It's certainly got plenty of

937
00:39:06,322 --> 00:39:07,916
electrons in it. Why not plenty of these

938
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:11,872
things? Who knows? But there's only one

939
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:15,056
closed pocket that maybe I'll come back

940
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:17,436
to four that can enclose this immediate

941
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:20,352
memory module. That's crucial because

942
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:22,876
it's what creates a temporal boundary

943
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:25,088
that in any possible sense could reflect

944
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,884
what we experience day to day. Because

945
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:30,276
these tiny if you

946
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:34,000
think of these 4D pockets,

947
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,416
if one pocket were to last long enough

948
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,944
to encompass, say, a whole day's worth

949
00:39:37,982 --> 00:39:39,592
of your experience, it's almost

950
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:43,048
impossible for it to vary enough without

951
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:45,928
breaking to actually contain all the

952
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:48,632
types of complex phenomena we experience

953
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,248
during the day. Which is why we think

954
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,788
it's much more likely they persist for a

955
00:39:51,794 --> 00:39:53,544
short period of time, but nonetheless,

956
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,244
our experiences of things persisting for

957
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:58,012
longer. Now, the micro level

958
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,524
persistence, why is it nonzero? Because

959
00:40:00,562 --> 00:40:04,270
if something is infinitesimally small,

960
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,496
it probably doesn't help us. If

961
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:07,408
something is the equivalent of a

962
00:40:07,414 --> 00:40:09,648
geometric point, no matter how many of

963
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:11,564
them you put together in a physical

964
00:40:11,612 --> 00:40:12,656
setting, you're not going to create a

965
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:14,940
line. We want some non zero duration.

966
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,464
Well, we've got that for free because

967
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:18,516
the closed pocket has this 4D

968
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:20,756
ontological presence. That's fine. How

969
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:23,124
would you get but it may be really

970
00:40:23,242 --> 00:40:25,268
short, far shorter than we experience

971
00:40:25,434 --> 00:40:28,136
even this sentence. So what ties that

972
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:31,432
together? Well, because it encloses each

973
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:32,856
millisecond to millisecond, it

974
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:35,416
recreates. Each one is a different piece

975
00:40:35,438 --> 00:40:37,848
of awareness. They are not in any way

976
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:39,784
ontologically linked to each other,

977
00:40:39,822 --> 00:40:42,044
they are each separate. But because each

978
00:40:42,082 --> 00:40:44,108
one encloses the memory module, which is

979
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:45,516
just an information processing thing,

980
00:40:45,538 --> 00:40:47,404
you can encode memory and pen and paper.

981
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:49,324
There's nothing magical about this. By

982
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:51,804
referencing it, it knows what was just

983
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:55,756
there before, and that can create we

984
00:40:55,778 --> 00:40:56,976
could call it an illusion if you want.

985
00:40:56,998 --> 00:40:58,576
Whether that matters is a much more

986
00:40:58,598 --> 00:41:00,304
philosophical point. But you create this

987
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:02,044
pseudo time arrow, you have unified

988
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,856
insight, because that's what fields do.

989
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,176
They unify the insight in all the things

990
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:08,848
that make it up. No information is lost.

991
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:12,256
It is all bound together. So now you've

992
00:41:12,288 --> 00:41:13,876
got the recent past and then you've got

993
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:15,056
the bit before that from the previous

994
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:16,308
pocket, and the bit before that and the

995
00:41:16,314 --> 00:41:18,790
bit before that. So it's all bound into

996
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,456
each individual present. As short as

997
00:41:22,478 --> 00:41:24,116
it may be, it has the sense that it's

998
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,328
something bigger. Now, in terms of the

999
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:28,312
macro level, days, years between

1000
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:32,180
interruptions, this is one where we are

1001
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,636
far more philosophically relaxed. It may

1002
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,708
well be that there is no kind of

1003
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:39,756
profound sense in which these things are

1004
00:41:39,778 --> 00:41:41,948
the same entity. It's maybe a ship of

1005
00:41:41,954 --> 00:41:44,396
theseus type concept, and it's all

1006
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,176
linked together by some fairly weak long

1007
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:48,144
term memory. And are we really the same

1008
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:50,224
person as we were a week ago, a year

1009
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:52,444
ago? We're far less philosophically

1010
00:41:52,492 --> 00:41:54,256
concerned about that than we are by the

1011
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,876
micro level and the meter level. But

1012
00:41:55,898 --> 00:41:58,324
either way, the solutions are the

1013
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:00,240
classic personal identity solutions,

1014
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,484
which have been gone over plenty of

1015
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:05,524
times. If you'll give us another five

1016
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:07,448
minutes before questions, we'd love to

1017
00:42:07,454 --> 00:42:08,804
share some more kind of speculative

1018
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:11,832
thoughts with you. Getting a thumbs up.

1019
00:42:11,886 --> 00:42:14,452
Wonderful. In which case, over to Andres

1020
00:42:14,596 --> 00:42:16,680
for some fun, thought provoking stuff.

1021
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,004
Well, awesome. Yeah, I mean,

1022
00:42:20,062 --> 00:42:21,816
it's just kind of like this deeper

1023
00:42:21,848 --> 00:42:24,988
question. And don't wait for me if my

1024
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:27,948
internet runs out for a second. But

1025
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:30,904
essentially, how does this influence,

1026
00:42:30,952 --> 00:42:32,960
for example, beliefs of personal

1027
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,352
identity? Next slide. I think once

1028
00:42:36,406 --> 00:42:39,472
you start seeing the universe as a field

1029
00:42:39,606 --> 00:42:41,724
and with maybe like fleeting topological

1030
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:43,792
pockets on it, that actually very

1031
00:42:43,846 --> 00:42:46,348
significantly informs these classic

1032
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:48,724
questions in philosophy like who are

1033
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:50,756
you? And do you continue to exist from

1034
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:52,516
one moment to the other and indeed the

1035
00:42:52,538 --> 00:42:54,564
other sheep of the sea's? Is there any

1036
00:42:54,602 --> 00:42:57,656
kind of metaphysical endearing ego, so

1037
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,944
to speak? And I actually think that each

1038
00:42:59,982 --> 00:43:02,740
of these views of personal identity

1039
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,072
could actually be reinterpreted in terms

1040
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:09,080
of claims about the field and field

1041
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,876
topology. So something like closed

1042
00:43:11,908 --> 00:43:13,596
individualism. This is the belief that

1043
00:43:13,618 --> 00:43:14,744
you start existing when you're born,

1044
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,796
stop existing when you die, or maybe you

1045
00:43:16,818 --> 00:43:18,316
go to heaven. But the point is that

1046
00:43:18,338 --> 00:43:20,984
you're kind of a separate self that

1047
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:22,704
endures over time that is different than

1048
00:43:22,742 --> 00:43:26,688
other selves. Here we would want to

1049
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:30,288
find some kind of enduring sheath or

1050
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,424
enduring nested architecture that even

1051
00:43:33,462 --> 00:43:35,232
though maybe each moment of awareness

1052
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:37,184
might be its own topological pocket,

1053
00:43:37,232 --> 00:43:39,860
maybe there's some kind of higher order

1054
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,916
topological unity that does carry over a

1055
00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:45,364
person's lifetime. That would be a

1056
00:43:45,402 --> 00:43:48,420
possible way of raifying in an actual

1057
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,096
significant physical way the sense of

1058
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:52,936
identity over time. Of course,

1059
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:54,888
completely speculative. It would be a

1060
00:43:54,894 --> 00:43:56,088
matter of actually finding it in the

1061
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:57,608
field. But that's how you could, I

1062
00:43:57,614 --> 00:43:59,644
think, Steel men this notion. Next

1063
00:43:59,682 --> 00:44:03,720
slide, then probably the most compatible

1064
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,836
and easy to justify view here would be

1065
00:44:05,858 --> 00:44:08,332
empty individualism, that every moment

1066
00:44:08,386 --> 00:44:09,832
of experience is ontologically

1067
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:12,520
different. And again here that would be

1068
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,048
possible because we would have these

1069
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:16,736
fleeting hard boundaries in the

1070
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:19,056
spacetime continuum. And as a

1071
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:21,212
consequence, you can look at the block

1072
00:44:21,276 --> 00:44:23,360
universe and say, okay, there's a 40

1073
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,124
pocket there, there's a 40 pocket over

1074
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,056
there. And wherever you see a 40 pocket,

1075
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:28,804
that is going to be a subject of

1076
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:32,032
experience. And any actual continuity

1077
00:44:32,096 --> 00:44:35,620
between moments of experience are either

1078
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,844
just causal or kind of illusory

1079
00:44:37,892 --> 00:44:39,944
constructed with the memory module, as

1080
00:44:39,982 --> 00:44:42,184
Chris was suggesting. And then next

1081
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:45,384
slide and then finally open

1082
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:47,256
individualism, there's this view that we

1083
00:44:47,278 --> 00:44:49,784
are all one consciousness. We're all

1084
00:44:49,902 --> 00:44:52,236
Krishna at the bottom layer, so to

1085
00:44:52,258 --> 00:44:54,072
speak. Well, the way we could justify

1086
00:44:54,136 --> 00:44:56,716
this within the topological account is

1087
00:44:56,738 --> 00:44:59,256
that, well, actually at the deepest

1088
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:01,776
ontological level, we're all the field,

1089
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:04,512
which just happened to be on a given

1090
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:07,552
point in time segmentation of that field

1091
00:45:07,606 --> 00:45:09,868
that prevents information propagation

1092
00:45:09,964 --> 00:45:12,544
with other regions of the field. So in

1093
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:15,244
this case, kind of the topological

1094
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:16,964
segmentation would actually be more of

1095
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:19,716
an epistemological boundary than it

1096
00:45:19,738 --> 00:45:21,104
would actually be an ontological

1097
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:22,704
boundary. It's like the idea that deep

1098
00:45:22,752 --> 00:45:24,848
down actually we are the field. It's

1099
00:45:24,864 --> 00:45:27,572
just that how the field knows itself is

1100
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:29,944
constrained by its topology in which

1101
00:45:29,982 --> 00:45:31,544
case, yeah, it's another way of still

1102
00:45:31,582 --> 00:45:34,536
meaning we're all one consciousness in a

1103
00:45:34,558 --> 00:45:36,392
very physically grounded way. And,

1104
00:45:36,446 --> 00:45:38,344
yeah, I think that's it. Unless I put

1105
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:39,916
anything else in the next slide oh,

1106
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:41,676
yeah, just the last kind of like

1107
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:44,204
speculation here is, well, okay, if you

1108
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,404
are this topological pocket in the field

1109
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:50,684
electromagnetic field, how can

1110
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:52,896
you in a sense, take a look at that

1111
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:54,848
pocket and then reconstruct what the

1112
00:45:54,854 --> 00:45:58,364
experience feels like. And here perhaps

1113
00:45:58,412 --> 00:46:00,928
like a fun thought experiment that you

1114
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:04,148
could make is thinking about what it

1115
00:46:04,154 --> 00:46:07,472
would be like to be a photon trapped

1116
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:10,576
kind of within a hall of mirrors.

1117
00:46:10,688 --> 00:46:14,868
There's this article I wrote, 2018 about

1118
00:46:15,034 --> 00:46:17,400
how to replicate a hyperbolic space

1119
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:21,130
using just double mirrors and

1120
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,628
gradient index optics. And essentially

1121
00:46:24,724 --> 00:46:27,336
within that structure that has those

1122
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:29,736
properties, a photon would have no way

1123
00:46:29,758 --> 00:46:31,596
of telling the fact that it is not in

1124
00:46:31,618 --> 00:46:34,444
hyperbolic space. In other words, the

1125
00:46:34,482 --> 00:46:37,564
index of refraction of a container would

1126
00:46:37,602 --> 00:46:40,188
present itself as the actual geometry of

1127
00:46:40,194 --> 00:46:43,084
the space from within. So in our brain,

1128
00:46:43,132 --> 00:46:46,288
presumably, the actual way in which the

1129
00:46:46,294 --> 00:46:47,676
local field potentials are stitched

1130
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:49,216
together and the relative index of

1131
00:46:49,238 --> 00:46:51,596
refraction could potentially give rise

1132
00:46:51,628 --> 00:46:55,004
to really arbitrary possible internal

1133
00:46:55,052 --> 00:46:56,736
geometrics. Where there's the illusion

1134
00:46:56,768 --> 00:46:58,516
that you're in a space, whether it's in

1135
00:46:58,538 --> 00:47:00,244
hyperbolic space, in spherical space,

1136
00:47:00,282 --> 00:47:02,436
some irregular geometry, all of those

1137
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:05,296
could be emulated with this paradigm.

1138
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:07,876
And that may go a little bit a long way

1139
00:47:07,898 --> 00:47:09,176
in actually explaining some of the most

1140
00:47:09,198 --> 00:47:11,752
exotic experiences that people can have,

1141
00:47:11,886 --> 00:47:14,216
which usually would challenge kind of

1142
00:47:14,238 --> 00:47:16,276
theories of consciousness. Here there's

1143
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:18,956
a way of stitching them together to

1144
00:47:18,978 --> 00:47:20,492
explain them. And I think yeah, the last

1145
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,636
slide, I believe. Yeah. So this

1146
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:27,116
is just illustrating that point, I think

1147
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:31,068
this is it. And we

1148
00:47:31,074 --> 00:47:32,496
can leave this up on the screen. This is

1149
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:33,824
just where we would go next with it.

1150
00:47:33,862 --> 00:47:35,392
But this seems like a good point to stop

1151
00:47:35,446 --> 00:47:37,520
and hear your thoughts.

1152
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,240
Awesome. Great presentations.

1153
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,308
Well, Bernie, would you like to give

1154
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:48,196
first reflection and I'll write down

1155
00:47:48,218 --> 00:47:49,524
some questions and look in the live

1156
00:47:49,562 --> 00:47:51,990
chat? Yeah, sure.

1157
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,200
I've been thinking a lot about similar

1158
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:01,816
stuff like this recently, and the

1159
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,356
paper presents how the functional

1160
00:48:04,388 --> 00:48:06,376
theories have the problem of

1161
00:48:06,398 --> 00:48:09,676
arbitrariness. So, for example, with

1162
00:48:09,698 --> 00:48:11,788
Markov blanket Markov blankets, that

1163
00:48:11,794 --> 00:48:14,648
could be the case when there's Markov

1164
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:17,676
blankets as ontological observers. And I

1165
00:48:17,698 --> 00:48:21,144
was thinking that maybe unifying

1166
00:48:21,272 --> 00:48:23,564
this with the Marko blanket paradigm is

1167
00:48:23,602 --> 00:48:25,936
that the mark of blanket that on the

1168
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:29,904
physical level is implemented using

1169
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:32,780
this topological pocket is the conscious

1170
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,104
mark of blackend. So it's how you were

1171
00:48:35,142 --> 00:48:37,116
referring the mark of black and solves

1172
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:39,730
the content problem, while the

1173
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,864
topological boundary solves all the

1174
00:48:42,902 --> 00:48:45,520
other problems. Like objective.

1175
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,410
Maybe.

1176
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,956
Yeah, no, that's something very quick to

1177
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,536
mention. Obviously, we're in the active

1178
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:02,876
inference institute podcast. I mean,

1179
00:49:02,978 --> 00:49:05,310
absolutely. One thing to mention is that

1180
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,028
our perspective is not in itself

1181
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:12,440
necessary or is not necessary and

1182
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,224
sufficient actually to satisfy the code

1183
00:49:16,262 --> 00:49:19,090
that we have specified. However,

1184
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,888
we actually think it's very likely that

1185
00:49:21,974 --> 00:49:23,296
topological pockets in the

1186
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:26,016
electromagnetic field do behave as mark

1187
00:49:26,038 --> 00:49:28,996
of blankets. And so it is a way in which

1188
00:49:29,018 --> 00:49:30,740
you can actually interface these

1189
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,604
different paradigms where we would be

1190
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:36,230
saying that at the implementation level

1191
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,696
can then realize the minimization of

1192
00:49:40,718 --> 00:49:43,320
free energy at the algorithmic level.

1193
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,232
However, we would be saying, and maybe

1194
00:49:46,286 --> 00:49:48,484
this would be a little bit of a twist or

1195
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:51,356
a nontrivial implication, that if you

1196
00:49:51,378 --> 00:49:54,536
were to simulate a hierarchically

1197
00:49:54,648 --> 00:49:56,796
structured mark of blanket system in a

1198
00:49:56,818 --> 00:49:59,708
computer, it could very well be from a

1199
00:49:59,714 --> 00:50:01,196
certain abstraction, be minimizing free

1200
00:50:01,218 --> 00:50:04,376
energy, but it wouldn't be able to solve

1201
00:50:04,408 --> 00:50:06,080
the boundary problem. In other words,

1202
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,536
it is sort of like there is a

1203
00:50:07,558 --> 00:50:10,512
significant overlap, but there are some

1204
00:50:10,566 --> 00:50:12,096
slight places of a divergence where you

1205
00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:13,888
might say, hey, a market blanket is

1206
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,296
actually not enough because it doesn't

1207
00:50:15,328 --> 00:50:17,668
give you the implementation level

1208
00:50:17,754 --> 00:50:20,020
explanation for how you get boundaries.

1209
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,350
Chris, if you want to add anything.

1210
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,136
Yeah, I mean, just to agree with that,

1211
00:50:26,158 --> 00:50:29,844
I think this is if you go back to Mars,

1212
00:50:29,972 --> 00:50:32,490
three levels around kind of what

1213
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,824
substrate we

1214
00:50:36,862 --> 00:50:39,304
haven't discussed anything here about

1215
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:41,260
the algorithms that are actually taking

1216
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,376
place on or kind of within the brain

1217
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,088
that would ultimately get incorporated

1218
00:50:46,184 --> 00:50:48,764
into the Em field. Clearly you need that

1219
00:50:48,802 --> 00:50:51,196
stuff as well. None of this makes any

1220
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,944
contribution to solving these more

1221
00:50:52,982 --> 00:50:55,264
content problems of consciousness or how

1222
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,904
we make inferences about the world, how

1223
00:50:57,942 --> 00:51:01,136
we respond to those. What it does say is

1224
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:04,256
that if there are algorithms that solve

1225
00:51:04,288 --> 00:51:05,556
those problems, and there are some good

1226
00:51:05,578 --> 00:51:08,100
candidates out there, including yours,

1227
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,160
they need to be implemented

1228
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,332
or they need to reflect back to a field

1229
00:51:15,466 --> 00:51:17,216
for it to become part of someone's

1230
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:19,708
unified macrophenomenological

1231
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,436
experience. If you did some sort of feed

1232
00:51:22,468 --> 00:51:24,984
forward in Silico version of this, or

1233
00:51:25,022 --> 00:51:27,096
you did it, you implemented the

1234
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:29,836
algorithm using rocks, just lots and

1235
00:51:29,858 --> 00:51:31,772
lots of rocks laid out forever like that

1236
00:51:31,826 --> 00:51:34,350
wonderful xkcd example,

1237
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,688
that is not going to create a bound

1238
00:51:37,864 --> 00:51:39,740
first person perspective anywhere.

1239
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,728
Well, a lot to say about that,

1240
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,384
certainly Markov blankets. And just to

1241
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:50,688
define it on a Bayesian graph, so the

1242
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:52,668
map not the territory. The Markov

1243
00:51:52,684 --> 00:51:55,892
blanket is the set of nodes upon which

1244
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,316
two other sets of nodes are

1245
00:51:57,338 --> 00:51:59,348
conditionally independent. And that's a

1246
00:51:59,354 --> 00:52:02,176
purely topological statement. It doesn't

1247
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:04,596
matter how far if there even is a

1248
00:52:04,618 --> 00:52:06,416
spatial association or temporal

1249
00:52:06,448 --> 00:52:09,256
association, it doesn't matter the

1250
00:52:09,278 --> 00:52:11,140
distance, which is to say the geometry,

1251
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,676
but rather the blanket is a purely

1252
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:15,592
topological statement. And that's what,

1253
00:52:15,726 --> 00:52:17,348
among other things, we've been exploring

1254
00:52:17,364 --> 00:52:19,564
with Chris Fields in the physics as

1255
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:21,772
information processing and this question

1256
00:52:21,826 --> 00:52:24,444
about the topology of communication for

1257
00:52:24,482 --> 00:52:27,772
bounded observers, and as we kind of

1258
00:52:27,826 --> 00:52:30,030
alluded to with that content problem,

1259
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,696
the topology of communication is,

1260
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:35,388
to use a geometric metaphor, it's

1261
00:52:35,404 --> 00:52:38,976
orthogonal to the content. You could

1262
00:52:38,998 --> 00:52:40,924
have two people on the phone sharing

1263
00:52:40,972 --> 00:52:42,912
different things. You could have a video

1264
00:52:42,966 --> 00:52:45,780
file with different contents. And so

1265
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:49,044
there's really a lot of layers that come

1266
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,684
into play. And so, I think, from an

1267
00:52:51,722 --> 00:52:55,508
instrumentalist view, I read your paper

1268
00:52:55,594 --> 00:52:57,736
as a call for the introduction of

1269
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:00,436
topology into what is often only modeled

1270
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,556
as geometric. A call for the integration

1271
00:53:03,668 --> 00:53:06,552
of electromagnetism rather than a

1272
00:53:06,606 --> 00:53:08,892
reliance on one or the other. Of course,

1273
00:53:08,946 --> 00:53:10,636
as introduced from the outset, a

1274
00:53:10,658 --> 00:53:13,948
pluralism these are not exhaustive nor

1275
00:53:14,034 --> 00:53:17,596
exclusive accounts, and we don't know

1276
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,804
what the scope of the possible

1277
00:53:20,002 --> 00:53:22,400
intelligences and awarenesses are.

1278
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,744
So from a research perspective, if not

1279
00:53:25,782 --> 00:53:28,960
beyond, why would we want to limit when

1280
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:31,632
we're not only interested in

1281
00:53:31,686 --> 00:53:34,068
understanding the properties of any

1282
00:53:34,234 --> 00:53:36,710
given system as we see it today?

1283
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,916
Any thoughts where I can read a question

1284
00:53:40,938 --> 00:53:44,356
in the Chat? Oh,

1285
00:53:44,378 --> 00:53:48,276
that sounds great. Turnkey Tyranny

1286
00:53:48,388 --> 00:53:51,704
writes, how does topology show up

1287
00:53:51,822 --> 00:53:53,240
phenomenologically?

1288
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,234
Yeah, this is an excellent, excellent

1289
00:54:00,282 --> 00:54:02,458
question. I'm happy to take it. Andrews

1290
00:54:02,474 --> 00:54:04,050
do you want to go back to your notes?

1291
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,500
We've got that page of notes in there.

1292
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,580
Sure, let's do that.

1293
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,442
Because I've asked a very similar

1294
00:54:11,496 --> 00:54:13,502
question of Andres, and these sort of

1295
00:54:13,576 --> 00:54:16,338
notes is what resulted in his attempts

1296
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:19,080
to explain it to me. Let me take yes,

1297
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:24,102
this is very speculative, but one

1298
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:26,438
wonderful resource, I think, hopefully I

1299
00:54:26,444 --> 00:54:28,762
think is wonderful, very worth trying

1300
00:54:28,816 --> 00:54:32,026
out is we made a series of

1301
00:54:32,048 --> 00:54:35,910
guided meditations about phenomenology.

1302
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,178
It's not really kind of like for the

1303
00:54:37,184 --> 00:54:38,470
sake of spirituality. It's more for the

1304
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,414
sake of exploring phenomenology with

1305
00:54:40,452 --> 00:54:43,374
meditation. The last one is called the

1306
00:54:43,412 --> 00:54:46,174
phenomenology of ontology. And that one

1307
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:49,120
helps you, in a sense, get a sense of

1308
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:51,970
how beliefs about the narrative reality

1309
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,260
reality, of course,

1310
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,266
different to believe that

1311
00:54:59,448 --> 00:55:01,186
electromagnetic field or you're an

1312
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:05,826
electromagnetic feels or

1313
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:09,574
in a specific version of materialism or

1314
00:55:09,612 --> 00:55:11,478
something like that. So very different

1315
00:55:11,564 --> 00:55:13,046
ontologies can give rise to very

1316
00:55:13,068 --> 00:55:15,298
different feelings. And so there's

1317
00:55:15,314 --> 00:55:17,010
definitely the worry that, well, if you

1318
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,406
think a lot about the electromagnetic

1319
00:55:18,438 --> 00:55:19,802
field, aren't you maybe just

1320
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:22,314
interpreting your sensations within that

1321
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,246
paradigm, but it's kind of like you're

1322
00:55:24,278 --> 00:55:28,426
overfeeding on top of it. But in

1323
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:30,302
a sense, I would argue that actually

1324
00:55:30,356 --> 00:55:32,430
it's the other way around. With

1325
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,886
something as generic and structured as

1326
00:55:35,908 --> 00:55:37,326
electromagnetic field, you can, I think,

1327
00:55:37,348 --> 00:55:40,186
in principle, explain the phenomenology

1328
00:55:40,218 --> 00:55:43,134
of any ontology. Like, why does it feel

1329
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:47,182
like, for example, that you can

1330
00:55:47,316 --> 00:55:49,586
kind of merge with the cosmos or

1331
00:55:49,608 --> 00:55:50,866
something like that? Why does it feel

1332
00:55:50,888 --> 00:55:52,562
like you can become one with everything

1333
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:54,386
in meditation, let's say in various

1334
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:56,774
meditation states? Well, with something

1335
00:55:56,812 --> 00:56:00,406
like the topological explanation for the

1336
00:56:00,428 --> 00:56:02,326
boundary problem, the way we might

1337
00:56:02,348 --> 00:56:04,934
interpret that is as the vanishing of

1338
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:07,562
internal boundaries. And so there is a

1339
00:56:07,616 --> 00:56:09,606
significant difference between a global

1340
00:56:09,638 --> 00:56:11,370
boundary, which is what we focused on,

1341
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,294
the overall kind of the macroscopic

1342
00:56:14,342 --> 00:56:16,474
division that says whether you're inside

1343
00:56:16,512 --> 00:56:18,474
or outside your experience. But

1344
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:20,142
something that the electromagnetic field

1345
00:56:20,196 --> 00:56:22,846
also affords and gives us as kind of

1346
00:56:22,868 --> 00:56:24,654
part of its rich structure is the

1347
00:56:24,692 --> 00:56:26,734
possibility of internal boundaries as

1348
00:56:26,772 --> 00:56:33,154
well, which would be not boundaries that

1349
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:36,130
wrap around a 4D object, but rather

1350
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,002
lower dimensional boundaries like

1351
00:56:38,056 --> 00:56:40,338
meeting points or convergence points of

1352
00:56:40,344 --> 00:56:42,626
the field lines within the pocket. And

1353
00:56:42,648 --> 00:56:45,606
so in this account, whenever you have

1354
00:56:45,788 --> 00:56:48,066
the sensation of solidity, the feeling

1355
00:56:48,098 --> 00:56:50,006
of, well, I am here, you're there, or

1356
00:56:50,028 --> 00:56:52,342
there's a boundary between us, that

1357
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:53,974
boundary would essentially be an

1358
00:56:54,012 --> 00:56:56,038
internal boundary, would be a region of

1359
00:56:56,044 --> 00:56:58,614
the field while the field lines converge

1360
00:56:58,662 --> 00:57:00,170
or they align,

1361
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:04,406
but it's only along a certain cross

1362
00:57:04,438 --> 00:57:06,794
section. Meaning that actually your

1363
00:57:06,832 --> 00:57:09,146
experience is still fully unified. You

1364
00:57:09,168 --> 00:57:11,390
can still go from one point to the other

1365
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,158
across a perceived barrier because

1366
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:15,934
they're still part of the whole

1367
00:57:15,972 --> 00:57:17,566
experience, they're still connected. In

1368
00:57:17,588 --> 00:57:19,022
other words, with this kind of data

1369
00:57:19,076 --> 00:57:22,062
structure, we can arrive at kind of like

1370
00:57:22,116 --> 00:57:24,786
a lot of phenomenological details and

1371
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,274
trying to explain them from that

1372
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:27,938
perspective. And I think it's going to

1373
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,170
be an enormous program in the long term

1374
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,566
involving physicists and mathematicians

1375
00:57:33,598 --> 00:57:35,638
and exotic states of consciousness to

1376
00:57:35,644 --> 00:57:37,362
say like, okay, that particular feature

1377
00:57:37,426 --> 00:57:39,766
of experience that happens on such and

1378
00:57:39,788 --> 00:57:42,566
such substance in such meditation state,

1379
00:57:42,748 --> 00:57:45,286
how does that map into the

1380
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:46,678
electromagnetic field? And I think we

1381
00:57:46,684 --> 00:57:48,146
will very likely find a lot of non

1382
00:57:48,178 --> 00:57:50,058
trivial connections with that sort of

1383
00:57:50,064 --> 00:57:50,970
paradigm.

1384
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,470
Chris, any thoughts on that?

1385
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,476
Just to make the link to some

1386
00:58:01,498 --> 00:58:04,536
of the diagrams on the page, which is if

1387
00:58:04,558 --> 00:58:07,716
you've got these non 4D closed

1388
00:58:07,748 --> 00:58:09,096
boundaries, but other types of

1389
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:10,276
boundaries, the other types of shapes

1390
00:58:10,308 --> 00:58:12,004
Andrews was talking about, the drawings

1391
00:58:12,052 --> 00:58:13,976
on the page are just examples of some of

1392
00:58:13,998 --> 00:58:17,256
those. As Andrew

1393
00:58:17,288 --> 00:58:18,716
said, it's not really part of the

1394
00:58:18,738 --> 00:58:20,856
solution, but it's part of imaginatively

1395
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:23,436
exploring where else it might go. So if

1396
00:58:23,538 --> 00:58:25,916
you've got feature binding, which know

1397
00:58:25,938 --> 00:58:27,648
I'm seeing a cup and the cup is both

1398
00:58:27,734 --> 00:58:30,284
blue and cup shaped, that's feature

1399
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:31,676
binding. And then the phenomenological

1400
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,680
binding is my whole experience being

1401
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,748
unified. You can imagine feature binding

1402
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:38,364
putting the blueness and the cupness

1403
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:39,984
together. That might be something that

1404
00:58:40,022 --> 00:58:41,716
happens along one of these types of

1405
00:58:41,738 --> 00:58:43,828
internal boundaries. It might not. It

1406
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:45,136
might be that that can be done purely

1407
00:58:45,168 --> 00:58:46,980
through informational associations.

1408
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,716
We're kind of agnostic on that. But

1409
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,224
what's interesting about a 4D topology

1410
00:58:52,272 --> 00:58:53,752
is within it you can have lots of other

1411
00:58:53,806 --> 00:58:56,456
complicated topologies provided they are

1412
00:58:56,478 --> 00:58:58,516
not closed along the fourth dimension,

1413
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:00,232
because then you sort of created another

1414
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,164
little mini bit of bit of awareness.

1415
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,276
Oh, Bernie. Go ahead. Yeah, I'll jump

1416
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:06,924
back to the other page. Yeah, I wanted

1417
00:59:06,962 --> 00:59:08,876
to say something else not related to

1418
00:59:08,898 --> 00:59:10,764
this exact question. So if you have

1419
00:59:10,802 --> 00:59:13,756
ended it, maybe. I'll well, in that

1420
00:59:13,778 --> 00:59:15,128
case, actually, I'll mention one last

1421
00:59:15,154 --> 00:59:17,760
thing about how electromagnetic field

1422
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:21,104
may be related to phenomenology. A very

1423
00:59:21,142 --> 00:59:23,136
specific thing that happens on

1424
00:59:23,158 --> 00:59:24,624
psychedelics, and especially something

1425
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:27,970
like DMT is that you may end up having

1426
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,196
different regions of your experience,

1427
00:59:30,298 --> 00:59:32,916
have the exact same texture, and have

1428
00:59:32,938 --> 00:59:35,572
the feeling of synchronization between

1429
00:59:35,626 --> 00:59:37,876
them. And when that happens, they sort

1430
00:59:37,898 --> 00:59:39,764
of become the same object, just like

1431
00:59:39,802 --> 00:59:42,056
spatially distributed. The way I

1432
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,248
interpret this is whenever the exact

1433
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:46,856
same wave equation applies to two

1434
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:49,176
regions of your experience and waves can

1435
00:59:49,198 --> 00:59:51,032
propagate from one region to the other

1436
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:52,956
that actually feels like they're the

1437
00:59:52,978 --> 00:59:54,924
same object. So one kind of, like,

1438
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:57,532
natural way in which regions of your

1439
00:59:57,586 --> 00:59:59,836
phenomenal world might be segmented out

1440
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:04,088
into phenomenal objects is by confining

1441
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,944
how waves can move within the world

1442
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:09,264
simulation. And whenever you have what

1443
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:11,104
feels like a bound object in your world

1444
01:00:11,142 --> 01:00:13,676
simulation that I think is highly,

1445
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:16,496
highly related to waves being able to

1446
01:00:16,518 --> 01:00:18,244
smoothly travel within that object but

1447
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,404
not outside of that object, some kind of

1448
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:23,764
wave confinement is happening. I'll add

1449
01:00:23,802 --> 01:00:25,716
in one more, of course, fun and

1450
01:00:25,738 --> 01:00:28,452
speculative thought, which is the

1451
01:00:28,506 --> 01:00:31,850
aboutness the content of what this

1452
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,472
computation or what this process is

1453
01:00:34,526 --> 01:00:37,112
unfolding. The aboutness itself can be

1454
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,896
structure learning. And so even for a

1455
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:43,164
fixed electromagnetic topology, you can

1456
01:00:43,202 --> 01:00:45,960
have variable informational topology.

1457
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,812
Case in point, the von Neumann computer,

1458
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,712
the CPU architecture.

1459
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:52,664
Electromagnetically is not changing

1460
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:55,188
topologically. We don't need to reroute

1461
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:58,016
the telephone connections for there to

1462
01:00:58,038 --> 01:01:00,224
be different messages that spread. And

1463
01:01:00,262 --> 01:01:02,816
so there's a lot of richness in the

1464
01:01:02,838 --> 01:01:05,452
space you've sketched or surveyed,

1465
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:08,756
because even for a fixed topology, we

1466
01:01:08,778 --> 01:01:10,980
might be able to do compositional

1467
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,460
binding like blue and cup.

1468
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:18,560
And then now we add in a dynamic,

1469
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:24,440
multiscale topological unfolding,

1470
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,640
and then that may connect to different

1471
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,248
frequencies of, for example,

1472
01:01:30,334 --> 01:01:33,144
measurements in the EEG, which are

1473
01:01:33,262 --> 01:01:35,436
really only picking up the synchrony in

1474
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,812
the outer shell, which might

1475
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:40,364
actually play a role. It's not like the

1476
01:01:40,402 --> 01:01:42,184
skull matters. You could have a skull

1477
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,836
removed. It's not the scalp. It's not

1478
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:46,256
your hair. It's not necessarily the

1479
01:01:46,278 --> 01:01:48,992
meninge. But what is it? Well, maybe

1480
01:01:49,046 --> 01:01:53,420
it's something that's infotainment

1481
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,868
that reflects kind of different regimes

1482
01:01:55,884 --> 01:01:59,732
of attention that actually does happen

1483
01:01:59,786 --> 01:02:02,976
to correspond, but it's also localized,

1484
01:02:03,088 --> 01:02:04,484
and that's that interplay with

1485
01:02:04,522 --> 01:02:08,548
individuality and oneness that

1486
01:02:08,714 --> 01:02:11,672
works like Wilbur's, no boundary point

1487
01:02:11,726 --> 01:02:13,544
towards, but then you got to come back

1488
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:15,124
from no boundary because that sentence

1489
01:02:15,172 --> 01:02:16,090
has to end.

1490
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:23,144
Bernie. Yeah. I wanted to mention

1491
01:02:23,262 --> 01:02:26,164
that in relation to the ongoing curves

1492
01:02:26,212 --> 01:02:27,868
on the physics and information

1493
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:31,304
processing that Chris Fields is hosting

1494
01:02:31,432 --> 01:02:34,844
is one construct that Chris Fields is

1495
01:02:34,882 --> 01:02:38,444
using in his papers with Michael and

1496
01:02:38,482 --> 01:02:42,172
Paul is the notion of topological

1497
01:02:42,316 --> 01:02:44,732
quantum neural networks and topological

1498
01:02:44,796 --> 01:02:47,104
quantum field theories. So it might be

1499
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:52,436
that those are the

1500
01:02:52,538 --> 01:02:54,676
information processing in this kind of

1501
01:02:54,698 --> 01:02:56,656
topological maps as well that you've

1502
01:02:56,688 --> 01:03:00,656
mentioned. Daniel, the grounding

1503
01:03:00,688 --> 01:03:03,272
for that or how Michael Levin is talking

1504
01:03:03,326 --> 01:03:10,840
about how bioelectricity is a glue for

1505
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:14,532
the various subsystems in the brain.

1506
01:03:14,676 --> 01:03:18,136
Or I've seen some recent paper that was

1507
01:03:18,158 --> 01:03:19,080
pretty late.

1508
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,150
I found out recently, which I'm pretty

1509
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,696
surprised at just recently, that there

1510
01:03:27,718 --> 01:03:31,760
is a whole field of people that are

1511
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,384
really trying to apply quantum field

1512
01:03:34,422 --> 01:03:36,784
theory on the brain. And there was one

1513
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:40,036
paper on memory formation. So how

1514
01:03:40,058 --> 01:03:43,492
you, Chris, talked about memory in terms

1515
01:03:43,546 --> 01:03:45,844
of the electromagnetic field that might

1516
01:03:45,882 --> 01:03:49,092
be also great, like pointer. So I'm just

1517
01:03:49,146 --> 01:03:52,296
putting out different people and

1518
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:54,200
papers that I think might be

1519
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:57,770
interconnectable with this work. Yeah.

1520
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,588
One interesting thing, and you reflected

1521
01:03:59,604 --> 01:04:01,784
it in your literature review is when

1522
01:04:01,822 --> 01:04:04,312
people think about quantum and cognitive

1523
01:04:04,376 --> 01:04:08,140
systems, the ORC, or and other

1524
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,952
frameworks often are considering quantum

1525
01:04:11,016 --> 01:04:13,960
as being electronic scale. And therefore

1526
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,676
a quantum theory of cognition or

1527
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:17,424
consciousness would entail some kind of

1528
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:19,264
relationship between the way that

1529
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:21,312
electrons and photons behave and then

1530
01:04:21,366 --> 01:04:22,992
some difference that makes a difference

1531
01:04:23,046 --> 01:04:26,304
at the biological level. And in

1532
01:04:26,342 --> 01:04:28,852
a way, what we've been exploring with

1533
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,072
Chris Fields and others is like a bypass

1534
01:04:31,136 --> 01:04:32,544
where it's like, no, the quantum

1535
01:04:32,592 --> 01:04:35,616
formalism, quantum topology, quantum

1536
01:04:35,648 --> 01:04:38,816
information simply and plainly describes

1537
01:04:38,848 --> 01:04:41,380
cognitive processes where order matters.

1538
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,548
Now, there may or may not be effects

1539
01:04:44,644 --> 01:04:46,648
associated with differences that make a

1540
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:49,848
difference at the electronic scale, but

1541
01:04:50,014 --> 01:04:53,310
we don't need that in order to use

1542
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,180
superposition and all of these different

1543
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:00,348
effects that empirically are the case in

1544
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:02,316
cognitive systems. We're not waiting for

1545
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:04,316
some new mechanistic insight. It'd be

1546
01:05:04,338 --> 01:05:06,876
cool to find out. But what you've

1547
01:05:06,908 --> 01:05:10,364
presented is not waiting

1548
01:05:10,412 --> 01:05:13,676
for a different kind of thing to exist.

1549
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,896
So I'm curious, what experiments or what

1550
01:05:16,918 --> 01:05:21,428
are the unique experiments that

1551
01:05:21,514 --> 01:05:25,216
you feel like would give a resounding

1552
01:05:25,408 --> 01:05:29,270
feeling on what you're talking about?

1553
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:35,460
Yeah, happy to take it on. So one

1554
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:37,480
kind of, like, very awesome research

1555
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,136
lead, and then I'll explain what a

1556
01:05:40,158 --> 01:05:41,576
research paradigm will look like. But

1557
01:05:41,598 --> 01:05:43,268
essentially, first of all, a very

1558
01:05:43,294 --> 01:05:46,264
powerful lead is meditative cessations.

1559
01:05:46,392 --> 01:05:49,436
So one of the most insane chapters in

1560
01:05:49,538 --> 01:05:50,956
mastering the core teachings of the

1561
01:05:50,978 --> 01:05:53,244
Buddha by Daniel Ingram is the one

1562
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,756
called The Three Doors, where he

1563
01:05:55,778 --> 01:05:58,508
describes the phenomenology of

1564
01:05:58,674 --> 01:06:00,524
experiencing a peak meditation state

1565
01:06:00,562 --> 01:06:01,952
that's called a cessation. Where you

1566
01:06:02,006 --> 01:06:03,872
blink out of reality for a second or

1567
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:05,488
well, for a subsecond moment, but you

1568
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:07,936
just blink out fully and then you get

1569
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:09,408
reconstituted. And when you get

1570
01:06:09,414 --> 01:06:10,756
reconstituted, it tends to be a very

1571
01:06:10,778 --> 01:06:12,644
blissful, very rejuvenating type

1572
01:06:12,682 --> 01:06:14,848
experience. But the thing he highlights

1573
01:06:14,864 --> 01:06:16,916
in that article is what it feels like to

1574
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:20,484
be really close to a cessation. And it

1575
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:22,376
actually depends on what type of

1576
01:06:22,398 --> 01:06:24,408
cessation it is. There's roughly, like,

1577
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:26,216
three ways in which it can happen. But

1578
01:06:26,238 --> 01:06:28,964
the mind blowing thing about that essay,

1579
01:06:29,012 --> 01:06:31,716
that chapter is he essentially describes

1580
01:06:31,748 --> 01:06:33,784
different topologies of attention and

1581
01:06:33,822 --> 01:06:36,792
awareness that may arise where in these

1582
01:06:36,846 --> 01:06:38,444
moments, close to a cessation, he says,

1583
01:06:38,482 --> 01:06:40,748
well, in one of those you become kind of

1584
01:06:40,754 --> 01:06:43,276
a taurus. And the taurus flips the

1585
01:06:43,298 --> 01:06:44,984
inside and an outside and it twists

1586
01:06:45,032 --> 01:06:46,604
around and then it cancels out and

1587
01:06:46,642 --> 01:06:48,636
compresses and then you vanish. And then

1588
01:06:48,658 --> 01:06:50,176
there's like, another variety where you

1589
01:06:50,198 --> 01:06:52,736
become a cone, and then all of your

1590
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,224
attention gets concentrated in the point

1591
01:06:54,262 --> 01:06:56,384
of the coin of the cone, and then that

1592
01:06:56,422 --> 01:06:58,996
twists around and then vanishes. So

1593
01:06:59,018 --> 01:07:00,820
there's like this reliable,

1594
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,072
very exotic kind of like topological

1595
01:07:05,136 --> 01:07:06,932
transformations that can happen to your

1596
01:07:06,986 --> 01:07:09,540
attention and awareness. And our guess

1597
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:12,264
would be that, well, a cessation, an

1598
01:07:12,302 --> 01:07:14,904
actual kind of full vanishing, might be

1599
01:07:14,942 --> 01:07:18,376
related to the topological pocket that

1600
01:07:18,398 --> 01:07:20,260
your brain is generating, essentially

1601
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,112
opening up. So that in some maybe

1602
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:25,784
nontrivial way, the actual boundary

1603
01:07:25,832 --> 01:07:27,084
between inside and outside gets

1604
01:07:27,122 --> 01:07:28,892
dissolved for a fraction of a second,

1605
01:07:28,946 --> 01:07:30,844
then it gets reconstituted. But

1606
01:07:30,882 --> 01:07:32,844
something really special happens in that

1607
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,196
moment that allows for deep insight or

1608
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:37,216
something along the lines or relieving a

1609
01:07:37,238 --> 01:07:39,088
lot of internal stress, maybe like a

1610
01:07:39,094 --> 01:07:41,120
coronal mass ejection. There might be

1611
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,724
something going on at the topological

1612
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:47,056
level. Now, in terms of kind

1613
01:07:47,078 --> 01:07:49,392
of like, further, more sophisticated

1614
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:52,288
research paradigms, the thing that we're

1615
01:07:52,384 --> 01:07:55,204
looking into, there's a lot more to be

1616
01:07:55,242 --> 01:07:57,748
unpacked and developed here, but is what

1617
01:07:57,834 --> 01:08:01,188
kind of electromagnetic resonant modes

1618
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:05,076
that can supervene on particular graphs,

1619
01:08:05,188 --> 01:08:06,312
whether we're talking about the

1620
01:08:06,366 --> 01:08:08,490
Connectum or whether we're talking about

1621
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,156
the geometric eigen modes. More recent

1622
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:12,756
work where you model the entire cortex

1623
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:15,916
as a geometric surface, and then you

1624
01:08:15,938 --> 01:08:17,548
apply neural field theory to that.

1625
01:08:17,634 --> 01:08:21,084
Well, all of that works so far.

1626
01:08:21,122 --> 01:08:23,020
Essentially, what it focuses on is

1627
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,000
oscillations in the electric field

1628
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:27,970
without modeling the magnetic field. So

1629
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,528
I would suspect that many of the

1630
01:08:30,534 --> 01:08:34,316
Connectum harmonics or geometric eigen

1631
01:08:34,348 --> 01:08:37,372
modes may be physically unrealizable

1632
01:08:37,516 --> 01:08:40,332
simply because the magnetic field lines

1633
01:08:40,396 --> 01:08:42,708
may collide with each other. So some of

1634
01:08:42,714 --> 01:08:44,996
those may not be possible. But one of

1635
01:08:45,018 --> 01:08:47,216
the crazy, fascinating, unusual

1636
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,756
predictions that may come out of our

1637
01:08:48,778 --> 01:08:51,848
whole paradigm is that once we have a

1638
01:08:51,854 --> 01:08:54,036
really good mapping of what resonant

1639
01:08:54,068 --> 01:08:57,176
modes arise in the brain on

1640
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:58,936
different states of consciousness, we

1641
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,676
would predict that a when you're fully

1642
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:03,956
awake, normally conscious, there will be

1643
01:09:03,998 --> 01:09:07,112
a very central, big topological loop

1644
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,416
inside you that whenever you're, let's

1645
01:09:09,448 --> 01:09:12,636
say, in deep sleep, you might see a kind

1646
01:09:12,658 --> 01:09:14,920
of mind dust. You might see lots of tiny

1647
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,568
little pockets. And maybe when you're in

1648
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:21,516
an ecstatic experience, like deep

1649
01:09:21,548 --> 01:09:24,160
meditation, it may do something else.

1650
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,464
Like the particular resonant modes there

1651
01:09:26,582 --> 01:09:29,184
may create open field lines that don't

1652
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:31,332
form a loop. So that is like the sort of

1653
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:34,720
crazy, very novel type of prediction,

1654
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,484
or at least research paradigm that this

1655
01:09:36,522 --> 01:09:40,084
enables. That's really

1656
01:09:40,122 --> 01:09:41,850
cool. Chris, anything out of that?

1657
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,928
Yeah, just to draw the link between the

1658
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:48,264
fourth bullet here and what Andres is

1659
01:09:48,302 --> 01:09:51,016
setting out. I don't think any of this

1660
01:09:51,038 --> 01:09:53,268
is there are some toy bits of modeling

1661
01:09:53,284 --> 01:09:54,344
you could do that could increase

1662
01:09:54,392 --> 01:09:56,108
confidence one way or another. But in

1663
01:09:56,114 --> 01:09:57,496
terms of an actual experimental

1664
01:09:57,528 --> 01:10:01,224
prediction, you would need to combine

1665
01:10:01,272 --> 01:10:04,764
this with some theory of which

1666
01:10:04,802 --> 01:10:06,956
bits of the brain are doing this. So if

1667
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:09,136
Ward and Guevara are right that it's the

1668
01:10:09,158 --> 01:10:11,616
thalamus that's doing this stuff, we

1669
01:10:11,638 --> 01:10:13,776
would expect to see around the thalmus a

1670
01:10:13,798 --> 01:10:15,376
closed pocket. And it should be

1671
01:10:15,398 --> 01:10:17,632
possible. In principle, this is probably

1672
01:10:17,686 --> 01:10:19,616
billions of pounds worth of effort. But

1673
01:10:19,638 --> 01:10:20,768
to model the thalamus and the

1674
01:10:20,774 --> 01:10:22,400
surrounding bits enough, and you can

1675
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,068
find out if there would actually be a

1676
01:10:24,074 --> 01:10:25,764
closed pocket, if there would be one.

1677
01:10:25,802 --> 01:10:27,188
In theory, you can see roughly where it

1678
01:10:27,194 --> 01:10:28,868
would be. Obviously, it moves around a

1679
01:10:28,874 --> 01:10:30,516
bit, but it's normally around here you

1680
01:10:30,538 --> 01:10:32,616
then should be able to I don't know if

1681
01:10:32,638 --> 01:10:34,136
ethical consent is even possible for

1682
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:36,600
something like this, but disrupt that

1683
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:39,640
with a very, very targeted external Em

1684
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,916
source. Think transcranial stimulation,

1685
01:10:42,948 --> 01:10:46,468
but just laser precise. If we've

1686
01:10:46,484 --> 01:10:48,088
now broken the bid around the thalamus

1687
01:10:48,104 --> 01:10:49,324
but left everything else more or less

1688
01:10:49,362 --> 01:10:52,732
untouched, we predict if warding of our

1689
01:10:52,786 --> 01:10:56,092
plus us is correct, we predict that your

1690
01:10:56,146 --> 01:10:57,496
first personal awareness would blink

1691
01:10:57,528 --> 01:10:59,336
out. Like deep sleep, like anesthesia

1692
01:10:59,368 --> 01:11:01,668
like a meditative cessation. If we're

1693
01:11:01,704 --> 01:11:03,456
wrong, or the combination of us is

1694
01:11:03,478 --> 01:11:05,436
wrong, then you will still be conscious,

1695
01:11:05,468 --> 01:11:06,784
but you might just experience something

1696
01:11:06,822 --> 01:11:09,564
really bloody weird. But your contents

1697
01:11:09,612 --> 01:11:12,336
have changed, not the actual container

1698
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,484
of consciousness hasn't blinked in and

1699
01:11:14,522 --> 01:11:16,436
out, and then you could apply that to

1700
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,764
other bits of the brain wherever you

1701
01:11:17,802 --> 01:11:21,496
think there's. Our other prediction is

1702
01:11:21,518 --> 01:11:23,796
that it must be enclosing the immediate

1703
01:11:23,828 --> 01:11:26,184
memory model, but we're unsure exactly

1704
01:11:26,222 --> 01:11:28,216
where that is as well. That is also an

1705
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:29,770
outstanding research question.

1706
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,416
It feels like doable in our lifetimes,

1707
01:11:33,448 --> 01:11:36,124
I think, but none of this is give us ten

1708
01:11:36,162 --> 01:11:37,480
grand and we'll do it this summer. None

1709
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,340
of it is that easy. Yeah,

1710
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:44,140
very interesting. And Neuroimaging

1711
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,916
already utilizes electromagnetic

1712
01:11:48,028 --> 01:11:50,384
measurements and there are things that

1713
01:11:50,422 --> 01:11:52,976
currently are described within a

1714
01:11:52,998 --> 01:11:55,344
biomolecular paradigm, like, for

1715
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:56,956
example, changes in effective

1716
01:11:56,988 --> 01:11:59,612
connectivity between different regions

1717
01:11:59,676 --> 01:12:01,936
of the brain. Well, there's already a

1718
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:04,388
tract, let's just say, between certain

1719
01:12:04,474 --> 01:12:07,828
brain regions. And so maybe if

1720
01:12:07,914 --> 01:12:10,728
the action potentials traveling down

1721
01:12:10,814 --> 01:12:14,504
that 100 lane highway are

1722
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:17,000
aligned, then it's going to be like this

1723
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:20,296
rippling em continuity. Whereas if they

1724
01:12:20,318 --> 01:12:22,424
were totally disarrayed along that

1725
01:12:22,462 --> 01:12:25,564
track, then you wouldn't have

1726
01:12:25,602 --> 01:12:27,836
those two regions contained. But it'd be

1727
01:12:27,858 --> 01:12:29,196
like kind of like two regions, like

1728
01:12:29,218 --> 01:12:31,756
blowing smoke rings at each other if

1729
01:12:31,778 --> 01:12:35,372
they had enough synchrony to push

1730
01:12:35,436 --> 01:12:37,760
through the trouble and the friction

1731
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:41,504
such that there was a pocket that was

1732
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:44,880
able to you squirt hot water

1733
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:48,000
into a cold pool. There's ways

1734
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:49,796
to angle it and do it in all of the

1735
01:12:49,818 --> 01:12:52,164
combinations of viscosity that it just

1736
01:12:52,282 --> 01:12:55,060
diffuses instantly. There's also ways

1737
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,980
where there would be a high temperature

1738
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,548
toroidal form that could pass through a

1739
01:13:00,554 --> 01:13:03,416
colder media because it maintains a

1740
01:13:03,438 --> 01:13:06,456
topological boundary. A lot of these

1741
01:13:06,478 --> 01:13:09,252
things are again described anatomically

1742
01:13:09,316 --> 01:13:12,120
or molecularly or electronically,

1743
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,136
but the duality between electronics

1744
01:13:16,168 --> 01:13:18,700
and magnetism is not contentious.

1745
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,190
So there may be a lot of phenomena that

1746
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:28,448
could be revisited, and I don't

1747
01:13:28,454 --> 01:13:31,244
know whether that would provide indirect

1748
01:13:31,292 --> 01:13:34,832
evidence with what we already know or

1749
01:13:34,886 --> 01:13:37,970
suggest new plausible experiments, but

1750
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,460
it's an approach.

1751
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,228
Yeah. Welcome it. And thanks, Bernie as

1752
01:13:49,234 --> 01:13:50,956
well for the pointers towards, like,

1753
01:13:50,978 --> 01:13:52,764
Chris Fields and Michael Levin. I may

1754
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:55,884
come back to you for the QFT on memory

1755
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,304
formation in case I've spotted some

1756
01:13:58,342 --> 01:13:59,468
stuff on that, but I'm not sure I've

1757
01:13:59,484 --> 01:14:00,864
spotted the one it sounded like you were

1758
01:14:00,902 --> 01:14:03,600
referring to. So yeah, it's an exciting

1759
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,044
sort of research. Yeah. One last

1760
01:14:07,082 --> 01:14:08,736
connection there with active inference

1761
01:14:08,768 --> 01:14:10,356
is you have the electronic and the

1762
01:14:10,378 --> 01:14:13,012
magnetic fields influencing each other.

1763
01:14:13,066 --> 01:14:16,500
That's the basis of what philosophers

1764
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,276
might consider in terms of this

1765
01:14:18,298 --> 01:14:21,770
epipenomenalism or not question.

1766
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,804
And if we had an active inference

1767
01:14:24,852 --> 01:14:27,716
situation of two songbirds, the active

1768
01:14:27,748 --> 01:14:29,608
states of one become the sensory of the

1769
01:14:29,614 --> 01:14:31,624
other. So if they were just passing

1770
01:14:31,672 --> 01:14:33,676
messages every single time step to each

1771
01:14:33,698 --> 01:14:36,872
other, then they would both be engaged

1772
01:14:36,936 --> 01:14:39,916
in their own blanketed perception on the

1773
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:41,880
inbound and action selection on the

1774
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:45,280
outbound. And so they could basically be

1775
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:48,364
in this continual oscillatory

1776
01:14:48,412 --> 01:14:51,712
relationship with causal efficacy both

1777
01:14:51,766 --> 01:14:53,888
ways. Again, or you could design a

1778
01:14:53,894 --> 01:14:55,556
situation where the causal efficacy only

1779
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:58,916
flowed one way. But the point is, this

1780
01:14:58,938 --> 01:15:01,684
is a topological approach that lets us

1781
01:15:01,722 --> 01:15:05,508
explore that in a way that isn't only

1782
01:15:05,594 --> 01:15:10,212
appealing to molecular or material

1783
01:15:10,356 --> 01:15:12,872
phenomena and then leaving the whole

1784
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:14,584
question, which is the whole question of

1785
01:15:14,622 --> 01:15:16,968
the informational. And the closure and

1786
01:15:16,974 --> 01:15:19,096
the binding. Leaving all those to be

1787
01:15:19,118 --> 01:15:21,228
resolved by slicing and dicing with a

1788
01:15:21,234 --> 01:15:25,436
scalpel. Which is not even a

1789
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:27,180
viable option as far as we already

1790
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:27,870
understand.

1791
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,200
Bernie and then the authors,

1792
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:37,424
what are your closing thoughts or how

1793
01:15:37,462 --> 01:15:40,336
would you suggest that people get in the

1794
01:15:40,358 --> 01:15:41,776
game or what should they do with their

1795
01:15:41,798 --> 01:15:43,040
own topologies?

1796
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,318
Maybe I could note that Andres could

1797
01:15:50,404 --> 01:15:52,990
expand on, if he wants to know.

1798
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:56,030
Synthetic valence and neuroanalink.

1799
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:02,120
Well, yeah,

1800
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:08,346
STB introduced by Mike in 2015 on

1801
01:16:08,368 --> 01:16:11,110
Principalia about the correspondence

1802
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:14,422
respondents between imagery

1803
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:21,486
of an object for

1804
01:16:21,508 --> 01:16:23,534
many years now. You can see a 2020

1805
01:16:23,572 --> 01:16:24,974
presentation about it and there's many

1806
01:16:25,012 --> 01:16:27,714
more content about it. But the main

1807
01:16:27,752 --> 01:16:31,250
idea, the way it would actually work out

1808
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,106
here is the regions of the

1809
01:16:35,128 --> 01:16:38,334
topologically closed field that behave

1810
01:16:38,382 --> 01:16:40,322
like a smooth field may potentially

1811
01:16:40,386 --> 01:16:42,546
correspond to a very blissful

1812
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:45,798
experience. So I'm very optimistic of

1813
01:16:45,804 --> 01:16:47,894
the potential of okay, like something

1814
01:16:47,932 --> 01:16:50,626
like a peak blissful experience, peak

1815
01:16:50,658 --> 01:16:52,586
five meodmt experience or something like

1816
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,190
that. It would probably, I suspect,

1817
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:57,670
have like a very internally simplified

1818
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:01,414
topology where the geometry is as smooth

1819
01:17:01,462 --> 01:17:02,986
as possible. So that's kind of like an

1820
01:17:03,008 --> 01:17:05,946
interesting prediction or angle on all

1821
01:17:05,968 --> 01:17:09,646
of this, I think. Yeah. Maybe to

1822
01:17:09,668 --> 01:17:13,310
wrap up, I would say that we would

1823
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:15,998
enormously welcome anybody who is

1824
01:17:16,084 --> 01:17:19,522
technically savvy for doing

1825
01:17:19,576 --> 01:17:21,106
interesting simulations of the

1826
01:17:21,128 --> 01:17:23,086
electromagnetic field. I mean, we're

1827
01:17:23,118 --> 01:17:24,978
doing ourselves some really interesting

1828
01:17:25,064 --> 01:17:27,890
experiments and in combination with

1829
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,738
classical neural networks, but anybody's

1830
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:32,502
kind of like the intersection between

1831
01:17:32,556 --> 01:17:35,394
machine learning electromagnetic fields

1832
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:39,634
and simulations and statistics,

1833
01:17:39,682 --> 01:17:41,798
machine learning essentially that kind

1834
01:17:41,804 --> 01:17:43,366
of intersection is something that could

1835
01:17:43,468 --> 01:17:45,482
really potentially accelerate these

1836
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:47,574
research. If you had the technical

1837
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:49,818
competency to sort of work on the

1838
01:17:49,824 --> 01:17:51,578
analysis I was describing of finding the

1839
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,258
electromagnetic resonant modes of a

1840
01:17:53,264 --> 01:17:56,054
graph and then analyzing its topology,

1841
01:17:56,182 --> 01:17:57,626
we would love to collaborate. That's

1842
01:17:57,658 --> 01:18:00,158
like the sort of content we dream of

1843
01:18:00,164 --> 01:18:02,640
producing in the next year or two.

1844
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:04,846
Thank you. And thank you for having us.

1845
01:18:04,868 --> 01:18:07,380
It's been really, really appreciate it.

1846
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,570
I appreciate that. Chris.

1847
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,306
Nothing substantial to add. Just my

1848
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:17,154
thanks. As you know, I've scribbled down

1849
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:19,406
some thoughts about the Markov blankets

1850
01:18:19,438 --> 01:18:20,402
and about some of those different

1851
01:18:20,456 --> 01:18:22,478
research areas. As you know, we're

1852
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:25,174
getting stuff from this as. Yeah. And

1853
01:18:25,212 --> 01:18:26,614
hopefully this helps reach a few new

1854
01:18:26,652 --> 01:18:28,646
people who might come up with either a

1855
01:18:28,668 --> 01:18:30,306
brilliant idea why something we've

1856
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:32,326
missed, and this just can't work. For

1857
01:18:32,348 --> 01:18:33,626
some reason, we want to hear that as

1858
01:18:33,648 --> 01:18:36,362
well. But even more constructively ways

1859
01:18:36,416 --> 01:18:38,394
that this could be tested or built out

1860
01:18:38,432 --> 01:18:40,170
more gradually modeled.

1861
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:43,610
Yeah. Thank you for having us. Cool.

1862
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,714
New ways of thinking within even one

1863
01:18:46,752 --> 01:18:49,606
topological frame enables new action

1864
01:18:49,638 --> 01:18:52,746
selection in the area. And the era of

1865
01:18:52,768 --> 01:18:54,282
video chatting. We've made new

1866
01:18:54,336 --> 01:18:57,042
topological relationships, new

1867
01:18:57,096 --> 01:19:00,882
connectivities that then disperse yet

1868
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:04,322
again. And so it

1869
01:19:04,376 --> 01:19:07,826
continues. Thank you all,

1870
01:19:07,848 --> 01:19:10,674
though. Thank you so much. Till next

1871
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:12,482
time. Very lovely. Thank you. Amazing

1872
01:19:12,536 --> 01:19:13,394
stuff. See ya.
