This is going to be a copresentation, followed by a discussion with our guests here. I will leave it to everyone to introduce themselves and present and discuss however they prefer.	Today we're going to be hearing about electromagnetic field topology	Quantum Field Topology
45650	87020	00:45	Andres Co, founder of Qualia Research Institute. Trying to unify QRI with Active Instruments a lot. Beautiful. Let's get into the detail.	Andres Co: I'm founder of Qualia Research Institute	Getting it out there: QRI vs Active Instruments
87790	547220	01:27	There's been an explosion of interest in electromagnetic theories of consciousness. It provides a way to solve question for how information can be combined. But how do you draw a boundary around it? And then Andreas will give you the solution.	Arthur Centurion: Binding problem is fundamental question of electromagnetic theories of consciousness	The Boundary Problem of electromagnetic consciousness
548550	1017500	09:08	Qri reviews literature on binding and boundary problems. Finds families of possible solutions, but no clear winner. There are open questions for each class of theories put out there to solve problem.	Q: Surely someone's come up with a few solutions to the boundary problem	Boundary and the computational causal structure problem
1018110	1588526	16:58	Hard boundary problem is this sense that a fuzzy boundary probably isn't good enough. Why can't we not bridge into each other's minds, at least not routinely? The last one is a temporal boundary problem because everything we've said so far is in space. If I hand back to Andrews now, he will give you an entirely new solution to these puzzles.	The hard boundary problem is this sense that a fuzzy boundary probably isn't enough	The Hard Boundary Problem
1588628	1697950	26:28	There's a lot of research on local field potentials in the which are little microscopic electric oscillations. They do seem to have causal effects on the activity of neurons. On top of that, they feed back into the probability for neurons to fire. Please feel free to write anything.	Local field potentials have causal effects on the activity of neurons	Electromagnetic field and neural activity
1703360	1782060	28:23	A closed topological pocket of electromagnetic field could be where awareness can take place. But what it's aware of? Well, that's an entirely different question. If to the extent they are there, what on Earth would be experienced within it?	If the idea that you'll see here stands, then you've got	Sunlight and the consciousness
1783230	2059296	29:43	There's growing evidence for downward causation from electromagnetic fields in the brain. Topological transformations are really significant at a massive, massive scale. You can play with simulations of the electromagnetic field to try to make sense of the topological transformations that happen in it.	There's growing evidence for downward causation from electromagnetic fields in the brain	Non-epiphenomenal electromagnetic fields in the brain
2059398	2553724	34:19	 electromagnetic fields can form closed loops. We don't know exactly how they occur in the human brain. All we're presenting is a conceptual solution that those things are possible. What would such a solution look like to those five boundary problems?	Electromagnetic fields can form closed loops and people have used that	Quantum awareness and the closed loop
2553852	2857520	42:33	Once you start seeing the universe as a field and with maybe like fleeting topological pockets on it, that actually very significantly informs these classic questions in philosophy. Each of these views of personal identity could actually be reinterpreted in terms of claims about the field and field topology.	I think once you start seeing the universe as a field and with fleeting topological pockets	Topological Individualism and the Self
2859380	3552364	47:39	Topological pockets in the electromagnetic field do behave as mark of blankets. None of this makes any contribution to solving more content problems of consciousness. If there are algorithms that solve those problems, they need to be implemented.	Bernie Andrews: I've been thinking a lot about similar stuff recently	Markov Blankets and the content of consciousness
3552402	3941416	59:12	Bernie: How electromagnetic field may be related to phenomenology. Even for a fixed electromagnetic topology, you can have variable informational topology. When people think about quantum and cognitive systems, the ORC, or and other frameworks often are considering quantum as being electronic scale.	Daniel: How electromagnetic field may be related to phenomenology	How Quantum Field Theory may be related to phenomenology
3941438	4684846	1:05:41	Chris Ward: A powerful lead is meditative cessations. He says a cessation might be related to the topological pocket that your brain is generating. Ward: Once we have a really good mapping of what resonant modes arise in the brain on different states of consciousness, we would expect to see a closed pocket.	Daniel Ingram describes what it feels like to be close to a cessation	How to Realize a Full Disappearance in Meditation
4684868	4753630	1:18:04	It's been really, really appreciate it. Nothing substantial to add. Just my thanks. New ways of thinking within even one topological frame enables new action selection in the area. And so it continues. Till next time.	Chris: Hopefully this helps reach a few new people who might have missed something	A Markov Blanket Talk
