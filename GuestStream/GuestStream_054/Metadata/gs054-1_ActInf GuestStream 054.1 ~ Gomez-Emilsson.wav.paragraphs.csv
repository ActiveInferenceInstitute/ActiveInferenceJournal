3390	17042	1	A	0.76233	00:03	18	You. Hello and welcome, everyone. This is active inference Livestream. Guest stream number 54.1. It's August 25, 2023.
17176	39660	2	B	1.0	00:17	58	Today we're going to be hearing about electromagnetic field topology as a solution to the boundary problem of consciousness. This is going to be a copresentation, followed by a discussion with our guests here. So I will leave it to everyone to introduce themselves and present and discuss however they prefer. And thank you again for joining. Please.
42290	61330	3	A	0.99666	00:42	45	Thank you so much for having us, Daniel. Yeah. I'm Andres Co, founder of Qualia Research Institute. And, yeah, I'm here with Liber Chris, co author of this paper, and Lieber, a volunteer and Wiki extraordinaire for QRI. But yeah, go ahead, Chris, and lieber.
62870	67240	4	C	0.96822	01:02	12	Yeah, no more to say. That's plenty. Let's get into the detail.
69610	80220	5	D	0.99056	01:09	25	Yeah, I'm co working with QRI and a lot into Active Instruments, and I'm trying to unify QRI with Active Instruments a lot. And yeah.
84270	124680	6	A	0.99998	01:24	83	Beautiful. Yeah. Next slide. Essentially, our outline of this presentation is going to essentially walk you through some of the key ideas of the paper and kind of like trying to illustrate them or making them a little bit more intuitive, fairly high level, although we will actually present kind of the core argument. The main thing to point out here next slide is that the magnetic theories of consciousness, I guess, like, 20 years ago, they sounded like a total crackpot type.
138560	175376	7	C	0.99996	02:18	91	Yeah, I've still got a good connection, so we can give him a moment or two, and if not, I'll pick up from what was the crackpot, see if he reconnects. My gosh, sorry, Andres, please repeat from crackpot. Oh, my God. Yeah. Over the last 20 years, however, there's been an explosion of interest in electromagnetic theories of consciousness and serious peer reviewed publications about them, especially the last ten and then five years, kind of like a variable exponential explosion in terms of a number of serious articles published.
175508	229630	8	A	0.99	02:55	131	And one of the very kind of key, amazing kind of contributions that something like an electromagnetic theory of consciousness can offer to the overall ecosystem of philosophy of mind is that it provides a way to solve question for how information can be combined. I mean, essentially, when you have information distributed, how is it possible that they can be simultaneously part of some kind of, like, unified whole? And electromagnetic theories of consciousness are just very proud to say, well, the electromagnetic field is ontologically unitary, it's already unified, so there's not much of a problem here. However, once you kind of have this unity, then the question becomes, well, but how do you actually draw a boundary around it? So actually, you just traded one problem for another.
231920	233470	9	A	0.98826	03:51	5	Dig into the details there.
239170	258802	10	A	0.97179	03:59	59	Cool. Shall I take us through the literature review as context for this? And then Andreas will come back to kind of give you the solution that we think can fit with electromagnetic fields. So, yeah, the boundary problem. So binding problem you heard just now into a first approximation that is, whatever you think might make up consciousness.
258866	276570	11	C	0.99999	04:18	52	Maybe it's neurons firing. Maybe it's some sort of magical qualia at the bottom of the universe. Whatever you think it is, these small things need to be bound together to reflect the complex phenomenology we have. We see lots of things all at once. Right now, I'm smelling the flowers outside.
276640	287214	12	C	0.99989	04:36	41	I've got the laptop screen in front of me. There's lots of stuff happening all at once in a unified way. So that's the binding problem. We won't do more on that here. We'll sort of assume some familiarity with it.
287252	312950	13	C	0.8191	04:47	71	But then the boundary problem is, well, once you've got a mechanism that creates the binding between these lower level entities, why would that mechanism ever stop? Because clearly, our awareness, our phenomenology doesn't go on forever. We don't know what's happening in Alpha Centurion. Our awareness is not unbounded. And as soon as you realize that you need boundaries around something, a number of things suddenly don't quite make sense.
313020	335502	14	C	0.90198	05:13	70	So Owen Schroedinger of physics Fame flagged this up as one of the things that he felt was completely unresolved. So despite his kind of vast intellect and his contributions elsewhere, he felt that this puzzle was one of the things that he described it as. When he turns his mind to it, everything just evaporates. None of it makes sense anymore. He can't get a grip on the problem.
335636	368620	15	C	0.99	05:35	86	And he described the problem, as you can see on the screen. He was saying, why is it that my identity is at the intermediate level, this kind of roughly human shaped body? And you can say, okay, we mostly mean the central nervous system. But either way, this broad entity has lots of smaller things inside it cells, organs, human bodies, and lots of things above it cities, states, solar systems, universes, and so on. Why is our self consciousness always at this one level?
369070	400850	16	C	1.0	06:09	86	And if you describe that as a problem to somebody who's never heard of it before or never thought of it before this happened to me just last Friday, they might say, well, it's obviously just like the body stops. Like, the skull stops here, or like, my arm stops here. Of course, it's not going out to Arthur Centurion. Why would and it's a very intuitive, immediate human reaction. But you probe it a little bit, as Schrodinger did, and it kind of falls apart.
401190	442174	17	C	0.99056	06:41	126	Because if you're a neuron firing somewhere in the central nervous system and you're being initiated by a neuron in the peripheral nervous system, well, how do you know to stop binding? How do you know that there's a boundary that stops at the edge of the central nervous system? Or if your fingers are holding onto a tool and you're getting feedback from that tool, you're driving a car, it can feel like you're part of that car. Where does the system know where the boundary is because most of these things that we observe have only observer dependent boundaries. If you've got a wheel in a car rolling along the road, from one perspective, it looks like the wheel is separate from the road.
442292	457160	18	C	0.99941	07:22	55	But if you're a tiny ant or something and the car is parked, these things all may feel like they're one object. And this was when Schrodinger turned his mind to this. It puzzled him. So let's give him the benefit of the doubt. Let's say that there's something real to be puzzled through here.
458330	482250	19	C	0.62429	07:38	79	This issue applies both to the example I started with around building up in small units. But also if you're a cosmo panpsychist, you believe that there is one universal consciousness, and we are like a god playing with its puppets. In that case, you still have the same question because you're still demarcating boundaries. You just get the mirror image. We'll mostly focus on the idea of expanding up from small things because that's closer to the orthodoxy.
482330	506760	20	C	0.98993	08:02	60	But you can't solve this problem magically by declaring a single consciousness. Okay, so Schrodinger didn't say much more about this. He just said that this was a puzzle. The first person we found that really formalized this and gave it the name boundary problem was Rosenberg. And it was a number of pieces, late 90s, early two thousand s.
507450	527430	21	C	0.99981	08:27	66	And he uses the phrase siller and Cryptus, but it's exactly the same idea as Schrodinger had. One of them is, well, why aren't there lots of small things? I think that might have been the silla, that might have been the nine headed monster. And then on the other hand, what about the things that we are nested within? And he called that the Cryptus.
527510	566060	22	C	1.0	08:47	102	And he said, it's very hard to posit a genuinely robust mechanism that would stop it in both directions. You can imagine a reason why lots of small things get bound together, but why would the binding stop? And his view in framing this problem is that no one had solved it. Winding on to Andres and I chatting about this last year and building on some of Qri's foundational work in this area, we wanted to know, well, what's happened since Rosenberg framed this and Schroding was so puzzled by it. Surely someone's come up with a few solutions to it.
566750	595006	23	C	0.99957	09:26	71	So Q standard database driven literature review, and you've got the details there. Fairly standard stuff. What we looked looking across the Scopus database, we only found five papers that seemed to be relevant about the boundary problem, compared to 92 on the binding and 47 on the combination problem. So some of these related problems, and in our intro, we kind of went straight from binding to boundary. They are.
595028	612646	24	C	0.99989	09:55	60	So if you're thinking about one, you really should be thinking about the other. Well, that is not reflected in the literature. We did a bit more puzzling around. People don't seem to be referring to this by other names, or when they are, they haven't solved it either. So it felt that there was something worth going at here.
612668	639840	25	C	1.0	10:12	70	And this is what initiated the paper. What we did find, though, partly in those five papers and partly in looking around, we do find families of possible solutions. And there's no clear winner. But maybe philosophy rarely has a clear winner for anything, so maybe that's an unreasonable expectation. But there's definitely open questions for each class of theories that have been put out there to solve this problem.
640850	680586	26	C	0.99771	10:40	108	So the first of these loosely termed algorithmic, so computational causal structure theories, I'm just trying to summarize them into one term. Some of the examples there IIT, of course, very well known global workspace theory as well. They will tend to say that things bind together when they're in a particular pattern. So you might imagine a database that references itself or the working memory of a computer, or as soon as things are somehow linked together in a causal sense, in IIT, there's a particular type of pattern, but nonetheless it's an abstract informational relationship. Those papers don't tend to be super explicit about defining boundaries.
680698	711078	27	C	0.97414	11:20	91	Normally, IIT will normally say, here's our system, and now let's ask within that system, where is the highest phi? They sort of just say, take the boundaries on that. No one has said, let's take the whole universe as a system. The math is already virtually impossible, even toy systems. But reading between the lines or reading some of the other papers around it, there's something about if you had a hi fi area surrounded by lots of lo fi areas, well, it's natural that it's the bit that's high.
711164	754610	28	C	1.0	11:51	130	And there's this principle of exclusion that says you take the highest one in a system, maybe you have to specify a system before it makes sense to ask that. And if you took the highest bit out, somehow you just remove some of those causal interconnections that create that highness. Whatever's left will have a slightly lower bit of phi, and that is now where the sort of locus of consciousness resides. This may well work, kind of the maths would need working out, I think Andres and I are initially skeptical, but because as best as we can see, no one's really created complicated maps and discussed what would happen when you've got different mixtures of densities that are shifting over time. What stops it from being arbitrary?
755030	783690	29	C	0.99989	12:35	82	Certainly there are questions to be had, and we can come back to this a bit if we want to talk about it further. But suffice it to say it's not a guaranteed solution. And there's one critique that we cite. There resonance theories, a link between those and electromagnetic fields now as well, in that the main progenitor of these theories. Pam Hunt would say that the main resonance which he sees binding happening together in human consciousness is en fields.
783770	818250	30	C	0.99947	13:03	99	So there are links between these as well, and maybe the informational patterns are being encoded in resonance or quantum entanglement or Em fields. So there can be links between these as well. The resonance theory that says that binding happens when things are in the same frequency, simple enough, or when they are close enough, and that becomes a little bit more debatable. But what does that really mean, the boundaries? There is a conceptual solution for this, which is the slowest shared resonance in a system, but many of the same issues apply as with the algorithmic.
819070	854286	31	C	0.99999	13:39	108	But again, if experimenters, it may be possible to create one that works there quantum theories entanglement is what binds it together, at least in some of them. So what causes two experiences, a blue cup and the shape of the cup to be bound together into one? Well, it's that the blueness and the cupness, I'm obviously talking at a very high level of abstraction, but those are somehow quantum entangled with each other that would indeed create, to the best of our physics knowledge today, a kind of ontologically real binding. And that's quite an attractive part of the solution. Well, what would stop those boundaries?
854478	883070	32	C	0.99999	14:14	86	There is the monogamy principle. Things can only be maximally entangled up to a certain point, but there's a very, very open question about whether that sort of thing would enable the kind of macro phenomenology we have. But in the paper we say all of these are worth exploring, let's keep investigating. And then there's the one I started with an instruction like maybe it's the boundary of the central nervous system, but hopefully even a small amount of scrutiny causes that one to collapse.
885810	923034	33	C	0.59	14:45	102	And most of these explicitly say that more work is needed, more math is needed, and certainly that will be true of what we're presenting here as well. What we want to do is add a new one to this list. And the inspiration for this is that, well, if the Em field accounts present a solution to the binding problem they certainly believe they do, there's lots of literature on it, then maybe they can also provide a solution to the boundary problem. Given how closely related they are. When you read those accounts, they don't quite have it nailed yet.
923072	956230	34	C	1.0	15:23	105	The most common explanation they give is a kind of inverse square law rule where, well, the strength of a field just becomes so small so quickly. By the time you're a centimeter out from the thalamus or by the time you're at the edges of the skull these fields have just evaporated into they've decohered. They're indistinguishable from the neural noise all around us. That might be okay if you're okay with a fuzzy boundary and we'll come on to that in a SEC. Others motivate a phase transition, a bit like quantum entanglement or a bit like the exact resonance of resonance theories.
956730	983310	35	C	0.99002	15:56	66	But those phase transitions are pretty speculative as well. So the solution we will come to and andrews will outline is a different aspect of em fields. It's not fuzzy boundaries and it's not a vague phase transition. It's an entirely different topological solution which we argue can solve the problems. What we think is worth doing, though, is to make that boundary problem more explicit.
983650	1017500	36	C	0.99985	16:23	101	What you've heard both from Schrodinger and from Rosenberg is this idea of kind of like why aren't the cells inside you conscious? Or if they are conscious, why don't we ever experience that? And again, going up, what about cities and families and things or group chants or football stadiums, that sort of stuff. And there is a scholar who argues, based on resonance theory, that actually when we are in a group chanting or a group dancing situation, our consciousness does in fact move to that level as well. And it's speculative, but there's much to be thought about.
1018110	1064798	37	C	0.9999	16:58	124	So to make this problem more precise, we've got five, and I'll just give you the one or two sentences on each. The hard boundary problem is this sense that a fuzzy boundary probably isn't good enough. And let's kind of explain a bit more why. If you have something like a wave or the example of the wheel I gave before touching the ground or indeed any connection between any physical atoms, the closer you look to it, the less obvious it is where it stops. The boundaries of my skull may feel very precise to me, but if there were an alien the size of a solar system, their ability to perceive this would most likely just blurs imperceptibly into its surroundings.
1064994	1068220	38	C	0.99982	17:44	9	These things feel hard, but they're not really hard.
1070750	1105326	39	C	1.0	17:50	100	At the edges of our awareness, there's this sense that things might feel fuzzy, but at some point it just sort of stops, might feel like it might feel infinite. There are states of mind where we can feel an infinite awareness, but probing that further, it doesn't truly encompass everything and go on forever. At this edge. Our assertion is that sometimes this feels like a hard boundary. And if it ever sometimes feels like a hard boundary, then you need some mechanism that is capable of a hard edge in a way that these physical phenomena typically aren't.
1105518	1143646	40	C	0.95538	18:25	114	So that's the hard boundary definitely happy to drill into more of any of this or any of the other five if they're not making enough sense in the Q A. So lower levels we've covered mean the great example of this is we know that when we go to sleep, some part of our consciousness, at least the bit that we remember, switches off, yet the brain remains active. The lower levels boundary problem could be reinterpreted as saying why doesn't our awareness just shift to another part of the brain at that point? It certainly doesn't seem to most of the time. Higher level boundary problem, we've had that from the beginning.
1143678	1167894	41	C	0.99968	19:03	66	That's why doesn't it go up? Maybe it does sometimes. Certainly doesn't normally the private boundary problem. So this is now, rather than going down into ourselves or up into the universe in which we are nested, this is more take two of those boundaries, me and you, me and one other person. Why can we not bridge into each other's minds, at least not routinely?
1167942	1197390	42	C	0.99998	19:27	91	Those who claim to do so have struggled to replicate it and get it into the mainstream. So this is privacy. There appears to be some limitation that stops these mechanisms from connecting with each other. And yet if it is slowest shared resonance or if it is highest informational phi in IIT, why is it not possible to construct a system in which the highest phi is now an interconnected one and our consciousness has collapsed? Maybe it is possible, and that's just a technical endeavor we haven't yet achieved.
1197550	1228620	43	C	0.99999	19:57	71	But either way, there's something that's challenging about it, either as a technical barrier or as a philosophical one. The last one is a temporal boundary problem because everything we've said so far is in space. But the kind of entities and experiences we're talking about are not zero time, space based activities. They have a temporal persistence. So what is it that puts boundaries around a micro moment of experience?
1229070	1257910	44	C	1.0	20:29	83	What is it that enables us to experience the end of a note and still retain that idea of the start of the note and experience them together? And how does this extend through broader experiences of the self. So those are the five puzzles. Hopefully that's enough of a qualitative overview so that you know what we're trying to solve at least. And if I hand back over to Andrews now, he will give you an entirely new solution to these puzzles.
1259050	1283610	45	A	1.0	20:59	69	Yes. Next slide. Going a little bit broader too, in that what Chris just talked about is kind of the criteria for the boundary problem, kind of like breaking down the boundary problem into subcomponents. And then there's also, more broadly, things that you would want out of a theory of consciousness. And so the solution to the boundary problem ideally will also, in a sense, satisfy these constraints.
1283770	1316410	46	A	0.99	21:23	77	And these constraints are framing variance nominated phenomenalism and no strong emergence. Next slide. So framing variance essentially can be recapariance. The fact that whatever structure is giving rise to the boundary shouldn't in a way, be frame specific, shouldn't just depend on how you're looking at an object. It should be kind of like an intrinsic objective property of the object that if you move it around, it shouldn't, in principle, be changing in that way.
1316480	1347022	47	A	0.99998	21:56	82	Next slide. Non epiphenomenalism. For those who are not familiar with the term, this is the idea that for a particular conscious physical system, there corresponds an experience, but that there's no causal influence from that conscious experience back into the system. And there's like, various ways of kind of trying to ground the question of, hey, why is epiphenomenalism not the case? There's kind of differences in emphasis by each of these questions, but they're roughly pointing in the same direction.
1347166	1384650	48	A	1.0	22:27	98	One important question is how is it possible that we can talk in detail about our experience, but the way we actually framed it in the paper that we find the most compelling is how was evolution able to recruit? Coherent, globally bound states. If they're not causally significant, if they're not causally useful, it would just be an extraordinary coincidence that it just happens to happen simultaneously along with something that seems to be computationally significant and encompass a whole lot of information at the same time. Next slide. And then we also have no strong emergence.
1384810	1429142	49	A	0.99527	23:04	107	There's this quote from David that says, the Lagrangian of the standard model does not break down inside one's own skull. Meaning we want the laws of physics to apply universally to whatever explanation space we come up with that we don't want to introduce special cases or say like, oh, there's like a special different field in the brain, or anything of the sort. We want to have a homogeneous set of physics that as simple as it gets, as mainstream as it gets in terms of appealing to standard physics. Next slide. So, yeah, the overarching solution and explanation space, that is electromagnetic field topology.
1429206	1459078	50	A	0.97949	23:49	72	So, first of all, I will walk you through in what way this explanation space satisfies the kind of like three constraints that I provided. And then Chris is going to explain how it addresses each of the sub problems. Next slide. So, yeah, next one. Yeah, if you actually kind of look at these amazing reconstructions of the electromagnetic field of stellar bodies, you would see that nothing trivial about it.
1459164	1489590	51	A	0.95207	24:19	82	There's like all of this incredible complexity and richness in structure. A lot of it is very counterintuitive, not something that you would see with a naked eye. You require superimposing, a lot of pictures from the different regions of the spectrum to kind of get a picture of what's going on in the electromagnetic field. And yeah, it has kind of these elongated, weird plasma tubes and circular structures and loops and so on. So it's a very structurally rich environment.
1489770	1529120	52	A	0.994	24:49	85	Next slide. And the way in which something like the topology of that field will satisfy the criteria that wet line is as follows. So if you look at the electromagnetic field of the sun, sometimes this phenomena called magnetic reconnection happens. And this is actually responsible for solar flares and kernel mass ejections. It has to do with when plasma tubes that are the electromagnetic confinement structures touch with each other and so they can open up and spray plasma into the outer space.
1529810	1579514	53	A	1.0	25:29	110	The key thing to point about here is that this is actually a topological change to the field. It's not just any kind of physical change when you have a solar flare coronal mass ejection that is the effect of a macroscopic gigantic topological transformation. What this slide is trying to get at is that whether a system experienced magnetic reconnection or not will not depend on your frame of reference. And the very simple reason is that Lorentz transforms simply squeeze and stretch, but they never actually reconnect or cut or add any kind of topological change. In other words, a Lorentz transform will leave a topological event untouched.
1579642	1589630	54	A	0.99987	26:19	24	So in that sense okay, like topology as an explanation space for why this is framing variant, it definitely fits the bill. Next slide.
1592710	1654950	55	A	0.987	26:32	151	Importantly, too, in the brain, we also can tackle the question of, like, in what way the field is not epiphenomenal. There's a lot of research on local field potentials in the which are little microscopic electric oscillations, and they do seem to actually have causal effects on the activity of neurons. In other words, people might believe, in a sense, that, hey, brainwaves are kind of just a reflection of neural activity. But the thing that something like transcranial magnetic stimulation makes clear is that on top of that, they actually feed back into the probability for neurons to fire, especially the probability for neurons to fire in synchrony or in a state of coherence. In other words, the actual causal structure of electromagnetic field and how it connects to neural activity is this dual causal arrow where neural activity influences local field potentials, neural activity influences activity via synapse.
1666520	1672310	56	C	0.99912	27:46	21	Yeah, we've been the victim of the connection. Again, let's hope it comes back as quickly as it did last time.
1676220	1680600	57	B	0.8	27:56	9	Yes, there's a lot to say, but I won't.
1683420	1697950	58	C	0.8769	28:03	37	Hopefully you got some harsh questions written down as we've been taking you through it. Yeah, just enough people who are listening in the discussion will look at some questions, so please feel free to write anything.
1703360	1720070	59	B	0.35	28:23	33	It personally, I'm curious whether the awareness is going to be the light of the sun, the heat of the sun, the ejection, the loop structure, the birth and death of the star.
1724110	1724860	60	A	0.89531	28:44	1	Yeah.
1727070	1750606	61	C	0.99993	28:47	74	If the idea that you'll see here stands, then you've got the idea that a closed topological pocket of electromagnetic field, that's where awareness can take place. That's where a first person perspective, a kind of a locus, can exist. But what it's aware of? Well, that's an entirely different question. And if there are pockets like that, we're not asserting in this paper that the sun has these it's such a complex entity.
1750718	1782060	62	C	0.98609	29:10	60	It's very possible, but that is a different but if to the extent they are there, what on Earth would be experienced within it? That's a different thing. The content problem, it's not just for YouTubers, it's also for conscious systems. But yeah, you've bound it all together, you've delimited a boundary topologically and then about what? And so what?
1783230	1789760	63	C	0.99546	29:43	17	Yeah, let me pick up a bit while we're while we're waiting for him to come in.
1792210	1817640	64	C	0.86	29:52	76	And there's really growing kind of neuroscience and biological evidence for downward causation from electromagnetic fields in the brain. And all we really do in this paper is acknowledge that research literature exists and say, and therefore, it's possible for fields to be non epipenomenal. We don't get into the specifics of it, but they've been shown in memory formation. They've been shown in the olfactory bulb for your smells. They've appeared all over the place.
1818810	1827114	65	C	0.61104	30:18	18	Andres, you're back. Just making the case for non epiphenomenal fields in the brain. Oh, fantastic. Beautiful. Yeah.
1827152	1831210	66	A	0.99995	30:27	11	Sorry about that. Hopefully, it doesn't happen again. Okay. Next slide.
1833390	1861330	67	A	0.99974	30:33	51	Yeah. And think about the immense causal power that a topological change in the field has in cosmological terms, like these billions of tons of plasma being ejected just because of otherwise epiphenomenal magnetic reconnection. It's like, no, actually, topological transformations are really significant at a massive, massive scale. Next slide?
1864660	1887240	68	A	0.97053	31:04	42	Yeah. Next one. Just showing kind of how ridiculously powerful this can be. Yeah. And importantly, too, the actual fact that you get an enclosure with a topological transformation in a medium also gives you this capacity to essentially have holistic behavior.
1887740	1935908	69	A	0.99999	31:27	116	This is one of the things that, to me, was kind of the most exciting about this explanation space. The moment you can close field lines or do a top formation, waves will be confined. Some kinds of waves can be confined within a topological pocket. When you have confinement of waves, then you have resonant modes. And when you have resonant modes, then you have this very fantastic effect where the whole shape of an object essentially is expressed in the way every part of the object is vibrating, in which case, essentially, you have this reason why evolution would recruit these topological objects is because it actually allows organisms to behave as a unit.
1936004	1969172	70	A	0.99896	32:16	91	So I think, yeah, that might be a very key piece of the puzzle for epiphenomenalism. Next slide. These are just kind of like some sketches of some of the kinds of boundaries that, in principle, you may have in the electromagnetic field and what kind of binding in consciousness they might correspond to. But you don't have to just speculate. The really exciting thing here is that you can actually play with simulations of the electromagnetic field to try to make sense of the topological transformations that happen in it.
1969306	1986330	71	A	0.7578	32:49	45	So the next following slides we can just go through them fairly quickly are essentially resonant modes of an empty cavity, electromagnetic resonance modes of an empty cube cavity, where the left side is the electric field and the right side is the magnetic field.
1988400	2016448	72	A	0.97	33:08	66	The website where you can check this is called Falstad.com EMBOX. And the thing that it kind of really neatly shows is how the magnetic field sometimes get this closed looping structure. Next slide. Yeah, just go through them, maybe like 5 seconds for each of them. And it also allows you to essentially look at what happens when you stack some of these resonant modes.
2016544	2053772	73	A	1.0	33:36	96	And some combinations, linear combinations of these resonant modes create intricate eddings and loops and twists that. Loop around and create this topological boundary very fleeting. It has to do with the frequency of oscillation of the electric field, how many times per second you're going to get this looping structure. But the fact that yeah, you can show there's some topologically closed objects that appear there is quite remarkable. And overall, the idea here would be that well, something like this is happening in the brain and the brain is actually recruiting these looping architectures.
2053836	2055680	74	A	0.95	34:13	8	All right, I'll hand it over to Chris.
2058340	2088468	75	C	0.99993	34:18	80	Thank you very much. Yes, we've seen that electromagnetic fields can form closed loops and people have used that, some of the sites in the paper around people trapping knots of light. And it just kind of really remarkable things happening at the edge of sort of room temperature state physics. Really incredible stuff. We know that in principle, these fields are capable of downward causation in massive contexts like the sun, but also in very real human brain settings.
2088564	2114500	76	C	0.76898	34:48	76	So conceptually, and we know that topologies in general are framing variants. So we've got those things in place, we've got boundaries that satisfy those various features that we wanted. We don't know exactly how they occur in the human brain. All we're presenting is a conceptual solution that those things are possible. But what we do say is, well, what would such a solution look like to those five boundary problems that we just described?
2114840	2162620	77	C	0.99992	35:14	132	So taking them one by one, or rather yeah, taking them as a group. Let's first say what in such a theory, the first person perspective, that kind of phenomenal awareness, the what it's likeness that we experience in a very normal everyday sense, what could that reflect, what could that correspond to in such a model? And there are others, but we'll give one example and use that to walk through the problems. So we would say that once you've got a closed topology and it may well require the time dimension for it to be properly ontologically closed and at that point em energy of that specific spectra, the same spectra that's making up the boundary can't pass through it or not. That's the whole point about the closed loop.
2162700	2183160	78	C	0.99999	36:02	61	Other things might pass through it, sound wave might pass through it. But nonetheless, for the entities that we're interested in, it is closed to itself. And that's where we can get this hard boundary. There may be lots of these being created in the brain. The brain is absolutely chock a block with different bits of em generating underlying phenomena.
2183980	2194830	79	C	0.99993	36:23	40	So it's certainly plausible that some of them are closed. We don't know. For this to be true, there must be at least one. But it's plausible that if there's one, there's probably several. So you've got several of these.
2195200	2235320	80	C	1.0	36:35	111	By definition they are non overlapping, the boundaries cannot overlap, but they could well be multiple at the same time. One at the front, one at the back could be all over the place. It's probable though, that only a subset would be continually recreated in a stable manner because the fact that these fields can have downward causation, they can do useful things. Some of the sites in the paper about information processing point to some of the nonlinearities you can achieve through wave and field based resonant, mode based computations which may well have benefits from an information processing perspective. So in some cases these will be continually recreated.
2236300	2248750	81	C	0.99999	37:16	33	Only one of them, because they cannot overlap, only one of them can enclose, let's call it an immediate memory model as a conceptual point, not committing to what exactly that might mean.
2251040	2289880	82	C	0.99999	37:31	114	We suspect these wouldn't last very long and they probably don't extend over the whole brain, but who knows? Regardless, it would vary from period to period. Other field theories might have other ways of recruiting this concept for solving the boundary problem, but let's walk this one through and see what it looks like as a response to those five things. So what we're saying is this closed topological pocket that is kind of axiomatically the same as a first person awareness. When you've got that, you've got something that is capable of both binding together those micro bits of experience and presenting them within a boundary so they have some unified ontology.
2291100	2331428	83	C	0.99938	38:11	124	So one by one, and I think this is our last slide, the hard boundary, well, that comes from what we've been talking about. Energy of the same spectra can't pass through the closed loop. So that happens quite naturally, a bit like with the field solution to binding. This is something you almost get for free as a result of using that lower levels and higher levels well, because only one of them, because of the non overlapping point, because only one of them can include the immediate memory model, which is crucial for the next bit, then you can't have lower levels and higher levels. There may well be mind dust at those levels which is this kind of lovely evocative concept.
2331524	2348124	84	C	0.99954	38:51	56	There may well be flashes of tiny bits of awareness that kind of they never repeat the patterns just gone for it. There's nothing that links it into future versions of itself, just gone. The universe may be replete with these things. It's certainly got plenty of electrons in it. Why not plenty of these things?
2348162	2395870	85	C	0.99999	39:08	122	Who knows? But there's only one closed pocket that maybe I'll come back to four that can enclose this immediate memory module. That's crucial because it's what creates a temporal boundary that in any possible sense could reflect what we experience day to day. Because these tiny if you think of these 4D pockets, if one pocket were to last long enough to encompass, say, a whole day's worth of your experience, it's almost impossible for it to vary enough without breaking to actually contain all the types of complex phenomena we experience during the day. Which is why we think it's much more likely they persist for a short period of time, but nonetheless, our experiences of things persisting for longer.
2396800	2419344	86	C	1.0	39:56	70	Now, the micro level persistence, why is it nonzero? Because if something is infinitesimally small, it probably doesn't help us. If something is the equivalent of a geometric point, no matter how many of them you put together in a physical setting, you're not going to create a line. We want some non zero duration. Well, we've got that for free because the closed pocket has this 4D ontological presence.
2419392	2436244	87	C	0.99986	40:19	43	That's fine. How would you get but it may be really short, far shorter than we experience even this sentence. So what ties that together? Well, because it encloses each millisecond to millisecond, it recreates. Each one is a different piece of awareness.
2436372	2459472	88	C	0.99999	40:36	75	They are not in any way ontologically linked to each other, they are each separate. But because each one encloses the memory module, which is just an information processing thing, you can encode memory and pen and paper. There's nothing magical about this. By referencing it, it knows what was just there before, and that can create we could call it an illusion if you want. Whether that matters is a much more philosophical point.
2459526	2477076	89	C	0.99993	40:59	66	But you create this pseudo time arrow, you have unified insight, because that's what fields do. They unify the insight in all the things that make it up. No information is lost. It is all bound together. So now you've got the recent past and then you've got the bit before that from the previous pocket, and the bit before that and the bit before that.
2477178	2506716	90	C	0.99998	41:17	83	So it's all bound into each individual present. As short as it may be, it has the sense that it's something bigger. Now, in terms of the macro level, days, years between interruptions, this is one where we are far more philosophically relaxed. It may well be that there is no kind of profound sense in which these things are the same entity. It's maybe a ship of theseus type concept, and it's all linked together by some fairly weak long term memory.
2506748	2531832	91	C	0.99	41:46	78	And are we really the same person as we were a week ago, a year ago? We're far less philosophically concerned about that than we are by the micro level and the meter level. But either way, the solutions are the classic personal identity solutions, which have been gone over plenty of times. If you'll give us another five minutes before questions, we'd love to share some more kind of speculative thoughts with you. Getting a thumbs up.
2531886	2547292	92	A	0.99715	42:11	39	Wonderful. In which case, over to Andres for some fun, thought provoking stuff. Well, awesome. Yeah, I mean, it's just kind of like this deeper question. And don't wait for me if my internet runs out for a second.
2547346	2578408	93	A	0.99954	42:27	79	But essentially, how does this influence, for example, beliefs of personal identity? Next slide. I think once you start seeing the universe as a field and with maybe like fleeting topological pockets on it, that actually very significantly informs these classic questions in philosophy like who are you? And do you continue to exist from one moment to the other and indeed the other sheep of the sea's? Is there any kind of metaphysical endearing ego, so to speak?
2578574	2623856	94	A	1.0	42:58	119	And I actually think that each of these views of personal identity could actually be reinterpreted in terms of claims about the field and field topology. So something like closed individualism. This is the belief that you start existing when you're born, stop existing when you die, or maybe you go to heaven. But the point is that you're kind of a separate self that endures over time that is different than other selves. Here we would want to find some kind of enduring sheath or enduring nested architecture that even though maybe each moment of awareness might be its own topological pocket, maybe there's some kind of higher order topological unity that does carry over a person's lifetime.
2623968	2650556	95	A	0.99988	43:43	72	That would be a possible way of raifying in an actual significant physical way the sense of identity over time. Of course, completely speculative. It would be a matter of actually finding it in the field. But that's how you could, I think, Steel men this notion. Next slide, then probably the most compatible and easy to justify view here would be empty individualism, that every moment of experience is ontologically different.
2650738	2688772	96	A	1.0	44:10	103	And again here that would be possible because we would have these fleeting hard boundaries in the spacetime continuum. And as a consequence, you can look at the block universe and say, okay, there's a 40 pocket there, there's a 40 pocket over there. And wherever you see a 40 pocket, that is going to be a subject of experience. And any actual continuity between moments of experience are either just causal or kind of illusory constructed with the memory module, as Chris was suggesting. And then next slide and then finally open individualism, there's this view that we are all one consciousness.
2688916	2735976	97	A	0.58964	44:48	129	We're all Krishna at the bottom layer, so to speak. Well, the way we could justify this within the topological account is that, well, actually at the deepest ontological level, we're all the field, which just happened to be on a given point in time segmentation of that field that prevents information propagation with other regions of the field. So in this case, kind of the topological segmentation would actually be more of an epistemological boundary than it would actually be an ontological boundary. It's like the idea that deep down actually we are the field. It's just that how the field knows itself is constrained by its topology in which case, yeah, it's another way of still meaning we're all one consciousness in a very physically grounded way.
2736078	2792716	98	A	0.7	45:36	138	And, yeah, I think that's it. Unless I put anything else in the next slide oh, yeah, just the last kind of like speculation here is, well, okay, if you are this topological pocket in the field electromagnetic field, how can you in a sense, take a look at that pocket and then reconstruct what the experience feels like. And here perhaps like a fun thought experiment that you could make is thinking about what it would be like to be a photon trapped kind of within a hall of mirrors. There's this article I wrote, 2018 about how to replicate a hyperbolic space using just double mirrors and gradient index optics. And essentially within that structure that has those properties, a photon would have no way of telling the fact that it is not in hyperbolic space.
2792818	2839484	99	A	1.0	46:32	127	In other words, the index of refraction of a container would present itself as the actual geometry of the space from within. So in our brain, presumably, the actual way in which the local field potentials are stitched together and the relative index of refraction could potentially give rise to really arbitrary possible internal geometrics. Where there's the illusion that you're in a space, whether it's in hyperbolic space, in spherical space, some irregular geometry, all of those could be emulated with this paradigm. And that may go a little bit a long way in actually explaining some of the most exotic experiences that people can have, which usually would challenge kind of theories of consciousness. Here there's a way of stitching them together to explain them.
2839522	2841630	100	A	1.0	47:19	9	And I think yeah, the last slide, I believe.
2843840	2848030	101	A	0.99929	47:23	13	Yeah. So this is just illustrating that point, I think this is it.
2850640	2862240	102	C	1.0	47:30	35	And we can leave this up on the screen. This is just where we would go next with it. But this seems like a good point to stop and hear your thoughts. Awesome. Great presentations.
2863720	2913724	103	B	0.98153	47:43	103	Well, Bernie, would you like to give first reflection and I'll write down some questions and look in the live chat? Yeah, sure. I've been thinking a lot about similar stuff like this recently, and the paper presents how the functional theories have the problem of arbitrariness. So, for example, with Markov blanket Markov blankets, that could be the case when there's Markov blankets as ontological observers. And I was thinking that maybe unifying this with the Marko blanket paradigm is that the mark of blanket that on the physical level is implemented using this topological pocket is the conscious mark of blackend.
2913772	2925520	104	D	0.99932	48:33	26	So it's how you were referring the mark of black and solves the content problem, while the topological boundary solves all the other problems. Like objective.
2933660	2934410	105	A	0.48056	48:53	1	Maybe.
2937340	2966652	106	A	0.95839	48:57	67	Yeah, no, that's something very quick to mention. Obviously, we're in the active inference institute podcast. I mean, absolutely. One thing to mention is that our perspective is not in itself necessary or is not necessary and sufficient actually to satisfy the code that we have specified. However, we actually think it's very likely that topological pockets in the electromagnetic field do behave as mark of blankets.
2966716	3047788	107	A	1.0	49:26	205	And so it is a way in which you can actually interface these different paradigms where we would be saying that at the implementation level can then realize the minimization of free energy at the algorithmic level. However, we would be saying, and maybe this would be a little bit of a twist or a nontrivial implication, that if you were to simulate a hierarchically structured mark of blanket system in a computer, it could very well be from a certain abstraction, be minimizing free energy, but it wouldn't be able to solve the boundary problem. In other words, it is sort of like there is a significant overlap, but there are some slight places of a divergence where you might say, hey, a market blanket is actually not enough because it doesn't give you the implementation level explanation for how you get boundaries. Chris, if you want to add anything. Yeah, I mean, just to agree with that, I think this is if you go back to Mars, three levels around kind of what substrate we haven't discussed anything here about the algorithms that are actually taking place on or kind of within the brain that would ultimately get incorporated into the Em field.
3047874	3099740	108	C	0.99997	50:47	131	Clearly you need that stuff as well. None of this makes any contribution to solving these more content problems of consciousness or how we make inferences about the world, how we respond to those. What it does say is that if there are algorithms that solve those problems, and there are some good candidates out there, including yours, they need to be implemented or they need to reflect back to a field for it to become part of someone's unified macrophenomenological experience. If you did some sort of feed forward in Silico version of this, or you did it, you implemented the algorithm using rocks, just lots and lots of rocks laid out forever like that wonderful xkcd example, that is not going to create a bound first person perspective anywhere.
3103220	3134084	109	B	0.98611	51:43	84	Well, a lot to say about that, certainly Markov blankets. And just to define it on a Bayesian graph, so the map not the territory. The Markov blanket is the set of nodes upon which two other sets of nodes are conditionally independent. And that's a purely topological statement. It doesn't matter how far if there even is a spatial association or temporal association, it doesn't matter the distance, which is to say the geometry, but rather the blanket is a purely topological statement.
3134212	3181560	110	B	1.0	52:14	115	And that's what, among other things, we've been exploring with Chris Fields in the physics as information processing and this question about the topology of communication for bounded observers, and as we kind of alluded to with that content problem, the topology of communication is, to use a geometric metaphor, it's orthogonal to the content. You could have two people on the phone sharing different things. You could have a video file with different contents. And so there's really a lot of layers that come into play. And so, I think, from an instrumentalist view, I read your paper as a call for the introduction of topology into what is often only modeled as geometric.
3181900	3216710	111	B	1.0	53:01	78	A call for the integration of electromagnetism rather than a reliance on one or the other. Of course, as introduced from the outset, a pluralism these are not exhaustive nor exclusive accounts, and we don't know what the scope of the possible intelligences and awarenesses are. So from a research perspective, if not beyond, why would we want to limit when we're not only interested in understanding the properties of any given system as we see it today?
3219480	3221780	112	B	0.99992	53:39	11	Any thoughts where I can read a question in the Chat?
3224040	3233240	113	A	0.5	53:44	13	Oh, that sounds great. Turnkey Tyranny writes, how does topology show up phenomenologically?
3238370	3248580	114	A	0.99771	53:58	34	Yeah, this is an excellent, excellent question. I'm happy to take it. Andrews do you want to go back to your notes? We've got that page of notes in there. Sure, let's do that.
3249990	3285002	115	C	0.99344	54:09	88	Because I've asked a very similar question of Andres, and these sort of notes is what resulted in his attempts to explain it to me. Let me take yes, this is very speculative, but one wonderful resource, I think, hopefully I think is wonderful, very worth trying out is we made a series of guided meditations about phenomenology. It's not really kind of like for the sake of spirituality. It's more for the sake of exploring phenomenology with meditation. The last one is called the phenomenology of ontology.
3285146	3341466	116	A	1.0	54:45	127	And that one helps you, in a sense, get a sense of how beliefs about the narrative reality reality, of course, different to believe that electromagnetic field or you're an electromagnetic feels or in a specific version of materialism or something like that. So very different ontologies can give rise to very different feelings. And so there's definitely the worry that, well, if you think a lot about the electromagnetic field, aren't you maybe just interpreting your sensations within that paradigm, but it's kind of like you're overfeeding on top of it. But in a sense, I would argue that actually it's the other way around. With something as generic and structured as electromagnetic field, you can, I think, in principle, explain the phenomenology of any ontology.
3341578	3402382	117	A	0.93047	55:41	153	Like, why does it feel like, for example, that you can kind of merge with the cosmos or something like that? Why does it feel like you can become one with everything in meditation, let's say in various meditation states? Well, with something like the topological explanation for the boundary problem, the way we might interpret that is as the vanishing of internal boundaries. And so there is a significant difference between a global boundary, which is what we focused on, the overall kind of the macroscopic division that says whether you're inside or outside your experience. But something that the electromagnetic field also affords and gives us as kind of part of its rich structure is the possibility of internal boundaries as well, which would be not boundaries that wrap around a 4D object, but rather lower dimensional boundaries like meeting points or convergence points of the field lines within the pocket.
3402446	3466182	118	A	1.0	56:42	172	And so in this account, whenever you have the sensation of solidity, the feeling of, well, I am here, you're there, or there's a boundary between us, that boundary would essentially be an internal boundary, would be a region of the field while the field lines converge or they align, but it's only along a certain cross section. Meaning that actually your experience is still fully unified. You can still go from one point to the other across a perceived barrier because they're still part of the whole experience, they're still connected. In other words, with this kind of data structure, we can arrive at kind of like a lot of phenomenological details and trying to explain them from that perspective. And I think it's going to be an enormous program in the long term involving physicists and mathematicians and exotic states of consciousness to say like, okay, that particular feature of experience that happens on such and such substance in such meditation state, how does that map into the electromagnetic field?
3466236	3470970	119	A	0.99	57:46	19	And I think we will very likely find a lot of non trivial connections with that sort of paradigm.
3474440	3514444	120	B	0.81346	57:54	110	Chris, any thoughts on that? Just to make the link to some of the diagrams on the page, which is if you've got these non 4D closed boundaries, but other types of boundaries, the other types of shapes Andrews was talking about, the drawings on the page are just examples of some of those. As Andrew said, it's not really part of the solution, but it's part of imaginatively exploring where else it might go. So if you've got feature binding, which know I'm seeing a cup and the cup is both blue and cup shaped, that's feature binding. And then the phenomenological binding is my whole experience being unified.
3514572	3529156	121	C	1.0	58:34	47	You can imagine feature binding putting the blueness and the cupness together. That might be something that happens along one of these types of internal boundaries. It might not. It might be that that can be done purely through informational associations. We're kind of agnostic on that.
3529258	3549612	122	C	0.99998	58:49	66	But what's interesting about a 4D topology is within it you can have lots of other complicated topologies provided they are not closed along the fourth dimension, because then you sort of created another little mini bit of bit of awareness. Oh, Bernie. Go ahead. Yeah, I'll jump back to the other page. Yeah, I wanted to say something else not related to this exact question.
3549666	3593724	123	D	0.99222	59:09	117	So if you have ended it, maybe. I'll well, in that case, actually, I'll mention one last thing about how electromagnetic field may be related to phenomenology. A very specific thing that happens on psychedelics, and especially something like DMT is that you may end up having different regions of your experience, have the exact same texture, and have the feeling of synchronization between them. And when that happens, they sort of become the same object, just like spatially distributed. The way I interpret this is whenever the exact same wave equation applies to two regions of your experience and waves can propagate from one region to the other that actually feels like they're the same object.
3593842	3645960	124	A	0.99985	59:53	124	So one kind of, like, natural way in which regions of your phenomenal world might be segmented out into phenomenal objects is by confining how waves can move within the world simulation. And whenever you have what feels like a bound object in your world simulation that I think is highly, highly related to waves being able to smoothly travel within that object but not outside of that object, some kind of wave confinement is happening. I'll add in one more, of course, fun and speculative thought, which is the aboutness the content of what this computation or what this process is unfolding. The aboutness itself can be structure learning. And so even for a fixed electromagnetic topology, you can have variable informational topology.
3646120	3699688	125	B	0.99999	1:00:46	107	Case in point, the von Neumann computer, the CPU architecture. Electromagnetically is not changing topologically. We don't need to reroute the telephone connections for there to be different messages that spread. And so there's a lot of richness in the space you've sketched or surveyed, because even for a fixed topology, we might be able to do compositional binding like blue and cup. And then now we add in a dynamic, multiscale topological unfolding, and then that may connect to different frequencies of, for example, measurements in the EEG, which are really only picking up the synchrony in the outer shell, which might actually play a role.
3699704	3707116	126	B	0.952	1:01:39	25	It's not like the skull matters. You could have a skull removed. It's not the scalp. It's not your hair. It's not necessarily the meninge.
3707228	3736090	127	B	0.99733	1:01:47	60	But what is it? Well, maybe it's something that's infotainment that reflects kind of different regimes of attention that actually does happen to correspond, but it's also localized, and that's that interplay with individuality and oneness that works like Wilbur's, no boundary point towards, but then you got to come back from no boundary because that sentence has to end.
3739340	3794532	128	B	0.99251	1:02:19	97	Bernie. Yeah. I wanted to mention that in relation to the ongoing curves on the physics and information processing that Chris Fields is hosting is one construct that Chris Fields is using in his papers with Michael and Paul is the notion of topological quantum neural networks and topological quantum field theories. So it might be that those are the information processing in this kind of topological maps as well that you've mentioned. Daniel, the grounding for that or how Michael Levin is talking about how bioelectricity is a glue for the various subsystems in the brain.
3794676	3799080	129	D	0.93	1:03:14	10	Or I've seen some recent paper that was pretty late.
3802160	3837770	130	D	0.99	1:03:22	78	I found out recently, which I'm pretty surprised at just recently, that there is a whole field of people that are really trying to apply quantum field theory on the brain. And there was one paper on memory formation. So how you, Chris, talked about memory in terms of the electromagnetic field that might be also great, like pointer. So I'm just putting out different people and papers that I think might be interconnectable with this work. Yeah.
3838140	3903896	131	B	1.0	1:03:58	157	One interesting thing, and you reflected it in your literature review is when people think about quantum and cognitive systems, the ORC, or and other frameworks often are considering quantum as being electronic scale. And therefore a quantum theory of cognition or consciousness would entail some kind of relationship between the way that electrons and photons behave and then some difference that makes a difference at the biological level. And in a way, what we've been exploring with Chris Fields and others is like a bypass where it's like, no, the quantum formalism, quantum topology, quantum information simply and plainly describes cognitive processes where order matters. Now, there may or may not be effects associated with differences that make a difference at the electronic scale, but we don't need that in order to use superposition and all of these different effects that empirically are the case in cognitive systems. We're not waiting for some new mechanistic insight.
3903928	3941416	132	B	0.93848	1:05:03	72	It'd be cool to find out. But what you've presented is not waiting for a different kind of thing to exist. So I'm curious, what experiments or what are the unique experiments that you feel like would give a resounding feeling on what you're talking about? Yeah, happy to take it on. So one kind of, like, very awesome research lead, and then I'll explain what a research paradigm will look like.
3941438	3979300	133	A	0.99854	1:05:41	114	But essentially, first of all, a very powerful lead is meditative cessations. So one of the most insane chapters in mastering the core teachings of the Buddha by Daniel Ingram is the one called The Three Doors, where he describes the phenomenology of experiencing a peak meditation state that's called a cessation. Where you blink out of reality for a second or well, for a subsecond moment, but you just blink out fully and then you get reconstituted. And when you get reconstituted, it tends to be a very blissful, very rejuvenating type experience. But the thing he highlights in that article is what it feels like to be really close to a cessation.
3979640	4018260	134	A	1.0	1:06:19	125	And it actually depends on what type of cessation it is. There's roughly, like, three ways in which it can happen. But the mind blowing thing about that essay, that chapter is he essentially describes different topologies of attention and awareness that may arise where in these moments, close to a cessation, he says, well, in one of those you become kind of a taurus. And the taurus flips the inside and an outside and it twists around and then it cancels out and compresses and then you vanish. And then there's like, another variety where you become a cone, and then all of your attention gets concentrated in the point of the coin of the cone, and then that twists around and then vanishes.
4018680	4064370	135	A	0.93091	1:06:58	117	So there's like this reliable, very exotic kind of like topological transformations that can happen to your attention and awareness. And our guess would be that, well, a cessation, an actual kind of full vanishing, might be related to the topological pocket that your brain is generating, essentially opening up. So that in some maybe nontrivial way, the actual boundary between inside and outside gets dissolved for a fraction of a second, then it gets reconstituted. But something really special happens in that moment that allows for deep insight or something along the lines or relieving a lot of internal stress, maybe like a coronal mass ejection. There might be something going on at the topological level.
4065540	4121952	136	A	1.0	1:07:45	131	Now, in terms of kind of like, further, more sophisticated research paradigms, the thing that we're looking into, there's a lot more to be unpacked and developed here, but is what kind of electromagnetic resonant modes that can supervene on particular graphs, whether we're talking about the Connectum or whether we're talking about the geometric eigen modes. More recent work where you model the entire cortex as a geometric surface, and then you apply neural field theory to that. Well, all of that works so far. Essentially, what it focuses on is oscillations in the electric field without modeling the magnetic field. So I would suspect that many of the Connectum harmonics or geometric eigen modes may be physically unrealizable simply because the magnetic field lines may collide with each other.
4122006	4169824	137	A	0.99953	1:08:42	124	So some of those may not be possible. But one of the crazy, fascinating, unusual predictions that may come out of our whole paradigm is that once we have a really good mapping of what resonant modes arise in the brain on different states of consciousness, we would predict that a when you're fully awake, normally conscious, there will be a very central, big topological loop inside you that whenever you're, let's say, in deep sleep, you might see a kind of mind dust. You might see lots of tiny little pockets. And maybe when you're in an ecstatic experience, like deep meditation, it may do something else. Like the particular resonant modes there may create open field lines that don't form a loop.
4169872	4177380	138	A	0.98975	1:09:29	21	So that is like the sort of crazy, very novel type of prediction, or at least research paradigm that this enables.
4179480	4206252	139	B	0.89829	1:09:39	76	That's really cool. Chris, anything out of that? Yeah, just to draw the link between the fourth bullet here and what Andres is setting out. I don't think any of this is there are some toy bits of modeling you could do that could increase confidence one way or another. But in terms of an actual experimental prediction, you would need to combine this with some theory of which bits of the brain are doing this.
4206386	4227764	140	C	0.99	1:10:06	80	So if Ward and Guevara are right that it's the thalamus that's doing this stuff, we would expect to see around the thalmus a closed pocket. And it should be possible. In principle, this is probably billions of pounds worth of effort. But to model the thalamus and the surrounding bits enough, and you can find out if there would actually be a closed pocket, if there would be one. In theory, you can see roughly where it would be.
4227882	4267788	141	C	0.85165	1:10:27	119	Obviously, it moves around a bit, but it's normally around here you then should be able to I don't know if ethical consent is even possible for something like this, but disrupt that with a very, very targeted external Em source. Think transcranial stimulation, but just laser precise. If we've now broken the bid around the thalamus but left everything else more or less untouched, we predict if warding of our plus us is correct, we predict that your first personal awareness would blink out. Like deep sleep, like anesthesia like a meditative cessation. If we're wrong, or the combination of us is wrong, then you will still be conscious, but you might just experience something really bloody weird.
4267884	4298590	142	C	0.99997	1:11:07	91	But your contents have changed, not the actual container of consciousness hasn't blinked in and out, and then you could apply that to other bits of the brain wherever you think there's. Our other prediction is that it must be enclosing the immediate memory model, but we're unsure exactly where that is as well. That is also an outstanding research question. It feels like doable in our lifetimes, I think, but none of this is give us ten grand and we'll do it this summer. None of it is that easy.
4300640	4347240	143	B	0.99997	1:11:40	88	Yeah, very interesting. And Neuroimaging already utilizes electromagnetic measurements and there are things that currently are described within a biomolecular paradigm, like, for example, changes in effective connectivity between different regions of the brain. Well, there's already a tract, let's just say, between certain brain regions. And so maybe if the action potentials traveling down that 100 lane highway are aligned, then it's going to be like this rippling em continuity. Whereas if they were totally disarrayed along that track, then you wouldn't have those two regions contained.
4347320	4423460	144	B	0.99999	1:12:27	151	But it'd be like kind of like two regions, like blowing smoke rings at each other if they had enough synchrony to push through the trouble and the friction such that there was a pocket that was able to you squirt hot water into a cold pool. There's ways to angle it and do it in all of the combinations of viscosity that it just diffuses instantly. There's also ways where there would be a high temperature toroidal form that could pass through a colder media because it maintains a topological boundary. A lot of these things are again described anatomically or molecularly or electronically, but the duality between electronics and magnetism is not contentious. So there may be a lot of phenomena that could be revisited, and I don't know whether that would provide indirect evidence with what we already know or suggest new plausible experiments, but it's an approach.
4427120	4445508	145	A	0.99889	1:13:47	61	Yeah. Welcome it. And thanks, Bernie as well for the pointers towards, like, Chris Fields and Michael Levin. I may come back to you for the QFT on memory formation in case I've spotted some stuff on that, but I'm not sure I've spotted the one it sounded like you were referring to. So yeah, it's an exciting sort of research.
4445674	4482796	146	A	0.99988	1:14:05	92	Yeah. One last connection there with active inference is you have the electronic and the magnetic fields influencing each other. That's the basis of what philosophers might consider in terms of this epipenomenalism or not question. And if we had an active inference situation of two songbirds, the active states of one become the sensory of the other. So if they were just passing messages every single time step to each other, then they would both be engaged in their own blanketed perception on the inbound and action selection on the outbound.
4482988	4522140	147	B	1.0	1:14:42	90	And so they could basically be in this continual oscillatory relationship with causal efficacy both ways. Again, or you could design a situation where the causal efficacy only flowed one way. But the point is, this is a topological approach that lets us explore that in a way that isn't only appealing to molecular or material phenomena and then leaving the whole question, which is the whole question of the informational. And the closure and the binding. Leaving all those to be resolved by slicing and dicing with a scalpel.
4522880	4527870	148	B	0.99993	1:15:22	13	Which is not even a viable option as far as we already understand.
4530560	4543040	149	B	0.63047	1:15:30	30	Bernie and then the authors, what are your closing thoughts or how would you suggest that people get in the game or what should they do with their own topologies?
4547810	4556030	150	D	0.99984	1:15:47	18	Maybe I could note that Andres could expand on, if he wants to know. Synthetic valence and neuroanalink.
4561130	4621978	151	A	0.99986	1:16:01	116	Well, yeah, STB introduced by Mike in 2015 on Principalia about the correspondence respondents between imagery of an object for many years now. You can see a 2020 presentation about it and there's many more content about it. But the main idea, the way it would actually work out here is the regions of the topologically closed field that behave like a smooth field may potentially correspond to a very blissful experience. So I'm very optimistic of the potential of okay, like something like a peak blissful experience, peak five meodmt experience or something like that. It would probably, I suspect, have like a very internally simplified topology where the geometry is as smooth as possible.
4622064	4677322	152	A	0.99994	1:17:02	125	So that's kind of like an interesting prediction or angle on all of this, I think. Yeah. Maybe to wrap up, I would say that we would enormously welcome anybody who is technically savvy for doing interesting simulations of the electromagnetic field. I mean, we're doing ourselves some really interesting experiments and in combination with classical neural networks, but anybody's kind of like the intersection between machine learning electromagnetic fields and simulations and statistics, machine learning essentially that kind of intersection is something that could really potentially accelerate these research. If you had the technical competency to sort of work on the analysis I was describing of finding the electromagnetic resonant modes of a graph and then analyzing its topology, we would love to collaborate.
4677386	4688802	153	A	0.97813	1:17:57	33	That's like the sort of content we dream of producing in the next year or two. Thank you. And thank you for having us. It's been really, really appreciate it. I appreciate that.
4688856	4689570	154	B	0.99323	1:18:08	1	Chris.
4691990	4704830	155	C	0.99976	1:18:11	37	Nothing substantial to add. Just my thanks. As you know, I've scribbled down some thoughts about the Markov blankets and about some of those different research areas. As you know, we're getting stuff from this as. Yeah.
4704920	4723050	156	C	0.52	1:18:24	59	And hopefully this helps reach a few new people who might come up with either a brilliant idea why something we've missed, and this just can't work. For some reason, we want to hear that as well. But even more constructively ways that this could be tested or built out more gradually modeled. Yeah. Thank you for having us.
4723200	4745410	157	A	0.99999	1:18:43	39	Cool. New ways of thinking within even one topological frame enables new action selection in the area. And the era of video chatting. We've made new topological relationships, new connectivities that then disperse yet again. And so it continues.
4747110	4752194	158	B	0.99994	1:19:07	15	Thank you all, though. Thank you so much. Till next time. Very lovely. Thank you.
4752232	4753630	159	D	0.99983	1:19:12	5	Amazing stuff. See ya. Bye.
