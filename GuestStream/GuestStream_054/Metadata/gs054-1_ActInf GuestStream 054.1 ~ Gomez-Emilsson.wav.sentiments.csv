5910	7618	B	0.9103710651397705	Hello and welcome, everyone.
7784	10638	B	0.8564463257789612	This is active inference Livestream.
10814	14066	B	0.9018252491950989	Guest stream number 54.1.
14248	17042	B	0.8721466064453125	It's August 25, 2023.
17176	23870	B	0.8688149452209473	Today we're going to be hearing about electromagnetic field topology as a solution to the boundary problem of consciousness.
24030	30906	B	0.8588141202926636	This is going to be a copresentation, followed by a discussion with our guests here.
31008	36774	B	0.8088672161102295	So I will leave it to everyone to introduce themselves and present and discuss however they prefer.
36902	38886	B	0.9591770768165588	And thank you again for joining.
38998	39660	B	0.6087223887443542	Please.
42290	45310	A	0.9889503121376038	Thank you so much for having us, Daniel.
45650	46014	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
46052	48842	A	0.888462245464325	I'm Andres Co, founder of Qualia Research Institute.
48906	58910	A	0.5891208052635193	And, yeah, I'm here with Liber Chris, co author of this paper, and Lieber, a volunteer and Wiki extraordinaire for QRI.
58990	61330	A	0.7203803658485413	But yeah, go ahead, Chris, and lieber.
62870	65010	C	0.7314164638519287	Yeah, no more to say.
65080	65850	C	0.6476652026176453	That's plenty.
65950	67240	C	0.81409752368927	Let's get into the detail.
69610	79114	D	0.6428353786468506	Yeah, I'm co working with QRI and a lot into Active Instruments, and I'm trying to unify QRI with Active Instruments a lot.
79232	80220	D	0.6092650294303894	And yeah.
84270	85020	A	0.9154167175292969	Beautiful.
86270	87020	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
87790	89030	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
89110	109330	A	0.5176979899406433	Essentially, our outline of this presentation is going to essentially walk you through some of the key ideas of the paper and kind of like trying to illustrate them or making them a little bit more intuitive, fairly high level, although we will actually present kind of the core argument.
110070	124680	A	0.6569812893867493	The main thing to point out here next slide is that the magnetic theories of consciousness, I guess, like, 20 years ago, they sounded like a total crackpot type.
138560	150200	C	0.6391098499298096	Yeah, I've still got a good connection, so we can give him a moment or two, and if not, I'll pick up from what was the crackpot, see if he reconnects.
150300	155780	B	0.7294043302536011	My gosh, sorry, Andres, please repeat from crackpot.
157320	158196	A	0.44471055269241333	Oh, my God.
158298	158852	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
158986	175376	A	0.5946257710456848	Over the last 20 years, however, there's been an explosion of interest in electromagnetic theories of consciousness and serious peer reviewed publications about them, especially the last ten and then five years, kind of like a variable exponential explosion in terms of a number of serious articles published.
175508	196156	A	0.8581690788269043	And one of the very kind of key, amazing kind of contributions that something like an electromagnetic theory of consciousness can offer to the overall ecosystem of philosophy of mind is that it provides a way to solve question for how information can be combined.
196268	205828	A	0.8197868466377258	I mean, essentially, when you have information distributed, how is it possible that they can be simultaneously part of some kind of, like, unified whole?
205994	217370	A	0.6859027147293091	And electromagnetic theories of consciousness are just very proud to say, well, the electromagnetic field is ontologically unitary, it's already unified, so there's not much of a problem here.
218380	227084	A	0.8426610231399536	However, once you kind of have this unity, then the question becomes, well, but how do you actually draw a boundary around it?
227122	229630	A	0.5238783955574036	So actually, you just traded one problem for another.
231920	233470	A	0.8457779288291931	Dig into the details there.
239170	239582	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
239636	242990	C	0.9225020408630371	Shall I take us through the literature review as context for this?
243140	250210	C	0.8593921065330505	And then Andreas will come back to kind of give you the solution that we think can fit with electromagnetic fields.
250790	252722	C	0.4952281415462494	So, yeah, the boundary problem.
252856	258802	C	0.7937273383140564	So binding problem you heard just now into a first approximation that is, whatever you think might make up consciousness.
258866	260546	C	0.7664698958396912	Maybe it's neurons firing.
260658	264034	C	0.7810223698616028	Maybe it's some sort of magical qualia at the bottom of the universe.
264082	272234	C	0.8543723821640015	Whatever you think it is, these small things need to be bound together to reflect the complex phenomenology we have.
272272	273674	C	0.7381335496902466	We see lots of things all at once.
273712	276570	C	0.6728532910346985	Right now, I'm smelling the flowers outside.
276640	278362	C	0.797838032245636	I've got the laptop screen in front of me.
278416	281966	C	0.6675859689712524	There's lots of stuff happening all at once in a unified way.
282068	283102	C	0.6369050145149231	So that's the binding problem.
283156	284526	C	0.6727448105812073	We won't do more on that here.
284548	287214	C	0.8616517186164856	We'll sort of assume some familiarity with it.
287252	296754	C	0.62851881980896	But then the boundary problem is, well, once you've got a mechanism that creates the binding between these lower level entities, why would that mechanism ever stop?
296872	301630	C	0.7392802238464355	Because clearly, our awareness, our phenomenology doesn't go on forever.
301790	303738	C	0.6335211396217346	We don't know what's happening in Alpha Centurion.
303774	305858	C	0.7504205107688904	Our awareness is not unbounded.
306034	312950	C	0.7879136204719543	And as soon as you realize that you need boundaries around something, a number of things suddenly don't quite make sense.
313020	320566	C	0.5347404479980469	So Owen Schroedinger of physics Fame flagged this up as one of the things that he felt was completely unresolved.
320598	329066	C	0.6742581129074097	So despite his kind of vast intellect and his contributions elsewhere, he felt that this puzzle was one of the things that he described it as.
329088	332450	C	0.5680127143859863	When he turns his mind to it, everything just evaporates.
332550	333946	C	0.943418562412262	None of it makes sense anymore.
333978	335502	C	0.7895016074180603	He can't get a grip on the problem.
335636	338862	C	0.654423177242279	And he described the problem, as you can see on the screen.
338916	347140	C	0.6766283512115479	He was saying, why is it that my identity is at the intermediate level, this kind of roughly human shaped body?
347750	350962	C	0.7395411133766174	And you can say, okay, we mostly mean the central nervous system.
351016	363400	C	0.7973333597183228	But either way, this broad entity has lots of smaller things inside it cells, organs, human bodies, and lots of things above it cities, states, solar systems, universes, and so on.
364170	368620	C	0.7132840156555176	Why is our self consciousness always at this one level?
369070	383754	C	0.5955610871315002	And if you describe that as a problem to somebody who's never heard of it before or never thought of it before this happened to me just last Friday, they might say, well, it's obviously just like the body stops.
383802	387678	C	0.7178268432617188	Like, the skull stops here, or like, my arm stops here.
387844	390698	C	0.6153052449226379	Of course, it's not going out to Arthur Centurion.
390794	396014	C	0.523885190486908	Why would and it's a very intuitive, immediate human reaction.
396142	400850	C	0.6043667197227478	But you probe it a little bit, as Schrodinger did, and it kind of falls apart.
401190	413314	C	0.6791985034942627	Because if you're a neuron firing somewhere in the central nervous system and you're being initiated by a neuron in the peripheral nervous system, well, how do you know to stop binding?
413442	417238	C	0.7487112879753113	How do you know that there's a boundary that stops at the edge of the central nervous system?
417404	425100	C	0.8246659636497498	Or if your fingers are holding onto a tool and you're getting feedback from that tool, you're driving a car, it can feel like you're part of that car.
425550	435770	C	0.7178252935409546	Where does the system know where the boundary is because most of these things that we observe have only observer dependent boundaries.
435930	442174	C	0.7911258935928345	If you've got a wheel in a car rolling along the road, from one perspective, it looks like the wheel is separate from the road.
442292	447426	C	0.6457048058509827	But if you're a tiny ant or something and the car is parked, these things all may feel like they're one object.
447608	450578	C	0.8487125039100647	And this was when Schrodinger turned his mind to this.
450744	451666	C	0.5406686067581177	It puzzled him.
451688	453710	C	0.747553288936615	So let's give him the benefit of the doubt.
453790	457160	C	0.7860808372497559	Let's say that there's something real to be puzzled through here.
458330	462786	C	0.8314988017082214	This issue applies both to the example I started with around building up in small units.
462898	471210	C	0.6460708975791931	But also if you're a cosmo panpsychist, you believe that there is one universal consciousness, and we are like a god playing with its puppets.
471710	475526	C	0.4947836101055145	In that case, you still have the same question because you're still demarcating boundaries.
475638	477302	C	0.6841199398040771	You just get the mirror image.
477366	482250	C	0.5197297930717468	We'll mostly focus on the idea of expanding up from small things because that's closer to the orthodoxy.
482330	487870	C	0.4941137135028839	But you can't solve this problem magically by declaring a single consciousness.
488850	492930	C	0.6714166402816772	Okay, so Schrodinger didn't say much more about this.
493000	495250	C	0.7338091731071472	He just said that this was a puzzle.
495990	503422	C	0.8344542980194092	The first person we found that really formalized this and gave it the name boundary problem was Rosenberg.
503486	506760	C	0.8795544505119324	And it was a number of pieces, late 90s, early two thousand s.
507450	513590	C	0.6764369606971741	And he uses the phrase siller and Cryptus, but it's exactly the same idea as Schrodinger had.
513660	517000	C	0.505017101764679	One of them is, well, why aren't there lots of small things?
517770	522614	C	0.7399969696998596	I think that might have been the silla, that might have been the nine headed monster.
522742	526058	C	0.7847023606300354	And then on the other hand, what about the things that we are nested within?
526144	527430	C	0.7061358094215393	And he called that the Cryptus.
527510	535790	C	0.5118685960769653	And he said, it's very hard to posit a genuinely robust mechanism that would stop it in both directions.
536450	541538	C	0.6299854516983032	You can imagine a reason why lots of small things get bound together, but why would the binding stop?
541704	547220	C	0.579937756061554	And his view in framing this problem is that no one had solved it.
548550	563254	C	0.7276726961135864	Winding on to Andres and I chatting about this last year and building on some of Qri's foundational work in this area, we wanted to know, well, what's happened since Rosenberg framed this and Schroding was so puzzled by it.
563372	566060	C	0.7184043526649475	Surely someone's come up with a few solutions to it.
566750	574506	C	0.8782939314842224	So Q standard database driven literature review, and you've got the details there.
574688	576300	C	0.6324545741081238	Fairly standard stuff.
577710	589214	C	0.610850989818573	What we looked looking across the Scopus database, we only found five papers that seemed to be relevant about the boundary problem, compared to 92 on the binding and 47 on the combination problem.
589332	594634	C	0.7551554441452026	So some of these related problems, and in our intro, we kind of went straight from binding to boundary.
594682	595006	C	0.5817788243293762	They are.
595028	598466	C	0.7480559349060059	So if you're thinking about one, you really should be thinking about the other.
598648	600850	C	0.5639063715934753	Well, that is not reflected in the literature.
601190	603060	C	0.8661108016967773	We did a bit more puzzling around.
603750	608600	C	0.7370906472206116	People don't seem to be referring to this by other names, or when they are, they haven't solved it either.
609450	612646	C	0.6597685217857361	So it felt that there was something worth going at here.
612668	615580	C	0.8248457908630371	And this is what initiated the paper.
616830	625530	C	0.6896910667419434	What we did find, though, partly in those five papers and partly in looking around, we do find families of possible solutions.
626430	628246	C	0.4904451370239258	And there's no clear winner.
628278	632986	C	0.619036853313446	But maybe philosophy rarely has a clear winner for anything, so maybe that's an unreasonable expectation.
633098	639840	C	0.757810115814209	But there's definitely open questions for each class of theories that have been put out there to solve this problem.
640850	649662	C	0.876501202583313	So the first of these loosely termed algorithmic, so computational causal structure theories, I'm just trying to summarize them into one term.
649726	654820	C	0.5235269665718079	Some of the examples there IIT, of course, very well known global workspace theory as well.
656070	660034	C	0.8958960771560669	They will tend to say that things bind together when they're in a particular pattern.
660082	674220	C	0.8304284811019897	So you might imagine a database that references itself or the working memory of a computer, or as soon as things are somehow linked together in a causal sense, in IIT, there's a particular type of pattern, but nonetheless it's an abstract informational relationship.
675870	680586	C	0.6148293614387512	Those papers don't tend to be super explicit about defining boundaries.
680698	688990	C	0.788228452205658	Normally, IIT will normally say, here's our system, and now let's ask within that system, where is the highest phi?
690050	692370	C	0.837439239025116	They sort of just say, take the boundaries on that.
692440	694626	C	0.7224695682525635	No one has said, let's take the whole universe as a system.
694728	699570	C	0.7526994347572327	The math is already virtually impossible, even toy systems.
700310	711078	C	0.711668074131012	But reading between the lines or reading some of the other papers around it, there's something about if you had a hi fi area surrounded by lots of lo fi areas, well, it's natural that it's the bit that's high.
711164	719370	C	0.6983036994934082	And there's this principle of exclusion that says you take the highest one in a system, maybe you have to specify a system before it makes sense to ask that.
719520	727130	C	0.7034744024276733	And if you took the highest bit out, somehow you just remove some of those causal interconnections that create that highness.
727470	735790	C	0.7886670827865601	Whatever's left will have a slightly lower bit of phi, and that is now where the sort of locus of consciousness resides.
736610	752258	C	0.6009723544120789	This may well work, kind of the maths would need working out, I think Andres and I are initially skeptical, but because as best as we can see, no one's really created complicated maps and discussed what would happen when you've got different mixtures of densities that are shifting over time.
752424	754610	C	0.6630280613899231	What stops it from being arbitrary?
755030	759730	C	0.8514572381973267	Certainly there are questions to be had, and we can come back to this a bit if we want to talk about it further.
759810	763394	C	0.5467484593391418	But suffice it to say it's not a guaranteed solution.
763442	765494	C	0.6944857239723206	And there's one critique that we cite.
765542	775974	C	0.9085835218429565	There resonance theories, a link between those and electromagnetic fields now as well, in that the main progenitor of these theories.
776022	783690	C	0.9109191298484802	Pam Hunt would say that the main resonance which he sees binding happening together in human consciousness is en fields.
783770	791418	C	0.9097111225128174	So there are links between these as well, and maybe the informational patterns are being encoded in resonance or quantum entanglement or Em fields.
791434	793618	C	0.856431782245636	So there can be links between these as well.
793784	804514	C	0.730550229549408	The resonance theory that says that binding happens when things are in the same frequency, simple enough, or when they are close enough, and that becomes a little bit more debatable.
804562	808610	C	0.7267736792564392	But what does that really mean, the boundaries?
808690	818250	C	0.5914537310600281	There is a conceptual solution for this, which is the slowest shared resonance in a system, but many of the same issues apply as with the algorithmic.
819070	829834	C	0.587430477142334	But again, if experimenters, it may be possible to create one that works there quantum theories entanglement is what binds it together, at least in some of them.
829952	835886	C	0.8435468673706055	So what causes two experiences, a blue cup and the shape of the cup to be bound together into one?
835988	848686	C	0.614635705947876	Well, it's that the blueness and the cupness, I'm obviously talking at a very high level of abstraction, but those are somehow quantum entangled with each other that would indeed create, to the best of our physics knowledge today, a kind of ontologically real binding.
848718	851570	C	0.6986931562423706	And that's quite an attractive part of the solution.
852230	854286	C	0.7202484011650085	Well, what would stop those boundaries?
854478	855934	C	0.8127002120018005	There is the monogamy principle.
855982	865798	C	0.613106906414032	Things can only be maximally entangled up to a certain point, but there's a very, very open question about whether that sort of thing would enable the kind of macro phenomenology we have.
865884	872410	C	0.5456638932228088	But in the paper we say all of these are worth exploring, let's keep investigating.
873070	883070	C	0.6072859168052673	And then there's the one I started with an instruction like maybe it's the boundary of the central nervous system, but hopefully even a small amount of scrutiny causes that one to collapse.
885810	894020	C	0.7305999994277954	And most of these explicitly say that more work is needed, more math is needed, and certainly that will be true of what we're presenting here as well.
894550	897060	C	0.7058209776878357	What we want to do is add a new one to this list.
897910	915894	C	0.5200371742248535	And the inspiration for this is that, well, if the Em field accounts present a solution to the binding problem they certainly believe they do, there's lots of literature on it, then maybe they can also provide a solution to the boundary problem.
915932	917820	C	0.7982091307640076	Given how closely related they are.
918590	923034	C	0.5852153301239014	When you read those accounts, they don't quite have it nailed yet.
923072	931406	C	0.5873470902442932	The most common explanation they give is a kind of inverse square law rule where, well, the strength of a field just becomes so small so quickly.
931508	940394	C	0.6556556820869446	By the time you're a centimeter out from the thalamus or by the time you're at the edges of the skull these fields have just evaporated into they've decohered.
940442	943520	C	0.5928912162780762	They're indistinguishable from the neural noise all around us.
944390	949682	C	0.6239635348320007	That might be okay if you're okay with a fuzzy boundary and we'll come on to that in a SEC.
949816	956230	C	0.9006170034408569	Others motivate a phase transition, a bit like quantum entanglement or a bit like the exact resonance of resonance theories.
956730	960120	C	0.7752461433410645	But those phase transitions are pretty speculative as well.
961210	968758	C	0.8843518495559692	So the solution we will come to and andrews will outline is a different aspect of em fields.
968774	971430	C	0.7476440668106079	It's not fuzzy boundaries and it's not a vague phase transition.
971510	977020	C	0.5669721364974976	It's an entirely different topological solution which we argue can solve the problems.
978750	983310	C	0.7172252535820007	What we think is worth doing, though, is to make that boundary problem more explicit.
983650	990810	C	0.7692681550979614	What you've heard both from Schrodinger and from Rosenberg is this idea of kind of like why aren't the cells inside you conscious?
990970	993634	C	0.6466526389122009	Or if they are conscious, why don't we ever experience that?
993672	1000900	C	0.7024714350700378	And again, going up, what about cities and families and things or group chants or football stadiums, that sort of stuff.
1002310	1013302	C	0.83730149269104	And there is a scholar who argues, based on resonance theory, that actually when we are in a group chanting or a group dancing situation, our consciousness does in fact move to that level as well.
1013356	1017500	C	0.7817807197570801	And it's speculative, but there's much to be thought about.
1018110	1025660	C	0.703076958656311	So to make this problem more precise, we've got five, and I'll just give you the one or two sentences on each.
1026750	1035470	C	0.7776498794555664	The hard boundary problem is this sense that a fuzzy boundary probably isn't good enough.
1035540	1038382	C	0.8691383600234985	And let's kind of explain a bit more why.
1038516	1050850	C	0.7202109694480896	If you have something like a wave or the example of the wheel I gave before touching the ground or indeed any connection between any physical atoms, the closer you look to it, the less obvious it is where it stops.
1052070	1064798	C	0.6739513874053955	The boundaries of my skull may feel very precise to me, but if there were an alien the size of a solar system, their ability to perceive this would most likely just blurs imperceptibly into its surroundings.
1064994	1068220	C	0.6003045439720154	These things feel hard, but they're not really hard.
1070750	1080858	C	0.7571542859077454	At the edges of our awareness, there's this sense that things might feel fuzzy, but at some point it just sort of stops, might feel like it might feel infinite.
1080954	1089550	C	0.7270241975784302	There are states of mind where we can feel an infinite awareness, but probing that further, it doesn't truly encompass everything and go on forever.
1090450	1091354	C	0.7810568809509277	At this edge.
1091402	1095250	C	0.7574234008789062	Our assertion is that sometimes this feels like a hard boundary.
1095750	1105326	C	0.7241259217262268	And if it ever sometimes feels like a hard boundary, then you need some mechanism that is capable of a hard edge in a way that these physical phenomena typically aren't.
1105518	1113782	C	0.5454925894737244	So that's the hard boundary definitely happy to drill into more of any of this or any of the other five if they're not making enough sense in the Q A.
1113916	1128006	C	0.624888002872467	So lower levels we've covered mean the great example of this is we know that when we go to sleep, some part of our consciousness, at least the bit that we remember, switches off, yet the brain remains active.
1128118	1136750	C	0.6621850728988647	The lower levels boundary problem could be reinterpreted as saying why doesn't our awareness just shift to another part of the brain at that point?
1136820	1139760	C	0.4770042300224304	It certainly doesn't seem to most of the time.
1140370	1143646	C	0.5848634243011475	Higher level boundary problem, we've had that from the beginning.
1143678	1144674	C	0.5830154418945312	That's why doesn't it go up?
1144712	1145842	C	0.7254580855369568	Maybe it does sometimes.
1145976	1149938	C	0.6603962182998657	Certainly doesn't normally the private boundary problem.
1150024	1162840	C	0.8346061706542969	So this is now, rather than going down into ourselves or up into the universe in which we are nested, this is more take two of those boundaries, me and you, me and one other person.
1164010	1167894	C	0.5363243818283081	Why can we not bridge into each other's minds, at least not routinely?
1167942	1172038	C	0.6522464156150818	Those who claim to do so have struggled to replicate it and get it into the mainstream.
1172214	1173334	C	0.8020919561386108	So this is privacy.
1173382	1179498	C	0.6471315026283264	There appears to be some limitation that stops these mechanisms from connecting with each other.
1179584	1193534	C	0.6024207472801208	And yet if it is slowest shared resonance or if it is highest informational phi in IIT, why is it not possible to construct a system in which the highest phi is now an interconnected one and our consciousness has collapsed?
1193662	1197390	C	0.6497166752815247	Maybe it is possible, and that's just a technical endeavor we haven't yet achieved.
1197550	1204054	C	0.5412465333938599	But either way, there's something that's challenging about it, either as a technical barrier or as a philosophical one.
1204252	1210040	C	0.6921759247779846	The last one is a temporal boundary problem because everything we've said so far is in space.
1210490	1219450	C	0.7982622981071472	But the kind of entities and experiences we're talking about are not zero time, space based activities.
1220350	1222390	C	0.8100267648696899	They have a temporal persistence.
1222550	1228620	C	0.8238183856010437	So what is it that puts boundaries around a micro moment of experience?
1229070	1236720	C	0.8187016844749451	What is it that enables us to experience the end of a note and still retain that idea of the start of the note and experience them together?
1238370	1242226	C	0.8972703218460083	And how does this extend through broader experiences of the self.
1242328	1245890	C	0.8365881443023682	So those are the five puzzles.
1246230	1251634	C	0.6264562010765076	Hopefully that's enough of a qualitative overview so that you know what we're trying to solve at least.
1251832	1257910	C	0.5877601504325867	And if I hand back over to Andrews now, he will give you an entirely new solution to these puzzles.
1259050	1259800	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
1261050	1261666	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1261698	1272214	A	0.8786283135414124	Going a little bit broader too, in that what Chris just talked about is kind of the criteria for the boundary problem, kind of like breaking down the boundary problem into subcomponents.
1272342	1277762	A	0.8158579468727112	And then there's also, more broadly, things that you would want out of a theory of consciousness.
1277846	1283610	A	0.7615847587585449	And so the solution to the boundary problem ideally will also, in a sense, satisfy these constraints.
1283770	1290138	A	0.5527918338775635	And these constraints are framing variance nominated phenomenalism and no strong emergence.
1290234	1291390	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1291970	1297846	A	0.8429545164108276	So framing variance essentially can be recapariance.
1297978	1308182	A	0.6799464225769043	The fact that whatever structure is giving rise to the boundary shouldn't in a way, be frame specific, shouldn't just depend on how you're looking at an object.
1308236	1316410	A	0.8014546036720276	It should be kind of like an intrinsic objective property of the object that if you move it around, it shouldn't, in principle, be changing in that way.
1316480	1317450	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1319310	1320710	A	0.7112826108932495	Non epiphenomenalism.
1320790	1333086	A	0.8083853125572205	For those who are not familiar with the term, this is the idea that for a particular conscious physical system, there corresponds an experience, but that there's no causal influence from that conscious experience back into the system.
1333268	1340160	A	0.7221018671989441	And there's like, various ways of kind of trying to ground the question of, hey, why is epiphenomenalism not the case?
1341330	1347022	A	0.8466768860816956	There's kind of differences in emphasis by each of these questions, but they're roughly pointing in the same direction.
1347166	1359122	A	0.6468048095703125	One important question is how is it possible that we can talk in detail about our experience, but the way we actually framed it in the paper that we find the most compelling is how was evolution able to recruit?
1359266	1362630	A	0.7496264576911926	Coherent, globally bound states.
1362780	1378558	A	0.5604068040847778	If they're not causally significant, if they're not causally useful, it would just be an extraordinary coincidence that it just happens to happen simultaneously along with something that seems to be computationally significant and encompass a whole lot of information at the same time.
1378724	1379790	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1381410	1384650	A	0.6314958930015564	And then we also have no strong emergence.
1384810	1393054	A	0.7987419366836548	There's this quote from David that says, the Lagrangian of the standard model does not break down inside one's own skull.
1393182	1406678	A	0.7226791381835938	Meaning we want the laws of physics to apply universally to whatever explanation space we come up with that we don't want to introduce special cases or say like, oh, there's like a special different field in the brain, or anything of the sort.
1406764	1419638	A	0.5827428698539734	We want to have a homogeneous set of physics that as simple as it gets, as mainstream as it gets in terms of appealing to standard physics.
1419814	1421210	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1422270	1429142	A	0.8272675275802612	So, yeah, the overarching solution and explanation space, that is electromagnetic field topology.
1429206	1437370	A	0.9070380330085754	So, first of all, I will walk you through in what way this explanation space satisfies the kind of like three constraints that I provided.
1437450	1441326	A	0.8756880164146423	And then Chris is going to explain how it addresses each of the sub problems.
1441508	1442510	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1443810	1446660	A	0.6827312111854553	So, yeah, next one.
1448470	1459078	A	0.7920649647712708	Yeah, if you actually kind of look at these amazing reconstructions of the electromagnetic field of stellar bodies, you would see that nothing trivial about it.
1459164	1463110	A	0.7373171448707581	There's like all of this incredible complexity and richness in structure.
1463610	1467690	A	0.5999049544334412	A lot of it is very counterintuitive, not something that you would see with a naked eye.
1468030	1477366	A	0.8750918507575989	You require superimposing, a lot of pictures from the different regions of the spectrum to kind of get a picture of what's going on in the electromagnetic field.
1477488	1485342	A	0.7485235929489136	And yeah, it has kind of these elongated, weird plasma tubes and circular structures and loops and so on.
1485476	1489590	A	0.8544195294380188	So it's a very structurally rich environment.
1489770	1490770	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1491750	1501422	A	0.8956373333930969	And the way in which something like the topology of that field will satisfy the criteria that wet line is as follows.
1501486	1509000	A	0.8630176186561584	So if you look at the electromagnetic field of the sun, sometimes this phenomena called magnetic reconnection happens.
1509370	1515150	A	0.5935678482055664	And this is actually responsible for solar flares and kernel mass ejections.
1515250	1529120	A	0.9084136486053467	It has to do with when plasma tubes that are the electromagnetic confinement structures touch with each other and so they can open up and spray plasma into the outer space.
1529810	1536270	A	0.6973697543144226	The key thing to point about here is that this is actually a topological change to the field.
1536420	1549374	A	0.7902892827987671	It's not just any kind of physical change when you have a solar flare coronal mass ejection that is the effect of a macroscopic gigantic topological transformation.
1549502	1559186	A	0.7314822673797607	What this slide is trying to get at is that whether a system experienced magnetic reconnection or not will not depend on your frame of reference.
1559298	1573978	A	0.5463395714759827	And the very simple reason is that Lorentz transforms simply squeeze and stretch, but they never actually reconnect or cut or add any kind of topological change.
1574064	1579514	A	0.7448765635490417	In other words, a Lorentz transform will leave a topological event untouched.
1579642	1588526	A	0.7865467667579651	So in that sense okay, like topology as an explanation space for why this is framing variant, it definitely fits the bill.
1588628	1589630	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1592710	1601170	A	0.786461591720581	Importantly, too, in the brain, we also can tackle the question of, like, in what way the field is not epiphenomenal.
1601990	1615346	A	0.7423387169837952	There's a lot of research on local field potentials in the which are little microscopic electric oscillations, and they do seem to actually have causal effects on the activity of neurons.
1615378	1622582	A	0.6577770113945007	In other words, people might believe, in a sense, that, hey, brainwaves are kind of just a reflection of neural activity.
1622726	1638410	A	0.8048834204673767	But the thing that something like transcranial magnetic stimulation makes clear is that on top of that, they actually feed back into the probability for neurons to fire, especially the probability for neurons to fire in synchrony or in a state of coherence.
1638490	1654950	A	0.8537946939468384	In other words, the actual causal structure of electromagnetic field and how it connects to neural activity is this dual causal arrow where neural activity influences local field potentials, neural activity influences activity via synapse.
1666520	1668624	C	0.7408996224403381	Yeah, we've been the victim of the connection.
1668672	1672310	C	0.8154868483543396	Again, let's hope it comes back as quickly as it did last time.
1676220	1680600	B	0.5448961853981018	Yes, there's a lot to say, but I won't.
1683420	1689116	C	0.6526907086372375	Hopefully you got some harsh questions written down as we've been taking you through it.
1689298	1697950	B	0.5861889719963074	Yeah, just enough people who are listening in the discussion will look at some questions, so please feel free to write anything.
1703360	1720070	B	0.8755906224250793	It personally, I'm curious whether the awareness is going to be the light of the sun, the heat of the sun, the ejection, the loop structure, the birth and death of the star.
1724110	1724860	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1727070	1736234	C	0.8549084663391113	If the idea that you'll see here stands, then you've got the idea that a closed topological pocket of electromagnetic field, that's where awareness can take place.
1736272	1739658	C	0.7802848219871521	That's where a first person perspective, a kind of a locus, can exist.
1739754	1741390	C	0.7902476191520691	But what it's aware of?
1741540	1743486	C	0.7155637741088867	Well, that's an entirely different question.
1743668	1750606	C	0.6358636021614075	And if there are pockets like that, we're not asserting in this paper that the sun has these it's such a complex entity.
1750718	1758020	C	0.791781485080719	It's very possible, but that is a different but if to the extent they are there, what on Earth would be experienced within it?
1759030	1760420	C	0.6999109983444214	That's a different thing.
1761270	1769030	B	0.6161831021308899	The content problem, it's not just for YouTubers, it's also for conscious systems.
1770170	1780698	B	0.7899280190467834	But yeah, you've bound it all together, you've delimited a boundary topologically and then about what?
1780784	1782060	B	0.6793815493583679	And so what?
1783230	1789760	C	0.8616765141487122	Yeah, let me pick up a bit while we're while we're waiting for him to come in.
1792210	1801450	C	0.8136702179908752	And there's really growing kind of neuroscience and biological evidence for downward causation from electromagnetic fields in the brain.
1801530	1809150	C	0.5843348503112793	And all we really do in this paper is acknowledge that research literature exists and say, and therefore, it's possible for fields to be non epipenomenal.
1809230	1812898	C	0.8876674175262451	We don't get into the specifics of it, but they've been shown in memory formation.
1812994	1815778	C	0.849733293056488	They've been shown in the olfactory bulb for your smells.
1815874	1817640	C	0.7243807315826416	They've appeared all over the place.
1818810	1820150	C	0.6458353400230408	Andres, you're back.
1820300	1825606	C	0.7774528861045837	Just making the case for non epiphenomenal fields in the brain.
1825638	1826342	A	0.8996133804321289	Oh, fantastic.
1826406	1826778	A	0.9154167175292969	Beautiful.
1826864	1827114	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1827152	1828026	A	0.6856347918510437	Sorry about that.
1828128	1829658	A	0.5997928380966187	Hopefully, it doesn't happen again.
1829824	1830202	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
1830256	1831210	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1833390	1833850	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1833920	1853066	A	0.5030925273895264	And think about the immense causal power that a topological change in the field has in cosmological terms, like these billions of tons of plasma being ejected just because of otherwise epiphenomenal magnetic reconnection.
1853098	1859918	A	0.48830676078796387	It's like, no, actually, topological transformations are really significant at a massive, massive scale.
1860014	1861330	A	0.8108103275299072	Next slide?
1864660	1865410	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1865940	1866930	A	0.593698263168335	Next one.
1867320	1871510	A	0.9192966818809509	Just showing kind of how ridiculously powerful this can be.
1872840	1873300	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1873370	1887240	A	0.6094056367874146	And importantly, too, the actual fact that you get an enclosure with a topological transformation in a medium also gives you this capacity to essentially have holistic behavior.
1887740	1891870	A	0.9814767241477966	This is one of the things that, to me, was kind of the most exciting about this explanation space.
1892480	1900040	A	0.857361376285553	The moment you can close field lines or do a top formation, waves will be confined.
1900200	1904044	A	0.8792546391487122	Some kinds of waves can be confined within a topological pocket.
1904172	1908860	A	0.8684197068214417	When you have confinement of waves, then you have resonant modes.
1908940	1935908	A	0.6119372844696045	And when you have resonant modes, then you have this very fantastic effect where the whole shape of an object essentially is expressed in the way every part of the object is vibrating, in which case, essentially, you have this reason why evolution would recruit these topological objects is because it actually allows organisms to behave as a unit.
1936004	1940784	A	0.5756748914718628	So I think, yeah, that might be a very key piece of the puzzle for epiphenomenalism.
1940852	1941980	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
1942400	1956450	A	0.9013681411743164	These are just kind of like some sketches of some of the kinds of boundaries that, in principle, you may have in the electromagnetic field and what kind of binding in consciousness they might correspond to.
1957060	1959532	A	0.6927787065505981	But you don't have to just speculate.
1959596	1969172	A	0.9286180734634399	The really exciting thing here is that you can actually play with simulations of the electromagnetic field to try to make sense of the topological transformations that happen in it.
1969306	1986330	A	0.8188132047653198	So the next following slides we can just go through them fairly quickly are essentially resonant modes of an empty cavity, electromagnetic resonance modes of an empty cube cavity, where the left side is the electric field and the right side is the magnetic field.
1988400	1993740	A	0.9183824062347412	The website where you can check this is called Falstad.com EMBOX.
1994560	2003276	A	0.7183451652526855	And the thing that it kind of really neatly shows is how the magnetic field sometimes get this closed looping structure.
2003388	2003996	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
2004028	2007970	A	0.8286350965499878	Yeah, just go through them, maybe like 5 seconds for each of them.
2009060	2016448	A	0.7733988761901855	And it also allows you to essentially look at what happens when you stack some of these resonant modes.
2016544	2027524	A	0.857968270778656	And some combinations, linear combinations of these resonant modes create intricate eddings and loops and twists that.
2027722	2031380	A	0.8716537356376648	Loop around and create this topological boundary very fleeting.
2031540	2038532	A	0.8918963670730591	It has to do with the frequency of oscillation of the electric field, how many times per second you're going to get this looping structure.
2038676	2045320	A	0.7823541760444641	But the fact that yeah, you can show there's some topologically closed objects that appear there is quite remarkable.
2045480	2053772	A	0.702901303768158	And overall, the idea here would be that well, something like this is happening in the brain and the brain is actually recruiting these looping architectures.
2053836	2055680	A	0.7499849200248718	All right, I'll hand it over to Chris.
2058340	2059296	C	0.9599630236625671	Thank you very much.
2059398	2069972	C	0.8605867624282837	Yes, we've seen that electromagnetic fields can form closed loops and people have used that, some of the sites in the paper around people trapping knots of light.
2070106	2076820	C	0.897509753704071	And it just kind of really remarkable things happening at the edge of sort of room temperature state physics.
2076900	2078250	C	0.9119794964790344	Really incredible stuff.
2079580	2088468	C	0.7907180190086365	We know that in principle, these fields are capable of downward causation in massive contexts like the sun, but also in very real human brain settings.
2088564	2092376	C	0.8193001747131348	So conceptually, and we know that topologies in general are framing variants.
2092488	2098188	C	0.750070333480835	So we've got those things in place, we've got boundaries that satisfy those various features that we wanted.
2098354	2100936	C	0.6285787224769592	We don't know exactly how they occur in the human brain.
2101048	2104850	C	0.5196843147277832	All we're presenting is a conceptual solution that those things are possible.
2105300	2114500	C	0.7442574501037598	But what we do say is, well, what would such a solution look like to those five boundary problems that we just described?
2114840	2119988	C	0.8913703560829163	So taking them one by one, or rather yeah, taking them as a group.
2120074	2138584	C	0.8741318583488464	Let's first say what in such a theory, the first person perspective, that kind of phenomenal awareness, the what it's likeness that we experience in a very normal everyday sense, what could that reflect, what could that correspond to in such a model?
2138622	2142204	C	0.799877941608429	And there are others, but we'll give one example and use that to walk through the problems.
2142402	2160640	C	0.7598416805267334	So we would say that once you've got a closed topology and it may well require the time dimension for it to be properly ontologically closed and at that point em energy of that specific spectra, the same spectra that's making up the boundary can't pass through it or not.
2160710	2162620	C	0.8143202662467957	That's the whole point about the closed loop.
2162700	2165920	C	0.8486398458480835	Other things might pass through it, sound wave might pass through it.
2165990	2170804	C	0.843595564365387	But nonetheless, for the entities that we're interested in, it is closed to itself.
2170922	2173780	C	0.7862333059310913	And that's where we can get this hard boundary.
2174200	2176256	C	0.628324568271637	There may be lots of these being created in the brain.
2176288	2183160	C	0.7305097579956055	The brain is absolutely chock a block with different bits of em generating underlying phenomena.
2183980	2186596	C	0.7472063899040222	So it's certainly plausible that some of them are closed.
2186708	2187672	C	0.6351645588874817	We don't know.
2187806	2189804	C	0.8168870806694031	For this to be true, there must be at least one.
2189922	2192312	C	0.7217456102371216	But it's plausible that if there's one, there's probably several.
2192456	2194830	C	0.825600802898407	So you've got several of these.
2195200	2202124	C	0.7597379088401794	By definition they are non overlapping, the boundaries cannot overlap, but they could well be multiple at the same time.
2202162	2204530	C	0.776945948600769	One at the front, one at the back could be all over the place.
2205300	2215812	C	0.6349136233329773	It's probable though, that only a subset would be continually recreated in a stable manner because the fact that these fields can have downward causation, they can do useful things.
2215946	2232020	C	0.8882518410682678	Some of the sites in the paper about information processing point to some of the nonlinearities you can achieve through wave and field based resonant, mode based computations which may well have benefits from an information processing perspective.
2232100	2235320	C	0.8727422952651978	So in some cases these will be continually recreated.
2236300	2248750	C	0.6871631741523743	Only one of them, because they cannot overlap, only one of them can enclose, let's call it an immediate memory model as a conceptual point, not committing to what exactly that might mean.
2251040	2257452	C	0.6037662625312805	We suspect these wouldn't last very long and they probably don't extend over the whole brain, but who knows?
2257596	2260108	C	0.8242574334144592	Regardless, it would vary from period to period.
2260284	2269908	C	0.882714569568634	Other field theories might have other ways of recruiting this concept for solving the boundary problem, but let's walk this one through and see what it looks like as a response to those five things.
2269994	2277852	C	0.8232477307319641	So what we're saying is this closed topological pocket that is kind of axiomatically the same as a first person awareness.
2277936	2289880	C	0.6185334920883179	When you've got that, you've got something that is capable of both binding together those micro bits of experience and presenting them within a boundary so they have some unified ontology.
2291100	2298700	C	0.8433151245117188	So one by one, and I think this is our last slide, the hard boundary, well, that comes from what we've been talking about.
2298770	2302216	C	0.49811071157455444	Energy of the same spectra can't pass through the closed loop.
2302248	2307068	C	0.8235467672348022	So that happens quite naturally, a bit like with the field solution to binding.
2307164	2326928	C	0.5874099731445312	This is something you almost get for free as a result of using that lower levels and higher levels well, because only one of them, because of the non overlapping point, because only one of them can include the immediate memory model, which is crucial for the next bit, then you can't have lower levels and higher levels.
2327024	2331428	C	0.7519108653068542	There may well be mind dust at those levels which is this kind of lovely evocative concept.
2331524	2338488	C	0.7847909927368164	There may well be flashes of tiny bits of awareness that kind of they never repeat the patterns just gone for it.
2338494	2343100	C	0.5021499395370483	There's nothing that links it into future versions of itself, just gone.
2343170	2345148	C	0.643485963344574	The universe may be replete with these things.
2345234	2347036	C	0.6648950576782227	It's certainly got plenty of electrons in it.
2347058	2348124	C	0.5614604949951172	Why not plenty of these things?
2348162	2349020	C	0.706895649433136	Who knows?
2350640	2358480	C	0.6948096752166748	But there's only one closed pocket that maybe I'll come back to four that can enclose this immediate memory module.
2359060	2366580	C	0.7015411853790283	That's crucial because it's what creates a temporal boundary that in any possible sense could reflect what we experience day to day.
2366650	2389416	C	0.5659556984901428	Because these tiny if you think of these 4D pockets, if one pocket were to last long enough to encompass, say, a whole day's worth of your experience, it's almost impossible for it to vary enough without breaking to actually contain all the types of complex phenomena we experience during the day.
2389518	2395870	C	0.7650367617607117	Which is why we think it's much more likely they persist for a short period of time, but nonetheless, our experiences of things persisting for longer.
2396800	2400104	C	0.6921975612640381	Now, the micro level persistence, why is it nonzero?
2400232	2406336	C	0.7728992700576782	Because if something is infinitesimally small, it probably doesn't help us.
2406358	2413008	C	0.49283310770988464	If something is the equivalent of a geometric point, no matter how many of them you put together in a physical setting, you're not going to create a line.
2413094	2414940	C	0.7806618213653564	We want some non zero duration.
2415020	2419344	C	0.652509331703186	Well, we've got that for free because the closed pocket has this 4D ontological presence.
2419392	2420276	C	0.6264714002609253	That's fine.
2420458	2426860	C	0.5556683540344238	How would you get but it may be really short, far shorter than we experience even this sentence.
2427040	2428536	C	0.8332920670509338	So what ties that together?
2428638	2433876	C	0.7708730101585388	Well, because it encloses each millisecond to millisecond, it recreates.
2434068	2436244	C	0.8188010454177856	Each one is a different piece of awareness.
2436372	2441044	C	0.626287579536438	They are not in any way ontologically linked to each other, they are each separate.
2441172	2447404	C	0.8478204011917114	But because each one encloses the memory module, which is just an information processing thing, you can encode memory and pen and paper.
2447442	2448892	C	0.7884172201156616	There's nothing magical about this.
2449026	2456976	C	0.7917073369026184	By referencing it, it knows what was just there before, and that can create we could call it an illusion if you want.
2456998	2459472	C	0.8223304748535156	Whether that matters is a much more philosophical point.
2459526	2463856	C	0.7414256930351257	But you create this pseudo time arrow, you have unified insight, because that's what fields do.
2463878	2467248	C	0.7591806054115295	They unify the insight in all the things that make it up.
2467414	2468848	C	0.6772955656051636	No information is lost.
2468944	2470870	C	0.5037521123886108	It is all bound together.
2471560	2477076	C	0.8442209362983704	So now you've got the recent past and then you've got the bit before that from the previous pocket, and the bit before that and the bit before that.
2477178	2481568	C	0.8127046823501587	So it's all bound into each individual present.
2481754	2485080	C	0.5302879810333252	As short as it may be, it has the sense that it's something bigger.
2485500	2494152	C	0.6839314699172974	Now, in terms of the macro level, days, years between interruptions, this is one where we are far more philosophically relaxed.
2494296	2500472	C	0.5203666090965271	It may well be that there is no kind of profound sense in which these things are the same entity.
2500536	2506716	C	0.5044450163841248	It's maybe a ship of theseus type concept, and it's all linked together by some fairly weak long term memory.
2506748	2510848	C	0.7731462121009827	And are we really the same person as we were a week ago, a year ago?
2511014	2515652	C	0.5909006595611572	We're far less philosophically concerned about that than we are by the micro level and the meter level.
2515706	2523110	C	0.6223656535148621	But either way, the solutions are the classic personal identity solutions, which have been gone over plenty of times.
2524120	2529930	C	0.8994306325912476	If you'll give us another five minutes before questions, we'd love to share some more kind of speculative thoughts with you.
2530780	2531832	C	0.8247311115264893	Getting a thumbs up.
2531886	2532372	A	0.9073238968849182	Wonderful.
2532436	2536680	C	0.899592399597168	In which case, over to Andres for some fun, thought provoking stuff.
2536830	2539096	A	0.932934582233429	Well, awesome.
2539278	2542140	A	0.8185132741928101	Yeah, I mean, it's just kind of like this deeper question.
2542210	2547292	A	0.6842105984687805	And don't wait for me if my internet runs out for a second.
2547346	2553724	A	0.8403695821762085	But essentially, how does this influence, for example, beliefs of personal identity?
2553852	2555004	A	0.7061944603919983	Next slide.
2555132	2569012	A	0.5416334271430969	I think once you start seeing the universe as a field and with maybe like fleeting topological pockets on it, that actually very significantly informs these classic questions in philosophy like who are you?
2569066	2573856	A	0.7122452259063721	And do you continue to exist from one moment to the other and indeed the other sheep of the sea's?
2573968	2578408	A	0.6859443187713623	Is there any kind of metaphysical endearing ego, so to speak?
2578574	2589988	A	0.8476433753967285	And I actually think that each of these views of personal identity could actually be reinterpreted in terms of claims about the field and field topology.
2590164	2592660	A	0.7520734667778015	So something like closed individualism.
2592740	2597384	A	0.6719428300857544	This is the belief that you start existing when you're born, stop existing when you die, or maybe you go to heaven.
2597432	2603680	A	0.84297776222229	But the point is that you're kind of a separate self that endures over time that is different than other selves.
2604260	2623856	A	0.748875081539154	Here we would want to find some kind of enduring sheath or enduring nested architecture that even though maybe each moment of awareness might be its own topological pocket, maybe there's some kind of higher order topological unity that does carry over a person's lifetime.
2623968	2632328	A	0.8282263875007629	That would be a possible way of raifying in an actual significant physical way the sense of identity over time.
2632414	2634132	A	0.6312780976295471	Of course, completely speculative.
2634196	2636312	A	0.8437398076057434	It would be a matter of actually finding it in the field.
2636366	2639256	A	0.7069559693336487	But that's how you could, I think, Steel men this notion.
2639368	2650556	A	0.6084547638893127	Next slide, then probably the most compatible and easy to justify view here would be empty individualism, that every moment of experience is ontologically different.
2650738	2658044	A	0.6629629135131836	And again here that would be possible because we would have these fleeting hard boundaries in the spacetime continuum.
2658172	2665460	A	0.798919141292572	And as a consequence, you can look at the block universe and say, okay, there's a 40 pocket there, there's a 40 pocket over there.
2665530	2669332	A	0.8643718957901001	And wherever you see a 40 pocket, that is going to be a subject of experience.
2669466	2681124	A	0.7979657053947449	And any actual continuity between moments of experience are either just causal or kind of illusory constructed with the memory module, as Chris was suggesting.
2681252	2688772	A	0.8147862553596497	And then next slide and then finally open individualism, there's this view that we are all one consciousness.
2688916	2692636	A	0.544794499874115	We're all Krishna at the bottom layer, so to speak.
2692738	2711328	A	0.6172836422920227	Well, the way we could justify this within the topological account is that, well, actually at the deepest ontological level, we're all the field, which just happened to be on a given point in time segmentation of that field that prevents information propagation with other regions of the field.
2711414	2721456	A	0.7367196083068848	So in this case, kind of the topological segmentation would actually be more of an epistemological boundary than it would actually be an ontological boundary.
2721488	2724388	A	0.7469227910041809	It's like the idea that deep down actually we are the field.
2724554	2735976	A	0.8118431568145752	It's just that how the field knows itself is constrained by its topology in which case, yeah, it's another way of still meaning we're all one consciousness in a very physically grounded way.
2736078	2737592	A	0.6724891662597656	And, yeah, I think that's it.
2737646	2756384	A	0.6902910470962524	Unless I put anything else in the next slide oh, yeah, just the last kind of like speculation here is, well, okay, if you are this topological pocket in the field electromagnetic field, how can you in a sense, take a look at that pocket and then reconstruct what the experience feels like.
2756502	2770576	A	0.5536004304885864	And here perhaps like a fun thought experiment that you could make is thinking about what it would be like to be a photon trapped kind of within a hall of mirrors.
2770688	2783460	A	0.8357611894607544	There's this article I wrote, 2018 about how to replicate a hyperbolic space using just double mirrors and gradient index optics.
2783620	2792716	A	0.7146353125572205	And essentially within that structure that has those properties, a photon would have no way of telling the fact that it is not in hyperbolic space.
2792818	2801576	A	0.8841300010681152	In other words, the index of refraction of a container would present itself as the actual geometry of the space from within.
2801698	2815724	A	0.8021396398544312	So in our brain, presumably, the actual way in which the local field potentials are stitched together and the relative index of refraction could potentially give rise to really arbitrary possible internal geometrics.
2815772	2825296	A	0.8222535848617554	Where there's the illusion that you're in a space, whether it's in hyperbolic space, in spherical space, some irregular geometry, all of those could be emulated with this paradigm.
2825328	2835172	A	0.7044186592102051	And that may go a little bit a long way in actually explaining some of the most exotic experiences that people can have, which usually would challenge kind of theories of consciousness.
2835236	2839484	A	0.8294025659561157	Here there's a way of stitching them together to explain them.
2839522	2841630	A	0.701044499874115	And I think yeah, the last slide, I believe.
2843840	2844204	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2844242	2848030	A	0.7353335022926331	So this is just illustrating that point, I think this is it.
2850640	2852192	C	0.8139160871505737	And we can leave this up on the screen.
2852246	2853824	C	0.725786566734314	This is just where we would go next with it.
2853862	2857520	C	0.6338123083114624	But this seems like a good point to stop and hear your thoughts.
2859380	2860032	B	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
2860166	2862240	B	0.9200834631919861	Great presentations.
2863720	2870260	B	0.904035210609436	Well, Bernie, would you like to give first reflection and I'll write down some questions and look in the live chat?
2871000	2871990	D	0.4872898459434509	Yeah, sure.
2873000	2887480	D	0.7553263902664185	I've been thinking a lot about similar stuff like this recently, and the paper presents how the functional theories have the problem of arbitrariness.
2888060	2896840	D	0.892672061920166	So, for example, with Markov blanket Markov blankets, that could be the case when there's Markov blankets as ontological observers.
2897000	2913724	D	0.8600283265113831	And I was thinking that maybe unifying this with the Marko blanket paradigm is that the mark of blanket that on the physical level is implemented using this topological pocket is the conscious mark of blackend.
2913772	2923920	D	0.6602181792259216	So it's how you were referring the mark of black and solves the content problem, while the topological boundary solves all the other problems.
2924070	2925520	D	0.716952919960022	Like objective.
2933660	2934410	A	0.6050544381141663	Maybe.
2937340	2939260	A	0.6098511815071106	Yeah, no, that's something very quick to mention.
2939330	2942296	A	0.7742082476615906	Obviously, we're in the active inference institute podcast.
2942328	2943484	A	0.5329102277755737	I mean, absolutely.
2943602	2957520	A	0.5567118525505066	One thing to mention is that our perspective is not in itself necessary or is not necessary and sufficient actually to satisfy the code that we have specified.
2958340	2966652	A	0.8600795865058899	However, we actually think it's very likely that topological pockets in the electromagnetic field do behave as mark of blankets.
2966716	2983320	A	0.7516393065452576	And so it is a way in which you can actually interface these different paradigms where we would be saying that at the implementation level can then realize the minimization of free energy at the algorithmic level.
2983470	3005168	A	0.6138213276863098	However, we would be saying, and maybe this would be a little bit of a twist or a nontrivial implication, that if you were to simulate a hierarchically structured mark of blanket system in a computer, it could very well be from a certain abstraction, be minimizing free energy, but it wouldn't be able to solve the boundary problem.
3005254	3020020	A	0.5010312795639038	In other words, it is sort of like there is a significant overlap, but there are some slight places of a divergence where you might say, hey, a market blanket is actually not enough because it doesn't give you the implementation level explanation for how you get boundaries.
3021560	3023350	A	0.8412944674491882	Chris, if you want to add anything.
3023960	3047788	C	0.8403135538101196	Yeah, I mean, just to agree with that, I think this is if you go back to Mars, three levels around kind of what substrate we haven't discussed anything here about the algorithms that are actually taking place on or kind of within the brain that would ultimately get incorporated into the Em field.
3047874	3049596	C	0.7147953510284424	Clearly you need that stuff as well.
3049698	3059410	C	0.6204317212104797	None of this makes any contribution to solving these more content problems of consciousness or how we make inferences about the world, how we respond to those.
3060100	3080330	C	0.5068539381027222	What it does say is that if there are algorithms that solve those problems, and there are some good candidates out there, including yours, they need to be implemented or they need to reflect back to a field for it to become part of someone's unified macrophenomenological experience.
3080780	3099740	C	0.534562349319458	If you did some sort of feed forward in Silico version of this, or you did it, you implemented the algorithm using rocks, just lots and lots of rocks laid out forever like that wonderful xkcd example, that is not going to create a bound first person perspective anywhere.
3103220	3107724	B	0.8010034561157227	Well, a lot to say about that, certainly Markov blankets.
3107772	3111916	B	0.7872918248176575	And just to define it on a Bayesian graph, so the map not the territory.
3112028	3118656	B	0.8885530233383179	The Markov blanket is the set of nodes upon which two other sets of nodes are conditionally independent.
3118768	3121536	B	0.6668803095817566	And that's a purely topological statement.
3121648	3134084	B	0.6175128817558289	It doesn't matter how far if there even is a spatial association or temporal association, it doesn't matter the distance, which is to say the geometry, but rather the blanket is a purely topological statement.
3134212	3158336	B	0.8635372519493103	And that's what, among other things, we've been exploring with Chris Fields in the physics as information processing and this question about the topology of communication for bounded observers, and as we kind of alluded to with that content problem, the topology of communication is, to use a geometric metaphor, it's orthogonal to the content.
3158518	3161664	B	0.7188706398010254	You could have two people on the phone sharing different things.
3161782	3164784	B	0.8652392625808716	You could have a video file with different contents.
3164912	3169988	B	0.637230396270752	And so there's really a lot of layers that come into play.
3170154	3181560	B	0.8169521689414978	And so, I think, from an instrumentalist view, I read your paper as a call for the introduction of topology into what is often only modeled as geometric.
3181900	3188212	B	0.8488179445266724	A call for the integration of electromagnetism rather than a reliance on one or the other.
3188366	3202400	B	0.7679156064987183	Of course, as introduced from the outset, a pluralism these are not exhaustive nor exclusive accounts, and we don't know what the scope of the possible intelligences and awarenesses are.
3202550	3216710	B	0.6676741242408752	So from a research perspective, if not beyond, why would we want to limit when we're not only interested in understanding the properties of any given system as we see it today?
3219480	3221780	B	0.884738028049469	Any thoughts where I can read a question in the Chat?
3224040	3225350	A	0.9817728400230408	Oh, that sounds great.
3226780	3233240	B	0.7894288301467896	Turnkey Tyranny writes, how does topology show up phenomenologically?
3238370	3240926	A	0.9532219767570496	Yeah, this is an excellent, excellent question.
3241108	3242174	A	0.8796073794364929	I'm happy to take it.
3242212	3244050	C	0.8817427754402161	Andrews do you want to go back to your notes?
3244550	3246500	C	0.8497592806816101	We've got that page of notes in there.
3246950	3248580	A	0.5908664464950562	Sure, let's do that.
3249990	3257398	C	0.8553028702735901	Because I've asked a very similar question of Andres, and these sort of notes is what resulted in his attempts to explain it to me.
3257484	3275910	A	0.9730663895606995	Let me take yes, this is very speculative, but one wonderful resource, I think, hopefully I think is wonderful, very worth trying out is we made a series of guided meditations about phenomenology.
3276070	3277878	A	0.5160248279571533	It's not really kind of like for the sake of spirituality.
3277894	3281338	A	0.6872023940086365	It's more for the sake of exploring phenomenology with meditation.
3281514	3285002	A	0.8338284492492676	The last one is called the phenomenology of ontology.
3285146	3310214	A	0.8540257215499878	And that one helps you, in a sense, get a sense of how beliefs about the narrative reality reality, of course, different to believe that electromagnetic field or you're an electromagnetic feels or in a specific version of materialism or something like that.
3310252	3314150	A	0.7964583039283752	So very different ontologies can give rise to very different feelings.
3314650	3326060	A	0.6302156448364258	And so there's definitely the worry that, well, if you think a lot about the electromagnetic field, aren't you maybe just interpreting your sensations within that paradigm, but it's kind of like you're overfeeding on top of it.
3326750	3331998	A	0.8458144068717957	But in a sense, I would argue that actually it's the other way around.
3332084	3341466	A	0.7137395739555359	With something as generic and structured as electromagnetic field, you can, I think, in principle, explain the phenomenology of any ontology.
3341578	3350242	A	0.699661910533905	Like, why does it feel like, for example, that you can kind of merge with the cosmos or something like that?
3350296	3355654	A	0.7509567737579346	Why does it feel like you can become one with everything in meditation, let's say in various meditation states?
3355852	3366098	A	0.8641685843467712	Well, with something like the topological explanation for the boundary problem, the way we might interpret that is as the vanishing of internal boundaries.
3366194	3377914	A	0.8150505423545837	And so there is a significant difference between a global boundary, which is what we focused on, the overall kind of the macroscopic division that says whether you're inside or outside your experience.
3378112	3402382	A	0.7679979205131531	But something that the electromagnetic field also affords and gives us as kind of part of its rich structure is the possibility of internal boundaries as well, which would be not boundaries that wrap around a 4D object, but rather lower dimensional boundaries like meeting points or convergence points of the field lines within the pocket.
3402446	3424998	A	0.8826696276664734	And so in this account, whenever you have the sensation of solidity, the feeling of, well, I am here, you're there, or there's a boundary between us, that boundary would essentially be an internal boundary, would be a region of the field while the field lines converge or they align, but it's only along a certain cross section.
3425094	3428902	A	0.5426439046859741	Meaning that actually your experience is still fully unified.
3428966	3437290	A	0.6262009739875793	You can still go from one point to the other across a perceived barrier because they're still part of the whole experience, they're still connected.
3437370	3447006	A	0.740375280380249	In other words, with this kind of data structure, we can arrive at kind of like a lot of phenomenological details and trying to explain them from that perspective.
3447118	3466182	A	0.7211611866950989	And I think it's going to be an enormous program in the long term involving physicists and mathematicians and exotic states of consciousness to say like, okay, that particular feature of experience that happens on such and such substance in such meditation state, how does that map into the electromagnetic field?
3466236	3470970	A	0.5227006673812866	And I think we will very likely find a lot of non trivial connections with that sort of paradigm.
3474440	3476470	B	0.8256508111953735	Chris, any thoughts on that?
3478280	3494570	C	0.9059677124023438	Just to make the link to some of the diagrams on the page, which is if you've got these non 4D closed boundaries, but other types of boundaries, the other types of shapes Andrews was talking about, the drawings on the page are just examples of some of those.
3496480	3502620	C	0.8653289675712585	As Andrew said, it's not really part of the solution, but it's part of imaginatively exploring where else it might go.
3502770	3510668	C	0.8663569092750549	So if you've got feature binding, which know I'm seeing a cup and the cup is both blue and cup shaped, that's feature binding.
3510684	3514444	C	0.7689082026481628	And then the phenomenological binding is my whole experience being unified.
3514572	3518816	C	0.761600911617279	You can imagine feature binding putting the blueness and the cupness together.
3518918	3522832	C	0.8277467489242554	That might be something that happens along one of these types of internal boundaries.
3522976	3523652	C	0.5774984955787659	It might not.
3523706	3526980	C	0.8655142188072205	It might be that that can be done purely through informational associations.
3527400	3529156	C	0.8836020827293396	We're kind of agnostic on that.
3529258	3542164	C	0.7765763401985168	But what's interesting about a 4D topology is within it you can have lots of other complicated topologies provided they are not closed along the fourth dimension, because then you sort of created another little mini bit of bit of awareness.
3542292	3542964	C	0.5654886364936829	Oh, Bernie.
3543012	3543480	C	0.6500546336174011	Go ahead.
3543550	3545450	C	0.6269161105155945	Yeah, I'll jump back to the other page.
3546080	3549612	D	0.6695736646652222	Yeah, I wanted to say something else not related to this exact question.
3549666	3552364	D	0.7595532536506653	So if you have ended it, maybe.
3552402	3559920	A	0.8828904628753662	I'll well, in that case, actually, I'll mention one last thing about how electromagnetic field may be related to phenomenology.
3560580	3575796	A	0.7916218042373657	A very specific thing that happens on psychedelics, and especially something like DMT is that you may end up having different regions of your experience, have the exact same texture, and have the feeling of synchronization between them.
3575818	3581328	A	0.8220268487930298	And when that happens, they sort of become the same object, just like spatially distributed.
3581504	3593724	A	0.8264278769493103	The way I interpret this is whenever the exact same wave equation applies to two regions of your experience and waves can propagate from one region to the other that actually feels like they're the same object.
3593842	3607500	A	0.8290109634399414	So one kind of, like, natural way in which regions of your phenomenal world might be segmented out into phenomenal objects is by confining how waves can move within the world simulation.
3607580	3622150	A	0.825325071811676	And whenever you have what feels like a bound object in your world simulation that I think is highly, highly related to waves being able to smoothly travel within that object but not outside of that object, some kind of wave confinement is happening.
3623160	3635220	B	0.49673697352409363	I'll add in one more, of course, fun and speculative thought, which is the aboutness the content of what this computation or what this process is unfolding.
3635300	3638152	B	0.8391743302345276	The aboutness itself can be structure learning.
3638286	3645960	B	0.8575686812400818	And so even for a fixed electromagnetic topology, you can have variable informational topology.
3646120	3650712	B	0.7975399494171143	Case in point, the von Neumann computer, the CPU architecture.
3650776	3653576	B	0.6539837121963501	Electromagnetically is not changing topologically.
3653688	3659804	B	0.5888137221336365	We don't need to reroute the telephone connections for there to be different messages that spread.
3659932	3673460	B	0.5741593241691589	And so there's a lot of richness in the space you've sketched or surveyed, because even for a fixed topology, we might be able to do compositional binding like blue and cup.
3674120	3699688	B	0.8741351962089539	And then now we add in a dynamic, multiscale topological unfolding, and then that may connect to different frequencies of, for example, measurements in the EEG, which are really only picking up the synchrony in the outer shell, which might actually play a role.
3699704	3701304	B	0.6140111684799194	It's not like the skull matters.
3701352	3702664	B	0.6169307231903076	You could have a skull removed.
3702712	3703496	B	0.609782874584198	It's not the scalp.
3703528	3704788	B	0.5776057243347168	It's not your hair.
3704984	3707116	B	0.6891196370124817	It's not necessarily the meninge.
3707228	3708224	B	0.7406122088432312	But what is it?
3708262	3736090	B	0.8075145483016968	Well, maybe it's something that's infotainment that reflects kind of different regimes of attention that actually does happen to correspond, but it's also localized, and that's that interplay with individuality and oneness that works like Wilbur's, no boundary point towards, but then you got to come back from no boundary because that sentence has to end.
3739340	3740280	B	0.573223888874054	Bernie.
3741260	3741864	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3741982	3766044	D	0.9068235158920288	I wanted to mention that in relation to the ongoing curves on the physics and information processing that Chris Fields is hosting is one construct that Chris Fields is using in his papers with Michael and Paul is the notion of topological quantum neural networks and topological quantum field theories.
3766172	3777028	D	0.8887893557548523	So it might be that those are the information processing in this kind of topological maps as well that you've mentioned.
3777114	3794532	D	0.8673436045646667	Daniel, the grounding for that or how Michael Levin is talking about how bioelectricity is a glue for the various subsystems in the brain.
3794676	3799080	D	0.521334707736969	Or I've seen some recent paper that was pretty late.
3802160	3815916	D	0.7078808546066284	I found out recently, which I'm pretty surprised at just recently, that there is a whole field of people that are really trying to apply quantum field theory on the brain.
3815948	3819280	D	0.8618550300598145	And there was one paper on memory formation.
3819440	3828064	D	0.8034691214561462	So how you, Chris, talked about memory in terms of the electromagnetic field that might be also great, like pointer.
3828192	3836090	D	0.7773882746696472	So I'm just putting out different people and papers that I think might be interconnectable with this work.
3837020	3837770	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3838140	3853064	B	0.8355004787445068	One interesting thing, and you reflected it in your literature review is when people think about quantum and cognitive systems, the ORC, or and other frameworks often are considering quantum as being electronic scale.
3853192	3865024	B	0.8981209993362427	And therefore a quantum theory of cognition or consciousness would entail some kind of relationship between the way that electrons and photons behave and then some difference that makes a difference at the biological level.
3865222	3881380	B	0.8063066005706787	And in a way, what we've been exploring with Chris Fields and others is like a bypass where it's like, no, the quantum formalism, quantum topology, quantum information simply and plainly describes cognitive processes where order matters.
3881460	3901400	B	0.7384873032569885	Now, there may or may not be effects associated with differences that make a difference at the electronic scale, but we don't need that in order to use superposition and all of these different effects that empirically are the case in cognitive systems.
3901480	3903896	B	0.6590290665626526	We're not waiting for some new mechanistic insight.
3903928	3905616	B	0.8825315237045288	It'd be cool to find out.
3905798	3913676	B	0.5883732438087463	But what you've presented is not waiting for a different kind of thing to exist.
3913868	3929270	B	0.8789716362953186	So I'm curious, what experiments or what are the unique experiments that you feel like would give a resounding feeling on what you're talking about?
3930040	3932484	A	0.9036679863929749	Yeah, happy to take it on.
3932522	3941416	A	0.9511663317680359	So one kind of, like, very awesome research lead, and then I'll explain what a research paradigm will look like.
3941438	3946264	A	0.6902223825454712	But essentially, first of all, a very powerful lead is meditative cessations.
3946392	3961476	A	0.4657801389694214	So one of the most insane chapters in mastering the core teachings of the Buddha by Daniel Ingram is the one called The Three Doors, where he describes the phenomenology of experiencing a peak meditation state that's called a cessation.
3961528	3968732	A	0.6540923118591309	Where you blink out of reality for a second or well, for a subsecond moment, but you just blink out fully and then you get reconstituted.
3968796	3973270	A	0.9613099694252014	And when you get reconstituted, it tends to be a very blissful, very rejuvenating type experience.
3973640	3979300	A	0.7502574920654297	But the thing he highlights in that article is what it feels like to be really close to a cessation.
3979640	3983224	A	0.810964822769165	And it actually depends on what type of cessation it is.
3983262	3986024	A	0.875968873500824	There's roughly, like, three ways in which it can happen.
3986062	4001448	A	0.5974923968315125	But the mind blowing thing about that essay, that chapter is he essentially describes different topologies of attention and awareness that may arise where in these moments, close to a cessation, he says, well, in one of those you become kind of a taurus.
4001544	4008184	A	0.7465917468070984	And the taurus flips the inside and an outside and it twists around and then it cancels out and compresses and then you vanish.
4008312	4018260	A	0.7448275089263916	And then there's like, another variety where you become a cone, and then all of your attention gets concentrated in the point of the coin of the cone, and then that twists around and then vanishes.
4018680	4028448	A	0.4991820156574249	So there's like this reliable, very exotic kind of like topological transformations that can happen to your attention and awareness.
4028624	4041304	A	0.7831010818481445	And our guess would be that, well, a cessation, an actual kind of full vanishing, might be related to the topological pocket that your brain is generating, essentially opening up.
4041422	4050424	A	0.8072054982185364	So that in some maybe nontrivial way, the actual boundary between inside and outside gets dissolved for a fraction of a second, then it gets reconstituted.
4050552	4060204	A	0.7366226315498352	But something really special happens in that moment that allows for deep insight or something along the lines or relieving a lot of internal stress, maybe like a coronal mass ejection.
4060252	4064370	A	0.7493639588356018	There might be something going on at the topological level.
4065540	4090500	A	0.8296611905097961	Now, in terms of kind of like, further, more sophisticated research paradigms, the thing that we're looking into, there's a lot more to be unpacked and developed here, but is what kind of electromagnetic resonant modes that can supervene on particular graphs, whether we're talking about the Connectum or whether we're talking about the geometric eigen modes.
4090580	4097548	A	0.8935166001319885	More recent work where you model the entire cortex as a geometric surface, and then you apply neural field theory to that.
4097634	4101084	A	0.8056827783584595	Well, all of that works so far.
4101122	4107248	A	0.87117999792099	Essentially, what it focuses on is oscillations in the electric field without modeling the magnetic field.
4107334	4121952	A	0.6278666257858276	So I would suspect that many of the Connectum harmonics or geometric eigen modes may be physically unrealizable simply because the magnetic field lines may collide with each other.
4122006	4124212	A	0.664150595664978	So some of those may not be possible.
4124346	4153544	A	0.5574110746383667	But one of the crazy, fascinating, unusual predictions that may come out of our whole paradigm is that once we have a really good mapping of what resonant modes arise in the brain on different states of consciousness, we would predict that a when you're fully awake, normally conscious, there will be a very central, big topological loop inside you that whenever you're, let's say, in deep sleep, you might see a kind of mind dust.
4153592	4156420	A	0.7307600975036621	You might see lots of tiny little pockets.
4156520	4164160	A	0.7598605751991272	And maybe when you're in an ecstatic experience, like deep meditation, it may do something else.
4164230	4169824	A	0.8696261644363403	Like the particular resonant modes there may create open field lines that don't form a loop.
4169872	4177380	A	0.6392392516136169	So that is like the sort of crazy, very novel type of prediction, or at least research paradigm that this enables.
4179480	4180324	B	0.985194981098175	That's really cool.
4180362	4181850	B	0.8130766749382019	Chris, anything out of that?
4183180	4189210	C	0.895317554473877	Yeah, just to draw the link between the fourth bullet here and what Andres is setting out.
4189980	4195628	C	0.6256300806999207	I don't think any of this is there are some toy bits of modeling you could do that could increase confidence one way or another.
4195714	4206252	C	0.8219615817070007	But in terms of an actual experimental prediction, you would need to combine this with some theory of which bits of the brain are doing this.
4206386	4214588	C	0.7888951897621155	So if Ward and Guevara are right that it's the thalamus that's doing this stuff, we would expect to see around the thalmus a closed pocket.
4214684	4215920	C	0.6010410785675049	And it should be possible.
4216070	4219340	C	0.4978383481502533	In principle, this is probably billions of pounds worth of effort.
4219420	4225764	C	0.8732155561447144	But to model the thalamus and the surrounding bits enough, and you can find out if there would actually be a closed pocket, if there would be one.
4225802	4227764	C	0.883042573928833	In theory, you can see roughly where it would be.
4227882	4240440	C	0.4988447427749634	Obviously, it moves around a bit, but it's normally around here you then should be able to I don't know if ethical consent is even possible for something like this, but disrupt that with a very, very targeted external Em source.
4240860	4245320	C	0.8646341562271118	Think transcranial stimulation, but just laser precise.
4245900	4257772	C	0.709759533405304	If we've now broken the bid around the thalamus but left everything else more or less untouched, we predict if warding of our plus us is correct, we predict that your first personal awareness would blink out.
4257826	4260840	C	0.856634259223938	Like deep sleep, like anesthesia like a meditative cessation.
4261000	4267788	C	0.9084287285804749	If we're wrong, or the combination of us is wrong, then you will still be conscious, but you might just experience something really bloody weird.
4267884	4278740	C	0.7331615090370178	But your contents have changed, not the actual container of consciousness hasn't blinked in and out, and then you could apply that to other bits of the brain wherever you think there's.
4279080	4287256	C	0.7049241662025452	Our other prediction is that it must be enclosing the immediate memory model, but we're unsure exactly where that is as well.
4287358	4289770	C	0.7425242066383362	That is also an outstanding research question.
4291500	4297256	C	0.4681788682937622	It feels like doable in our lifetimes, I think, but none of this is give us ten grand and we'll do it this summer.
4297288	4298590	C	0.4614820182323456	None of it is that easy.
4300640	4302444	B	0.8810970783233643	Yeah, very interesting.
4302562	4320604	B	0.8765257000923157	And Neuroimaging already utilizes electromagnetic measurements and there are things that currently are described within a biomolecular paradigm, like, for example, changes in effective connectivity between different regions of the brain.
4320732	4325424	B	0.6998553276062012	Well, there's already a tract, let's just say, between certain brain regions.
4325552	4339092	B	0.8143755197525024	And so maybe if the action potentials traveling down that 100 lane highway are aligned, then it's going to be like this rippling em continuity.
4339236	4347240	B	0.6193004846572876	Whereas if they were totally disarrayed along that track, then you wouldn't have those two regions contained.
4347320	4366400	B	0.7803581953048706	But it'd be like kind of like two regions, like blowing smoke rings at each other if they had enough synchrony to push through the trouble and the friction such that there was a pocket that was able to you squirt hot water into a cold pool.
4367220	4373856	B	0.7263036370277405	There's ways to angle it and do it in all of the combinations of viscosity that it just diffuses instantly.
4374048	4385000	B	0.8818908333778381	There's also ways where there would be a high temperature toroidal form that could pass through a colder media because it maintains a topological boundary.
4385660	4398700	B	0.8409783244132996	A lot of these things are again described anatomically or molecularly or electronically, but the duality between electronics and magnetism is not contentious.
4399760	4423460	B	0.8283784985542297	So there may be a lot of phenomena that could be revisited, and I don't know whether that would provide indirect evidence with what we already know or suggest new plausible experiments, but it's an approach.
4427120	4427532	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4427586	4428204	C	0.5156857967376709	Welcome it.
4428242	4432312	C	0.8500226140022278	And thanks, Bernie as well for the pointers towards, like, Chris Fields and Michael Levin.
4432376	4441424	C	0.7707793712615967	I may come back to you for the QFT on memory formation in case I've spotted some stuff on that, but I'm not sure I've spotted the one it sounded like you were referring to.
4441462	4445508	C	0.9522900581359863	So yeah, it's an exciting sort of research.
4445674	4446340	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4446490	4453012	B	0.8643427491188049	One last connection there with active inference is you have the electronic and the magnetic fields influencing each other.
4453066	4461770	B	0.8951533436775208	That's the basis of what philosophers might consider in terms of this epipenomenalism or not question.
4462300	4470120	B	0.8648915886878967	And if we had an active inference situation of two songbirds, the active states of one become the sensory of the other.
4470270	4482796	B	0.8784193396568298	So if they were just passing messages every single time step to each other, then they would both be engaged in their own blanketed perception on the inbound and action selection on the outbound.
4482988	4492416	B	0.8693066239356995	And so they could basically be in this continual oscillatory relationship with causal efficacy both ways.
4492598	4496708	B	0.8500422835350037	Again, or you could design a situation where the causal efficacy only flowed one way.
4496874	4515716	B	0.6932134032249451	But the point is, this is a topological approach that lets us explore that in a way that isn't only appealing to molecular or material phenomena and then leaving the whole question, which is the whole question of the informational.
4515828	4517796	B	0.7434355020523071	And the closure and the binding.
4517908	4522140	B	0.8227388858795166	Leaving all those to be resolved by slicing and dicing with a scalpel.
4522880	4527870	B	0.7164977192878723	Which is not even a viable option as far as we already understand.
4530560	4543040	B	0.8910313844680786	Bernie and then the authors, what are your closing thoughts or how would you suggest that people get in the game or what should they do with their own topologies?
4547810	4552990	D	0.8309088945388794	Maybe I could note that Andres could expand on, if he wants to know.
4553140	4556030	D	0.7978181838989258	Synthetic valence and neuroanalink.
4561130	4582446	A	0.8586441278457642	Well, yeah, STB introduced by Mike in 2015 on Principalia about the correspondence respondents between imagery of an object for many years now.
4582548	4586426	A	0.7074055671691895	You can see a 2020 presentation about it and there's many more content about it.
4586468	4603014	A	0.838316798210144	But the main idea, the way it would actually work out here is the regions of the topologically closed field that behave like a smooth field may potentially correspond to a very blissful experience.
4603132	4613082	A	0.9507805109024048	So I'm very optimistic of the potential of okay, like something like a peak blissful experience, peak five meodmt experience or something like that.
4613216	4621978	A	0.5975253582000732	It would probably, I suspect, have like a very internally simplified topology where the geometry is as smooth as possible.
4622064	4627630	A	0.6708289980888367	So that's kind of like an interesting prediction or angle on all of this, I think.
4627700	4627934	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4627972	4642162	A	0.8837427496910095	Maybe to wrap up, I would say that we would enormously welcome anybody who is technically savvy for doing interesting simulations of the electromagnetic field.
4642216	4666042	A	0.9314099550247192	I mean, we're doing ourselves some really interesting experiments and in combination with classical neural networks, but anybody's kind of like the intersection between machine learning electromagnetic fields and simulations and statistics, machine learning essentially that kind of intersection is something that could really potentially accelerate these research.
4666176	4677322	A	0.839743435382843	If you had the technical competency to sort of work on the analysis I was describing of finding the electromagnetic resonant modes of a graph and then analyzing its topology, we would love to collaborate.
4677386	4682640	A	0.6834144592285156	That's like the sort of content we dream of producing in the next year or two.
4683410	4683934	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
4683972	4684846	A	0.8987807035446167	And thank you for having us.
4684868	4687380	A	0.9691193699836731	It's been really, really appreciate it.
4687830	4688802	B	0.9405770897865295	I appreciate that.
4688856	4689570	B	0.6186602711677551	Chris.

4694616	4701246	C	0.9032586216926575	As you know, I've scribbled down some thoughts about the Markov blankets and about some of those different research areas.
4701278	4704114	C	0.7805615663528442	As you know, we're getting stuff from this as.
4704312	4704830	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4704920	4712134	C	0.4488765299320221	And hopefully this helps reach a few new people who might come up with either a brilliant idea why something we've missed, and this just can't work.
4712172	4714170	C	0.8041888475418091	For some reason, we want to hear that as well.
4714320	4720170	C	0.7069831490516663	But even more constructively ways that this could be tested or built out more gradually modeled.

4723680	4731594	B	0.5666909217834473	New ways of thinking within even one topological frame enables new action selection in the area.
4731712	4733526	B	0.8061814308166504	And the era of video chatting.
4733558	4741540	B	0.5596874952316284	We've made new topological relationships, new connectivities that then disperse yet again.
4742150	4745410	B	0.5215926170349121	And so it continues.
4747110	4748420	B	0.8995601534843445	Thank you all, though.
