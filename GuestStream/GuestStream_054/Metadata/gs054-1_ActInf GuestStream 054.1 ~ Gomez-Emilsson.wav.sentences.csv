5910	7618	2	B	0.61371	Hello and welcome, everyone.
7784	10638	3	B	0.88005	This is active inference Livestream.
10814	14066	4	B	0.9995	Guest stream number 54.1.
14248	17042	5	B	0.94936	It's August 25, 2023.
17176	23870	6	B	1	Today we're going to be hearing about electromagnetic field topology as a solution to the boundary problem of consciousness.
24030	30906	7	B	0.73378	This is going to be a copresentation, followed by a discussion with our guests here.
31008	36774	8	B	0.99623	So I will leave it to everyone to introduce themselves and present and discuss however they prefer.
36902	38886	9	B	1	And thank you again for joining.
38998	39660	10	B	0.99509	Please.
42290	45310	11	A	0.99666	Thank you so much for having us, Daniel.
45650	46014	12	A	0.99312	Yeah.
46052	48842	13	A	0.99306	I'm Andres, co-founder of Qualia Research Institute.
48906	58910	14	A	0.93	And, yeah, I'm here with Libor â€“ Chris, co author of this paper, and Libor, a volunteer and Wiki extraordinaire for QRI.
58990	61330	15	A	0.99352	But yeah, go ahead, Chris, and Libor.
62870	65010	16	C	0.96822	Yeah, no more to say.
65080	65850	17	C	0.9934	That's plenty.
65950	67240	18	C	0.99972	Let's get into the detail.
69610	79114	19	D	0.99056	Yeah, I'm co working with QRI and a lot into Active Instruments, and I'm trying to unify QRI with Active Instruments a lot.
79232	80220	20	D	0.53	And yeah.
84270	85020	21	A	0.99998	Beautiful.
86270	87020	22	A	0.99878	Yeah.
87790	89030	23	A	0.63629	Next slide.
89110	109330	24	A	0.99989	Essentially, our outline of this presentation is going to essentially walk you through some of the key ideas of the paper and kind of like trying to illustrate them or making them a little bit more intuitive, fairly high level, although we will actually present kind of the core argument.
110070	124680	25	A	1	The main thing to point out here next slide is that the magnetic theories of consciousness, I guess, like, 20 years ago, they sounded like a total crackpot type.
138560	150200	26	C	0.99996	Yeah, I've still got a good connection, so we can give him a moment or two, and if not, I'll pick up from what was the crackpot, see if he reconnects.
150300	155780	27	B	0.75081	My gosh, sorry, Andres, please repeat from crackpot.
157320	158196	28	A	0.97	Oh, my God.
158298	158852	29	A	0.74834	Yeah.
158986	175376	30	A	0.97965	Over the last 20 years, however, there's been an explosion of interest in electromagnetic theories of consciousness and serious peer reviewed publications about them, especially the last ten and then five years, kind of like a variable exponential explosion in terms of a number of serious articles published.
175508	196156	31	A	0.99	And one of the very kind of key, amazing kind of contributions that something like an electromagnetic theory of consciousness can offer to the overall ecosystem of philosophy of mind is that it provides a way to solve question for how information can be combined.
196268	205828	32	A	1	I mean, essentially, when you have information distributed, how is it possible that they can be simultaneously part of some kind of, like, unified whole?
205994	217370	33	A	1	And electromagnetic theories of consciousness are just very proud to say, well, the electromagnetic field is ontologically unitary, it's already unified, so there's not much of a problem here.
218380	227084	34	A	0.99998	However, once you kind of have this unity, then the question becomes, well, but how do you actually draw a boundary around it?
227122	229630	35	A	0.99605	So actually, you just traded one problem for another.
231920	233470	36	A	0.98826	Dig into the details there.
239170	239582	37	A	0.97179	Cool.
239636	242990	38	C	0.95055	Shall I take us through the literature review as context for this?
243140	250210	39	C	0.99	And then Andreas will come back to kind of give you the solution that we think can fit with electromagnetic fields.
250790	252722	40	C	0.8458	So, yeah, the boundary problem.
252856	258802	41	C	0.93867	So binding problem you heard just now into a first approximation that is, whatever you think might make up consciousness.
258866	260546	42	C	0.99999	Maybe it's neurons firing.
260658	264034	43	C	0.99999	Maybe it's some sort of magical qualia at the bottom of the universe.
264082	272234	44	C	0.99999	Whatever you think it is, these small things need to be bound together to reflect the complex phenomenology we have.
272272	273674	45	C	0.99996	We see lots of things all at once.
273712	276570	46	C	0.99999	Right now, I'm smelling the flowers outside.
276640	278362	47	C	0.99989	I've got the laptop screen in front of me.
278416	281966	48	C	0.92105	There's lots of stuff happening all at once in a unified way.
282068	283102	49	C	0.99999	So that's the binding problem.
283156	284526	50	C	0.99999	We won't do more on that here.
284548	287214	51	C	0.99981	We'll sort of assume some familiarity with it.
287252	296754	52	C	0.8191	But then the boundary problem is, well, once you've got a mechanism that creates the binding between these lower level entities, why would that mechanism ever stop?
296872	301630	53	C	0.99592	Because clearly, our awareness, our phenomenology doesn't go on forever.
301790	303738	54	C	0.99998	We don't know what's happening in Alpha Centurion.
303774	305858	55	C	0.99935	Our awareness is not unbounded.
306034	312950	56	C	0.98	And as soon as you realize that you need boundaries around something, a number of things suddenly don't quite make sense.
313020	320566	57	C	0.90198	So Owen Schroedinger of physics Fame flagged this up as one of the things that he felt was completely unresolved.
320598	329066	58	C	0.99973	So despite his kind of vast intellect and his contributions elsewhere, he felt that this puzzle was one of the things that he described it as.
329088	332450	59	C	0.99999	When he turns his mind to it, everything just evaporates.
332550	333946	60	C	0.62384	None of it makes sense anymore.
333978	335502	61	C	0.99998	He can't get a grip on the problem.
335636	338862	62	C	0.99	And he described the problem, as you can see on the screen.
338916	347140	63	C	0.99998	He was saying, why is it that my identity is at the intermediate level, this kind of roughly human shaped body?
347750	350962	64	C	0.61	And you can say, okay, we mostly mean the central nervous system.
351016	363400	65	C	1	But either way, this broad entity has lots of smaller things inside it cells, organs, human bodies, and lots of things above it cities, states, solar systems, universes, and so on.
364170	368620	66	C	0.99999	Why is our self consciousness always at this one level?
369070	383754	67	C	1	And if you describe that as a problem to somebody who's never heard of it before or never thought of it before this happened to me just last Friday, they might say, well, it's obviously just like the body stops.
383802	387678	68	C	0.8428	Like, the skull stops here, or like, my arm stops here.
387844	390698	69	C	0.58	Of course, it's not going out to Arthur Centurion.
390794	396014	70	C	0.99609	Why would and it's a very intuitive, immediate human reaction.
396142	400850	71	C	0.99914	But you probe it a little bit, as Schrodinger did, and it kind of falls apart.
401190	413314	72	C	0.99056	Because if you're a neuron firing somewhere in the central nervous system and you're being initiated by a neuron in the peripheral nervous system, well, how do you know to stop binding?
413442	417238	73	C	0.99998	How do you know that there's a boundary that stops at the edge of the central nervous system?
417404	425100	74	C	1	Or if your fingers are holding onto a tool and you're getting feedback from that tool, you're driving a car, it can feel like you're part of that car.
425550	435770	75	C	0.99987	Where does the system know where the boundary is because most of these things that we observe have only observer dependent boundaries.
435930	442174	76	C	0.99964	If you've got a wheel in a car rolling along the road, from one perspective, it looks like the wheel is separate from the road.
442292	447426	77	C	0.99941	But if you're a tiny ant or something and the car is parked, these things all may feel like they're one object.
447608	450578	78	C	0.98	And this was when Schrodinger turned his mind to this.
450744	451666	79	C	1	It puzzled him.
451688	453710	80	C	0.98047	So let's give him the benefit of the doubt.
453790	457160	81	C	0.99943	Let's say that there's something real to be puzzled through here.
458330	462786	82	C	0.62429	This issue applies both to the example I started with around building up in small units.
462898	471210	83	C	0.99999	But also if you're a cosmo panpsychist, you believe that there is one universal consciousness, and we are like a god playing with its puppets.
471710	475526	84	C	1	In that case, you still have the same question because you're still demarcating boundaries.
475638	477302	85	C	0.99999	You just get the mirror image.
477366	482250	86	C	0.97419	We'll mostly focus on the idea of expanding up from small things because that's closer to the orthodoxy.
482330	487870	87	C	0.98993	But you can't solve this problem magically by declaring a single consciousness.
488850	492930	88	C	0.68	Okay, so Schrodinger didn't say much more about this.
493000	495250	89	C	0.99991	He just said that this was a puzzle.
495990	503422	90	C	1	The first person we found that really formalized this and gave it the name boundary problem was Rosenberg.
503486	506760	91	C	1	And it was a number of pieces, late 90s, early two thousand s.
507450	513590	92	C	0.99981	And he uses the phrase siller and Cryptus, but it's exactly the same idea as Schrodinger had.
513660	517000	93	C	1	One of them is, well, why aren't there lots of small things?
517770	522614	94	C	1	I think that might have been the silla, that might have been the nine headed monster.
522742	526058	95	C	1	And then on the other hand, what about the things that we are nested within?
526144	527430	96	C	0.97	And he called that the Cryptus.
527510	535790	97	C	1	And he said, it's very hard to posit a genuinely robust mechanism that would stop it in both directions.
536450	541538	98	C	0.99968	You can imagine a reason why lots of small things get bound together, but why would the binding stop?
541704	547220	99	C	0.86	And his view in framing this problem is that no one had solved it.
548550	563254	100	C	0.99975	Winding on to Andres and I chatting about this last year and building on some of Qri's foundational work in this area, we wanted to know, well, what's happened since Rosenberg framed this and Schroding was so puzzled by it.
563372	566060	101	C	0.99991	Surely someone's come up with a few solutions to it.
566750	574506	102	C	0.99957	So Q standard database driven literature review, and you've got the details there.
574688	576300	103	C	0.61768	Fairly standard stuff.
577710	589214	104	C	0.67243	What we looked looking across the Scopus database, we only found five papers that seemed to be relevant about the boundary problem, compared to 92 on the binding and 47 on the combination problem.
589332	594634	105	C	0.99994	So some of these related problems, and in our intro, we kind of went straight from binding to boundary.
594682	595006	106	C	0.72713	They are.
595028	598466	107	C	0.99989	So if you're thinking about one, you really should be thinking about the other.
598648	600850	108	C	0.99893	Well, that is not reflected in the literature.
601190	603060	109	C	1	We did a bit more puzzling around.
603750	608600	110	C	1	People don't seem to be referring to this by other names, or when they are, they haven't solved it either.
609450	612646	111	C	0.99986	So it felt that there was something worth going at here.
612668	615580	112	C	1	And this is what initiated the paper.
616830	625530	113	C	1	What we did find, though, partly in those five papers and partly in looking around, we do find families of possible solutions.
626430	628246	114	C	1	And there's no clear winner.
628278	632986	115	C	0.99921	But maybe philosophy rarely has a clear winner for anything, so maybe that's an unreasonable expectation.
633098	639840	116	C	0.99983	But there's definitely open questions for each class of theories that have been put out there to solve this problem.
640850	649662	117	C	0.99771	So the first of these loosely termed algorithmic, so computational causal structure theories, I'm just trying to summarize them into one term.
649726	654820	118	C	0.99999	Some of the examples there IIT, of course, very well known global workspace theory as well.
656070	660034	119	C	0.57029	They will tend to say that things bind together when they're in a particular pattern.
660082	674220	120	C	0.99962	So you might imagine a database that references itself or the working memory of a computer, or as soon as things are somehow linked together in a causal sense, in IIT, there's a particular type of pattern, but nonetheless it's an abstract informational relationship.
675870	680586	121	C	0.99971	Those papers don't tend to be super explicit about defining boundaries.
680698	688990	122	C	0.97414	Normally, IIT will normally say, here's our system, and now let's ask within that system, where is the highest phi?
690050	692370	123	C	0.99997	They sort of just say, take the boundaries on that.
692440	694626	124	C	0.99926	No one has said, let's take the whole universe as a system.
694728	699570	125	C	1	The math is already virtually impossible, even toy systems.
700310	711078	126	C	0.57844	But reading between the lines or reading some of the other papers around it, there's something about if you had a hi fi area surrounded by lots of lo fi areas, well, it's natural that it's the bit that's high.
711164	719370	127	C	1	And there's this principle of exclusion that says you take the highest one in a system, maybe you have to specify a system before it makes sense to ask that.
719520	727130	128	C	0.98	And if you took the highest bit out, somehow you just remove some of those causal interconnections that create that highness.
727470	735790	129	C	0.80384	Whatever's left will have a slightly lower bit of phi, and that is now where the sort of locus of consciousness resides.
736610	752258	130	C	0.99984	This may well work, kind of the maths would need working out, I think Andres and I are initially skeptical, but because as best as we can see, no one's really created complicated maps and discussed what would happen when you've got different mixtures of densities that are shifting over time.
752424	754610	131	C	1	What stops it from being arbitrary?
755030	759730	132	C	0.99989	Certainly there are questions to be had, and we can come back to this a bit if we want to talk about it further.
759810	763394	133	C	0.99588	But suffice it to say it's not a guaranteed solution.
763442	765494	134	C	0.99	And there's one critique that we cite.
765542	775974	135	C	0.99653	There resonance theories, a link between those and electromagnetic fields now as well, in that the main progenitor of these theories.
776022	783690	136	C	0.97042	Pam Hunt would say that the main resonance which he sees binding happening together in human consciousness is en fields.
783770	791418	137	C	0.99947	So there are links between these as well, and maybe the informational patterns are being encoded in resonance or quantum entanglement or Em fields.
791434	793618	138	C	0.71087	So there can be links between these as well.
793784	804514	139	C	0.99	The resonance theory that says that binding happens when things are in the same frequency, simple enough, or when they are close enough, and that becomes a little bit more debatable.
804562	808610	140	C	0.99962	But what does that really mean, the boundaries?
808690	818250	141	C	0.99974	There is a conceptual solution for this, which is the slowest shared resonance in a system, but many of the same issues apply as with the algorithmic.
819070	829834	142	C	0.99999	But again, if experimenters, it may be possible to create one that works there quantum theories entanglement is what binds it together, at least in some of them.
829952	835886	143	C	0.99992	So what causes two experiences, a blue cup and the shape of the cup to be bound together into one?
835988	848686	144	C	0.99999	Well, it's that the blueness and the cupness, I'm obviously talking at a very high level of abstraction, but those are somehow quantum entangled with each other that would indeed create, to the best of our physics knowledge today, a kind of ontologically real binding.
848718	851570	145	C	1	And that's quite an attractive part of the solution.
852230	854286	146	C	0.72809	Well, what would stop those boundaries?
854478	855934	147	C	0.99999	There is the monogamy principle.
855982	865798	148	C	0.99996	Things can only be maximally entangled up to a certain point, but there's a very, very open question about whether that sort of thing would enable the kind of macro phenomenology we have.
865884	872410	149	C	0.99978	But in the paper we say all of these are worth exploring, let's keep investigating.
873070	883070	150	C	1	And then there's the one I started with an instruction like maybe it's the boundary of the central nervous system, but hopefully even a small amount of scrutiny causes that one to collapse.
885810	894020	151	C	0.59	And most of these explicitly say that more work is needed, more math is needed, and certainly that will be true of what we're presenting here as well.
894550	897060	152	C	0.99936	What we want to do is add a new one to this list.
897910	915894	153	C	0.9	And the inspiration for this is that, well, if the Em field accounts present a solution to the binding problem they certainly believe they do, there's lots of literature on it, then maybe they can also provide a solution to the boundary problem.
915932	917820	154	C	0.99979	Given how closely related they are.
918590	923034	155	C	0.94613	When you read those accounts, they don't quite have it nailed yet.
923072	931406	156	C	1	The most common explanation they give is a kind of inverse square law rule where, well, the strength of a field just becomes so small so quickly.
931508	940394	157	C	1	By the time you're a centimeter out from the thalamus or by the time you're at the edges of the skull these fields have just evaporated into they've decohered.
940442	943520	158	C	0.99983	They're indistinguishable from the neural noise all around us.
944390	949682	159	C	0.99911	That might be okay if you're okay with a fuzzy boundary and we'll come on to that in a SEC.
949816	956230	160	C	0.33839	Others motivate a phase transition, a bit like quantum entanglement or a bit like the exact resonance of resonance theories.
956730	960120	161	C	0.99002	But those phase transitions are pretty speculative as well.
961210	968758	162	C	0.89898	So the solution we will come to and andrews will outline is a different aspect of em fields.
968774	971430	163	C	0.99752	It's not fuzzy boundaries and it's not a vague phase transition.
971510	977020	164	C	0.99931	It's an entirely different topological solution which we argue can solve the problems.
978750	983310	165	C	0.99966	What we think is worth doing, though, is to make that boundary problem more explicit.
983650	990810	166	C	0.99985	What you've heard both from Schrodinger and from Rosenberg is this idea of kind of like why aren't the cells inside you conscious?
990970	993634	167	C	0.7	Or if they are conscious, why don't we ever experience that?
993672	1000900	168	C	1	And again, going up, what about cities and families and things or group chants or football stadiums, that sort of stuff.
1002310	1013302	169	C	1	And there is a scholar who argues, based on resonance theory, that actually when we are in a group chanting or a group dancing situation, our consciousness does in fact move to that level as well.
1013356	1017500	170	C	1	And it's speculative, but there's much to be thought about.
1018110	1025660	171	C	0.9999	So to make this problem more precise, we've got five, and I'll just give you the one or two sentences on each.
1026750	1035470	172	C	1	The hard boundary problem is this sense that a fuzzy boundary probably isn't good enough.
1035540	1038382	173	C	1	And let's kind of explain a bit more why.
1038516	1050850	174	C	0.99999	If you have something like a wave or the example of the wheel I gave before touching the ground or indeed any connection between any physical atoms, the closer you look to it, the less obvious it is where it stops.
1052070	1064798	175	C	1	The boundaries of my skull may feel very precise to me, but if there were an alien the size of a solar system, their ability to perceive this would most likely just blurs imperceptibly into its surroundings.
1064994	1068220	176	C	0.99982	These things feel hard, but they're not really hard.
1070750	1080858	177	C	1	At the edges of our awareness, there's this sense that things might feel fuzzy, but at some point it just sort of stops, might feel like it might feel infinite.
1080954	1089550	178	C	0.99999	There are states of mind where we can feel an infinite awareness, but probing that further, it doesn't truly encompass everything and go on forever.
1090450	1091354	179	C	1	At this edge.
1091402	1095250	180	C	0.58985	Our assertion is that sometimes this feels like a hard boundary.
1095750	1105326	181	C	0.99	And if it ever sometimes feels like a hard boundary, then you need some mechanism that is capable of a hard edge in a way that these physical phenomena typically aren't.
1105518	1113782	182	C	0.95538	So that's the hard boundary definitely happy to drill into more of any of this or any of the other five if they're not making enough sense in the Q A.
1113916	1128006	183	C	0.99753	So lower levels we've covered mean the great example of this is we know that when we go to sleep, some part of our consciousness, at least the bit that we remember, switches off, yet the brain remains active.
1128118	1136750	184	C	1	The lower levels boundary problem could be reinterpreted as saying why doesn't our awareness just shift to another part of the brain at that point?
1136820	1139760	185	C	1	It certainly doesn't seem to most of the time.
1140370	1143646	186	C	0.9957	Higher level boundary problem, we've had that from the beginning.
1143678	1144674	187	C	0.99968	That's why doesn't it go up?
1144712	1145842	188	C	0.99997	Maybe it does sometimes.
1145976	1149938	189	C	0.99998	Certainly doesn't normally the private boundary problem.
1150024	1162840	190	C	0.66191	So this is now, rather than going down into ourselves or up into the universe in which we are nested, this is more take two of those boundaries, me and you, me and one other person.
1164010	1167894	191	C	0.99999	Why can we not bridge into each other's minds, at least not routinely?
1167942	1172038	192	C	0.99998	Those who claim to do so have struggled to replicate it and get it into the mainstream.
1172214	1173334	193	C	0.99852	So this is privacy.
1173382	1179498	194	C	0.99998	There appears to be some limitation that stops these mechanisms from connecting with each other.
1179584	1193534	195	C	1	And yet if it is slowest shared resonance or if it is highest informational phi in IIT, why is it not possible to construct a system in which the highest phi is now an interconnected one and our consciousness has collapsed?
1193662	1197390	196	C	0.99998	Maybe it is possible, and that's just a technical endeavor we haven't yet achieved.
1197550	1204054	197	C	0.99999	But either way, there's something that's challenging about it, either as a technical barrier or as a philosophical one.
1204252	1210040	198	C	0.61	The last one is a temporal boundary problem because everything we've said so far is in space.
1210490	1219450	199	C	0.99996	But the kind of entities and experiences we're talking about are not zero time, space based activities.
1220350	1222390	200	C	0.99982	They have a temporal persistence.
1222550	1228620	201	C	0.99991	So what is it that puts boundaries around a micro moment of experience?
1229070	1236720	202	C	1	What is it that enables us to experience the end of a note and still retain that idea of the start of the note and experience them together?
1238370	1242226	203	C	1	And how does this extend through broader experiences of the self.
1242328	1245890	204	C	0.99265	So those are the five puzzles.
1246230	1251634	205	C	0.9782	Hopefully that's enough of a qualitative overview so that you know what we're trying to solve at least.
1251832	1257910	206	C	0.98	And if I hand back over to Andrews now, he will give you an entirely new solution to these puzzles.
1259050	1259800	207	A	1	Yes.
1261050	1261666	208	A	0.9953	Next slide.
1261698	1272214	209	A	0.97315	Going a little bit broader too, in that what Chris just talked about is kind of the criteria for the boundary problem, kind of like breaking down the boundary problem into subcomponents.
1272342	1277762	210	A	0.99	And then there's also, more broadly, things that you would want out of a theory of consciousness.
1277846	1283610	211	A	0.98	And so the solution to the boundary problem ideally will also, in a sense, satisfy these constraints.
1283770	1290138	212	A	0.99	And these constraints are framing variance nominated phenomenalism and no strong emergence.
1290234	1291390	213	A	0.9971	Next slide.
1291970	1297846	214	A	0.97824	So framing variance essentially can be recapariance.
1297978	1308182	215	A	1	The fact that whatever structure is giving rise to the boundary shouldn't in a way, be frame specific, shouldn't just depend on how you're looking at an object.
1308236	1316410	216	A	1	It should be kind of like an intrinsic objective property of the object that if you move it around, it shouldn't, in principle, be changing in that way.
1316480	1317450	217	A	0.99998	Next slide.
1319310	1320710	218	A	0.94481	Non epiphenomenalism.
1320790	1333086	219	A	1	For those who are not familiar with the term, this is the idea that for a particular conscious physical system, there corresponds an experience, but that there's no causal influence from that conscious experience back into the system.
1333268	1340160	220	A	0.98	And there's like, various ways of kind of trying to ground the question of, hey, why is epiphenomenalism not the case?
1341330	1347022	221	A	0.99942	There's kind of differences in emphasis by each of these questions, but they're roughly pointing in the same direction.
1347166	1359122	222	A	1	One important question is how is it possible that we can talk in detail about our experience, but the way we actually framed it in the paper that we find the most compelling is how was evolution able to recruit?
1359266	1362630	223	A	0.99803	Coherent, globally bound states.
1362780	1378558	224	A	0.9987	If they're not causally significant, if they're not causally useful, it would just be an extraordinary coincidence that it just happens to happen simultaneously along with something that seems to be computationally significant and encompass a whole lot of information at the same time.
1378724	1379790	225	A	0.98907	Next slide.
1381410	1384650	226	A	0.98	And then we also have no strong emergence.
1384810	1393054	227	A	0.99527	There's this quote from David that says, the Lagrangian of the standard model does not break down inside one's own skull.
1393182	1406678	228	A	1	Meaning we want the laws of physics to apply universally to whatever explanation space we come up with that we don't want to introduce special cases or say like, oh, there's like a special different field in the brain, or anything of the sort.
1406764	1419638	229	A	0.99983	We want to have a homogeneous set of physics that as simple as it gets, as mainstream as it gets in terms of appealing to standard physics.
1419814	1421210	230	A	0.98249	Next slide.
1422270	1429142	231	A	0.99561	So, yeah, the overarching solution and explanation space, that is electromagnetic field topology.
1429206	1437370	232	A	0.97949	So, first of all, I will walk you through in what way this explanation space satisfies the kind of like three constraints that I provided.
1437450	1441326	233	A	1	And then Chris is going to explain how it addresses each of the sub problems.
1441508	1442510	234	A	0.97784	Next slide.
1443810	1446660	235	A	0.6452	So, yeah, next one.
1448470	1459078	236	A	0.98813	Yeah, if you actually kind of look at these amazing reconstructions of the electromagnetic field of stellar bodies, you would see that nothing trivial about it.
1459164	1463110	237	A	0.95207	There's like all of this incredible complexity and richness in structure.
1463610	1467690	238	A	1	A lot of it is very counterintuitive, not something that you would see with a naked eye.
1468030	1477366	239	A	0.98075	You require superimposing, a lot of pictures from the different regions of the spectrum to kind of get a picture of what's going on in the electromagnetic field.
1477488	1485342	240	A	1	And yeah, it has kind of these elongated, weird plasma tubes and circular structures and loops and so on.
1485476	1489590	241	A	0.94131	So it's a very structurally rich environment.
1489770	1490770	242	A	0.994	Next slide.
1491750	1501422	243	A	1	And the way in which something like the topology of that field will satisfy the criteria that wet line is as follows.
1501486	1509000	244	A	0.99036	So if you look at the electromagnetic field of the sun, sometimes this phenomena called magnetic reconnection happens.
1509370	1515150	245	A	1	And this is actually responsible for solar flares and kernel mass ejections.
1515250	1529120	246	A	1	It has to do with when plasma tubes that are the electromagnetic confinement structures touch with each other and so they can open up and spray plasma into the outer space.
1529810	1536270	247	A	1	The key thing to point about here is that this is actually a topological change to the field.
1536420	1549374	248	A	0.93315	It's not just any kind of physical change when you have a solar flare coronal mass ejection that is the effect of a macroscopic gigantic topological transformation.
1549502	1559186	249	A	0.99993	What this slide is trying to get at is that whether a system experienced magnetic reconnection or not will not depend on your frame of reference.
1559298	1573978	250	A	0.99	And the very simple reason is that Lorentz transforms simply squeeze and stretch, but they never actually reconnect or cut or add any kind of topological change.
1574064	1579514	251	A	1	In other words, a Lorentz transform will leave a topological event untouched.
1579642	1588526	252	A	0.99987	So in that sense okay, like topology as an explanation space for why this is framing variant, it definitely fits the bill.
1588628	1589630	253	A	0.99998	Next slide.
1592710	1601170	254	A	0.987	Importantly, too, in the brain, we also can tackle the question of, like, in what way the field is not epiphenomenal.
1601990	1615346	255	A	0.99995	There's a lot of research on local field potentials in the which are little microscopic electric oscillations, and they do seem to actually have causal effects on the activity of neurons.
1615378	1622582	256	A	1	In other words, people might believe, in a sense, that, hey, brainwaves are kind of just a reflection of neural activity.
1622726	1638410	257	A	0.99996	But the thing that something like transcranial magnetic stimulation makes clear is that on top of that, they actually feed back into the probability for neurons to fire, especially the probability for neurons to fire in synchrony or in a state of coherence.
1638490	1654950	258	A	1	In other words, the actual causal structure of electromagnetic field and how it connects to neural activity is this dual causal arrow where neural activity influences local field potentials, neural activity influences activity via synapse.
1666520	1668624	259	C	0.99912	Yeah, we've been the victim of the connection.
1668672	1672310	260	C	0.99994	Again, let's hope it comes back as quickly as it did last time.
1676220	1680600	261	B	0.8	Yes, there's a lot to say, but I won't.
1683420	1689116	262	C	0.8769	Hopefully you got some harsh questions written down as we've been taking you through it.
1689298	1697950	263	B	0.56443	Yeah, just enough people who are listening in the discussion will look at some questions, so please feel free to write anything.
1703360	1720070	264	B	0.35	It personally, I'm curious whether the awareness is going to be the light of the sun, the heat of the sun, the ejection, the loop structure, the birth and death of the star.
1724110	1724860	265	A	0.89531	Yeah.
1727070	1736234	266	C	0.99993	If the idea that you'll see here stands, then you've got the idea that a closed topological pocket of electromagnetic field, that's where awareness can take place.
1736272	1739658	267	C	0.99997	That's where a first person perspective, a kind of a locus, can exist.
1739754	1741390	268	C	0.99991	But what it's aware of?
1741540	1743486	269	C	0.99943	Well, that's an entirely different question.
1743668	1750606	270	C	1	And if there are pockets like that, we're not asserting in this paper that the sun has these it's such a complex entity.
1750718	1758020	271	C	0.98609	It's very possible, but that is a different but if to the extent they are there, what on Earth would be experienced within it?
1759030	1760420	272	C	0.99984	That's a different thing.
1761270	1769030	273	B	1	The content problem, it's not just for YouTubers, it's also for conscious systems.
1770170	1780698	274	B	0.57315	But yeah, you've bound it all together, you've delimited a boundary topologically and then about what?
1780784	1782060	275	B	1	And so what?
1783230	1789760	276	C	0.99546	Yeah, let me pick up a bit while we're while we're waiting for him to come in.
1792210	1801450	277	C	0.86	And there's really growing kind of neuroscience and biological evidence for downward causation from electromagnetic fields in the brain.
1801530	1809150	278	C	1	And all we really do in this paper is acknowledge that research literature exists and say, and therefore, it's possible for fields to be non epipenomenal.
1809230	1812898	279	C	0.96083	We don't get into the specifics of it, but they've been shown in memory formation.
1812994	1815778	280	C	0.99249	They've been shown in the olfactory bulb for your smells.
1815874	1817640	281	C	0.99837	They've appeared all over the place.
1818810	1820150	282	C	0.61104	Andres, you're back.
1820300	1825606	283	C	0.84905	Just making the case for non epiphenomenal fields in the brain.
1825638	1826342	284	A	0.86	Oh, fantastic.
1826406	1826778	285	A	0.99966	Beautiful.
1826864	1827114	286	A	0.61133	Yeah.
1827152	1828026	287	A	0.99995	Sorry about that.
1828128	1829658	288	A	0.99981	Hopefully, it doesn't happen again.
1829824	1830202	289	A	1	Okay.
1830256	1831210	290	A	0.99999	Next slide.
1833390	1833850	291	A	0.99974	Yeah.
1833920	1853066	292	A	0.75	And think about the immense causal power that a topological change in the field has in cosmological terms, like these billions of tons of plasma being ejected just because of otherwise epiphenomenal magnetic reconnection.
1853098	1859918	293	A	0.8112	It's like, no, actually, topological transformations are really significant at a massive, massive scale.
1860014	1861330	294	A	0.99996	Next slide?
1864660	1865410	295	A	0.97053	Yeah.
1865940	1866930	296	A	0.99998	Next one.
1867320	1871510	297	A	0.99992	Just showing kind of how ridiculously powerful this can be.
1872840	1873300	298	A	0.99993	Yeah.
1873370	1887240	299	A	1	And importantly, too, the actual fact that you get an enclosure with a topological transformation in a medium also gives you this capacity to essentially have holistic behavior.
1887740	1891870	300	A	0.99999	This is one of the things that, to me, was kind of the most exciting about this explanation space.
1892480	1900040	301	A	1	The moment you can close field lines or do a top formation, waves will be confined.
1900200	1904044	302	A	0.99999	Some kinds of waves can be confined within a topological pocket.
1904172	1908860	303	A	0.99752	When you have confinement of waves, then you have resonant modes.
1908940	1935908	304	A	1	And when you have resonant modes, then you have this very fantastic effect where the whole shape of an object essentially is expressed in the way every part of the object is vibrating, in which case, essentially, you have this reason why evolution would recruit these topological objects is because it actually allows organisms to behave as a unit.
1936004	1940784	305	A	0.99896	So I think, yeah, that might be a very key piece of the puzzle for epiphenomenalism.
1940852	1941980	306	A	0.99991	Next slide.
1942400	1956450	307	A	0.99986	These are just kind of like some sketches of some of the kinds of boundaries that, in principle, you may have in the electromagnetic field and what kind of binding in consciousness they might correspond to.
1957060	1959532	308	A	0.99997	But you don't have to just speculate.
1959596	1969172	309	A	1	The really exciting thing here is that you can actually play with simulations of the electromagnetic field to try to make sense of the topological transformations that happen in it.
1969306	1986330	310	A	0.7578	So the next following slides we can just go through them fairly quickly are essentially resonant modes of an empty cavity, electromagnetic resonance modes of an empty cube cavity, where the left side is the electric field and the right side is the magnetic field.
1988400	1993740	311	A	0.97	The website where you can check this is called Falstad.com EMBOX.
1994560	2003276	312	A	1	And the thing that it kind of really neatly shows is how the magnetic field sometimes get this closed looping structure.
2003388	2003996	313	A	1	Next slide.
2004028	2007970	314	A	0.99979	Yeah, just go through them, maybe like 5 seconds for each of them.
2009060	2016448	315	A	1	And it also allows you to essentially look at what happens when you stack some of these resonant modes.
2016544	2027524	316	A	1	And some combinations, linear combinations of these resonant modes create intricate eddings and loops and twists that.
2027722	2031380	317	A	0.99991	Loop around and create this topological boundary very fleeting.
2031540	2038532	318	A	1	It has to do with the frequency of oscillation of the electric field, how many times per second you're going to get this looping structure.
2038676	2045320	319	A	0.87895	But the fact that yeah, you can show there's some topologically closed objects that appear there is quite remarkable.
2045480	2053772	320	A	0.99	And overall, the idea here would be that well, something like this is happening in the brain and the brain is actually recruiting these looping architectures.
2053836	2055680	321	A	0.95	All right, I'll hand it over to Chris.
2058340	2059296	322	C	0.99993	Thank you very much.
2059398	2069972	323	C	0.81	Yes, we've seen that electromagnetic fields can form closed loops and people have used that, some of the sites in the paper around people trapping knots of light.
2070106	2076820	324	C	0.99	And it just kind of really remarkable things happening at the edge of sort of room temperature state physics.
2076900	2078250	325	C	0.99999	Really incredible stuff.
2079580	2088468	326	C	0.99989	We know that in principle, these fields are capable of downward causation in massive contexts like the sun, but also in very real human brain settings.
2088564	2092376	327	C	0.76898	So conceptually, and we know that topologies in general are framing variants.
2092488	2098188	328	C	0.99975	So we've got those things in place, we've got boundaries that satisfy those various features that we wanted.
2098354	2100936	329	C	0.99998	We don't know exactly how they occur in the human brain.
2101048	2104850	330	C	1	All we're presenting is a conceptual solution that those things are possible.
2105300	2114500	331	C	0.79029	But what we do say is, well, what would such a solution look like to those five boundary problems that we just described?
2114840	2119988	332	C	0.99992	So taking them one by one, or rather yeah, taking them as a group.
2120074	2138584	333	C	0.68437	Let's first say what in such a theory, the first person perspective, that kind of phenomenal awareness, the what it's likeness that we experience in a very normal everyday sense, what could that reflect, what could that correspond to in such a model?
2138622	2142204	334	C	1	And there are others, but we'll give one example and use that to walk through the problems.
2142402	2160640	335	C	0.99933	So we would say that once you've got a closed topology and it may well require the time dimension for it to be properly ontologically closed and at that point em energy of that specific spectra, the same spectra that's making up the boundary can't pass through it or not.
2160710	2162620	336	C	0.99925	That's the whole point about the closed loop.
2162700	2165920	337	C	0.99999	Other things might pass through it, sound wave might pass through it.
2165990	2170804	338	C	0.99979	But nonetheless, for the entities that we're interested in, it is closed to itself.
2170922	2173780	339	C	1	And that's where we can get this hard boundary.
2174200	2176256	340	C	0.99997	There may be lots of these being created in the brain.
2176288	2183160	341	C	1	The brain is absolutely chock a block with different bits of em generating underlying phenomena.
2183980	2186596	342	C	0.99993	So it's certainly plausible that some of them are closed.
2186708	2187672	343	C	0.99993	We don't know.
2187806	2189804	344	C	0.99992	For this to be true, there must be at least one.
2189922	2192312	345	C	0.99999	But it's plausible that if there's one, there's probably several.
2192456	2194830	346	C	0.99997	So you've got several of these.
2195200	2202124	347	C	1	By definition they are non overlapping, the boundaries cannot overlap, but they could well be multiple at the same time.
2202162	2204530	348	C	1	One at the front, one at the back could be all over the place.
2205300	2215812	349	C	0.99993	It's probable though, that only a subset would be continually recreated in a stable manner because the fact that these fields can have downward causation, they can do useful things.
2215946	2232020	350	C	0.62078	Some of the sites in the paper about information processing point to some of the nonlinearities you can achieve through wave and field based resonant, mode based computations which may well have benefits from an information processing perspective.
2232100	2235320	351	C	0.57159	So in some cases these will be continually recreated.
2236300	2248750	352	C	0.99999	Only one of them, because they cannot overlap, only one of them can enclose, let's call it an immediate memory model as a conceptual point, not committing to what exactly that might mean.
2251040	2257452	353	C	0.99999	We suspect these wouldn't last very long and they probably don't extend over the whole brain, but who knows?
2257596	2260108	354	C	0.67838	Regardless, it would vary from period to period.
2260284	2269908	355	C	0.99999	Other field theories might have other ways of recruiting this concept for solving the boundary problem, but let's walk this one through and see what it looks like as a response to those five things.
2269994	2277852	356	C	0.9995	So what we're saying is this closed topological pocket that is kind of axiomatically the same as a first person awareness.
2277936	2289880	357	C	0.99992	When you've got that, you've got something that is capable of both binding together those micro bits of experience and presenting them within a boundary so they have some unified ontology.
2291100	2298700	358	C	0.99938	So one by one, and I think this is our last slide, the hard boundary, well, that comes from what we've been talking about.
2298770	2302216	359	C	0.73033	Energy of the same spectra can't pass through the closed loop.
2302248	2307068	360	C	0.99997	So that happens quite naturally, a bit like with the field solution to binding.
2307164	2326928	361	C	1	This is something you almost get for free as a result of using that lower levels and higher levels well, because only one of them, because of the non overlapping point, because only one of them can include the immediate memory model, which is crucial for the next bit, then you can't have lower levels and higher levels.
2327024	2331428	362	C	0.9998	There may well be mind dust at those levels which is this kind of lovely evocative concept.
2331524	2338488	363	C	0.99954	There may well be flashes of tiny bits of awareness that kind of they never repeat the patterns just gone for it.
2338494	2343100	364	C	0.9926	There's nothing that links it into future versions of itself, just gone.
2343170	2345148	365	C	1	The universe may be replete with these things.
2345234	2347036	366	C	0.99828	It's certainly got plenty of electrons in it.
2347058	2348124	367	C	0.99999	Why not plenty of these things?
2348162	2349020	368	C	0.99999	Who knows?
2350640	2358480	369	C	0.99995	But there's only one closed pocket that maybe I'll come back to four that can enclose this immediate memory module.
2359060	2366580	370	C	0.98383	That's crucial because it's what creates a temporal boundary that in any possible sense could reflect what we experience day to day.
2366650	2389416	371	C	0.99994	Because these tiny if you think of these 4D pockets, if one pocket were to last long enough to encompass, say, a whole day's worth of your experience, it's almost impossible for it to vary enough without breaking to actually contain all the types of complex phenomena we experience during the day.
2389518	2395870	372	C	0.99892	Which is why we think it's much more likely they persist for a short period of time, but nonetheless, our experiences of things persisting for longer.
2396800	2400104	373	C	1	Now, the micro level persistence, why is it nonzero?
2400232	2406336	374	C	0.99965	Because if something is infinitesimally small, it probably doesn't help us.
2406358	2413008	375	C	0.99998	If something is the equivalent of a geometric point, no matter how many of them you put together in a physical setting, you're not going to create a line.
2413094	2414940	376	C	0.99999	We want some non zero duration.
2415020	2419344	377	C	0.9969	Well, we've got that for free because the closed pocket has this 4D ontological presence.
2419392	2420276	378	C	0.99986	That's fine.
2420458	2426860	379	C	0.99406	How would you get but it may be really short, far shorter than we experience even this sentence.
2427040	2428536	380	C	0.99992	So what ties that together?
2428638	2433876	381	C	0.99995	Well, because it encloses each millisecond to millisecond, it recreates.
2434068	2436244	382	C	0.99999	Each one is a different piece of awareness.
2436372	2441044	383	C	0.99999	They are not in any way ontologically linked to each other, they are each separate.
2441172	2447404	384	C	0.57966	But because each one encloses the memory module, which is just an information processing thing, you can encode memory and pen and paper.
2447442	2448892	385	C	0.92871	There's nothing magical about this.
2449026	2456976	386	C	1	By referencing it, it knows what was just there before, and that can create we could call it an illusion if you want.
2456998	2459472	387	C	0.99993	Whether that matters is a much more philosophical point.
2459526	2463856	388	C	0.99993	But you create this pseudo time arrow, you have unified insight, because that's what fields do.
2463878	2467248	389	C	1	They unify the insight in all the things that make it up.
2467414	2468848	390	C	0.99782	No information is lost.
2468944	2470870	391	C	1	It is all bound together.
2471560	2477076	392	C	0.99999	So now you've got the recent past and then you've got the bit before that from the previous pocket, and the bit before that and the bit before that.
2477178	2481568	393	C	0.99998	So it's all bound into each individual present.
2481754	2485080	394	C	0.99992	As short as it may be, it has the sense that it's something bigger.
2485500	2494152	395	C	1	Now, in terms of the macro level, days, years between interruptions, this is one where we are far more philosophically relaxed.
2494296	2500472	396	C	1	It may well be that there is no kind of profound sense in which these things are the same entity.
2500536	2506716	397	C	0.99489	It's maybe a ship of theseus type concept, and it's all linked together by some fairly weak long term memory.
2506748	2510848	398	C	0.99	And are we really the same person as we were a week ago, a year ago?
2511014	2515652	399	C	0.96905	We're far less philosophically concerned about that than we are by the micro level and the meter level.
2515706	2523110	400	C	0.9975	But either way, the solutions are the classic personal identity solutions, which have been gone over plenty of times.
2524120	2529930	401	C	0.84688	If you'll give us another five minutes before questions, we'd love to share some more kind of speculative thoughts with you.
2530780	2531832	402	C	0.99968	Getting a thumbs up.
2531886	2532372	403	A	0.99715	Wonderful.
2532436	2536680	404	C	1	In which case, over to Andres for some fun, thought provoking stuff.
2536830	2539096	405	A	0.83045	Well, awesome.
2539278	2542140	406	A	0.63892	Yeah, I mean, it's just kind of like this deeper question.
2542210	2547292	407	A	1	And don't wait for me if my internet runs out for a second.
2547346	2553724	408	A	0.99954	But essentially, how does this influence, for example, beliefs of personal identity?
2553852	2555004	409	A	0.99994	Next slide.
2555132	2569012	410	A	1	I think once you start seeing the universe as a field and with maybe like fleeting topological pockets on it, that actually very significantly informs these classic questions in philosophy like who are you?
2569066	2573856	411	A	1	And do you continue to exist from one moment to the other and indeed the other sheep of the sea's?
2573968	2578408	412	A	0.99952	Is there any kind of metaphysical endearing ego, so to speak?
2578574	2589988	413	A	1	And I actually think that each of these views of personal identity could actually be reinterpreted in terms of claims about the field and field topology.
2590164	2592660	414	A	0.99995	So something like closed individualism.
2592740	2597384	415	A	0.99993	This is the belief that you start existing when you're born, stop existing when you die, or maybe you go to heaven.
2597432	2603680	416	A	0.99999	But the point is that you're kind of a separate self that endures over time that is different than other selves.
2604260	2623856	417	A	1	Here we would want to find some kind of enduring sheath or enduring nested architecture that even though maybe each moment of awareness might be its own topological pocket, maybe there's some kind of higher order topological unity that does carry over a person's lifetime.
2623968	2632328	418	A	0.99988	That would be a possible way of raifying in an actual significant physical way the sense of identity over time.
2632414	2634132	419	A	1	Of course, completely speculative.
2634196	2636312	420	A	0.99	It would be a matter of actually finding it in the field.
2636366	2639256	421	A	0.99999	But that's how you could, I think, Steel men this notion.
2639368	2650556	422	A	0.99999	Next slide, then probably the most compatible and easy to justify view here would be empty individualism, that every moment of experience is ontologically different.
2650738	2658044	423	A	1	And again here that would be possible because we would have these fleeting hard boundaries in the spacetime continuum.
2658172	2665460	424	A	1	And as a consequence, you can look at the block universe and say, okay, there's a 40 pocket there, there's a 40 pocket over there.
2665530	2669332	425	A	1	And wherever you see a 40 pocket, that is going to be a subject of experience.
2669466	2681124	426	A	1	And any actual continuity between moments of experience are either just causal or kind of illusory constructed with the memory module, as Chris was suggesting.
2681252	2688772	427	A	0.68	And then next slide and then finally open individualism, there's this view that we are all one consciousness.
2688916	2692636	428	A	0.58964	We're all Krishna at the bottom layer, so to speak.
2692738	2711328	429	A	0.99473	Well, the way we could justify this within the topological account is that, well, actually at the deepest ontological level, we're all the field, which just happened to be on a given point in time segmentation of that field that prevents information propagation with other regions of the field.
2711414	2721456	430	A	0.9999	So in this case, kind of the topological segmentation would actually be more of an epistemological boundary than it would actually be an ontological boundary.
2721488	2724388	431	A	0.67591	It's like the idea that deep down actually we are the field.
2724554	2735976	432	A	0.87078	It's just that how the field knows itself is constrained by its topology in which case, yeah, it's another way of still meaning we're all one consciousness in a very physically grounded way.
2736078	2737592	433	A	0.7	And, yeah, I think that's it.
2737646	2756384	434	A	0.99994	Unless I put anything else in the next slide oh, yeah, just the last kind of like speculation here is, well, okay, if you are this topological pocket in the field electromagnetic field, how can you in a sense, take a look at that pocket and then reconstruct what the experience feels like.
2756502	2770576	435	A	1	And here perhaps like a fun thought experiment that you could make is thinking about what it would be like to be a photon trapped kind of within a hall of mirrors.
2770688	2783460	436	A	0.61394	There's this article I wrote, 2018 about how to replicate a hyperbolic space using just double mirrors and gradient index optics.
2783620	2792716	437	A	0.71	And essentially within that structure that has those properties, a photon would have no way of telling the fact that it is not in hyperbolic space.
2792818	2801576	438	A	1	In other words, the index of refraction of a container would present itself as the actual geometry of the space from within.
2801698	2815724	439	A	0.67976	So in our brain, presumably, the actual way in which the local field potentials are stitched together and the relative index of refraction could potentially give rise to really arbitrary possible internal geometrics.
2815772	2825296	440	A	0.99993	Where there's the illusion that you're in a space, whether it's in hyperbolic space, in spherical space, some irregular geometry, all of those could be emulated with this paradigm.
2825328	2835172	441	A	1	And that may go a little bit a long way in actually explaining some of the most exotic experiences that people can have, which usually would challenge kind of theories of consciousness.
2835236	2839484	442	A	0.89	Here there's a way of stitching them together to explain them.
2839522	2841630	443	A	1	And I think yeah, the last slide, I believe.
2843840	2844204	444	A	0.99929	Yeah.
2844242	2848030	445	A	0.98763	So this is just illustrating that point, I think this is it.
2850640	2852192	446	C	1	And we can leave this up on the screen.
2852246	2853824	447	C	0.99976	This is just where we would go next with it.
2853862	2857520	448	C	0.99743	But this seems like a good point to stop and hear your thoughts.
2859380	2860032	449	B	0.99986	Awesome.
2860166	2862240	450	B	0.99967	Great presentations.
2863720	2870260	451	B	0.98153	Well, Bernie, would you like to give first reflection and I'll write down some questions and look in the live chat?
2871000	2871990	452	D	0.99163	Yeah, sure.
2873000	2887480	453	D	0.81653	I've been thinking a lot about similar stuff like this recently, and the paper presents how the functional theories have the problem of arbitrariness.
2888060	2896840	454	D	0.98051	So, for example, with Markov blanket Markov blankets, that could be the case when there's Markov blankets as ontological observers.
2897000	2913724	455	D	0.99	And I was thinking that maybe unifying this with the Marko blanket paradigm is that the mark of blanket that on the physical level is implemented using this topological pocket is the conscious mark of blackend.
2913772	2923920	456	D	0.99932	So it's how you were referring the mark of black and solves the content problem, while the topological boundary solves all the other problems.
2924070	2925520	457	D	0.99376	Like objective.
2933660	2934410	458	A	0.48056	Maybe.
2937340	2939260	459	A	0.95839	Yeah, no, that's something very quick to mention.
2939330	2942296	460	A	0.99657	Obviously, we're in the active inference institute podcast.
2942328	2943484	461	A	0.6	I mean, absolutely.
2943602	2957520	462	A	1	One thing to mention is that our perspective is not in itself necessary or is not necessary and sufficient actually to satisfy the code that we have specified.
2958340	2966652	463	A	1	However, we actually think it's very likely that topological pockets in the electromagnetic field do behave as mark of blankets.
2966716	2983320	464	A	1	And so it is a way in which you can actually interface these different paradigms where we would be saying that at the implementation level can then realize the minimization of free energy at the algorithmic level.
2983470	3005168	465	A	1	However, we would be saying, and maybe this would be a little bit of a twist or a nontrivial implication, that if you were to simulate a hierarchically structured mark of blanket system in a computer, it could very well be from a certain abstraction, be minimizing free energy, but it wouldn't be able to solve the boundary problem.
3005254	3020020	466	A	1	In other words, it is sort of like there is a significant overlap, but there are some slight places of a divergence where you might say, hey, a market blanket is actually not enough because it doesn't give you the implementation level explanation for how you get boundaries.
3021560	3023350	467	A	0.99881	Chris, if you want to add anything.
3023960	3047788	468	C	0.89898	Yeah, I mean, just to agree with that, I think this is if you go back to Mars, three levels around kind of what substrate we haven't discussed anything here about the algorithms that are actually taking place on or kind of within the brain that would ultimately get incorporated into the Em field.
3047874	3049596	469	C	0.99997	Clearly you need that stuff as well.
3049698	3059410	470	C	0.99471	None of this makes any contribution to solving these more content problems of consciousness or how we make inferences about the world, how we respond to those.
3060100	3080330	471	C	1	What it does say is that if there are algorithms that solve those problems, and there are some good candidates out there, including yours, they need to be implemented or they need to reflect back to a field for it to become part of someone's unified macrophenomenological experience.
3080780	3099740	472	C	0.99994	If you did some sort of feed forward in Silico version of this, or you did it, you implemented the algorithm using rocks, just lots and lots of rocks laid out forever like that wonderful xkcd example, that is not going to create a bound first person perspective anywhere.
3103220	3107724	473	B	0.98611	Well, a lot to say about that, certainly Markov blankets.
3107772	3111916	474	B	1	And just to define it on a Bayesian graph, so the map not the territory.
3112028	3118656	475	B	1	The Markov blanket is the set of nodes upon which two other sets of nodes are conditionally independent.
3118768	3121536	476	B	0.99	And that's a purely topological statement.
3121648	3134084	477	B	1	It doesn't matter how far if there even is a spatial association or temporal association, it doesn't matter the distance, which is to say the geometry, but rather the blanket is a purely topological statement.
3134212	3158336	478	B	1	And that's what, among other things, we've been exploring with Chris Fields in the physics as information processing and this question about the topology of communication for bounded observers, and as we kind of alluded to with that content problem, the topology of communication is, to use a geometric metaphor, it's orthogonal to the content.
3158518	3161664	479	B	1	You could have two people on the phone sharing different things.
3161782	3164784	480	B	1	You could have a video file with different contents.
3164912	3169988	481	B	1	And so there's really a lot of layers that come into play.
3170154	3181560	482	B	1	And so, I think, from an instrumentalist view, I read your paper as a call for the introduction of topology into what is often only modeled as geometric.
3181900	3188212	483	B	1	A call for the integration of electromagnetism rather than a reliance on one or the other.
3188366	3202400	484	B	1	Of course, as introduced from the outset, a pluralism these are not exhaustive nor exclusive accounts, and we don't know what the scope of the possible intelligences and awarenesses are.
3202550	3216710	485	B	0.99131	So from a research perspective, if not beyond, why would we want to limit when we're not only interested in understanding the properties of any given system as we see it today?
3219480	3221780	486	B	0.99992	Any thoughts where I can read a question in the Chat?
3224040	3225350	487	A	0.5	Oh, that sounds great.
3226780	3233240	488	B	0.973	Turnkey Tyranny writes, how does topology show up phenomenologically?
3238370	3240926	489	A	0.99771	Yeah, this is an excellent, excellent question.
3241108	3242174	490	A	0.73013	I'm happy to take it.
3242212	3244050	491	C	0.10995	Andrews do you want to go back to your notes?
3244550	3246500	492	C	0.69833	We've got that page of notes in there.
3246950	3248580	493	A	0.93963	Sure, let's do that.
3249990	3257398	494	C	0.99344	Because I've asked a very similar question of Andres, and these sort of notes is what resulted in his attempts to explain it to me.
3257484	3275910	495	A	0.98454	Let me take yes, this is very speculative, but one wonderful resource, I think, hopefully I think is wonderful, very worth trying out is we made a series of guided meditations about phenomenology.
3276070	3277878	496	A	0.99696	It's not really kind of like for the sake of spirituality.
3277894	3281338	497	A	0.93886	It's more for the sake of exploring phenomenology with meditation.
3281514	3285002	498	A	1	The last one is called the phenomenology of ontology.
3285146	3310214	499	A	1	And that one helps you, in a sense, get a sense of how beliefs about the narrative reality reality, of course, different to believe that electromagnetic field or you're an electromagnetic feels or in a specific version of materialism or something like that.
3310252	3314150	500	A	0.99972	So very different ontologies can give rise to very different feelings.
3314650	3326060	501	A	1	And so there's definitely the worry that, well, if you think a lot about the electromagnetic field, aren't you maybe just interpreting your sensations within that paradigm, but it's kind of like you're overfeeding on top of it.
3326750	3331998	502	A	0.99965	But in a sense, I would argue that actually it's the other way around.
3332084	3341466	503	A	0.99996	With something as generic and structured as electromagnetic field, you can, I think, in principle, explain the phenomenology of any ontology.
3341578	3350242	504	A	0.93047	Like, why does it feel like, for example, that you can kind of merge with the cosmos or something like that?
3350296	3355654	505	A	1	Why does it feel like you can become one with everything in meditation, let's say in various meditation states?
3355852	3366098	506	A	0.99898	Well, with something like the topological explanation for the boundary problem, the way we might interpret that is as the vanishing of internal boundaries.
3366194	3377914	507	A	1	And so there is a significant difference between a global boundary, which is what we focused on, the overall kind of the macroscopic division that says whether you're inside or outside your experience.
3378112	3402382	508	A	0.99997	But something that the electromagnetic field also affords and gives us as kind of part of its rich structure is the possibility of internal boundaries as well, which would be not boundaries that wrap around a 4D object, but rather lower dimensional boundaries like meeting points or convergence points of the field lines within the pocket.
3402446	3424998	509	A	1	And so in this account, whenever you have the sensation of solidity, the feeling of, well, I am here, you're there, or there's a boundary between us, that boundary would essentially be an internal boundary, would be a region of the field while the field lines converge or they align, but it's only along a certain cross section.
3425094	3428902	510	A	0.99999	Meaning that actually your experience is still fully unified.
3428966	3437290	511	A	0.50826	You can still go from one point to the other across a perceived barrier because they're still part of the whole experience, they're still connected.
3437370	3447006	512	A	1	In other words, with this kind of data structure, we can arrive at kind of like a lot of phenomenological details and trying to explain them from that perspective.
3447118	3466182	513	A	1	And I think it's going to be an enormous program in the long term involving physicists and mathematicians and exotic states of consciousness to say like, okay, that particular feature of experience that happens on such and such substance in such meditation state, how does that map into the electromagnetic field?
3466236	3470970	514	A	0.99	And I think we will very likely find a lot of non trivial connections with that sort of paradigm.
3474440	3476470	515	B	0.81346	Chris, any thoughts on that?
3478280	3494570	516	C	0.99999	Just to make the link to some of the diagrams on the page, which is if you've got these non 4D closed boundaries, but other types of boundaries, the other types of shapes Andrews was talking about, the drawings on the page are just examples of some of those.
3496480	3502620	517	C	0.67209	As Andrew said, it's not really part of the solution, but it's part of imaginatively exploring where else it might go.
3502770	3510668	518	C	0.96754	So if you've got feature binding, which know I'm seeing a cup and the cup is both blue and cup shaped, that's feature binding.
3510684	3514444	519	C	1	And then the phenomenological binding is my whole experience being unified.
3514572	3518816	520	C	1	You can imagine feature binding putting the blueness and the cupness together.
3518918	3522832	521	C	0.80979	That might be something that happens along one of these types of internal boundaries.
3522976	3523652	522	C	0.93	It might not.
3523706	3526980	523	C	1	It might be that that can be done purely through informational associations.
3527400	3529156	524	C	0.61704	We're kind of agnostic on that.
3529258	3542164	525	C	0.99998	But what's interesting about a 4D topology is within it you can have lots of other complicated topologies provided they are not closed along the fourth dimension, because then you sort of created another little mini bit of bit of awareness.
3542292	3542964	526	C	0.94	Oh, Bernie.
3543012	3543480	527	C	1	Go ahead.
3543550	3545450	528	C	0.99673	Yeah, I'll jump back to the other page.
3546080	3549612	529	D	0.99522	Yeah, I wanted to say something else not related to this exact question.
3549666	3552364	530	D	0.99222	So if you have ended it, maybe.
3552402	3559920	531	A	0.8101	I'll well, in that case, actually, I'll mention one last thing about how electromagnetic field may be related to phenomenology.
3560580	3575796	532	A	0.71	A very specific thing that happens on psychedelics, and especially something like DMT is that you may end up having different regions of your experience, have the exact same texture, and have the feeling of synchronization between them.
3575818	3581328	533	A	0.91	And when that happens, they sort of become the same object, just like spatially distributed.
3581504	3593724	534	A	1	The way I interpret this is whenever the exact same wave equation applies to two regions of your experience and waves can propagate from one region to the other that actually feels like they're the same object.
3593842	3607500	535	A	0.99985	So one kind of, like, natural way in which regions of your phenomenal world might be segmented out into phenomenal objects is by confining how waves can move within the world simulation.
3607580	3622150	536	A	1	And whenever you have what feels like a bound object in your world simulation that I think is highly, highly related to waves being able to smoothly travel within that object but not outside of that object, some kind of wave confinement is happening.
3623160	3635220	537	B	0.99986	I'll add in one more, of course, fun and speculative thought, which is the aboutness the content of what this computation or what this process is unfolding.
3635300	3638152	538	B	1	The aboutness itself can be structure learning.
3638286	3645960	539	B	0.98	And so even for a fixed electromagnetic topology, you can have variable informational topology.
3646120	3650712	540	B	0.99999	Case in point, the von Neumann computer, the CPU architecture.
3650776	3653576	541	B	0.98937	Electromagnetically is not changing topologically.
3653688	3659804	542	B	0.99993	We don't need to reroute the telephone connections for there to be different messages that spread.
3659932	3673460	543	B	1	And so there's a lot of richness in the space you've sketched or surveyed, because even for a fixed topology, we might be able to do compositional binding like blue and cup.
3674120	3699688	544	B	1	And then now we add in a dynamic, multiscale topological unfolding, and then that may connect to different frequencies of, for example, measurements in the EEG, which are really only picking up the synchrony in the outer shell, which might actually play a role.
3699704	3701304	545	B	0.952	It's not like the skull matters.
3701352	3702664	546	B	0.99999	You could have a skull removed.
3702712	3703496	547	B	0.9999	It's not the scalp.
3703528	3704788	548	B	0.99996	It's not your hair.
3704984	3707116	549	B	0.99531	It's not necessarily the meninge.
3707228	3708224	550	B	0.99733	But what is it?
3708262	3736090	551	B	0.99978	Well, maybe it's something that's infotainment that reflects kind of different regimes of attention that actually does happen to correspond, but it's also localized, and that's that interplay with individuality and oneness that works like Wilbur's, no boundary point towards, but then you got to come back from no boundary because that sentence has to end.
3739340	3740280	552	B	0.99251	Bernie.
3741260	3741864	553	A	0.99327	Yeah.
3741982	3766044	554	D	1	I wanted to mention that in relation to the ongoing curves on the physics and information processing that Chris Fields is hosting is one construct that Chris Fields is using in his papers with Michael and Paul is the notion of topological quantum neural networks and topological quantum field theories.
3766172	3777028	555	D	0.99504	So it might be that those are the information processing in this kind of topological maps as well that you've mentioned.
3777114	3794532	556	D	0.91574	Daniel, the grounding for that or how Michael Levin is talking about how bioelectricity is a glue for the various subsystems in the brain.
3794676	3799080	557	D	0.93	Or I've seen some recent paper that was pretty late.
3802160	3815916	558	D	0.99	I found out recently, which I'm pretty surprised at just recently, that there is a whole field of people that are really trying to apply quantum field theory on the brain.
3815948	3819280	559	D	1	And there was one paper on memory formation.
3819440	3828064	560	D	0.99779	So how you, Chris, talked about memory in terms of the electromagnetic field that might be also great, like pointer.
3828192	3836090	561	D	0.99453	So I'm just putting out different people and papers that I think might be interconnectable with this work.
3837020	3837770	562	A	0.99418	Yeah.
3838140	3853064	563	B	1	One interesting thing, and you reflected it in your literature review is when people think about quantum and cognitive systems, the ORC, or and other frameworks often are considering quantum as being electronic scale.
3853192	3865024	564	B	1	And therefore a quantum theory of cognition or consciousness would entail some kind of relationship between the way that electrons and photons behave and then some difference that makes a difference at the biological level.
3865222	3881380	565	B	0.94	And in a way, what we've been exploring with Chris Fields and others is like a bypass where it's like, no, the quantum formalism, quantum topology, quantum information simply and plainly describes cognitive processes where order matters.
3881460	3901400	566	B	1	Now, there may or may not be effects associated with differences that make a difference at the electronic scale, but we don't need that in order to use superposition and all of these different effects that empirically are the case in cognitive systems.
3901480	3903896	567	B	0.99994	We're not waiting for some new mechanistic insight.
3903928	3905616	568	B	0.93848	It'd be cool to find out.
3905798	3913676	569	B	0.99994	But what you've presented is not waiting for a different kind of thing to exist.
3913868	3929270	570	B	0.99994	So I'm curious, what experiments or what are the unique experiments that you feel like would give a resounding feeling on what you're talking about?
3930040	3932484	571	A	0.70654	Yeah, happy to take it on.
3932522	3941416	572	A	0.95838	So one kind of, like, very awesome research lead, and then I'll explain what a research paradigm will look like.
3941438	3946264	573	A	0.99854	But essentially, first of all, a very powerful lead is meditative cessations.
3946392	3961476	574	A	0.98338	So one of the most insane chapters in mastering the core teachings of the Buddha by Daniel Ingram is the one called The Three Doors, where he describes the phenomenology of experiencing a peak meditation state that's called a cessation.
3961528	3968732	575	A	0.99999	Where you blink out of reality for a second or well, for a subsecond moment, but you just blink out fully and then you get reconstituted.
3968796	3973270	576	A	1	And when you get reconstituted, it tends to be a very blissful, very rejuvenating type experience.
3973640	3979300	577	A	0.9151	But the thing he highlights in that article is what it feels like to be really close to a cessation.
3979640	3983224	578	A	1	And it actually depends on what type of cessation it is.
3983262	3986024	579	A	0.85843	There's roughly, like, three ways in which it can happen.
3986062	4001448	580	A	0.99861	But the mind blowing thing about that essay, that chapter is he essentially describes different topologies of attention and awareness that may arise where in these moments, close to a cessation, he says, well, in one of those you become kind of a taurus.
4001544	4008184	581	A	0.95	And the taurus flips the inside and an outside and it twists around and then it cancels out and compresses and then you vanish.
4008312	4018260	582	A	1	And then there's like, another variety where you become a cone, and then all of your attention gets concentrated in the point of the coin of the cone, and then that twists around and then vanishes.
4018680	4028448	583	A	0.93091	So there's like this reliable, very exotic kind of like topological transformations that can happen to your attention and awareness.
4028624	4041304	584	A	1	And our guess would be that, well, a cessation, an actual kind of full vanishing, might be related to the topological pocket that your brain is generating, essentially opening up.
4041422	4050424	585	A	0.99999	So that in some maybe nontrivial way, the actual boundary between inside and outside gets dissolved for a fraction of a second, then it gets reconstituted.
4050552	4060204	586	A	0.9949	But something really special happens in that moment that allows for deep insight or something along the lines or relieving a lot of internal stress, maybe like a coronal mass ejection.
4060252	4064370	587	A	0.99972	There might be something going on at the topological level.
4065540	4090500	588	A	1	Now, in terms of kind of like, further, more sophisticated research paradigms, the thing that we're looking into, there's a lot more to be unpacked and developed here, but is what kind of electromagnetic resonant modes that can supervene on particular graphs, whether we're talking about the Connectum or whether we're talking about the geometric eigen modes.
4090580	4097548	589	A	1	More recent work where you model the entire cortex as a geometric surface, and then you apply neural field theory to that.
4097634	4101084	590	A	0.94194	Well, all of that works so far.
4101122	4107248	591	A	0.98103	Essentially, what it focuses on is oscillations in the electric field without modeling the magnetic field.
4107334	4121952	592	A	0.99869	So I would suspect that many of the Connectum harmonics or geometric eigen modes may be physically unrealizable simply because the magnetic field lines may collide with each other.
4122006	4124212	593	A	0.99953	So some of those may not be possible.
4124346	4153544	594	A	0.99998	But one of the crazy, fascinating, unusual predictions that may come out of our whole paradigm is that once we have a really good mapping of what resonant modes arise in the brain on different states of consciousness, we would predict that a when you're fully awake, normally conscious, there will be a very central, big topological loop inside you that whenever you're, let's say, in deep sleep, you might see a kind of mind dust.
4153592	4156420	595	A	0.99999	You might see lots of tiny little pockets.
4156520	4164160	596	A	1	And maybe when you're in an ecstatic experience, like deep meditation, it may do something else.
4164230	4169824	597	A	0.63273	Like the particular resonant modes there may create open field lines that don't form a loop.
4169872	4177380	598	A	0.98975	So that is like the sort of crazy, very novel type of prediction, or at least research paradigm that this enables.
4179480	4180324	599	B	0.89829	That's really cool.
4180362	4181850	600	B	0.99831	Chris, anything out of that?
4183180	4189210	601	C	0.96071	Yeah, just to draw the link between the fourth bullet here and what Andres is setting out.
4189980	4195628	602	C	0.97	I don't think any of this is there are some toy bits of modeling you could do that could increase confidence one way or another.
4195714	4206252	603	C	0.7607	But in terms of an actual experimental prediction, you would need to combine this with some theory of which bits of the brain are doing this.
4206386	4214588	604	C	0.99	So if Ward and Guevara are right that it's the thalamus that's doing this stuff, we would expect to see around the thalmus a closed pocket.
4214684	4215920	605	C	0.99	And it should be possible.
4216070	4219340	606	C	1	In principle, this is probably billions of pounds worth of effort.
4219420	4225764	607	C	0.99824	But to model the thalamus and the surrounding bits enough, and you can find out if there would actually be a closed pocket, if there would be one.
4225802	4227764	608	C	1	In theory, you can see roughly where it would be.
4227882	4240440	609	C	0.85165	Obviously, it moves around a bit, but it's normally around here you then should be able to I don't know if ethical consent is even possible for something like this, but disrupt that with a very, very targeted external Em source.
4240860	4245320	610	C	0.9988	Think transcranial stimulation, but just laser precise.
4245900	4257772	611	C	0.99985	If we've now broken the bid around the thalamus but left everything else more or less untouched, we predict if warding of our plus us is correct, we predict that your first personal awareness would blink out.
4257826	4260840	612	C	0.99994	Like deep sleep, like anesthesia like a meditative cessation.
4261000	4267788	613	C	0.81523	If we're wrong, or the combination of us is wrong, then you will still be conscious, but you might just experience something really bloody weird.
4267884	4278740	614	C	0.99997	But your contents have changed, not the actual container of consciousness hasn't blinked in and out, and then you could apply that to other bits of the brain wherever you think there's.
4279080	4287256	615	C	0.99159	Our other prediction is that it must be enclosing the immediate memory model, but we're unsure exactly where that is as well.
4287358	4289770	616	C	0.99535	That is also an outstanding research question.
4291500	4297256	617	C	0.79	It feels like doable in our lifetimes, I think, but none of this is give us ten grand and we'll do it this summer.
4297288	4298590	618	C	0.97074	None of it is that easy.
4300640	4302444	619	B	0.99997	Yeah, very interesting.
4302562	4320604	620	B	1	And Neuroimaging already utilizes electromagnetic measurements and there are things that currently are described within a biomolecular paradigm, like, for example, changes in effective connectivity between different regions of the brain.
4320732	4325424	621	B	0.99992	Well, there's already a tract, let's just say, between certain brain regions.
4325552	4339092	622	B	1	And so maybe if the action potentials traveling down that 100 lane highway are aligned, then it's going to be like this rippling em continuity.
4339236	4347240	623	B	0.50631	Whereas if they were totally disarrayed along that track, then you wouldn't have those two regions contained.
4347320	4366400	624	B	0.99999	But it'd be like kind of like two regions, like blowing smoke rings at each other if they had enough synchrony to push through the trouble and the friction such that there was a pocket that was able to you squirt hot water into a cold pool.
4367220	4373856	625	B	0.99993	There's ways to angle it and do it in all of the combinations of viscosity that it just diffuses instantly.
4374048	4385000	626	B	0.95826	There's also ways where there would be a high temperature toroidal form that could pass through a colder media because it maintains a topological boundary.
4385660	4398700	627	B	0.92	A lot of these things are again described anatomically or molecularly or electronically, but the duality between electronics and magnetism is not contentious.
4399760	4423460	628	B	0.99994	So there may be a lot of phenomena that could be revisited, and I don't know whether that would provide indirect evidence with what we already know or suggest new plausible experiments, but it's an approach.
4427120	4427532	629	A	0.99889	Yeah.
4427586	4428204	630	C	1	Welcome it.
4428242	4432312	631	C	1	And thanks, Bernie as well for the pointers towards, like, Chris Fields and Michael Levin.
4432376	4441424	632	C	0.99	I may come back to you for the QFT on memory formation in case I've spotted some stuff on that, but I'm not sure I've spotted the one it sounded like you were referring to.
4441462	4445508	633	C	0.93952	So yeah, it's an exciting sort of research.
4445674	4446340	634	A	0.99988	Yeah.
4446490	4453012	635	B	1	One last connection there with active inference is you have the electronic and the magnetic fields influencing each other.
4453066	4461770	636	B	0.99961	That's the basis of what philosophers might consider in terms of this epipenomenalism or not question.
4462300	4470120	637	B	1	And if we had an active inference situation of two songbirds, the active states of one become the sensory of the other.
4470270	4482796	638	B	0.99632	So if they were just passing messages every single time step to each other, then they would both be engaged in their own blanketed perception on the inbound and action selection on the outbound.
4482988	4492416	639	B	1	And so they could basically be in this continual oscillatory relationship with causal efficacy both ways.
4492598	4496708	640	B	0.99951	Again, or you could design a situation where the causal efficacy only flowed one way.
4496874	4515716	641	B	0.99993	But the point is, this is a topological approach that lets us explore that in a way that isn't only appealing to molecular or material phenomena and then leaving the whole question, which is the whole question of the informational.
4515828	4517796	642	B	0.65	And the closure and the binding.
4517908	4522140	643	B	0.99805	Leaving all those to be resolved by slicing and dicing with a scalpel.
4522880	4527870	644	B	0.99993	Which is not even a viable option as far as we already understand.
4530560	4543040	645	B	0.63047	Bernie and then the authors, what are your closing thoughts or how would you suggest that people get in the game or what should they do with their own topologies?
4547810	4552990	646	D	0.99984	Maybe I could note that Andres could expand on, if he wants to know.
4553140	4556030	647	D	0.1511	Synthetic valence and neuroanalink.
4561130	4582446	648	A	0.99986	Well, yeah, STB introduced by Mike in 2015 on Principalia about the correspondence respondents between imagery of an object for many years now.
4582548	4586426	649	A	0.99999	You can see a 2020 presentation about it and there's many more content about it.
4586468	4603014	650	A	0.4341	But the main idea, the way it would actually work out here is the regions of the topologically closed field that behave like a smooth field may potentially correspond to a very blissful experience.
4603132	4613082	651	A	0.99583	So I'm very optimistic of the potential of okay, like something like a peak blissful experience, peak five meodmt experience or something like that.
4613216	4621978	652	A	1	It would probably, I suspect, have like a very internally simplified topology where the geometry is as smooth as possible.
4622064	4627630	653	A	0.99994	So that's kind of like an interesting prediction or angle on all of this, I think.
4627700	4627934	654	A	0.9181	Yeah.
4627972	4642162	655	A	0.99999	Maybe to wrap up, I would say that we would enormously welcome anybody who is technically savvy for doing interesting simulations of the electromagnetic field.
4642216	4666042	656	A	0.98	I mean, we're doing ourselves some really interesting experiments and in combination with classical neural networks, but anybody's kind of like the intersection between machine learning electromagnetic fields and simulations and statistics, machine learning essentially that kind of intersection is something that could really potentially accelerate these research.
4666176	4677322	657	A	0.99987	If you had the technical competency to sort of work on the analysis I was describing of finding the electromagnetic resonant modes of a graph and then analyzing its topology, we would love to collaborate.
4677386	4682640	658	A	0.97813	That's like the sort of content we dream of producing in the next year or two.
4683410	4683934	659	A	0.99991	Thank you.
4683972	4684846	660	A	1	And thank you for having us.
4684868	4687380	661	A	0.99949	It's been really, really appreciate it.
4687830	4688802	662	B	0.79	I appreciate that.
4688856	4689570	663	B	0.99323	Chris.
4691990	4693682	664	C	0.99976	Nothing substantial to add.
4693816	4694562	665	C	0.99962	Just my thanks.
4694616	4701246	666	C	0.99983	As you know, I've scribbled down some thoughts about the Markov blankets and about some of those different research areas.
4701278	4704114	667	C	0.99972	As you know, we're getting stuff from this as.
4704312	4704830	668	C	0.82249	Yeah.
4704920	4712134	669	C	0.52	And hopefully this helps reach a few new people who might come up with either a brilliant idea why something we've missed, and this just can't work.
4712172	4714170	670	C	0.989	For some reason, we want to hear that as well.
4714320	4720170	671	C	0.93764	But even more constructively ways that this could be tested or built out more gradually modeled.
4721390	4721802	672	A	0.54046	Yeah.
4721856	4723050	673	C	0.99996	Thank you for having us.
4723200	4723610	674	A	0.99999	Cool.
4723680	4731594	675	B	0.91	New ways of thinking within even one topological frame enables new action selection in the area.
4731712	4733526	676	B	0.98	And the era of video chatting.
4733558	4741540	677	B	0.988	We've made new topological relationships, new connectivities that then disperse yet again.
4742150	4745410	678	B	1	And so it continues.
4747110	4748420	679	B	0.99994	Thank you all, though.
4749190	4750178	680	A	0.99951	Thank you so much.
4750264	4750914	681	B	0.97132	Till next time.
4750952	4751710	682	D	0.82104	Very lovely.
4751790	4752194	683	D	0.99982	Thank you.
4752232	4752850	684	D	0.99983	Amazing stuff.
4752920	4753394	685	B	0.99974	See ya.
4753432	4753630	686	A	0.94352	Bye.
