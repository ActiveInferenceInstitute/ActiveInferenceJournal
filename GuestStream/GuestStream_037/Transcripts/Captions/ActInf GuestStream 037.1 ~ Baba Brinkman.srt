1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,854
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:12,330
It's February 28, 2023.

3
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:16,704
It's ActInf lab GuestStream number 37.1.

4
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:18,934
And we're here with Baba Brinkman.

5
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:22,316
This should be a great discussion and

6
00:00:22,316 --> 00:00:22,316
emergence.

7
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:24,577
Baba, thank you so much for joining.

8
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:27,833
Let's just jump right into it.

9
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:29,089
What brings you to this day?

10
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:31,260
How and who are you?

11
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:36,765
Baba: Thanks, Daniel, so much for having

12
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:36,765
me here.

13
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:46,766
It's a real honor to join you and to dip

14
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:46,766
into this community, which I've been

15
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:46,766
aware of for a while, and like to try to

16
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:46,766
follow the work as much as I can.

17
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:48,929
But I'm not a scientist myself.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,050
I'm a rapper.

19
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:55,596
I have been exploring academic topics in

20
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:55,596
hip hop for quite a while.

21
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:58,932
I did my master's thesis on Chaucer's

22
00:00:58,932 --> 00:00:58,932
Canterbury tales.

23
00:00:55,602 --> 00:01:04,903
I was a Renaissance and medieval scholar

24
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:04,903
and I rewrote the Canterbury Tales into

25
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:04,903
rap.

26
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:10,564
And I used to tour around the UK rapping

27
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:10,564
my Wife of Bath's Tale and Miller's Tale

28
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:10,564
renditions, which was a lot of fun.

29
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:28,318
And then at one point, it was around 2007

30
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:28,318
or 2008, an evolutionary biologist, a

31
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:28,318
geneticist, saw my Canterbury Tales show,

32
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:28,318
and he reached out to me and said, I love

33
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:28,318
what you're doing for medieval

34
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:28,318
literature, popularizing it with rap, but

35
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:28,318
there's other topics that need rap

36
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:28,318
popularization.

37
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:33,876
I think his exact words were, would you

38
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:33,876
be willing to do for Darwin what you did

39
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:33,876
for Chaucer?

40
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:38,370
And this was in the run up to the Darwin

41
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,370
bicentennial in 2009.

42
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:46,009
It was the 200th anniversary of the birth

43
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:46,009
of Charles Darwin, also the 150th

44
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:46,009
anniversary of the publication of The

45
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:46,009
Origin of Species.

46
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:50,059
I was, of course, a big fan of Darwin and

47
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:50,059
of evolutionary theory, but not very

48
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:50,059
expert.

49
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:55,106
So I said to this scientist, yes, I'll

50
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:55,106
write some raps about evolution, but I

51
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:55,106
could use some guidance.

52
00:01:51,059 --> 00:02:02,114
He sent me a whole bunch of suggested

53
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:02,114
reading sources, books, peer reviewed

54
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:02,114
papers, everything.

55
00:01:55,107 --> 00:02:10,193
So I took a sort of six month deep dive

56
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:10,193
on the state of evolutionary theory,

57
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:10,193
absorbed a whole bunch of books, and

58
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:10,193
wrote these rhymes.

59
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:22,315
But his criteria was, your performances

60
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:22,315
will be at academic seminars with experts

61
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:22,315
in Darwinian evolution across all kinds

62
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:22,315
of social domains and psychology and

63
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:22,315
everything.

64
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:34,433
So you need to make sure you represent

65
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:34,433
the theory accurately, which means you

66
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:34,433
have to run your lyrics by me so I can

67
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:34,433
check them for scientific veracity, which

68
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:34,433
I thought was a fair criteria for that

69
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:34,433
kind of context.

70
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:35,443
So I sent him my lyrics.

71
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:38,476
He gave me some revision suggestions.

72
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:50,589
And then when I was set to perform the

73
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:50,589
premiere of my Darwin show on Darwin Day,

74
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:50,589
February 12, 2009, the scientist, his

75
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:50,589
name is Mark Palin.

76
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:51,604
He was a bacterial geneticist.

77
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,642
He had this great intro, typical British

78
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:55,642
tongue in cheek style.

79
00:02:51,605 --> 00:03:01,641
He was like, I have fact checked the

80
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:01,641
lyrics, and you're about to witness the

81
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:01,641
first rap show in history

82
00:02:55,643 --> 00:03:03,661
that's peer reviewed.

83
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:04,678
I was like, Peer reviewed rap?

84
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:06,691
That's a great idea.

85
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:08,715
Totally marks coinage.

86
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:15,786
But then right away, the wheels started

87
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:15,786
spinning like what other topics could you

88
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:15,786
apply the peer reviewed rap lens to?

89
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:18,812
So I did my Evolution rap show for

90
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:18,812
several years.

91
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:19,828
It was called the Rap Guide to

92
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:19,828
Evolution.

93
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:32,956
It played off Broadway, won an award at

94
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:32,956
the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and then

95
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:32,956
other scientists started tugging me on

96
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:32,956
the sleeve like, oh, the Darwin wraps are

97
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:32,956
cool, but could you do wilderness

98
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:32,956
conservation and threatened species

99
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:32,956
ecology?

100
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:34,970
Could you do climate change?

101
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:36,991
Could you do neuroscience?

102
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:39,023
And various great collaborations came

103
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:39,023
from that.

104
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:43,062
So we now have a whole series of rap

105
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:43,062
albums, rap guides to various topics.

106
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:51,143
And my encounter with the active

107
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:51,143
inference community and research base was

108
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:51,143
when I was working on one called The Rap

109
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:51,143
Guide to Consciousness.

110
00:03:43,063 --> 00:04:02,190
And Professor Anil Seth is one of the, I

111
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,190
think, main proponents and contributors

112
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,190
to the Bayesian brain active inference

113
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,190
research paradigm today.

114
00:03:51,144 --> 00:04:05,227
And he was one of the main science

115
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:05,227
advisors on the project.

116
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:08,255
So he was giving me Bayesian stuff to

117
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:08,255
read,

118
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:10,270
including Andy Clark's

119
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:11,280
What's Next?

120
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:24,416
Highly technical review of all the

121
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:24,416
literature which I slogged my way through

122
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:24,416
as a nonexpert and ended up working

123
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:24,416
Bayesian ideas quite in a detailed way

124
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:24,416
into the Rap Guide to Consciousness

125
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:24,416
show.

126
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:35,521
And what really resonated for me,

127
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:35,521
honestly, I had never really paid

128
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:35,521
attention to Bayes’ Theorem or Bayesian

129
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:35,521
reasoning at all, but it took me a while

130
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:35,521
to get my head around it.

131
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:40,575
But then I was like, okay, this is

132
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:40,575
actually just a great paraphrase of the

133
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:40,575
scientific method.

134
00:04:35,521 --> 00:05:01,721
And I was already a massive proponent of

135
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,721
the scientific method, and I was geeking

136
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,721
out on the degree to which the brain may

137
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,721
be a Bayesian engine at the microscopic

138
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,721
level, producing a rational inquiry

139
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,721
process that replicates the exact same

140
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,721
Bayesian algorithm at the level of

141
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:01,721
interactions with society.

142
00:04:40,575 --> 00:05:05,764
So I did one song in the show called Good

143
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:05,764
Bayesian:

144
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:05,764
Baba rapping: “Let me show

145
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:09,809
you how to be a good Bayesian and change

146
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:09,809
your predictions after taking

147
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:09,809
information.

148
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:15,867
And if you're thinking I’ll be less than

149
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:15,867
amazing, let's adjust those

150
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:15,867
expectations!”

151
00:05:10,813 --> 00:05:40,119
Baba: And I was right away thinking

152
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
about, like, how is a rap performance

153
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
itself an instantiation of a Bayesian

154
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
algorithm with the audience's

155
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
expectations being revised in real time

156
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
based on the rapper's performance and the

157
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
rappers expectations when creating the

158
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
script of the performance about what

159
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
reaction they'll get from the audience,

160
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
which is a prior belief about the

161
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,119
effectiveness of the performance.

162
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:43,147
But when it's only a script, you don't

163
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:43,147
actually know what's going to work.

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:49,203
And then you do the performance, you see

165
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:49,203
what gets the reaction, you revise your

166
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:49,203
priors and you also revise your script.

167
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:53,242
And that was a concept that I had already

168
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:53,242
been rapping about in my Evolution show.

169
00:05:49,203 --> 00:06:01,265
I have a show whole song, and that called

170
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:01,265
performance feedback revision, which

171
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:01,265
instantiates the kind of evolutionary

172
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:01,265
natural selection algorithm.

173
00:05:53,243 --> 00:06:16,412
But at the level of creative writing and

174
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:16,412
performance, you write the script, you do

175
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:16,412
the show, you see how people react, you

176
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:16,412
go back, change the script and that's

177
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:16,412
kind of like the genome being revised

178
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:16,412
under phenotypic variants and how they

179
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:16,412
end up surviving or not surviving,

180
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:16,412
reproducing and not reproducing.

181
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:28,539
I just started out wrapping and trying to

182
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:28,539
master the craft and each scientific

183
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:28,539
topic I get into I start going, oh, this

184
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:28,539
actually helps me understand what's going

185
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:28,539
on in rap much better.

186
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:35,607
And especially, actually one of the

187
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:35,607
examples I play with in the show, which

188
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:35,607
is a lot of fun, is like call and

189
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:35,607
response expectations of the audience.

190
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:48,734
Like a perfect kind of demonstration of a

191
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:48,734
Bayesian moment when you go double take,

192
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:48,734
look twice, calculate the odds, roll the

193
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:48,734
and when I do that the whole crowd would

194
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:48,734
be like dice.

195
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:56,812
But the expectation of what the rhyme

196
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:56,812
couplet is going to be is a game rappers

197
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:56,812
play all the time, like finish the bar,

198
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:56,812
right?

199
00:06:48,736 --> 00:07:05,845
And that is entirely around a setup of an

200
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:05,845
expectation and the fulfillment of it,

201
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:05,845
but then sometimes you can play with it

202
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:05,845
and be like yo perceptual basics.

203
00:06:56,813 --> 00:07:06,856
Baba rapping: As morpheus.

204
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:12,911
Baba: We live in the and I usually get

205
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:12,911
the crowd being like, matrix back at me,

206
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:12,911
but then other times I'd make it more

207
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:12,911
difficult.

208
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:16,957
Like, yo, perceptual basics, lady bugs

209
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:16,957
like to eat.

210
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:19,989
And then maybe one person out of 100

211
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:19,989
would be like, Aphids.

212
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:29,080
And I'd be like, yeah, that was a person

213
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,080
that had the correct scientific Bayesian

214
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,080
priors to conclude my matrix basics

215
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,080
aphids rhyme pattern.

216
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:30,095
But usually only a few get it.

217
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:33,123
And then everyone else is like, there's

218
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:33,123
the nerd over there or whatever.

219
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:45,242
So it's become like actually informed my

220
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:45,242
creative process in terms of how I try to

221
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:45,242
set up and violate expectations in real

222
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:45,242
time psychologically with an audience

223
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:45,242
when I'm performing.

224
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:56,353
And I will be honest that my close

225
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:56,353
reading of the research was several years

226
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:56,353
ago at this point the Rap Guide to

227
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:56,353
Consciousness came out in 2017.

228
00:07:45,246 --> 00:08:15,480
18 I was performing it off Broadway, 19 I

229
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,480
was touring it around theaters in the UK

230
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,480
and still performing it off Broadway and

231
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,480
then 20, of course, all performances

232
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,480
ceased altogether and I had to think

233
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,480
about what rappers do in pandemics when

234
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,480
they can't get on stages and see crowds.

235
00:07:56,357 --> 00:08:22,553
So yeah, we can talk during this

236
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:22,553
interview about my new project, which is

237
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:22,553
a custom wrap agency.

238
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:23,568
You can see me wrapping it right here.

239
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:33,661
Event wrap, which could be fun to talk

240
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:33,661
about in terms of the event inference,

241
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:33,661
elements of active inference and Bayesian

242
00:08:33,661 --> 00:08:33,661
analysis.

243
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:49,824
Could be, I think, some of the aspects of

244
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:49,824
what attract me to events, what attracted

245
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:49,824
me to events during the Pandemics, and

246
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:49,824
still does, as a sort of catalyst for

247
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:49,824
good art and for rap, might have to do

248
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:49,824
with active inference, expectations and

249
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:49,824
experiences.

250
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:52,852
But I don't know this literature very

251
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:52,852
closely at this point.

252
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:55,886
So yeah, that basically brings us up to

253
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:55,886
the present.

254
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:57,902
Hopefully that was a good summary.

255
00:08:55,887 --> 00:09:10,976
Daniel: Amazing, just great to connect

256
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:10,976
and to be able to share this moment with

257
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:10,976
someone who's seen it from all sides in

258
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:10,976
front of the stage, on stage, behind

259
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:10,976
stage, inside the mind.

260
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:12,994
Real, recognize, real.

261
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:14,015
So there's a lot out there.

262
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:16,037
And just like as if we were.

263
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:19,069
Baba: Talking about a paper, real,

264
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:19,069
recognize, real.

265
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:20,079
Namaste.

266
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:27,147
Daniel: If we were talking about a paper,

267
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:27,147
we would read between the lines and

268
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:27,147
reference out.

269
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:38,252
And similarly, there's so much that can

270
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:38,252
be referenced out and people can listen

271
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:38,252
to the original creations and see what

272
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:38,252
that primary text looks like.

273
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:48,356
And the fact that it's an orally

274
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:48,356
performed text for much of human

275
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:48,356
development in history was are real.

276
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:57,440
So whether something is written is

277
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,440
increasingly fluid these days with speech

278
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,440
to text and text to speech.

279
00:09:49,360 --> 00:10:00,411
So there's going to be so many great

280
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:00,411
avenues.

281
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,434
Let's just start with event based

282
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:02,434
cognitivist.

283
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:06,477
So what is an event from the cognitive

284
00:10:06,477 --> 00:10:06,477
perspective?

285
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:13,549
Baba: I was trying to find that

286
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:13,549
definition with Google about 20 minutes

287
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:13,549
ago, so I didn't sound like an idiot in

288
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:13,549
this podcast.

289
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:22,635
So I think it's a perceptual construct,

290
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:22,635
right?

291
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:33,739
It is the perception of an entity that

292
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:33,739
there is some kind of instantiation of

293
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:33,739
action that is circumscribed in time,

294
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:33,739
that has a beginning and an end.

295
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:50,917
And if it's not perceived as having a

296
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:50,917
beginning and an end by some cognitive

297
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:50,917
entity, historically organisms, but in

298
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:50,917
the future also probably AIS, then it's

299
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:50,917
not treated as an event, which means an

300
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:50,917
event could be a thousand years or 5

301
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:50,917
seconds or whatever.

302
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:59,008
It's actually interesting how the kind of

303
00:10:59,008 --> 00:10:59,008
the scientific definition of it in active

304
00:10:59,008 --> 00:10:59,008
inference research really is like a

305
00:10:59,008 --> 00:10:59,008
narrative definition in a way, right?

306
00:10:51,923 --> 00:11:01,963
It's a story.

307
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:06,017
Something you can tell a story about,

308
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:06,017
something you can construct a story

309
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:06,017
around is an event.

310
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:09,044
Is that pretty close to how scientists

311
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:09,044
think about it?

312
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:12,076
Daniel: Yeah, I mean, already so much

313
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:12,076
there.

314
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:13,085
You're right.

315
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:25,203
It does not have to be tied to a given

316
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:25,203
amount of clock time, which we might call

317
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:25,203
chronology harkening back to chronos,

318
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:25,203
that sort of decimal point time.

319
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:36,312
But action takes place in the

320
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:36,312
understanding of the actor or the

321
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:36,312
observer in this timescale of action or

322
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:36,312
kairos.

323
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:48,431
And that timescale of action may be

324
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:48,431
narrative, and that is what you invoke

325
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:48,431
with the beginning, middle and end,

326
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:48,431
rising and falling cultural patterns.

327
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:51,467
That's not necessarily happening on the

328
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:51,467
clock.

329
00:11:48,432 --> 00:12:13,623
Just because you can run a stopwatch

330
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:13,623
while somebody's reciting Canterbury

331
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:13,623
Tales doesn't mean that it'd be twice as

332
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:13,623
exciting if they spoke twice as fast, or

333
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:13,623
that you could map in some linear way

334
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:13,623
what was happening on the watch face to

335
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:13,623
what's happening in the mind of audience

336
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:13,623
who have different familiarity with the

337
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:13,623
material.

338
00:11:51,468 --> 00:12:16,657
Baba: Or a historical study context as

339
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:16,657
well.

340
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:23,726
It just made me think of like, if I do a

341
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:23,726
ten minute long wrap of The Wife of

342
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:23,726
Bath's Tale, then that's an event.

343
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:25,744
I performed the Wife of Bath’s Tale.

344
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:27,760
There was an audience that witnessed it.

345
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,778
You could circumscribe it that way.

346
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,836
But you could do a scientific study on

347
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:34,836
what occurred during that event.

348
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:35,840
Right?

349
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:45,947
But you could also choose to study the

350
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:45,947
event of humanity's retelling of the

351
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:45,947
story of the Wife of Bath's Tale, which

352
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:45,947
is a story that takes place in King

353
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:45,947
Arthur's Court.

354
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:54,037
So now we know where the mythology has to

355
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:54,037
have started, which is around, you know

356
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:54,037
(forgive me, Medievalists!), but let's

357
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:54,037
say like four or 500 AD.

358
00:12:45,948 --> 00:13:05,088
And then whenever the historical King

359
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:05,088
Arthur's court existed, and then there

360
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:05,088
was an oral mythology that adhered to

361
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:05,088
that over the course of a period of time

362
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:05,088
as people told folk tales about it.

363
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:15,186
And then in the year 1400, Geoffrey

364
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:15,186
Chaucer (well, I think he perished in

365
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:15,186
1400, so he was born in the 1330s)…

366
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:21,244
But he writes the Wife of Bath’s Tale at

367
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:21,244
some point as a written representation of

368
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:21,244
the oral narrative.

369
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:29,324
And then that vellum manuscript is passed

370
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:29,324
down into college reading lists and I

371
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:29,324
read it in 1998 and write a Rap version

372
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:29,324
of it.

373
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:45,481
So any study of humanity's engagement

374
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:45,481
with the story of the Wife of Bath Tail

375
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:45,481
has to really start in the year 400 and

376
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:45,481
end the last time I wrapped my Rap

377
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:45,481
version of the Wife of Bathtail at the

378
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:45,481
Edinburgh Fringe Festival, which was a

379
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:45,481
couple of years ago.

380
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:52,553
And no event that accounts for the

381
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:52,553
phenomenon of the telling of that story

382
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:52,553
can leave any of those instantiations

383
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:52,553
out.

384
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:53,560
Right.

385
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:54,570
Daniel: Awesome.

386
00:13:53,564 --> 00:14:04,612
It's like the earlier events are our

387
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:04,612
prior or our generative process, which is

388
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:04,612
our niche, that events happen in our

389
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:04,612
generative model.

390
00:13:54,571 --> 00:14:07,648
Our cognitive model exists within the

391
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:07,648
niche, the generative process.

392
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:12,695
And those prior events quite literally

393
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:12,695
are our priors.

394
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:18,751
And there's no last chapter because the

395
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:18,751
observations keep rolling in.

396
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:38,959
And whether the observation is exactly as

397
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:38,959
expected, whether that performance of

398
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:38,959
that symphony is exactly as expected,

399
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:38,959
whether that performance of the hamburger

400
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:38,959
or of the portrait, even if it's exactly

401
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:38,959
as expected, it still is a new

402
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:38,959
observation.

403
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:43,000
And then what is as expected?

404
00:14:39,963 --> 00:15:04,150
Well, that's in the encultured cognitive

405
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,150
mind, and that is this sometimes implicit

406
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,150
reference point that novelty is

407
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,150
contrasted against, like, well, I knew I

408
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,150
was going to get a Rap summary, but I

409
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,150
didn't know it'd be that funny, or I

410
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,150
didn't know I was going to get a Rap

411
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,150
summary.

412
00:14:43,001 --> 00:15:08,193
These are like different levels and types

413
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:08,193
of novelty about the story of a moment.

414
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:23,345
Baba: Or look at how he changed the story

415
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:23,345
from the archival version because there's

416
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:23,345
definitely a completely different

417
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:23,345
experience of people that are intimately

418
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:23,345
familiar with Chaucer's version and ones

419
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:23,345
who are hearing the story for the first

420
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:23,345
time and encountering each of the

421
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:23,345
characters.

422
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:31,419
This is the kind of expectation of how

423
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:31,419
accurately will the story be recounted in

424
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:31,419
this new version.

425
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:34,454
Also, let me just expand on something

426
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:34,454
that you said.

427
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:39,502
You said there's no last prior because

428
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:39,502
there's constant reinstantiations and

429
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:39,502
updating.

430
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:39,504
Right.

431
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:45,566
But there is a last plot prior from the

432
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:45,566
perspective of a temporary analysis of an

433
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:45,566
event.

434
00:15:39,505 --> 00:16:01,666
You can set a sort of artificial

435
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:01,666
beginning and end for the purpose of

436
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:01,666
doing an analysis, and that's, I guess,

437
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:01,666
where you're able to apply mathematics to

438
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:01,666
it, but you always have to keep in mind

439
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:01,666
that it's a chosen beginning and endpoint

440
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:01,666
within a larger unfolding.

441
00:15:46,575 --> 00:16:02,675
Daniel: Yeah.

442
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:19,842
And that's very resonance with my

443
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:19,842
experience as a researcher, which is

444
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:19,842
like, there is a final data point in any

445
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:19,842
time series at some point, the fMRI

446
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:19,842
machine or the ant foraging watching

447
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:19,842
machine, you just turn it off for the

448
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:19,842
day.

449
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:23,889
So there is empirically something that's

450
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:23,889
very addressable.

451
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:34,989
But in the general case, it's not the

452
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:34,989
case that a time series algorithm says

453
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:34,989
what the last observation is.

454
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:53,187
And we might even say that that's a

455
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:53,187
deflationary perspective on history,

456
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:53,187
because rather than debating whether

457
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:53,187
somebody has released the definitive

458
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:53,187
American novel or the last word on this

459
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:53,187
symphony, it's like, well, the last note

460
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:53,187
of their symphony was non

461
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:53,187
controversially, the last note of their

462
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:53,187
symphony.

463
00:16:34,991 --> 00:17:06,257
But the question about the discourse and

464
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:06,257
the community, of course, there's no last

465
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:06,257
word in this open ended space, and art is

466
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:06,257
always like surfing on that open space.

467
00:16:53,189 --> 00:17:22,410
Baba: One of the things I remember from

468
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,410
my comparative literature courses is this

469
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,410
idea of the anxiety of influence and how

470
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,410
poets have their I think it's maybe

471
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,410
Harold Bloom that wrote that, but poets

472
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,410
have a sense of needing to create

473
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,410
something new.

474
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:24,430
I think this general applies to art.

475
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,441
All artists, right?

476
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:26,455
Theater rappers.

477
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:30,490
This is like imagination conjures.

478
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:35,544
But of course, great art is produced on

479
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:35,544
the shoulders of a lot of influence in

480
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:35,544
the past.

481
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:46,657
And one of the measures in an English

482
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:46,657
literature course of whether a poem rises

483
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:46,657
to the level of worthiness to be studied

484
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:46,657
at university is the degree of impact it

485
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:46,657
had afterwards.

486
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:50,698
And that can sometimes be measured by how

487
00:17:50,698 --> 00:17:50,698
many imitators it generated.

488
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:58,769
So one thing I always find fascinating is

489
00:17:58,769 --> 00:17:58,769
you read 14th century literature and

490
00:17:58,769 --> 00:17:58,769
Chaucer stands out as the main poet,

491
00:17:58,769 --> 00:17:58,769
right?

492
00:17:51,699 --> 00:18:04,779
You barely read any 15th century

493
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:04,779
literature in an English lit course, or

494
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:04,779
at least when I was in school in the 90s,

495
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:04,779
that was the case.

496
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:06,792
I've just gone all blurry heaven.

497
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:09,820
I want to see what's going on with my

498
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:09,820
camera here.

499
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:10,834
There we go.

500
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:11,844
Refocused.

501
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:14,869
The camera has its own priors.

502
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:26,992
So Chaucer shut down English literature

503
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:26,992
for, like, 100 years, and when I was in

504
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:26,992
an English survey course, I'm like, Why

505
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:26,992
do we read Chaucer in the 14th century?

506
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:28,001
And the next poet we read is the 16th

507
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:28,001
century.

508
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:30,003
What happened to the 15th century?

509
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:47,020
And my professors were like, well, every

510
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
poet that wrote poetry in the 15th

511
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
century was seen as so much of a Chaucer

512
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
knockoff and derivative because his style

513
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
was so influential that none of them rise

514
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
to the level of having contributed

515
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
anything distinctive until over 100 years

516
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,020
later.

517
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:50,023
I was like, wow, that is impact, right?

518
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,025
That is like as much impact as you.

519
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:54,027
But ironically, it's like negative

520
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:54,027
impact.

521
00:18:52,025 --> 00:19:02,029
Like the most significant poem shuts

522
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,029
everybody up because they don't dare to

523
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,029
do anything except for imitated in a

524
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,029
totally derivative way.

525
00:18:54,027 --> 00:19:08,035
But creating something new out of it,

526
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
that's what creates the most fecundity in

527
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
art, right?

528
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:09,036
Like, you create something.

529
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:12,039
And a lot of her people were like, oh, I

530
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:12,039
love this.

531
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm going to take it and adapt it and run

532
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,040
with it.

533
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:26,053
That's one of the things I love about hip

534
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:26,053
hop, is it's so much about sampling and

535
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:26,053
flipping and remixing, and it's not

536
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:26,053
afraid of any other genre because its

537
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:26,053
attitude is you can take any genre and

538
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:26,053
make it better by adding beats and

539
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:26,053
rhymes.

540
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:29,056
But really effective art shuts it down.

541
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:44,071
I think Andrew Marvell was also known as

542
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:44,071
the last carpet diem poem writer because

543
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:44,071
he wrote such a perfect carpet diem poem,

544
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:44,071
Gather Ye Rosebuds while You May, that no

545
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:44,071
one really bothered with that genre

546
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:44,071
anymore because nobody could do as well

547
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:44,071
as Andrew Marvell.

548
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:48,075
And he wrote the last great garden poem

549
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
as well, english garden poem.

550
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:52,079
And it's like, how do you measure your

551
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,079
success as an artist?

552
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:58,085
By the degree to which you've created

553
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,085
something that's so intimidating for

554
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,085
everybody else that they don't even

555
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,085
bother with the genre anymore.

556
00:19:52,079 --> 00:20:07,088
And now you're measuring your success by

557
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
the deletion of genres from the cultural

558
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
milieu, which creates space for other

559
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
people to invent more genres.

560
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:10,091
But this is an interesting way to measure

561
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:10,091
success.

562
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:12,092
Daniel: Wow.

563
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:17,098
I'm going to pick up on that pattern and

564
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:17,098
bring it into attention.

565
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:24,105
And the Bayesian perspective on

566
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
attention, which is sometimes equated

567
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
with precision.

568
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:34,115
So if we're paying a lot of attention to

569
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:34,115
a sensory input, a lot of attention, high

570
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:34,115
precision, we're really putting a lot of

571
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:34,115
credence in that information.

572
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:36,117
It's overriding our priors a lot.

573
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:41,122
We're updating our beliefs to basically

574
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,122
be what we're paying attention to.

575
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:44,125
And then the other case would be we're

576
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
not paying attention.

577
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:50,131
We have low precision or high

578
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
uncertainty, and we're not updating our

579
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
beliefs at all.

580
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:55,136
That's what we basically conversationally

581
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:55,136
mean when we say we're not paying

582
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:55,136
attention to that.

583
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:56,137
Like, I couldn't tell you what it was.

584
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:58,139
It didn't leave an impact.

585
00:20:56,137 --> 00:21:15,150
And when you were talking about this

586
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
cultural evolutionary process, I thought

587
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
about cultures paying attention to genres

588
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
and works, because if there was one work

589
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
that was the object of attention, it

590
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
would be in the spotlight.

591
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:21,156
But attention is like a spotlight, and if

592
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:21,156
it's a laser on one thing, it's not on

593
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:21,156
everything else.

594
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:35,170
And if there's no work that's rising to

595
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,170
attention, then there's this

596
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,170
proliferation of hypotheses cultural

597
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,170
endeavors, but no one of them will

598
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,170
necessarily be shared.

599
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:40,175
And so art that resonates with

600
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,175
communities and with your friends.

601
00:21:35,170 --> 00:22:04,193
It's like in this gray zone where it has

602
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
to have enough attention on it so that

603
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
there can be a culture of hip hop or the

604
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
Grateful Dean or whatever it may be, but

605
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
not one that is so attended to that it

606
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
gets burnt by the laser.

607
00:21:40,175 --> 00:22:16,205
Baba: Yeah, it's like if everyone's only

608
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
paying attention to one thing then that's

609
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
actually very stifling for cultural

610
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
flourishing because you don't get all the

611
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
variants, you get these totally dominant

612
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
moments.

613
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:20,209
You can see that at the macro level in

614
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
history but it also just happens on

615
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
social media all the time too.

616
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:21,210
Right?

617
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:27,216
Everybody's talking about one thing and

618
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:27,216
then it's like what if that thing is not

619
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:27,216
interesting to you?

620
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:32,221
Or what is the upshot of that.

621
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:36,225
Daniel: Dominance of attention in active

622
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
inference?

623
00:22:32,221 --> 00:23:04,247
We sometimes talk about regimes of

624
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:04,247
attention and there have been some great

625
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:04,247
recent papers on cultural regimes of

626
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:04,247
attention and that kind of takes that

627
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:04,247
basal Bayesian idea of attention as

628
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:04,247
precision to stimuli and it puts it into

629
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:04,247
the dynamical space where the regime of

630
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:04,247
attention might be like the sequence of

631
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:04,247
eye circades across a page.

632
00:22:36,225 --> 00:23:14,257
So that is a complex pattern with

633
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:14,257
attention moving and we could just call

634
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:14,257
that broadly like a regime of attention

635
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:14,257
or attention and action.

636
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:21,264
And in some sense that's what culture is

637
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:21,264
or can be described as.

638
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:34,277
Baba: Is regime just a kind of summary of

639
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
where you happen to look or is the intent

640
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
that it's like there is some kind of

641
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
intentional control of attention that is

642
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
inherent to the work that's being

643
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
attended to.

644
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:39,281
Like you can expect people to look others

645
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:39,281
in the eyes when you're seeing a video or

646
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:39,281
a photo.

647
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:48,291
And the regime is that there must be some

648
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:48,291
implied, maybe an inbuilt psychology of

649
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:48,291
things that we tend to find more

650
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:48,291
fascinating.

651
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:51,294
Is that what's implied by it a.

652
00:23:48,291 --> 00:24:11,308
Daniel: Lot there the word regime does

653
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
have a slight connotation of something

654
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
that's imposed whereas it is in the

655
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
neutral sense describing merely the

656
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
dynamics and then what those shared

657
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
regimes of attention might be like.

658
00:23:51,294 --> 00:24:17,314
We're going to approach each other this

659
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
way, making this kind of eye contact and

660
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
make these kinds of gestures.

661
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:24,321
That's how we're going to be reducing our

662
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:24,321
uncertainty about who we are and what

663
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:24,321
this event is.

664
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:41,338
And without those shiboliths secret words

665
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
and implicit or explicit processes and

666
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
rituals, it's hard to lock on culturally

667
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
and there's so many ways to go from

668
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
there.

669
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:47,344
Baba: But I'll leave it yeah, whenever I

670
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:47,344
see chibolas and norms being acted out.

671
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:52,349
Obviously there are scientific studies

672
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,349
that are trying to unpack this as well.

673
00:24:48,345 --> 00:25:08,359
But my favorite thing to speculate about

674
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
is to what degree is this culturally

675
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
constructed in an open ended way and to

676
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
what degree is the cultural aspects of it

677
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
relying on an underlying cognitivist

678
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
psychology that is inherited from

679
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
evolution?

680
00:24:52,349 --> 00:25:19,370
Like for instance, if you're having a

681
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
conversation with somebody one on one and

682
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
you never look them in the eyes, that's

683
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
inherently suspicious, right?

684
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:20,371
Like, what's wrong with this person?

685
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,372
They won't look me in the eyes.

686
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:22,373
Are they lying to me?

687
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:37,388
Do they have something to hide that

688
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:37,388
response that you get emotionally and in

689
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:37,388
terms of somebody's disposition towards

690
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:37,388
you, I would find that very unlikely to

691
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:37,388
be 100% culturally constructed.

692
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:42,393
Could you imagine a society that was

693
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:42,393
egalitarian where they never looked each

694
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:42,393
other in the eyes?

695
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:53,403
I can imagine societies where aristocrats

696
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:53,403
prohibit people below them in the

697
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:53,403
hierarchy from looking in the eyes

698
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:53,403
because it's seen as a sign of

699
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:53,403
disrespect, which of course, is entirely

700
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:53,403
based on primate behavior.

701
00:25:42,393 --> 00:26:01,406
When you're, like, challenging an alpha,

702
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:01,406
if you look at them for too long, then

703
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:01,406
they'll bite you and you got to cast your

704
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:01,406
eyes down to demonstrate your

705
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:01,406
submissiveness or whatever.

706
00:25:53,404 --> 00:26:05,410
Humans have replicated some of these very

707
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:05,410
deep mammalian instincts that we have,

708
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:05,410
right?

709
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:13,418
But are we malleable enough that a

710
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
society could ever evolve with the norm

711
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
of nobody ever looks the other person in

712
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:13,418
the eyes?

713
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:29,434
Or would that swim upstream so strongly

714
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
against our instinctive ways of measuring

715
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
our degrees of trust and affinity towards

716
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
each other that that culture would just

717
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
inherently fail and not manage to be

718
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
represented in the panoply of cultures

719
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
going forward?

720
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:33,438
Daniel: I'll try to give a thought on

721
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:33,438
that.

722
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:37,442
Falling back to this attention

723
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:37,442
discussion.

724
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:41,446
So the movement of the eyes does provide

725
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:41,446
information.

726
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:44,449
Whether it's deceptive or not.

727
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:49,454
It is an outlet of information from the

728
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:49,454
person who you could be looking.

729
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:56,460
Baba: At putting attention itself right

730
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:56,460
where you look to find out if someone's

731
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:56,460
paying attention.

732
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:58,463
Daniel: The eyes are the window to the

733
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:58,463
soul.

734
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:04,463
Maybe that wasn't just about the cornea

735
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:04,463
attention as the window to the soul.

736
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:05,464
Baba: It was about game theory.

737
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:29,488
Daniel: And so to neglect this fountain

738
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
of information, you have to have a

739
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
cultural clamp on it, like a secondary

740
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
reason to not look, because it is

741
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
providing so much info on a millisecond

742
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
by millisecond level in ways that aren't

743
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
always even expressible.

744
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:33,492
Like pupil diameter has a lot to do with

745
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:33,492
arousal.

746
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:44,503
And psychologically, people may or may

747
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
not know about that empirically, and I

748
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
doubt it was shown empirically until we

749
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
had cameras and measuring devices and

750
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
millimeters and all of that.

751
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:51,510
But it can still play a role implicitly

752
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,510
in behaviors and heuristics and

753
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,510
strategies.

754
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:57,516
And so it's like if we're paying

755
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
attention to our embodiment, certain

756
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
things will arise.

757
00:27:51,510 --> 00:28:16,529
And in situations where the inherited

758
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:16,529
prior has to overrule or reinterpret

759
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:16,529
those first principles takes those are

760
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:16,529
like scenarios with an attention to the

761
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:16,529
past, for better and worse.

762
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:35,548
That is shading our experience

763
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
interpretation versus the prima fascia

764
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
situational awareness that convergently

765
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
evolves to a few attractors like looking

766
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
at informative sources of information.

767
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:37,550
Baba: Yeah.

768
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:59,572
And just because there's a lot of

769
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
swimming upstream of sort of instinctive

770
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
cognition necessary for cultural norms to

771
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
play out, doesn't necessarily mean that

772
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
they're doomed to fail or a waste of time

773
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
or whatever you could almost say, like

774
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
the whole scientific enterprise, complex

775
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
mathematics, even reading, none of these

776
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
things are instinctively evolved.

777
00:28:37,550 --> 00:29:06,573
They're all very recent, and we're like

778
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
building them on top of our older

779
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
cognition and architecture and

780
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
instincts.

781
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:14,581
But they're gloriously culturally

782
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
constructed and I would say worthy of the

783
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
effort of swimming upstream.

784
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:18,585
Daniel: The keyboard.

785
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:22,589
QWERTY oh, well, the keyboard doesn't

786
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:22,589
have to be that way.

787
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:27,594
Well, yeah, but we don't need keyboards

788
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:27,594
and we haven't always had them and we

789
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:27,594
won't always have them.

790
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:35,602
And left to right reading, it could be

791
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:35,602
right to left or up to down or it could

792
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:35,602
be any, but we haven't even had

793
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:35,602
inscription technology.

794
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:40,607
So maybe let me bring it back to your

795
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
experience with hip hop.

796
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:50,617
How has the generative process, the

797
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:50,617
extended cognitive niche of technology,

798
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:50,617
supported the remix culture?

799
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:52,619
And how does that manifest?

800
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:57,624
Baba: Well, I think I'll start with some

801
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:57,624
of the good ones.

802
00:29:54,621 --> 00:30:06,627
I used to go to a studio and sit with

803
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:06,627
producers and hear their beats and like,

804
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:06,627
let's go with that one, and then like,

805
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:06,627
try lyrics.

806
00:29:57,624 --> 00:30:09,630
I had prewritten or sometimes write the

807
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:09,630
track.

808
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:15,636
It was really expensive, fun,

809
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
interactively.

810
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:17,638
I do miss the in person studio

811
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:17,638
experience.

812
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:23,644
But all the previous rap records I've

813
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:23,644
made for the past ten years were all made

814
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:23,644
remotely with dropbox.

815
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:27,648
So the rappers, you know, send, or the

816
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
producers send me a folder full of

817
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
beats.

818
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:29,650
I choose the one that I like the best.

819
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:33,654
I write the rap, I record the raps at

820
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:33,654
home, I send them to the producer.

821
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:41,662
And I've got a track where the producer

822
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:41,662
is based in Seattle, the session musician

823
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:41,662
is playing, keys is in Vancouver.

824
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:47,668
The vocalist is doing the song from his

825
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
place in Toronto and I'm in Long Island.

826
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:52,673
Like taking all the different parts and

827
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:52,673
editing them and then sending them to the

828
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:52,673
mix engineer and the master.

829
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:55,676
It's like this great distributed

830
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:55,676
collaborative process.

831
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:59,680
And even by today's standard, that's

832
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
analog, right?

833
00:30:55,676 --> 00:31:15,690
That's like sharing files in a dropbox

834
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:15,690
and throwing them into your local studio

835
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:15,690
and sort of measuring each input against

836
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:15,690
the expectation song to sound ultimately,

837
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:15,690
and giving people feedback and asking for

838
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:15,690
revisions.

839
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:26,701
But I think there are now AI sort of web

840
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
three platforms where you can all be in

841
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
the same virtual room and the latency is

842
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
worked out and you're collaborating

843
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
musically.

844
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:30,705
Haven't used those yet, but I've been

845
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:30,705
scoping them out.

846
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:33,708
So I think that's generally been

847
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:33,708
positive.

848
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:35,710
It's brought the cost down and it's

849
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,710
allowed for real time.

850
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:41,716
Well, not quite real time, but like,

851
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:41,716
ongoing collaboration with creatives

852
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:41,716
across different areas.

853
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:54,729
But then the kind of parallel revolution

854
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
that's happened is from selling CDs,

855
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
selling tape, selling CDs, and then

856
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
Spotify takes over and you're getting

857
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:54,729
like fractions of pennies on the stream.

858
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:59,734
And your music is going into this massive

859
00:31:59,734 --> 00:31:59,734
archive of every kind of music.

860
00:31:54,729 --> 00:32:04,733
And you're only getting paid based on how

861
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:04,733
much your music is listened to compared

862
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:04,733
to every other music that's on there.

863
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:11,740
They're partitioning their subscription

864
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:11,740
fees and it's become much harder, I

865
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:11,740
think, for a lot of musicians to make a.

866
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:13,742
Living from the sale of music.

867
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:26,755
And so over the past ten to 15 years,

868
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
that process really pushed a lot of

869
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
artists into really just basing all their

870
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
income on live performance, like set up

871
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
gigs and rock shows and sell merchant

872
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
shows.

873
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:37,766
If you want any expectation of income

874
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:37,766
from music sales, you better be there

875
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:37,766
meeting the fans, shaking their hands,

876
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:37,766
sending them a CD in person, then COVID

877
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:37,766
shut that down for a couple of years

878
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:37,766
anyway, it's coming back.

879
00:32:26,755 --> 00:33:00,783
But my estimation during the pandemic was

880
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
even as it comes back, there's going to

881
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
be people that are more reluctant to

882
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
travel to shows and do that have the in

883
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
person experience, even when public

884
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
health notices say it's safe because

885
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
people have different degrees of paranoia

886
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
and anxiety and they won't feel as

887
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
comfortable even if it is objectively

888
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
safe.

889
00:32:37,766 --> 00:33:12,795
So pivoting to this event wrap game was

890
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:12,795
partially based on an analysis of what's

891
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:12,795
happening with the industry and how hard

892
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:12,795
it is to make it as an artist.

893
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:16,799
And part of that has been a technology

894
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:16,799
driven process.

895
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:20,803
Daniel: Wow.

896
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:38,821
Also many ways to go, let's kind of

897
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:38,821
return to those expectations and I think

898
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:38,821
there'll be some ways that your

899
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:38,821
experience with expectations might map or

900
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:38,821
resonate to the Bayesian brain.

901
00:33:20,803 --> 00:34:02,839
So say a little bit about what are your

902
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:02,839
expectations when you're coming out to a

903
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:02,839
performance, whatever setting that you

904
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:02,839
choose to think about, and then how does

905
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:02,839
that interface with or to what extent do

906
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:02,839
you even preempt or pregame the

907
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:02,839
audience's expectation?

908
00:33:38,821 --> 00:34:13,850
Do you just call it like you see it or

909
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:13,850
are you looking to finesse your

910
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:13,850
performance based upon what you rightly

911
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:13,850
or wrongly believe their expectations to

912
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:13,850
be?

913
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:30,867
Baba: Well, there's an ambient

914
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:30,867
characteristic that I kind of just take

915
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:30,867
for granted, which is that I'm not very

916
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:30,867
famous, but I have a hardcore boutique

917
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:30,867
fan base of the science nerds and science

918
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:30,867
rap nerds.

919
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:39,876
So if I'm in front of a crowd most of the

920
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:39,876
time, more than half of them don't even

921
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:39,876
know who I am and I've got to introduce

922
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:39,876
myself to them for the first time.

923
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:43,880
And some portion of them have seen a

924
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:43,880
bunch of my shows and their fans and

925
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:43,880
they're like, oh, it's his next show.

926
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:50,887
But I don't really write to address an

927
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
audience that knows me generally.

928
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:55,892
My assumption is that they don't and I'm

929
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:55,892
constantly reintroducing myself and

930
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:55,892
finding new fans that way.

931
00:34:50,887 --> 00:35:00,891
And let's be honest, you see me walking

932
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:00,891
down the street, you're not going to be

933
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:00,891
like, there goes a rapper.

934
00:34:55,892 --> 00:35:07,898
The Bayesian priors of my ability to

935
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:07,898
perform as a rapper are low and they have

936
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:07,898
been since I started.

937
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:13,904
I was as bookish, suburban Canadian

938
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
woodsy teenager.

939
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:18,909
Like, I want to be a rapper, but no one's

940
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:18,909
going to believe I'm a rapper, so I

941
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:18,909
better get really good at rapping.

942
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:28,919
And also just it is a bit of a choice not

943
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:28,919
to like, dress overtly to hip hop or talk

944
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:28,919
overtly to hip hop.

945
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:32,923
It's like there is a hip hop persona that

946
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:32,923
a lot of artists adopt.

947
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:36,927
Maybe it becomes natural to them and they

948
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
could say, this is who I am.

949
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:44,935
There was either a conscious or

950
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:44,935
unconscious decision at some point in

951
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:44,935
their growth where they became more

952
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:44,935
seemingly hip hop.

953
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:51,942
Maybe to reduce the cognitive dissonance

954
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:51,942
of the lack of expectations of them being

955
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:51,942
able to wrap from their audience.

956
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:58,949
Maybe for other reasons, maybe peer

957
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:58,949
influence, maybe they just none of that

958
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:58,949
analysis really matters.

959
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:59,950
And they felt it.

960
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:02,947
They were passionate, so they started

961
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:02,947
adopting the lingo.

962
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:05,950
I kind of always partitioned rap a little

963
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:05,950
bit.

964
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:14,959
Like when I'm performing, I'm a rapper

965
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
and my profession is I'm a rapper, but

966
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
I'm not going to make myself a cup of tea

967
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:14,959
in a rap style.

968
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:14,959
Baba rapping: You know what I'm saying?

969
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:25,970
Baba: It's like I do distinguish a little

970
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:25,970
bit between the domains of my life and

971
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:25,970
partially what that means is people don't

972
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:25,970
mark me and expect me to be good at it or

973
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:25,970
to be able to deliver.

974
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:28,973
And then I get to there's a cost benefit

975
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
there, right?

976
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:39,984
For one thing, the skepticism might lose

977
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:39,984
me potential opportunities to perform or

978
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:39,984
potential members of the audience who see

979
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:39,984
me setting up the mic and they're like,

980
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:39,984
that guy?

981
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:40,985
I don't think so, and then leave.

982
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:56,001
But on the other hand, the transformation

983
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:56,001
I get to take an audience through as they

984
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:56,001
realize what they're experiencing and

985
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:56,001
feel their expectations being overturned

986
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:56,001
is actually, I think, really part of the

987
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:56,001
joy of the experience.

988
00:36:40,985 --> 00:37:05,004
It's an expectation shattering experience

989
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:05,004
when someone that you don't expect to be

990
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:05,004
able to deliver in a certain art form

991
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:05,004
just really does.

992
00:36:56,001 --> 00:37:12,011
And I kind of play with that in the

993
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:12,011
comedy and tease the audience for having

994
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:12,011
low expectations with me and stuff like

995
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:12,011
that.

996
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:20,019
But then part of this is contingent on me

997
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:20,019
just never getting that famous.

998
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:31,030
If there was a point at which I had

999
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
achieved as much as much of a fan base as

1000
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
them, my, like, writing style about, you

1001
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
don't think I'm going to be able to rap,

1002
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
do you?

1003
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:34,033
While watch this would of course, sounds

1004
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:34,033
pointless.

1005
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:42,041
Kind of like he stopped writing about

1006
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:42,041
being poor after his first album and the

1007
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:42,041
first line of his second album was, they

1008
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:42,041
say I can't rap about Lee and broke no

1009
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:42,041
more.

1010
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:51,050
Just like naming the critical reception

1011
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,050
of his transition from album one to

1012
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,050
Millionaire album two.

1013
00:37:43,042 --> 00:38:01,054
So I think there is a kind of interplay

1014
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:01,054
between artists and their audiences and I

1015
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:01,054
stay niche and I write to the

1016
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:01,054
expectations of that niche.

1017
00:37:51,050 --> 00:38:08,061
Daniel: We're all in our own niche, so I

1018
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:08,061
hope that part doesn't change.

1019
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:20,073
But very interesting, when we attend, we

1020
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:20,073
don't even need to say pay attention and

1021
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:20,073
use this economic modality.

1022
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:29,082
But when we attend to our experience and

1023
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,082
update our priors just statistically,

1024
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,082
that's called learning.

1025
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:41,094
And I think that speaks to this synthesis

1026
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:41,094
with the language, the lexicon, the

1027
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:41,094
slang, or as we might call it, the active

1028
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:41,094
inference.

1029
00:38:29,082 --> 00:39:02,109
Ontology speaks across a continuum from

1030
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
the experiential and the folk ecological,

1031
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
the day to day, it's the same terms with

1032
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
the same authentic relationships that are

1033
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
increasingly becoming embodied in our

1034
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
intelligence algorithms.

1035
00:38:41,094 --> 00:39:09,116
Again, not even calling it artificial

1036
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
intelligence algorithms because they're

1037
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
extensions into the niche from us.

1038
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:29,136
So these cognitive models that are being

1039
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:29,136
deployed, AI artificial intelligence or

1040
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:29,136
large language models, they are cognitive

1041
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:29,136
entities and they're participating in

1042
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:29,136
these ecosystems of engagement with us.

1043
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:40,147
Baba: I had a conversation with the new

1044
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
Chat GPT driven Bing engine last night.

1045
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:45,152
I just got added to Bing, the AI driven

1046
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,152
version.

1047
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:46,153
It's interesting.

1048
00:39:45,152 --> 00:40:01,162
The first thing I did when Chat GPT came

1049
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
out was I said, write me a rap song in

1050
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
the style of Snoop that explains how to

1051
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
change the oil in a Honda CRV, because

1052
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
that's exactly the kind of project that

1053
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
we do with Event Wrap.

1054
00:39:46,153 --> 00:40:17,178
Event Wrap is like a team of skilled,

1055
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
professional, ten year veteran artists

1056
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
that'll make you a song on any topic and

1057
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
either record it as a video that you can

1058
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
share as a kind of public engagement, or

1059
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
explainer or come in live to one of your

1060
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
events, virtual or in person, and

1061
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
perform.

1062
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:20,181
But it's a topical rap agency.

1063
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:25,186
It's like all the rappers have their own

1064
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
catalogs, but they don't perform them at

1065
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
the events we book.

1066
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:27,188
They always create all new stuff.

1067
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:35,196
And Chat GBT's Honda CRV oil change wrap

1068
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:35,196
in the style of Snoop was like, uncannily

1069
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:35,196
on point.

1070
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:41,202
It had the Snoop doble g lingo.

1071
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:48,209
It was like an accurate description of

1072
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
the steps that you would have to take to

1073
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
change the oil in your CRV.

1074
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:50,211
It was like a cogently.

1075
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:55,216
From the scripting perspective, I felt

1076
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:55,216
like we had a threat on our hands.

1077
00:40:51,212 --> 00:41:05,220
Chat Gbt has definitely shook a lot of

1078
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
people's professions, marketing copy,

1079
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
professors, academics that's writing

1080
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
papers.

1081
00:40:55,216 --> 00:41:11,226
The economics of this thing have not even

1082
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:11,226
begun to dawn on people yet.

1083
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:15,230
But the question in my mind was, how soon

1084
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
is it coming for the rapper's job?

1085
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:24,239
And there was a sophomoric cartoonish

1086
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:24,239
kind of kindergarten flavor to the way

1087
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:24,239
it's constructing bars.

1088
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:32,247
So Chat Gbt and Bing by extension, I

1089
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:32,247
think it's the same layer that's running

1090
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:32,247
it is.

1091
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:37,252
It writes wraps like someone who's never

1092
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:37,252
wrapped before.

1093
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:41,256
So if I told you, write me a wrap, you

1094
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:41,256
could do it.

1095
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:52,267
But there's like, layers of proficiency,

1096
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
of master level stuff, of syncopation and

1097
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
internal rhythm within the main stresses

1098
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
of the bars.

1099
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:57,272
And especially, and this is where I was

1100
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:57,272
chatting about with Bing last night, is

1101
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:57,272
polycellabic rhyme.

1102
00:41:52,267 --> 00:42:04,273
So polysyllabic rhyme seams are like the

1103
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:04,273
construction of multisyllable rhymes out

1104
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:04,273
of parts of other words.

1105
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:10,279
And I was like, asking Bing, can you do

1106
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:10,279
polysyllabic rhymes?

1107
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:12,281
And Bing was like, yes, I can.

1108
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:18,287
And I said, okay, give me some examples

1109
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:18,287
from mainstream rap of polysyllabic

1110
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:18,287
rhymes and it pulled an example from MF.

1111
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:20,289
Doom, which was an excellent example.

1112
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:30,299
It was like, the girl's a crazy skitzo,

1113
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
but she's got amazing tits though, so you

1114
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
can hear the pattern.

1115
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:33,302
Crazy skitzo, amazing tits, though.

1116
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:36,305
It's like multiple words constructing a

1117
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:36,305
longer pattern of syllables.

1118
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:40,309
I was like, Gravo, Bing, you found a

1119
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
perfect polycellabic rhyme.

1120
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:49,318
Now write me a wrap that explains your

1121
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:49,318
internal data architecture or your

1122
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:49,318
algorithmic architecture in the style of

1123
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:49,318
MF.

1124
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:51,320
Doom emphasizing polysyllabic rhymes.

1125
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:54,323
Couldn't do it all monosyllabic.

1126
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,324
Like, check me out.

1127
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:55,324
I'm bing.

1128
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:56,325
I do averse.

1129
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:58,327
I am artificial intelligence.

1130
00:42:57,326 --> 00:43:00,323
I don't even need to rehearse.

1131
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:03,326
And I was like, Bing, those are not

1132
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:03,326
polysyllabic rhymes.

1133
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:05,328
You started out quoting MF.

1134
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:10,333
Doom complex five syllable rhyme pattern,

1135
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:10,333
and now you're rhyming rehearse with

1136
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:10,333
verse.

1137
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:11,334
Like, don't insult my intelligence.

1138
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:13,336
I was like, dissing the AI.

1139
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:17,340
And I was like, I'm sorry, I'm a new

1140
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
model and I will get better at

1141
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
polysyllabic rhyme.

1142
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:21,344
But basically, that is the thing that's

1143
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:21,344
got our job safe for now.

1144
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:38,361
Because if rap is an elite art form that

1145
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:38,361
takes a decade or more to master, the

1146
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:38,361
techniques of flowing, live freestyling

1147
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:38,361
polysyllabic rhyme and rhythm patterns,

1148
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:38,361
and also just the confidence to perform

1149
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:38,361
are the things that we're still getting

1150
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:38,361
paid for.

1151
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:45,368
Even if ability to write a basic

1152
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:45,368
competent rap is now easily achievable by

1153
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:45,368
AI.

1154
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:53,376
Daniel: I'm sure even outside of the rap

1155
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:53,376
profession, these conversations are

1156
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:53,376
happening.

1157
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:55,378
They certainly are in research and

1158
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
education.

1159
00:43:53,376 --> 00:44:06,383
Previously, the artifacts that we exuded

1160
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:06,383
into our niche were mnemonic almost at

1161
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:06,383
best.

1162
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:12,389
It was probably transformative when some

1163
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:12,389
of these oral traditions were able to be

1164
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:12,389
written down.

1165
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:21,398
And that may have also been seen as

1166
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:21,398
threatening to the underlying basis of

1167
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:21,398
the skill and the transmission.

1168
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:29,406
And now we have just a brief window of

1169
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:29,406
these inert externalized artifacts.

1170
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:35,412
These mnemonic devices have only existed

1171
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:35,412
aka writing for however long they've been

1172
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:35,412
in the niche.

1173
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:45,422
And now it's like they've come not quite

1174
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:45,422
to life, but certainly to activity.

1175
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:55,432
And now these off sourced and outsourced

1176
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:55,432
cognitivist entities are not just

1177
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:55,432
receiving and holding, but doing.

1178
00:44:45,422 --> 00:45:05,436
And that transforms who and what we are

1179
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:05,436
in terms of our perception, cognition,

1180
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:05,436
and action loops.

1181
00:44:56,433 --> 00:45:07,438
They're going to be different.

1182
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:13,444
And that is what any given particular

1183
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:13,444
thing is.

1184
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:20,451
Baba: So you mean like any technological

1185
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:20,451
innovation that changes how we interact

1186
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:20,451
with each other and with our art forms?

1187
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:21,452
Daniel: Yeah.

1188
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:30,461
And from the technical side, we use the

1189
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:30,461
word thing active inference lab to

1190
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:30,461
describe the blanket and the internal

1191
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:30,461
states.

1192
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:36,467
So we take a particular partition, we

1193
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:36,467
cleave off the thing we're talking about

1194
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:36,467
from the environment.

1195
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:40,471
The generative model of the thing is the

1196
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:40,471
blanket and the internal states.

1197
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:49,480
And so that thing is defined in terms of

1198
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
its perception, cognition, internal

1199
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
states, and action.

1200
00:45:41,472 --> 00:46:01,486
So when new sensory modalities or sense

1201
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:01,486
data appear, when new action modalities

1202
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:01,486
affordances appear, and when our thinking

1203
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:01,486
is different, it's a different thing.

1204
00:45:49,480 --> 00:46:06,491
It isn't just like well, we mixed this

1205
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:06,491
one thing with another thing, and they've

1206
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:06,491
both retained their identity.

1207
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:17,502
It's like there's been transformation and

1208
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
a learning and we're in the middle of

1209
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
some fractal dimension of it.

1210
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:19,504
Baba: Yeah.

1211
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:25,510
I think this is like a radical break from

1212
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,510
previous technological changes.

1213
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:38,523
One of the things I argued in my thesis

1214
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:38,523
when I was a master's student was that

1215
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:38,523
poets conceived of their audience and

1216
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:38,523
their ability to connect with people

1217
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:38,523
orally, primarily in CHAUCER's time,

1218
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:38,523
right.

1219
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:41,526
Reciting your poetry for a listening

1220
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:41,526
crowd.

1221
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:53,538
But then the invention of the printing

1222
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:53,538
press with Gutenberg changed that ability

1223
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:53,538
to imagine an audience because it was so

1224
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:53,538
much easier to imagine a silent

1225
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:53,538
readership of 10,000 people reading your

1226
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:53,538
pamphlet.

1227
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:57,542
But making 10,000 vellum manuscripts by

1228
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:57,542
hand was always prohibitively expensive.

1229
00:46:53,538 --> 00:47:02,541
So no poet could even imagine ever having

1230
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:02,541
a fan base through text.

1231
00:46:57,542 --> 00:47:02,541
Right.

1232
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:08,547
Gutenberg allows for the possibility of a

1233
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:08,547
fan base through text, which changes the

1234
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:08,547
whole art form.

1235
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:14,553
Suddenly rhyme is extraneous because

1236
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
they're going to be reading quietly

1237
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
anyway, so who cares what the poetry

1238
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
sounds like?

1239
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:21,560
The main thing should be carefully

1240
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
constructed syntax and story and

1241
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
semantics in a concentrated way.

1242
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:23,562
But you see then this rise of free verse,

1243
00:47:23,562 --> 00:47:23,562
right?

1244
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,565
Poetry is sort of like shorn of all of

1245
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:26,565
its ornaments.

1246
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:32,571
And my hypothesis was that they were just

1247
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:32,571
basically irrelevant because people were

1248
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:32,571
reading quietly and not reciting out

1249
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:32,571
loud.

1250
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:45,584
And then Edison invents recorded sound,

1251
00:47:45,584 --> 00:47:45,584
which creates the possibility of an

1252
00:47:45,584 --> 00:47:45,584
audience and fanbase that's just as vast

1253
00:47:45,584 --> 00:47:45,584
from the sound of your words as it would

1254
00:47:45,584 --> 00:47:45,584
be from the silent readership.

1255
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:52,591
And that paves the way for the

1256
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
possibility of hip hop, because this is

1257
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
like people that are writing things

1258
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
rhyming verse.

1259
00:47:45,584 --> 00:47:54,593
And of course, I call this the rhyme

1260
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:54,593
renaissance, right?

1261
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:56,595
Poetry was all rhymed then.

1262
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:57,596
None of it was rhymed.

1263
00:47:56,595 --> 00:48:01,594
And then if you think of rap as poetry,

1264
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:01,594
now it's all rhymed again, because who

1265
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:01,594
cares about poetry?

1266
00:47:57,596 --> 00:48:07,600
Rap dominates, like, all of our verse

1267
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:07,600
consumption compared to every other kind

1268
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:07,600
of poetry out there.

1269
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:07,600
Right.

1270
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,601
And rap is rhymed.

1271
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:17,610
And I think people instinctively resonate

1272
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:17,610
with rhyme and just took a break from it

1273
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:17,610
when they were reading silent pamphlets

1274
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:17,610
published by poets who were imagining

1275
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:17,610
their readership.

1276
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:26,619
But each of these examples is like a

1277
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:26,619
technological innovation that mediates

1278
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:26,619
the creative process with its ability to

1279
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:26,619
connect with an audience.

1280
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:29,622
But this AI thing is something completely

1281
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:29,622
different, isn't it?

1282
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:36,629
It's like competing with us in our

1283
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:36,629
production of the creative things.

1284
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:44,637
And right now I'm taking some comfort in

1285
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:44,637
the fact that it's competing ineptly it's

1286
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:44,637
not as good at writing a rap as a good

1287
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:44,637
rapper.

1288
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:59,652
But I'm probably a subset of professions

1289
00:48:59,652 --> 00:48:59,652
that can still say that it's passing the

1290
00:48:59,652 --> 00:48:59,652
Lsat, it's passing all the masters entry

1291
00:48:59,652 --> 00:48:59,652
exams and which rarefied Anil Seth will

1292
00:48:59,652 --> 00:48:59,652
be left.

1293
00:48:44,637 --> 00:49:13,660
Maybe I could comfort to myself to say

1294
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660
the rapper will be the last to fall to AI

1295
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660
because of the combination of creativity

1296
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660
and semantic cogency and humor and all

1297
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660
the things that go into it that the AI is

1298
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660
going to have to work each of those out.

1299
00:48:59,652 --> 00:49:21,668
Like maybe stand up comics, too are safe

1300
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
for a while because Jack Tvtpt can write

1301
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
some jokes, but they're corny jokes

1302
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
still, right?

1303
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:25,672
The original jokes it writes aren't that

1304
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
good compared to Dave Chappelle.

1305
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:27,674
But what are we talking?

1306
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:31,678
Like ten years of safe jobs as artists or

1307
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:31,678
less?

1308
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:35,682
The speed of this last six months has

1309
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:35,682
been a little mind blowing.

1310
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:38,685
Daniel: Who is the deep blue?

1311
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:42,689
Who is the Gary Casperov of Performance.

1312
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:44,690
What is the Turing test?

1313
00:49:42,689 --> 00:50:06,707
And for you to again calling back the

1314
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
real recognized real I listen to that as

1315
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
being like kind of a Turing Test is you

1316
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
have cognitive entities in this moment of

1317
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
reflection, which has been called Theory

1318
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
of Mind and Active Inference Lab

1319
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
sometimes is called thinking through

1320
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
other minds.

1321
00:49:44,691 --> 00:50:13,714
Ttom because there's this cognitive

1322
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:13,714
emulation of if I do this, then they'll

1323
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:13,714
do that.

1324
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:23,724
And so thinking through other minds used

1325
00:50:23,724 --> 00:50:23,724
to be a defined set of types of minds.

1326
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:24,725
We had children.

1327
00:50:23,724 --> 00:50:26,727
We had adults like us.

1328
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:28,729
We had adults in different cultures.

1329
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:30,731
We had squirrels.

1330
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:42,743
And then the workshop is open and the

1331
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
composability is extreme, especially with

1332
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
algorithms that can construct other

1333
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
algorithms.

1334
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:47,748
And all of a sudden that ecosystem of

1335
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:47,748
shared intelligence thinking through

1336
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:47,748
other minds.

1337
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:55,756
We don't even know if it's a sports car

1338
00:50:55,756 --> 00:50:55,756
or a horse and buggy or a spaceship and

1339
00:50:55,756 --> 00:50:55,756
someone's like, do you want to get in?

1340
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:57,758
And it's like, Where are we going?

1341
00:50:56,756 --> 00:50:59,760
What is it going to be like?

1342
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:12,767
All those expectations that we might want

1343
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:12,767
to have about a journey and an event and

1344
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:12,767
who can say what with any precision?

1345
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:15,770
Things will be like, So what do we do

1346
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:15,770
then?

1347
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:21,776
Baba: Yeah, except it's more like a

1348
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:21,776
spaceship that the pilot is like, do you

1349
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:21,776
want to get in?

1350
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:24,779
If you don't, all these people are going

1351
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:24,779
to die.

1352
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:29,784
And so it's your choice whether you want

1353
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
to get in but lives on the line.

1354
00:51:24,779 --> 00:51:39,794
Because obviously people that work in all

1355
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:39,794
kinds of medical fields and scientific

1356
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:39,794
fields will point directly to the amount

1357
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:39,794
of human suffering that they're on the

1358
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:39,794
verge of alleviating using these tools.

1359
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:52,807
And the applications to rapper job

1360
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:52,807
stealing are merely side effects

1361
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:52,807
spandrels of the main focus of it, which

1362
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:52,807
is, I think, mostly very laudable and

1363
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:52,807
very necessary.

1364
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:53,808
Right.

1365
00:51:52,807 --> 00:52:11,820
Let's not get on the spaceship means we

1366
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
continue to put up with all kinds of

1367
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
genetic diseases and levels of poverty

1368
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
and public health crises and things like

1369
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
that that the AI is being applied to and

1370
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
is likely to do a great job in solving.

1371
00:51:53,808 --> 00:52:24,833
Daniel: Yeah, someone says, look, if your

1372
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
four year old still wants to do art by

1373
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
hand, we don't need to stop that, but we

1374
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
just want to use it here.

1375
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:37,846
That's going to be something that's very

1376
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
challenging to take a long term

1377
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
perspective on because it's going to seem

1378
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
like a reasonable compromise in the

1379
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
moment, just like everything always

1380
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:37,846
does.

1381
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:43,851
And what compromise was made when those

1382
00:52:43,851 --> 00:52:43,851
oral traditions were written down?

1383
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:49,858
What compromise was made when that sheet

1384
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
music became recorded and that became

1385
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
canonical and distributed?

1386
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:58,867
And so what is the nature of the

1387
00:52:58,867 --> 00:52:58,867
compromise and who's at the table in

1388
00:52:58,867 --> 00:52:58,867
2023?

1389
00:52:49,858 --> 00:53:02,865
Baba: Yeah, I think that's exactly the

1390
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:02,865
right level of analysis.

1391
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:12,875
And you can say on balance that each of

1392
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:12,875
the compromises we made for some new

1393
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:12,875
technology to give us some costs, but

1394
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:12,875
also benefits.

1395
00:53:02,865 --> 00:53:25,888
It was a totally understandable and

1396
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:25,888
reasonable one from the perspective of

1397
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:25,888
like when I look at an individual poet

1398
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:25,888
giving up on rhyme because they want to

1399
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:25,888
do pamphlets and reach more people, I'm

1400
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:25,888
like, well, they got a family to feed.

1401
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:32,895
That's the way that they can achieve the

1402
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:32,895
notoriety and a claim that is their path

1403
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:32,895
to success as an individual.

1404
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:35,898
And it has cultural ramifications

1405
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:35,898
overall.

1406
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:51,914
And I think you can put that people can

1407
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:51,914
opt out of any technology and the people

1408
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:51,914
that decide to opt in have totally

1409
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:51,914
defensible personal choice reasons for

1410
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:51,914
why they're doing so, usually to get a

1411
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:51,914
competitive advantage.

1412
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:54,917
That was the case with tools going back

1413
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:54,917
to the Stone Age.

1414
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:54,917
Right?

1415
00:53:54,917 --> 00:54:00,917
I only throw rocks, I don't use bow and

1416
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:00,917
arrows and all right, you do you I'm

1417
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:00,917
going to take down this antelope over

1418
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:00,917
here.

1419
00:53:54,917 --> 00:54:02,919
We'll give you a piece if you're lucky.

1420
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:07,924
That's the AI tool choice that everyone's

1421
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:07,924
facing right now too.

1422
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:19,936
Daniel: It also makes me think about art

1423
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:19,936
always playing this role of like the tip

1424
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:19,936
of the spear that kind of penetrates the

1425
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:19,936
veil.

1426
00:54:09,926 --> 00:54:24,941
We had the discussion about Nfts as if

1427
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:24,941
they were just a question about art.

1428
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:30,947
But of course digital certificates are a

1429
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
lot broader and more significant than

1430
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
just visual images.

1431
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:37,954
And there's a discussion about whether

1432
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:37,954
certain kinds of art are being replaced

1433
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:37,954
by generative algorithms.

1434
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:53,970
Long ago, six months ago, twelve months

1435
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
ago, when it was prechat GPT, but there

1436
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
was a lot of the stable diffusion and

1437
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
Midijourney type algorithms then the

1438
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
conversation was more about graphical

1439
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
design and professionals.

1440
00:54:37,954 --> 00:55:02,973
But of course that is a broader

1441
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:02,973
discussion that isn't just about the

1442
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:02,973
generation of images that you are paying

1443
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:02,973
a creative professional to make.

1444
00:54:53,970 --> 00:55:11,982
And it's like art as this frontier and

1445
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:11,982
mediator with the open ended.

1446
00:55:03,974 --> 00:55:19,990
Will people be looking for open endedness

1447
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
and liminality in their events in 50

1448
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
years?

1449
00:55:12,983 --> 00:55:20,991
I think they will be.

1450
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:44,015
That niche, the marginal niche of art as

1451
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
well as the central role of art, I think

1452
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
it's fair to say we'll both exist now

1453
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
whether that cultural attention on the

1454
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
central artifacts will be about artifacts

1455
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
made by a person, an algorithm or

1456
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
something in between.

1457
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:59,030
If somebody designs a 3D sculpture but

1458
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,030
then it's printed, or if they think about

1459
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,030
a drawing and then they use a pen that

1460
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,030
was produced by a machine, who's to say

1461
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,030
in these extended scenarios, whether one

1462
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,030
or the other made it.

1463
00:55:44,015 --> 00:56:06,031
But in the margins, it's where we're

1464
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
always going to be exploring in whatever

1465
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
people call art.

1466
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:11,036
And people who are in the middle of the

1467
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
spotlight saying, that's not art, it's

1468
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:11,036
not their art.

1469
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:29,054
But every single genre has had to have

1470
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
this mitosis or birthing process with

1471
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
people who weren't part of that process

1472
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
saying it wasn't art or that's not the

1473
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
right way to do this kind of science.

1474
00:56:11,036 --> 00:56:30,055
Baba: Or rap is not music.

1475
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:42,067
As a hip hop partisan, I'm very familiar

1476
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
with defending against the rarefied taste

1477
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
of people that want to gatekeep what

1478
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
constitutes art and what doesn't.

1479
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:49,074
But one thing I've always loved about

1480
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:49,074
rap, like that aspect of it not being

1481
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:49,074
gatekeep by Elitists.

1482
00:56:42,067 --> 00:57:05,084
If you want to be a professional ballet

1483
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,084
dancer, like Billy Elliot's stories

1484
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,084
notwithstanding, you got to try to get

1485
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,084
into juilliard, and you have to go

1486
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,084
through the process of rarefied judges

1487
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,084
that are telling people who can and can't

1488
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,084
get into the next one.

1489
00:56:49,074 --> 00:57:10,089
Lake there is no backdoor to success in

1490
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:10,089
some art forms, right?

1491
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:11,090
Classical music, opera.

1492
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:14,093
But with hip hop, there's no front door

1493
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:14,093
to success.

1494
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:16,095
You got to get good at it.

1495
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:20,099
On the street level, there's no degree

1496
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
that will get you a job in it.

1497
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:26,105
You just have to find crowds and

1498
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:26,105
entertain them at the level of your

1499
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:26,105
neighborhood and then your city and then

1500
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:26,105
your state.

1501
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:33,112
And if you survive the levels of

1502
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:33,112
competition on the way up, then you get

1503
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:33,112
to the world stage or whatever.

1504
00:57:27,105 --> 00:57:38,117
But it's very like, pick up a mic and

1505
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:38,117
show what you got kind of thing.

1506
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:41,120
And it's mediated by the audience and the

1507
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,120
fans.

1508
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:44,123
If they like it, it's right, and if they

1509
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:44,123
don't like it, it's wrong.

1510
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:56,135
And MC has moved the crowd, and there's a

1511
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:56,135
fairly definitive objective measurement

1512
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:56,135
about whether someone's doing rap well or

1513
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:56,135
not, and it's how the crowd is

1514
00:57:56,135 --> 00:57:56,135
responding.

1515
00:57:44,123 --> 00:58:02,135
There's no valid argument that

1516
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:02,135
everybody's booing you, but you're

1517
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:02,135
actually awesome because they just don't

1518
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:02,135
understand your art.

1519
00:57:56,135 --> 00:58:06,139
No, you failed to understand the context

1520
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:06,139
in which your art was meant to be

1521
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:06,139
consumed.

1522
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:06,139
Right.

1523
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:13,146
So whenever we're looking at these trade

1524
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:13,146
offs, often it comes down to producers

1525
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:13,146
and consumers, right?

1526
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:16,149
Each new tool is good for consumers but

1527
00:58:16,149 --> 00:58:16,149
bad for producers.

1528
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:20,153
And this is like the Taxi Guilds trying

1529
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:20,153
to fight off Uber.

1530
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:25,158
Uber is great for people that want to

1531
00:58:25,158 --> 00:58:25,158
ride, but it's bad for people that are

1532
00:58:25,158 --> 00:58:25,158
going to try to control the means of

1533
00:58:25,158 --> 00:58:25,158
production.

1534
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:33,166
And you're seeing this exact process play

1535
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
out with Chat GPT now, which is like and

1536
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
also with stable diffusion and the other

1537
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
examples you gave.

1538
00:58:25,158 --> 00:58:41,174
Like, people want to consume art and they

1539
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:41,174
don't necessarily care who made it, as

1540
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:41,174
long as their reception of it gives them

1541
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:41,174
the feelings that they want from the

1542
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:41,174
consumption.

1543
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:41,174
Right.

1544
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:44,177
And I think that's the case with music

1545
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
and with poetry as well.

1546
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:54,187
Although we're not yet consuming a ton of

1547
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:54,187
AI generated music and poetry and comedy

1548
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:54,187
because it's not sophisticated enough to

1549
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:54,187
produce the highest level stuff.

1550
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:58,191
Although I think with classical music it

1551
00:58:58,191 --> 00:58:58,191
is, and with graphic design andy Clark it

1552
00:58:58,191 --> 00:58:58,191
is.

1553
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:58,191
Right.

1554
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:12,199
The best AI art is actually competitive

1555
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:12,199
commercially or from a consumer

1556
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:12,199
perspective, like taste test wise with

1557
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:12,199
the best rarefied professionals, which is

1558
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:12,199
devastating for them, but it's not

1559
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:12,199
unique.

1560
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:25,212
That's what the guilds have wanted to do

1561
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:25,212
for centuries is protect their status as

1562
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:25,212
the elite producers of a thing from the

1563
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:25,212
ability of just about anybody to consume

1564
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:25,212
it for as cheaply as they want.

1565
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:27,214
And that's what technology keeps

1566
00:59:27,214 --> 00:59:27,214
delivering.

1567
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:30,217
And in general, I'm actually a fan of

1568
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:30,217
that process.

1569
00:59:27,214 --> 00:59:32,219
I think it's democratizing.

1570
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:37,224
It's good for everybody on average, even

1571
00:59:37,224 --> 00:59:37,224
though it perpetually upends the guilds.

1572
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:41,228
But we shouldn't give guilds control over

1573
00:59:41,228 --> 00:59:41,228
our ability to consume excellence.

1574
00:59:37,224 --> 00:59:47,234
And if excellence is delivered better by

1575
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:47,234
AI, then let's not be curmudgeons about

1576
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:47,234
that.

1577
00:59:41,228 --> 00:59:53,240
But there is still an individual

1578
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,240
challenge like, okay, what am I going to

1579
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,240
do to make a living now?

1580
00:59:48,235 --> 01:00:13,406
It does really create a lot of potential

1581
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:13,406
unemployment and economic devastation,

1582
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:13,406
which is why a lot of people have thought

1583
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:13,406
that there's just no escape from

1584
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:13,406
universal basic income because the jobs

1585
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:13,406
are going to fall and society will

1586
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:13,406
descend into chaos with that much

1587
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:13,406
unemployment and frustration and

1588
01:00:13,406 --> 01:00:13,406
resentment and anger.

1589
00:59:53,240 --> 01:00:20,183
But even if rappers are the last job to

1590
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:20,183
fall, the analysis has to apply to all

1591
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:20,183
kinds of other jobs first.

1592
01:00:13,413 --> 01:00:27,842
And active inference comes into this

1593
01:00:27,842 --> 01:00:27,842
because how does a rapper entertain the

1594
01:00:27,842 --> 01:00:27,842
crowd?

1595
01:00:21,197 --> 01:00:34,514
By having a mental model of what the

1596
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:34,514
crowd's going to do if they perform

1597
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:34,514
Action X, right.

1598
01:00:27,855 --> 01:00:36,717
What it will be the effect of X on Y.

1599
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:41,277
Y is the crowd, x is the intervention and

1600
01:00:41,277 --> 01:00:41,277
the intervention is a choice of a bar.

1601
01:00:36,729 --> 01:00:43,437
I'm going to rhyme this with this.

1602
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:45,644
I'm going to make a song about this

1603
01:00:45,644 --> 01:00:45,644
topic.

1604
01:00:43,446 --> 01:00:48,971
I'm going to try this joke out in my flow

1605
01:00:48,971 --> 01:00:48,971
as a punchline.

1606
01:00:45,649 --> 01:00:50,104
And you have a mental model.

1607
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,316
Oh yeah, people are going to think that's

1608
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:52,316
really funny.

1609
01:00:50,111 --> 01:00:57,816
And then you deploy it and you see the

1610
01:00:57,816 --> 01:00:57,816
degree to which your expectation has been

1611
01:00:57,816 --> 01:00:57,816
fulfilled.

1612
01:00:52,329 --> 01:01:05,040
And I don't think AI is that good at that

1613
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:05,040
yet because it doesn't model expectations

1614
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:05,040
of audiences very well yet, does it?

1615
01:00:57,828 --> 01:01:10,567
It doesn't have deep theories of mind, of

1616
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:10,567
perceptions of perceptions of

1617
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:10,567
perceptions.

1618
01:01:05,047 --> 01:01:23,880
It just has averaging abilities to

1619
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:23,880
recreate patterns that it finds in vast

1620
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:23,880
troves of human created art, which

1621
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:23,880
includes pixel patterns and graphics and

1622
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:23,880
patterns and text, semantic and syntactic

1623
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:23,880
patterns.

1624
01:01:10,578 --> 01:01:34,916
But like performance art with an audience

1625
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:34,916
requires a mental prior of the audience's

1626
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:34,916
disposition and attitude.

1627
01:01:23,883 --> 01:01:37,218
And that's why I say rap is going to be

1628
01:01:37,218 --> 01:01:37,218
the last to fall.

1629
01:01:34,926 --> 01:01:39,482
And that's also why it's really hard to

1630
01:01:39,482 --> 01:01:39,482
get good at.

1631
01:01:37,237 --> 01:01:52,079
It takes years of performing, dying on

1632
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:52,079
stage and sucking and being booed before

1633
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:52,079
you really build up this mental model of

1634
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:52,079
like, I know what people like and I know

1635
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:52,079
if I do this, they'll do that.

1636
01:01:39,492 --> 01:01:55,103
And even I've been doing this for 25

1637
01:01:55,103 --> 01:01:55,103
years.

1638
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:56,114
I'm wrong all the time.

1639
01:01:55,104 --> 01:01:58,133
Oh yeah, that line fell flat.

1640
01:01:56,115 --> 01:01:59,146
All good, all good.

1641
01:01:58,134 --> 01:02:02,113
Either you like carry on or you go fix

1642
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:02,113
it.

1643
01:01:59,147 --> 01:02:05,142
That's where the AIS have to get to,

1644
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:05,142
right?

1645
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,163
Daniel: Wow, so much.

1646
01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:15,240
One thought was, rap will be the last to

1647
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:15,240
fall and the first arise around that

1648
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:15,240
campfire again.

1649
01:02:07,168 --> 01:02:17,265
It'll arise situationally.

1650
01:02:15,242 --> 01:02:25,342
Baba: You mean after society descends

1651
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:25,342
into chaos and all the AIS are resting

1652
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:25,342
and we're back to Spears, rap will be the

1653
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:25,342
first to arise again.

1654
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:27,363
Daniel: First in, last out.

1655
01:02:25,346 --> 01:02:30,392
Baba: What was the next thing?

1656
01:02:29,382 --> 01:02:30,398
Daniel: Another thought?

1657
01:02:30,393 --> 01:02:32,415
You mentioned tastemakers.

1658
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:38,470
And I thought, what is the ultimate or

1659
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:38,470
even the proximate taste maker?

1660
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:39,488
It's our generative model of taste.

1661
01:02:38,471 --> 01:02:42,511
It's every person eating that dish.

1662
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:45,546
The tastemaker isn't who told them to go

1663
01:02:45,546 --> 01:02:45,546
to the restaurant.

1664
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:50,598
That's basically believing the hype and

1665
01:02:50,598 --> 01:02:50,598
using the paradigm of the advertising

1666
01:02:50,598 --> 01:02:50,598
industry.

1667
01:02:45,547 --> 01:02:53,624
The tastemaker is the taster.

1668
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,659
That's who is generating the experience

1669
01:02:56,659 --> 01:02:56,659
of taste.

1670
01:02:53,626 --> 01:03:04,679
Taste isn't just in the dish before it is

1671
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:04,679
actually eaten by that person, it's

1672
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:04,679
experienced.

1673
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:13,766
And they're going to have some previous

1674
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:13,766
taste in their mouth or they're going to

1675
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:13,766
have a context or a cultural

1676
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:13,766
understanding or a memory, a trigger.

1677
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:19,820
So the taste is generated authentically

1678
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:19,820
and situationally.

1679
01:03:13,768 --> 01:03:30,930
And yeah, there's going to be a lot of

1680
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:30,930
volatility as tastemaking becomes

1681
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:30,930
actually understood to be personalized.

1682
01:03:19,827 --> 01:03:37,999
And that may look like the personal

1683
01:03:37,999 --> 01:03:37,999
generation of media, which has not even

1684
01:03:37,999 --> 01:03:37,999
been plausible.

1685
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:45,081
When you had only 33 Rpm records, then

1686
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:45,081
you have somebody selecting which ones to

1687
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:45,081
distribute.

1688
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:50,133
But when you have algorithms, it takes it

1689
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:50,133
one level further which ones you like to

1690
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:50,133
listen to.

1691
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:52,153
People who like this also listen to

1692
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:52,153
that.

1693
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:58,217
And this is like, as far as we can see,

1694
01:03:58,217 --> 01:03:58,217
another level of like, you liked this.

1695
01:03:52,154 --> 01:04:03,209
We're going to regenerate that story so

1696
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:03,209
that the person's voice is like that.

1697
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:05,226
That takes it to the next level.

1698
01:04:04,211 --> 01:04:14,318
But also with enormous trade offs, it

1699
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:14,318
brings it closer to how things really

1700
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:14,318
are.

1701
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:24,413
Baba: Well, that makes me think of

1702
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:24,413
something we spoke on earlier, which is

1703
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:24,413
the degree to which cultural norms are

1704
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:24,413
able to reorganize or swim upstream

1705
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:24,413
against instincts.

1706
01:04:15,323 --> 01:04:24,417
Right.

1707
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:36,535
So when you say the taste maker is the

1708
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:36,535
taster, the counter examples that jump to

1709
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:36,535
mind are rappers who are like Jayz, where

1710
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:36,535
he's like and before this song ends, I'm

1711
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:36,535
going to start another trend.

1712
01:04:24,419 --> 01:04:44,612
If you want to say the tasters of the

1713
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:44,612
taste makers, I'm looking at people who

1714
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:44,612
merely suggest something is cool and it

1715
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:44,612
instantly becomes cool.

1716
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:53,707
And everybody is able to post hoc

1717
01:04:53,707 --> 01:04:53,707
rationalize reasons why it has intrinsic

1718
01:04:53,707 --> 01:04:53,707
qualities that they now recognize as

1719
01:04:53,707 --> 01:04:53,707
amazing over and above what the

1720
01:04:53,707 --> 01:04:53,707
tastemaker told them to do.

1721
01:04:44,613 --> 01:04:58,751
But we are highly susceptible primates to

1722
01:04:58,751 --> 01:04:58,751
cool factors.

1723
01:04:53,707 --> 01:05:00,716
And so I would suggest the taste maker.

1724
01:04:58,753 --> 01:05:01,728
Is not the taster.

1725
01:05:00,716 --> 01:05:06,779
The taste maker is the best predictor of

1726
01:05:06,779 --> 01:05:06,779
the average resonate of the tasters.

1727
01:05:01,728 --> 01:05:23,948
And when you get very, very good at

1728
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:23,948
understanding instinctively how people

1729
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:23,948
will react to the taste, using taste as a

1730
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:23,948
metaphor for all kinds of art, then

1731
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:23,948
you're able to be treated as

1732
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:23,948
authoritative on taste because you're

1733
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:23,948
right so often about what people will

1734
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:23,948
like.

1735
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:32,039
And that power of vested expertise from

1736
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:32,039
your fan base then allows you to start

1737
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:32,039
trends that are not just predictive.

1738
01:05:23,949 --> 01:05:50,215
You say something's great, and everybody

1739
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:50,215
instantly believes it's great and

1740
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:50,215
experiences it as great, as authentically

1741
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:50,215
as if they had discovered it for

1742
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:50,215
themselves and decided it was great

1743
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:50,215
because they've recognized your actual,

1744
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:50,215
real, vertical, average ability to

1745
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:50,215
predict taste across groups.

1746
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:52,234
Daniel: Awesome.

1747
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:55,268
I thought, okay, again, who's the taste

1748
01:05:55,268 --> 01:05:55,268
maker?

1749
01:05:52,235 --> 01:05:56,279
It's the chef.

1750
01:05:55,269 --> 01:06:14,393
And not everyone's in the kitchen,

1751
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:14,393
because a chef is in their position,

1752
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:14,393
because they've been recognized to

1753
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:14,393
repeatedly be able to construct dishes

1754
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:14,393
that in the local taste making diners

1755
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:14,393
like, or maybe just a few diners like.

1756
01:05:57,283 --> 01:06:15,401
And it's like, what?

1757
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:26,510
You can't do that with molecular

1758
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:26,510
gastronomy, but some so it's the chef and

1759
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:26,510
it's the social influence network, and

1760
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:26,510
it's local.

1761
01:06:15,402 --> 01:06:38,630
What framework can we use to think about

1762
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,630
all of these interactions within and

1763
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,630
among cognitive entities, within and

1764
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,630
among their niche?

1765
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:42,674
We use Active Inference as just a way of

1766
01:06:42,674 --> 01:06:42,674
thinking about it.

1767
01:06:38,634 --> 01:06:42,678
Well, what?

1768
01:06:42,675 --> 01:06:43,687
Active inference lab?

1769
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:47,723
It's there in the title Action and

1770
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:47,723
Inference.

1771
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:53,780
It's involving action and doing cognitive

1772
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:53,780
modeling.

1773
01:06:47,728 --> 01:07:09,883
And that gives us the composability and

1774
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:09,883
the ability to reconfigure and remix, to

1775
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:09,883
capture all of these diverse scenarios,

1776
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:09,883
not to close the book on them, but to be

1777
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:09,883
like, oh, wow, what an amazing question.

1778
01:06:53,782 --> 01:07:13,919
There's 50 PhDs of research that you

1779
01:07:13,919 --> 01:07:13,919
could go into.

1780
01:07:09,885 --> 01:07:28,071
So it's a question generator, and it's a

1781
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:28,071
lens by people who are even just

1782
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:28,071
beginning to learn it, who review

1783
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:28,071
phenomena that they've already been told

1784
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:28,071
or experienced in one light.

1785
01:07:13,923 --> 01:07:47,264
All of a sudden, they're seeing how it

1786
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:47,264
can be reconfigured, for example, seeing

1787
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:47,264
what we prefer in terms of what we expect

1788
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:47,264
rather than what we prefer in terms of

1789
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:47,264
what's rewarding, which is the reward

1790
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:47,264
learning reinforcement paradigm which

1791
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:47,264
proposes, well, maybe, you know, the

1792
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:47,264
value of different states and you're

1793
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:47,264
maximizing value.

1794
01:07:28,072 --> 01:08:12,452
It resonate with some contrast that with

1795
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
you have this complex generative model,

1796
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
and you're always referencing to it, and

1797
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
you're taking actions and learning to

1798
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
reduce your surprise bound, your surprise

1799
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
of certain kinds, which could include

1800
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
increasing your narrative surprise, and

1801
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
you want that page turner or the horror

1802
01:08:12,452 --> 01:08:12,452
film.

1803
01:07:47,266 --> 01:08:15,487
So it just kind of reflects back.

1804
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:28,619
And then one last point on Active

1805
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:28,619
Inference as a research direction that

1806
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:28,619
the nursery to hear your thoughts on is

1807
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:28,619
it is happening in a time that has never

1808
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:28,619
been seen before in research and

1809
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:28,619
academia.

1810
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:36,692
So you said there are certain careers or

1811
01:08:36,692 --> 01:08:36,692
genres where there's no back door to

1812
01:08:36,692 --> 01:08:36,692
success, and then you said in Rap,

1813
01:08:36,692 --> 01:08:36,692
there's no front door.

1814
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:50,831
So traditionally, even if we could say

1815
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:50,831
there was no back door to success in

1816
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:50,831
research, the reality is there was a side

1817
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:50,831
door, and people were getting kicked out

1818
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:50,831
and being brought into the party through

1819
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:50,831
the side door, and a bunch of people were

1820
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:50,831
waiting at the front door.

1821
01:08:36,693 --> 01:08:53,861
They didn't even know that the show was

1822
01:08:53,861 --> 01:08:53,861
not happening that way.

1823
01:08:50,832 --> 01:09:03,902
We're developing a framework in community

1824
01:09:03,902 --> 01:09:03,902
at the speed of preprints ActInf

1825
01:09:03,902 --> 01:09:03,902
Livestream.

1826
01:08:53,868 --> 01:09:12,997
And so there's transdisciplinary

1827
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:12,997
collaborations with philosophy,

1828
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:12,997
historians of science, cognitivist,

1829
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:12,997
researchers, mathematicians, physicists.

1830
01:09:03,904 --> 01:09:29,165
So there's a transdisciplinary

1831
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:29,165
conversation and one with practitioners

1832
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:29,165
and one that's happening with everybody

1833
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:29,165
with view access to some large parts of

1834
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:29,165
it, which wasn't even the case

1835
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:29,165
previously.

1836
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:32,197
Open science and research was like, break

1837
01:09:32,197 --> 01:09:32,197
down the paywalls.

1838
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:53,400
Everybody should have access to the PDFs,

1839
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,400
which is great, but it turns out that

1840
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,400
having access to 200,000 PDFs, having

1841
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,400
access to every single PDF that Karl

1842
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,400
Friston has ever been an author on, it's

1843
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,400
not even going to take you 10% of the way

1844
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,400
unless you're going to engage in this

1845
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:53,400
total monastic life to unpack them.

1846
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:57,446
And the details aren't even in what's

1847
01:09:57,446 --> 01:09:57,446
necessarily those papers.

1848
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:58,453
It's beyond that.

1849
01:09:57,446 --> 01:10:01,423
It's in the community, it's in the

1850
01:10:01,423 --> 01:10:01,423
software, in the inaction.

1851
01:09:58,453 --> 01:10:05,461
So, of course, wait and see.

1852
01:10:01,424 --> 01:10:38,799
But there's so much with the way that

1853
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
active inference is developing on the

1854
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
influence of previous frameworks Bayesian

1855
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
brain and Bayesian statistics, causal

1856
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
inference, statistical physics happening

1857
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
in this sort of wrapping in front of the

1858
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
crowd way asynchronously with the

1859
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
preprints synchronously with remote

1860
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
presentations and recordings, that it's

1861
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
hard to think of another area that has

1862
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:38,799
had that kind of a developmental niche.

1863
01:10:05,463 --> 01:10:42,839
Baba: You're saying active inference is

1864
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:42,839
the hip hop of the scientific community?

1865
01:10:39,805 --> 01:10:45,868
Daniel: Basically, you said it, not me.

1866
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:47,882
Baba: Live on the mic.

1867
01:10:46,869 --> 01:10:48,891
I love it.

1868
01:10:47,884 --> 01:10:48,894
Yeah.

1869
01:10:48,892 --> 01:10:51,919
And I think it's super exciting.

1870
01:10:48,894 --> 01:10:57,979
Research and collaboration happening, and

1871
01:10:57,979 --> 01:10:57,979
it's very unknown to the public.

1872
01:10:51,920 --> 01:11:19,148
If you try to explain what this

1873
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:19,148
conversation is about, people understand

1874
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:19,148
the idea of expectation and priors and

1875
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:19,148
belief upgrading, the very sort of basic

1876
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:19,148
version of the Bayesian algorithm, but

1877
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:19,148
all the applications of it and the cross

1878
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:19,148
disciplinary side and everything, it

1879
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:19,148
needs more science communication.

1880
01:10:57,981 --> 01:11:22,174
I've made two Bayesian songs.

1881
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:24,191
I think I need to make 20 more.

1882
01:11:22,175 --> 01:11:44,397
Because the applications of the research

1883
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:44,397
are vast, and especially in the AI era,

1884
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:44,397
people really need to know what these

1885
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:44,397
algorithms are achieving and the ways in

1886
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:44,397
which they are similar or different to

1887
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:44,397
our own cognitive processes and what we

1888
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:44,397
can expect them to achieve and how we can

1889
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:44,397
expect them to help and what they're

1890
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:44,397
threatening.

1891
01:11:24,192 --> 01:11:47,427
All that stuff goes through active

1892
01:11:47,427 --> 01:11:47,427
inference, doesn't it?

1893
01:11:44,397 --> 01:11:49,448
Daniel: Awesome.

1894
01:11:49,442 --> 01:11:57,526
Well, in our kind of closing segments,

1895
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:57,526
would you like to do something musical or

1896
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:57,526
how do you want to proceed?

1897
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:59,545
Baba: Yes, indeed, I'd love to.

1898
01:11:57,528 --> 01:12:09,584
I'm very happy to do a demonstration of

1899
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:09,584
one of the last art forms that AI is not

1900
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:09,584
yet able to model and that is a freestyle

1901
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:09,584
wrap.

1902
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:14,631
So if we have anybody watching on the

1903
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:14,631
stream or Daniel, you're welcome to do it

1904
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:14,631
as well.

1905
01:12:09,585 --> 01:12:25,740
If you want to pop some phrases into the

1906
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:25,740
text, I will look at the text that you're

1907
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:25,740
displaying and also look at the comments

1908
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:25,740
and the chats on YouTube.

1909
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:39,883
And anything that I see pop up, I will

1910
01:12:39,883 --> 01:12:39,883
visually process and convert into rhymes

1911
01:12:39,883 --> 01:12:39,883
in a freestyle rap track just to give a

1912
01:12:39,883 --> 01:12:39,883
little insight into this process.

1913
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:44,937
It is a violation and.

1914
01:12:42,912 --> 01:12:50,991
Baba rapping: Expectation setting.

1915
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:52,010
Baba: And expectation violating process.

1916
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:52,016
Right.

1917
01:12:52,011 --> 01:12:59,089
Like the active listener to a freestyle

1918
01:12:59,089 --> 01:12:59,089
rap is trying to figure out the semantics

1919
01:12:59,089 --> 01:12:59,089
and figure out where the rap is going to

1920
01:12:59,089 --> 01:12:59,089
go.

1921
01:12:52,016 --> 01:13:11,145
And the rapper is also in real time

1922
01:13:11,145 --> 01:13:11,145
figuring out the semantics because it's

1923
01:13:11,145 --> 01:13:11,145
completely unscripted, but it's at the

1924
01:13:11,145 --> 01:13:11,145
same time trying to set up expectations

1925
01:13:11,145 --> 01:13:11,145
of the audience and violate them.

1926
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:16,190
I think a lot of the fun is the surprise

1927
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:16,190
factor of like, oh, I didn't expect him

1928
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:16,190
to go there.

1929
01:13:11,146 --> 01:13:22,255
I thought he was going to go there, but

1930
01:13:22,255 --> 01:13:22,255
oh, now I see it's kind of like a game of

1931
01:13:22,255 --> 01:13:22,255
chase, like the rabbit and the fox.

1932
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:29,320
So I see Sean Kelly's, drop Topology in

1933
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:29,320
the chat of YouTube.

1934
01:13:22,257 --> 01:13:32,351
I'm going to start there and I'm going to

1935
01:13:32,351 --> 01:13:32,351
kick a little rap for you guys.

1936
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:46,493
Baba rapping: This is hip hop, tell me

1937
01:13:46,493 --> 01:13:46,493
what you think this is.

1938
01:13:43,463 --> 01:13:47,505
It's Barbara Brinkman rock.

1939
01:13:46,494 --> 01:13:49,522
And now an active infrared.

1940
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:51,542
That's the infrared looking for.

1941
01:13:49,523 --> 01:13:55,581
Where info is, I don't know, but I feel

1942
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:55,581
it's kind of intimate.

1943
01:13:51,542 --> 01:13:56,597
Yes, indeed, hip hop.

1944
01:13:55,582 --> 01:14:01,588
What you think this is, is Bubba Brinklin

1945
01:14:01,588 --> 01:14:01,588
here on the active infraring podcast.

1946
01:13:56,598 --> 01:14:08,654
I'm looking for where the info is so I

1947
01:14:08,654 --> 01:14:08,654
could update my priors and get into it

1948
01:14:08,654 --> 01:14:08,654
and maybe drop a beat.

1949
01:14:01,589 --> 01:14:10,673
Sean Kelly said topology.

1950
01:14:08,655 --> 01:14:12,699
Yes, right now I'm rocking hip hopology.

1951
01:14:10,675 --> 01:14:14,714
Can't you even see that's?

1952
01:14:13,701 --> 01:14:16,738
How I just abuse in trouble topology.

1953
01:14:14,714 --> 01:14:22,791
That means checking all the levels and

1954
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:22,791
looking for the map and the different

1955
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:22,791
levels of impact.

1956
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:23,801
I'm spitting rap.

1957
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,816
Yes, I'm looking at the chat.

1958
01:14:23,802 --> 01:14:28,850
That's how I kick it, yes, how I go with

1959
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:28,850
rap and flows.

1960
01:14:24,817 --> 01:14:30,870
It is me kicking it with Mr.

1961
01:14:28,851 --> 01:14:31,882
Danielle Freedman.

1962
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:31,889
How I'm speaking.

1963
01:14:31,883 --> 01:14:34,917
Yes, I'm always just deleting variants

1964
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:34,917
every time.

1965
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:37,940
I'm sometimes just weekend through the

1966
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:37,940
speakers.

1967
01:14:34,918 --> 01:14:39,961
I just do this on a Tuesday or a week.

1968
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:42,993
And indeed, active inference is how I'm

1969
01:14:42,993 --> 01:14:42,993
speaking.

1970
01:14:39,961 --> 01:14:47,049
I'm sneaking past all your expectations

1971
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:47,049
like a Rhett and amaze because my raps

1972
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:47,049
will amaze.

1973
01:14:42,994 --> 01:14:50,079
And yes, I'm doing polysyllabic to

1974
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:50,079
amaze.

1975
01:14:48,049 --> 01:14:52,092
I'm just having to blaze.

1976
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:59,168
Yes, I'm actively playing all the

1977
01:14:59,168 --> 01:14:59,168
different rhymes on my brain like a

1978
01:14:59,168 --> 01:14:59,168
piano, changing the channels like I'm

1979
01:14:59,168 --> 01:14:59,168
rocking ganks at Tony Soprano.

1980
01:14:52,093 --> 01:15:01,120
Yeah, that's okay.

1981
01:14:59,169 --> 01:15:05,166
This is how I just anger the listeners

1982
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:05,166
sometimes because raps are danger.

1983
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:10,210
Got to give a shout out to Tucker Cat

1984
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:10,210
Hill Chambers who rocked this with us.

1985
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:14,255
Yes, working the angles like Base theorem

1986
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:14,255
can you even hear them when I'm near

1987
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:14,255
them.

1988
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:20,311
I start to see it as this math scientific

1989
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:20,311
theorem that I could apply to every

1990
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:20,311
single thing.

1991
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:22,339
As Barbara Brinkman gets all your neurons

1992
01:15:22,339 --> 01:15:22,339
jingling.

1993
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:24,356
It's how I attacked it.

1994
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,365
I attracted.

1995
01:15:24,357 --> 01:15:26,372
I'm massive.

1996
01:15:25,365 --> 01:15:27,387
I'm active when I'm doing.

1997
01:15:26,372 --> 01:15:37,488
Inference in my rap and indeed this is

1998
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:37,488
how I kick it when I enter my rap is

1999
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:37,488
directed it's never non censored as I

2000
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:37,488
just try to construct it mistakes I

2001
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:37,488
make?

2002
01:15:27,387 --> 01:15:44,550
Sometimes I'm run DMC and sometimes I'm

2003
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:44,550
drake except I'm not quite as good of a

2004
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:44,550
singer with the melodies.

2005
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:57,688
But then again, I've got the free steve's

2006
01:15:57,688 --> 01:15:57,688
that kick a lot active inference lab,

2007
01:15:57,688 --> 01:15:57,688
Bayesian styles, freestyles that's trying

2008
01:15:57,688 --> 01:15:57,688
to make the people smile as they listen

2009
01:15:57,688 --> 01:15:57,688
in yes, that's how I'm straight rock and

2010
01:15:57,688 --> 01:15:57,688
even Ahmad Mostafi says yo wow.

2011
01:15:44,551 --> 01:16:09,741
Awesome with explosion emojis baba

2012
01:16:09,741 --> 01:16:09,741
Brinkman coming with the dope beats

2013
01:16:09,741 --> 01:16:09,741
people are like, hopefully he's one of

2014
01:16:09,741 --> 01:16:09,741
those MCs becca rock straight up as

2015
01:16:09,741 --> 01:16:09,741
ancient hip hop like rock him and Eric

2016
01:16:09,741 --> 01:16:09,741
B.

2017
01:15:57,688 --> 01:16:10,756
I never do it terribly.

2018
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:11,768
I just freestyle.

2019
01:16:10,756 --> 01:16:14,794
That is improv, which means it's

2020
01:16:14,794 --> 01:16:14,794
spontaneous.

2021
01:16:11,769 --> 01:16:29,945
My style is the Zania some repping for

2022
01:16:29,945 --> 01:16:29,945
the Long Islanders plus the Canadians

2023
01:16:29,945 --> 01:16:29,945
people listen and blow their brains when

2024
01:16:29,945 --> 01:16:29,945
I'm blazing it yeah, that's how it goes

2025
01:16:29,945 --> 01:16:29,945
when I'm speaking on the basics I'm in

2026
01:16:29,945 --> 01:16:29,945
Long Island, but Daniel he's up in Davis,

2027
01:16:29,945 --> 01:16:29,945
California I put it on you.

2028
01:16:14,795 --> 01:16:31,967
It's act of inference boba Brickman.

2029
01:16:29,946 --> 01:16:35,002
When I'm speaking it, I'm getting into it

2030
01:16:35,002 --> 01:16:35,002
looking for where the info is.

2031
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:36,014
That's how I'm rocking.

2032
01:16:35,003 --> 01:16:40,051
This was like a four minute continuous

2033
01:16:40,051 --> 01:16:40,051
talk and demonstration.

2034
01:16:36,015 --> 01:16:41,060
Yes, indeed.

2035
01:16:40,052 --> 01:16:41,069
I'll make it easy.

2036
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:45,100
Let's say you do this shit chat Gpt-3.

2037
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:46,110
You can't do it.

2038
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:51,162
You can't freestyle over this music and

2039
01:16:51,162 --> 01:16:51,162
use a brain to actively infer that's so

2040
01:16:51,162 --> 01:16:51,162
fluid.

2041
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:58,231
Yes, that's a rap that I make up and

2042
01:16:58,231 --> 01:16:58,231
invent the last four minutes has been an

2043
01:16:58,231 --> 01:16:58,231
event prescribed in the time.

2044
01:16:51,163 --> 01:17:01,202
That's the freestyle wrap that I did on

2045
01:17:01,202 --> 01:17:01,202
this concept.

2046
01:16:58,232 --> 01:17:02,216
That's how I can adapt.

2047
01:17:01,202 --> 01:17:05,245
Yes, indeed, that's a rhyme that I had to

2048
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:05,245
make.

2049
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:06,254
I can do this.

2050
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:08,275
My brain makes me a primate.

2051
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:09,289
But I don't make mistakes.

2052
01:17:08,275 --> 01:17:12,319
Okay, sometimes I do, but that's just

2053
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:12,319
mutation.

2054
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:16,352
Yes, that's how I move all the mistakes

2055
01:17:16,352 --> 01:17:16,352
get integrated.

2056
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:17,364
Baba: My work is huge.

2057
01:17:16,353 --> 01:17:18,378
Baba rapping: Thank you, Ahmad.

2058
01:17:17,365 --> 01:17:19,384
Mustafi.

2059
01:17:18,378 --> 01:17:20,399
I appreciate you.

2060
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:23,421
Okay, now I'm starting to wind down.

2061
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,437
Baba: And trying to just find a new.

2062
01:17:23,422 --> 01:17:26,455
Baba rapping: Direction for the rhyme

2063
01:17:26,455 --> 01:17:26,455
sound.

2064
01:17:24,438 --> 01:17:28,477
This is how I just get into it.

2065
01:17:26,456 --> 01:17:33,521
It's Baba Brickman rockin with active

2066
01:17:33,521 --> 01:17:33,521
infrareds, active infraring.

2067
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:35,542
This is how I'm never pretending I'm.

2068
01:17:33,522 --> 01:17:37,561
Baba: Trying to infer some way for the.

2069
01:17:35,543 --> 01:17:39,580
Baba rapping: Rap ending, but wait a

2070
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:39,580
second.

2071
01:17:37,561 --> 01:17:40,592
This is how I do it.

2072
01:17:39,581 --> 01:17:40,598
Hip hop.

2073
01:17:40,592 --> 01:17:44,633
Baba: The easiest solution is just turn

2074
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:44,633
the music off, bra.

2075
01:17:40,598 --> 01:17:50,690
All right, that's freestyle rap.

2076
01:17:47,659 --> 01:17:52,711
And I really appreciated this chat.

2077
01:17:50,691 --> 01:17:54,735
It was a ton of fun and super

2078
01:17:54,735 --> 01:17:54,735
interesting.

2079
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:59,787
Daniel: I'll give a closing remark and

2080
01:17:59,787 --> 01:17:59,787
then any last words from you?

2081
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:10,835
It brought a smile and a laugh to my face

2082
01:18:10,835 --> 01:18:10,835
and body because another individual was

2083
01:18:10,835 --> 01:18:10,835
engaging in the shared moment.

2084
01:18:00,738 --> 01:18:23,962
I've seen language models output

2085
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:23,962
incredible X in the style of Y, and every

2086
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:23,962
single time it brings a chuckle or less

2087
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:23,962
and it's like, okay, I kind of expected

2088
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:23,962
it to do that.

2089
01:18:10,839 --> 01:18:32,005
I'm disappointed if it can't fulfill my

2090
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:32,005
request because it's like, Well, I asked

2091
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:32,005
you this because I expected you to do

2092
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:32,005
that.

2093
01:18:24,972 --> 01:18:46,019
When there's joyful, spontaneous

2094
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:46,019
engagement that is reflective of a shared

2095
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:46,019
experience, it's the real thing.

2096
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:54,027
And when that lens is applied, it's going

2097
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
to be real recognizing real.

2098
01:18:46,019 --> 01:19:00,027
And I don't think humans will be out of a

2099
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:00,027
relationship role for each other for a

2100
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:00,027
long, long time.

2101
01:18:54,027 --> 01:19:02,029
Baba: Amen to that.

2102
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:22,049
And I just want to say that the phrase

2103
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:22,049
that you just coined joyful, spontaneous

2104
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:22,049
experience, that's joyful, spontaneous

2105
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:22,049
engagement that's reflective of a shared

2106
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:22,049
experience that is basically the entire

2107
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:22,049
value proposition of my event rap company

2108
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:22,049
is Find.

2109
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:31,058
A topic or an event or something that

2110
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:31,058
creates collective attention of a group

2111
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:31,058
and have that be the locust and the

2112
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:31,058
catalyst of a rap.

2113
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:48,075
Because the rap game is entirely

2114
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:48,075
predicated on make a thing that is very

2115
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:48,075
widely appreciated and goes viral and is

2116
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:48,075
hugely massive and making general purpose

2117
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:48,075
art is what most rappers are focusing

2118
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:48,075
on.

2119
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:59,086
And I really thought it would be

2120
01:19:59,086 --> 01:19:59,086
interesting to apply a rapper skill to

2121
01:19:59,086 --> 01:19:59,086
this joyful, shared experience and

2122
01:19:59,086 --> 01:19:59,086
spontaneity challenge, and thank you for

2123
01:19:59,086 --> 01:19:59,086
giving me a platform for it.

2124
01:19:48,075 --> 01:20:14,095
And I hope your audience will now imagine

2125
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:14,095
every other possible application of a

2126
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:14,095
shared experience that a rapper could add

2127
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:14,095
value to, because if such things occur,

2128
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:14,095
then my business will succeed and lots of

2129
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:14,095
rappers will get lots of gigs wrapping in

2130
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:14,095
weird places like this.

2131
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:19,100
And I think that would add to the joyful

2132
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:19,100
variety of the world and the genre.

2133
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:20,101
Daniel: Amazing.

2134
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:23,103
So thank you so much, Baba.

2135
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:24,105
Always welcome to come back.

2136
01:20:23,104 --> 01:20:28,109
Give us updates when that wrap guide to

2137
01:20:28,109 --> 01:20:28,109
active inference drops.

2138
01:20:25,105 --> 01:20:30,111
Baba: All right, I'm on it.

2139
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:31,112
I'm on it.

2140
01:20:30,111 --> 01:20:31,112
Daniel: Thank you.

2141
01:20:31,112 --> 01:20:32,113
Baba: Thanks, Daniel.

2142
01:20:31,112 --> 01:20:32,113
Daniel: Peace.
