330	775490	00:00	Presentation followed by discussion on geometric constraints on human brain function by James Pang and Alex Fornito. Key motivating factor is trying to understand how the structure or anatomy of the brain constrains its function.

One of the people in the team asked Chat GPT to explain eigenmodes to a ten year old.	Eigen modes can be used to reconstruct any spatial pattern in the brain	Eigenmodes in the brain
1277050	1824770	21:17	An alternative approach has emerged out of neural field theory. Instead of dividing the brain into discrete specialized areas or nodes, we can treat the cortex as a continuous sheep. We are trying to capture how patterns of brain activity propagate through that continuous sheet. The eigen modes that we should be extracting are those derived from the geometry of the brain.

1826970	2641750	30:26	We're trying to answer and test the theory on which modes of the brain could best describe activity measured in FMI. We also analyze data from what we call neural vault. Each map was acquired with distinct experimental protocols. The level of heterogeneity in the different tasks is quite remarkable.	How do we measure modes of brain activity using FMI data	Geometric and connector modes in the brain
2642330	3661630	44:02	Most of the power is contained within about 50 modes. These long wavelength modes are really important and they describe the important structure found in activation maps from FMI data. We compare that with a more sophisticated neuromasses model that relies on the connector.	Traditional approach to brain map mapping is to threshold these maps	Brain map mapping with thresholding
3664630	3882490	1:01:04	The approach we put forward in this paper emphasizes the role of geometry and it does have connectivity embedded in that model. The idea behind this work was to test in a way between these two approaches and see which one's approximations were more useful.	When you present this in a neuroscience setting, what's a common response or reaction	Inventing the brain with active inference
3883340	4133450	1:04:43	A lot of the connections are local. Distal connections really do matter as the Jello sets and things change. The effects of this localized connectivity probably dominates a lot of what we see there FMI. Time will tell if we improve the ways we capture brain activity with OpenAI.	A lot of the connections are local. So it is really a question about what is being captured	Functional connectivity and the EDR
4136510	4265860	1:08:56	Dean: Is there any difference between something that happens interoceptively and something that's simply coming from within system? Could be that the underlying principle could be extended in such a way that you could potentially distinguish between interreceptive and extra receptive inputs.	Dean, can I ask about the metaphor of spoon tapping on the cello	External perturbations on the brain
4267030	4442250	1:11:07	Can you still have these sort of same waves going through the brain because other sensory uptake is causing that same you get a surprising feeling. How do the top down predictions and the bottom up sensory input get reconciled between the interactions of these waves? I think these are kind of really interesting ways forward.	You must have known I was going to ask next thing because that was the direction	Inference 6, Sensory attenuation
4442910	4942660	1:14:02	Daniel: Is it possible to detect modes in your analysis where there's an effect locally and then there's like a tunnel and there's a region that the wave doesn't appear to pass through? Does any of this speak also to sort of the tunneling effects of that eigenvalue or eigenmode quantum piece?	Dean: There's some standing wave in the physical water pool	Quantum tunneling and the standing wave
4945240	5149080	1:22:25	There's a few different ways that we're interested in progressing it. One is trying to reconcile this purely geometric approach with connectivity. We're also interested in taking this forward to leverage these approaches for thinking about different ways to map brain changes in different disorders or variations across species.	Dean: There are a few ways that we're interested in progressing this work	End of the talk
