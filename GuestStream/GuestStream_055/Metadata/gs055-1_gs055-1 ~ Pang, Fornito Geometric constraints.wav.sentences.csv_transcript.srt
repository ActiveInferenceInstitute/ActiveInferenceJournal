00:00:02,448 --> 00:00:04,010
Daniel: Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:06,513
This is Active Inference guest stream

3
00:00:06,513 --> 00:00:07,351
number 55.1.

4
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:10,111
It's August 30, 2023.

5
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:13,425
Today we are going to have a presentation

6
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:13,425
followed by a discussion on geometric

7
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:13,425
constraints on human brain function by

8
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:20,189
James Pang and Alex Fornito.

9
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:24,532
Thank you again for joining.

10
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:26,714
Really looking forward to the

11
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:27,859
presentation and the discussion.

12
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:29,081
So please off to you two to introduce

13
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:32,311
yourself and continue however you like.

14
00:00:32,318 --> 00:00:33,396
Thank you.

15
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:35,663
Alex: Well, thanks very much, Daniel.

16
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:37,835
My name is Alex Fornito.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,102
I'm based in the School of Psychological

18
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:40,102
Sciences and Turn Institute for Brain and

19
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:40,102
Mental Health at Monash University, and

20
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:40,102
James Penn, who is a research fellow

21
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:49,021
working in the team.

22
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:52,330
And so the idea today was that we were

23
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:52,330
going to talk a little bit about this

24
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,627
work.

25
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:58,894
I'll begin by providing a bit of a

26
00:00:58,894 --> 00:00:58,894
historical and theoretical background and

27
00:00:58,894 --> 00:00:58,894
then James will take over and jump into

28
00:00:58,894 --> 00:00:58,894
the specifics of what we did and what we

29
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:07,285
found.

30
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,731
We're assuming some basic understanding

31
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:12,731
of neuroscience and some elements of

32
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:12,731
human brain imaging and we'll go through

33
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:12,731
a little bit of maths, but hopefully it'

34
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:12,731
'll be enough to give a picture and if

35
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:12,731
there's any questions about it afterwards,

36
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:27,205
, we'll be happy to try and answer them.

37
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:31,618
So a key motivating factor for this work

38
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:31,618
is really trying to understand how the

39
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:31,618
structure or anatomy of the brain

40
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:38,321
constrains its function.

41
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:40,562
And if you look at a diverse range of

42
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:40,562
systems found throughout nature, we know

43
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:40,562
that the structure of the system can

44
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:46,016
change its dynamics.

45
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:50,051
So, for example, the shape of a racing

46
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:50,051
car will influence its aerodynamics and

47
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:55,106
how fast it can go.

48
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:59,140
The folding patterns of a protein will

49
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,140
influence the other proteins that it can

50
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,140
interact with and have quite large

51
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,141
effects.

52
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,166
So here, for example, we've got example

53
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:07,166
of the hemoglobin protein in a healthy

54
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:07,166
person and someone with sickle cell

55
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:13,219
anemia.

56
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,240
And this change in the geometry of the

57
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,240
protein leads to a 20 year difference in

58
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,271
life expectancy.

59
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:21,308
And here we've got the molecular

60
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,335
structures of diamond and graphite.

61
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:28,369
So both of these materials are made of

62
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:29,383
the same atoms.

63
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,399
They're all purely carbon atoms.

64
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:33,421
It's just the bonds between them that are

65
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:33,426
different.

66
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:36,453
And that difference is sufficient to

67
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:36,453
create quite a variation in the

68
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:40,495
properties of the material.

69
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,518
So diamond being one of the hardest

70
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:42,518
substances on Earth and valued at

71
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:42,518
somewhere between twelve to $90 million

72
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:42,518
per kilo, whereas graphite is one of the

73
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:42,518
most brittle and only costs you about $20

74
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:53,621
per kilo.

75
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:56,651
And so this is essentially the reason why

76
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:56,651
we don't propose to people with H two B

77
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:01,645
pencil, we use diamond rings instead.

78
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,689
Now, the brain is no different.

79
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,710
We think anatomy constraints function,

80
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,710
but there has been a long standing debate

81
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,710
about the specific properties that are

82
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,710
the most relevant and how we should best

83
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:15,787
conceptualize them.

84
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:18,810
And this can be traced back to the days

85
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:18,810
of Ramani Kahal and Camilla Golgi, two

86
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:18,810
people considered to be some of the

87
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:18,810
founding fathers of modern neuroscience,

88
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:18,810
golgi developed a technique for staining

89
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:18,810
neurons that allowed you to visualize

90
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:31,945
their structure under the microscope.

91
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:34,973
And Cahal really perfected that technique

92
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:34,973
and studied the nervous system in

93
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:34,973
extensive detail and really laid down the

94
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:34,973
foundations for what we think about the

95
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:44,072
anatomy of the brain to this day.

96
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,108
Now, both of these men were recognized

97
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:47,108
for their efforts in 1906 with a Nobel

98
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:51,139
prize.

99
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,167
But even at the award ceremony, when

100
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:53,167
giving their lectures, they were in

101
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:57,208
bitter disagreement.

102
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,179
So if you actually look at the recordings

103
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:00,179
of their lectures, cahal says, we applied

104
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:00,179
Golgi's method, and our observations

105
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:00,179
revealed, in my opinion, the terminal

106
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:11,284
arrangement of the nerve fibers.

107
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,304
Nerve elements possess reciprocal

108
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:13,304
relationships in continuity, but not in

109
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:16,334
continuity.

110
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,359
So here he's saying that cells are

111
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:18,359
fundamentally discrete elements separated

112
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:18,359
in physical space and that there's a gap

113
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:26,436
between them at the synapse.

114
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:29,464
The synaptic cleft and signaling occurs

115
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:30,476
through this gap.

116
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:34,515
Olga, on the other hand, didn't agree.

117
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,536
He said, while I admire the brilliancy of

118
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:36,536
the doctrine, which is a worthy product

119
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:36,536
of the high intellect of my illustrious

120
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:36,536
Spanish colleague, I cannot agree with

121
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:36,536
him on some points of an anatomical

122
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:36,536
nature, which are for the theory of

123
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:46,637
fundamental importance.

124
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,659
I found myself unable to follow the

125
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:48,659
current of opinion because I was

126
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:48,659
confronted by one concrete anatomical

127
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:53,704
fact.

128
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:55,729
This was the existence of the formation,

129
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:55,729
which I have called the diffuse nerve

130
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,756
network.

131
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,727
And so, for Golgi, all the cells were

132
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:02,735
continuous.

133
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,755
They form one continuous network.

134
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:07,784
There was no point of separation between

135
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:07,784
them, and signaling occurred through this

136
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:11,828
continuous network.

137
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:16,872
Now, ultimately, a growing body of

138
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:16,872
evidence, and you can see it in Golgi's

139
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:16,872
statements, was starting to favor Cahal's

140
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:24,949
model.

141
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,977
But really, it was only resolved in the

142
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:26,977
1940s with the advent of electron

143
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:26,977
microscopy, where people could actually

144
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:26,977
resolve synapses and saw that they were

145
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:35,064
spatially disjoint.

146
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,090
And this ultimately established the

147
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,090
neuron doctrine as the fundamental theory

148
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,090
about how the nerve, the system is

149
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:44,158
organized at a cellular level.

150
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:49,203
And this basic idea that we can divide

151
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:49,203
the brain up into discrete units was then

152
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:49,203
carried through to different scales, most

153
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:49,203
famously by Corbinian Broadman, who

154
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:49,203
developed a parcellation of the cortex

155
00:05:49,203 --> 00:06:04,291
based on cyto architectonic grounds.

156
00:06:04,293 --> 00:06:07,320
His idea was that different parts of the

157
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,320
cortex have different cellular properties,

158
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,320
, and so they define these discrete areas

159
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,320
that are functionally specialized in some

160
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:16,410
way.

161
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:19,449
And certainly this has been a very

162
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:19,449
influential idea in neuroscience ever

163
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,477
since.

164
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,506
But around the same time, in fact, a

165
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:25,506
couple of years earlier, the neurologist

166
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:25,506
Alfred Campbell published his own

167
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:25,506
cytoacyctonic map, and he agreed that you

168
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:25,506
could identify discrete boundaries

169
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:25,506
largely in primary zones, but then in the

170
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:25,506
cortex in between, it was a lot more

171
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:25,506
difficult to find sharp outlines or

172
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:46,711
boundaries.

173
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:48,736
And he suggested that actually the

174
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:48,736
changes were more gradual or continuous

175
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:52,771
in nature.

176
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:57,820
Broadman's view became more popular and

177
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:57,820
certainly became sort of the dominant

178
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:57,820
theory in neuroscience, even though

179
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:57,820
subsequent attempts to try to replicate

180
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:06,855
it were different.

181
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:08,871
And so different anatomists would

182
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:08,871
parcelate the brain in different ways,

183
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,908
using different boundaries and so on.

184
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,942
But nonetheless, this kind of congruence

185
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:15,942
between the discrete model of cahal and

186
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:15,942
discrete model of Broadman eventually led

187
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:15,942
to the idea that essentially we can think

188
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:15,942
about the brain as a multiscale network

189
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:15,942
where at the cellular level we can

190
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:15,942
identify discrete cells that are

191
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:31,107
connected by synapses.

192
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:34,130
Then we can scale up at the population

193
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,130
level at a mesoscale resolution and

194
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,130
identify how population of cells are

195
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,130
linked by bundles of axons and then all

196
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,130
the way through to the macro scales,

197
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,130
which is what you sort of see when you

198
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:46,256
look at one of Broadman's maps.

199
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:49,281
You have these broad, roughly so

200
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:49,281
architectonic areas connected by white

201
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:53,325
matter bundles.

202
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:58,375
And in the last two or so decades we've

203
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:58,375
had the measurement techniques for

204
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:58,375
characterizing these networks on a vast

205
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:58,375
scale and there's been a pretty well

206
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:58,375
established pipeline for mapping these

207
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:11,445
networks.

208
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:13,467
So the basic idea is that we have the

209
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:13,467
brain, we divide it up into these

210
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:13,467
discrete areas and they act as our

211
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:18,515
network nodes.

212
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:20,533
And then for every pair of nodes we

213
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:20,533
measure some aspect of structural or

214
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,570
functional connectivity between them.

215
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,593
Functional connectivity being some aspect

216
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:27,606
of coupling in activity.

217
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,631
And then we can represent that in the

218
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:31,648
form of a connectivity matrix.

219
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:33,669
So each row and column represents a

220
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:33,669
different region and each element tells

221
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:33,669
you about the type and strength of

222
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:33,669
connectivity between areas that can

223
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:42,752
equivalently be represented as a graph.

224
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:44,774
And then with that graph representation,

225
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:44,774
we can apply all sorts of different

226
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:44,774
analytic tools to understand different

227
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:44,774
aspects about how the network is

228
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:51,845
connected and organized.

229
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:54,878
And this basic approach has been used

230
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:54,878
quite extensively to understand how the

231
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:54,878
underlying anatomical properties of the

232
00:08:54,878 --> 00:09:00,879
network constrain function.

233
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:02,898
This is one of my favorite examples.

234
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,925
This was a study of two different worms,

235
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:07,945
c Elegance and P Pacificus.

236
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,966
Both of their nervous systems in the head

237
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:09,966
have been mapped at the level of each

238
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:09,966
cell and synapse and they're actually

239
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,004
identical.

240
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:15,023
So they've got the same type of cells,

241
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:15,023
the same number of cells, it's just the

242
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:15,023
connectivity between them that's

243
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:19,065
different.

244
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:21,081
And that's what you see in this network

245
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:21,081
projection here that the topology of the

246
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,107
network is different.

247
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:26,132
And in this study they showed that

248
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:26,132
changes in the connectivity of just two

249
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:26,132
hub neurons were sufficient to elicit a

250
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:26,132
difference in the behavior of the animals,

251
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:26,132
, such that P Pacificus is a predator of

252
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:38,251
sea elegance.

253
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,273
And here you can see Pacificus eating

254
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:42,291
poor sea elegance for lunch.

255
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:46,330
Now, we can't lock humans up in a room

256
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:46,330
and see who eats who and try to

257
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:46,330
understand how their anatomy constraints

258
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,385
function in that way.

259
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:53,408
But we can do things like use MRI to

260
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:53,408
measure anatomical connectivity and

261
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:53,408
functional connectivity and correlate the

262
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:59,459
two.

263
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,419
And it's pretty consistent finding that

264
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:00,419
we generally find there is a correlation

265
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,445
between them.

266
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:06,475
We can run computational models where we

267
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:06,475
have a structural network, we simulate

268
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:09,506
the activity.

269
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,522
Then we apply, say, a lesion to that

270
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:11,522
network and look at the effects on the

271
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,544
activity.

272
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:15,565
And we can show, for example, that if you

273
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:15,565
lesion a hub area you have quite a

274
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:15,565
dramatic impact on brain function

275
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:15,565
compared to if you lesion a more weakly

276
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:22,634
connected non hub area.

277
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,657
Or we could use clinical studies.

278
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,678
We could look at cases where there are

279
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:26,678
naturally arising lesions through stroke

280
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:26,678
or some other form of brain damage and we

281
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:26,678
can understand the functional impairments

282
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:34,753
that result.

283
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:36,776
So, for example, in this case, people

284
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:36,776
with lesions to certain types of hub

285
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:36,776
areas with diffuse connectivity showed

286
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:36,776
much more generalized cognitive

287
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:36,776
impairments than people with lesions to

288
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:36,776
areas with more specific patterns of

289
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:49,900
connectivity.

290
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:51,924
So this is great.

291
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:53,948
This has been really informative and

292
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:53,948
great for understanding the role of

293
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:53,948
individual brain regions or connections

294
00:10:53,948 --> 00:11:00,950
in brain function.

295
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,981
But it doesn't really give us a coherent,

296
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:03,981
unified perspective about how dynamics

297
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:08,036
emerge from the underlying structure.

298
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,055
It's all a little bit piecemeal.

299
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:13,086
Now, if we want to develop such a

300
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:13,086
coherent understanding we can draw some

301
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:13,086
inspiration from different physics and

302
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:13,086
engineering where typically the

303
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:13,086
structural constraints on the dynamics of

304
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:13,086
a system are studied by understanding the

305
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:30,250
eigenmodes of the system.

306
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,283
Now, the eigen modes of a system are

307
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:33,283
found by solving an eigenvalue problem

308
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:37,320
such as this one.

309
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,346
So an eigenvector we can think of as

310
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:39,346
something that we measure about a system

311
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:39,346
that doesn't change its direction if it's

312
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:39,346
subjected to some kind of transformation.

313
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:48,432
.

314
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,462
So if that's the case, then this equality

315
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:51,467
holds.

316
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:54,489
So the idea here is that PSI is our

317
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:54,489
vector, something we measure about the

318
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:54,489
system subjected to some transformation L.

319
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:59,541
.

320
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:02,511
And if PSI is an eigenvector, then the

321
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:02,511
transformed eigenvector is equal to the

322
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:07,569
eigenvector just scaled by some value.

323
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,595
So the transformation can scale the

324
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:10,595
vector, but it doesn't change its

325
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,627
direction.

326
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,649
And so if that's the case, then this

327
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:15,649
scaling factor, lambda, is what we call

328
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,693
an eigenvalue and PSI is an eigenvector.

329
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:23,724
This kind of equation is applied to a lot

330
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:23,724
of different systems and a lot of

331
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:26,753
different contexts.

332
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:29,781
But when we're studying the eigen modes

333
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:29,781
of a system, typically our L term here is

334
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:29,781
an operator called the Laplacian operator

335
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:29,781
which essentially describes how smoothly

336
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:29,781
some kind of structural property of the

337
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:29,781
system varies through an appropriate

338
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:44,933
spatial embedding.

339
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,957
So I'll come back a little bit to what

340
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:46,957
that means because we can make different

341
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:46,957
choices for what we use in L and that

342
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:46,957
determines the specific anatomical

343
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:55,044
properties that we prioritize.

344
00:12:56,051 --> 00:12:58,076
But for now, I just want to emphasize

345
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:58,076
that a key property of these eigenvectors

346
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:58,076
is that they're orthogonal and so that

347
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:58,076
then we can use them as a basis set for

348
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:58,076
reconstructing different activity

349
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:58,076
patterns that we might see in the network.

350
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:12,153
.

351
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,188
So I guess the most famous example of a

352
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:15,188
basis set that many people will be

353
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:19,226
familiar with is a Fourier set.

354
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:21,249
So, for example, here we have some one

355
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:21,249
dimensional signal, and we can decompose

356
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:21,249
that signal as a weighted sum of sine and

357
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:29,322
cosine functions of varying frequencies.

358
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:31,340
So here you've got the different

359
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,340
functions, different frequencies, and

360
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,380
here you've got some weighting factors.

361
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,403
And we can reconstruct this signal as a

362
00:13:37,403 --> 00:13:39,422
weighted sum of these functions.

363
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:42,450
In a similar way, we can extract our

364
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:42,450
Eigen modes of the brain based on some

365
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,495
particular anatomical property.

366
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:49,521
And we end up with these spatial patterns

367
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:49,521
here that are organized again in terms of

368
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:49,521
spatial frequency or the wavelength of

369
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:54,577
fluctuation.

370
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:57,603
So here you can see we've got a very low

371
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:57,603
frequency fluctuation moving from back to

372
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:57,603
front, top to bottom, medial, lateral,

373
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:57,603
and then as you move up, you get these

374
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:07,640
more high frequency fluctuations.

375
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:09,668
And so then we can use these patterns to

376
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:09,668
reconstruct any spatial map that we

377
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:13,703
observe on the brain.

378
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:15,726
So it could be a map of brain activity

379
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:17,746
recorded during a particular task.

380
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:19,765
It could be, say, a map of cortical

381
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:19,765
thickness variations or gray matter

382
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:22,795
volume variations.

383
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,822
It's sufficiently general to allow you to

384
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,841
reconstruct any type of map.

385
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,863
And so we can do that just as a weighted

386
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:29,866
sum.

387
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,888
So here Y represents our map, and then we

388
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:31,888
represent that as a weighted sum of our

389
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:31,888
modes with the A coefficients

390
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:37,941
representing the weights.

391
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,005
Sorry, I should emphasize that that

392
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:43,005
explanation can be a little bit abstract

393
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:43,005
for people who aren't familiar with Eigen

394
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:49,066
modes.

395
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:52,090
And it is always a bit of a challenge to

396
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,101
get an intuition.

397
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,122
And so you can do what one of the people

398
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:55,122
in the team did and asked Chat GPT to

399
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:59,162
explain eigenmodes to a ten year old.

400
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:01,121
And it turns out that it does a pretty

401
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:01,126
good job.

402
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:03,146
I was quite happy with this explanation,

403
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:04,158
so I thought I'd share it.

404
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,183
So our Chat GPT says, of course, let's

405
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:07,183
imagine we have a wobbly jiggly bowl of

406
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:10,210
jelly.

407
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:12,231
When you poke it, it wiggles and shakes,

408
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:12,234
right?

409
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:14,253
Now, imagine if you poke the jelly in

410
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:14,253
different spots or with different amounts

411
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:14,253
of force, each time you poke it

412
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:14,253
differently, the jelly wiggles and shakes

413
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:20,317
in a different way.

414
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,339
Eigenmos are like those different ways.

415
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,360
The jelly wiggles and shakes when you

416
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,365
poke it.

417
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:28,394
So essentially, seeing this video here,

418
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:28,394
the jelly is poked and it wobbles in a

419
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,421
particular way.

420
00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:33,443
If you poke the jelly in a different spot

421
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:33,443
or with a different amount of force, you'

422
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:33,443
'll trigger a different pattern of

423
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:37,487
vibration.

424
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:41,520
And so commonly, Eigen modes are used in

425
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,547
the context of systems that vibrate.

426
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,566
And the idea is these Eigen modes

427
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:45,566
correspond to preferred patterns of

428
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:45,566
vibration when the system is perturbed,

429
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:45,566
and those preferred patterns are just

430
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:45,566
dictated by the structural properties of

431
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:54,657
that system.

432
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,689
We can extend it more generally and think

433
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:57,689
about it more as how a system responds to

434
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:57,689
any type of excitation and how an

435
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:57,689
excitation spreads through some connected

436
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:05,706
system.

437
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,728
And the Eigen modes correspond to the

438
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:09,747
preferred patterns of excitation.

439
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:11,764
Again determined by the physical

440
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:12,778
properties of the system.

441
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:18,832
So naturally, given everything we've been

442
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:18,832
talking about and these ideas that the

443
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:18,832
brain is a multiscale network, we need to

444
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:18,832
make a choice about how we define

445
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:18,832
alloplastian what specific anatomical

446
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:18,832
properties are we going to extract our

447
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:31,967
eigen modes from?

448
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:33,988
And so a natural choice would be to

449
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:36,011
extract them from brain connectivity.

450
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:38,035
And we can do this quite in a reasonably

451
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:39,046
straightforward way.

452
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:42,072
We get some map of the connections in the

453
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:42,076
brain.

454
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:45,103
We map connectivity between every pair of

455
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:45,107
nodes.

456
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:47,129
After we apply some discretization, we

457
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,144
define our discrete nodes.

458
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:51,164
We map every pair of connections.

459
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,187
We represent that in the form of a matrix.

460
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:53,187
.

461
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:56,217
And then we extract this quantity here.

462
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:58,236
It's called a graph Laplacian.

463
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:00,198
The details are not so important, but

464
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:02,218
that's essentially our l operator here.

465
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:04,239
And it describes how smoothly

466
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:04,239
connectivity varies as we move from node

467
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:09,285
to node in the network.

468
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,323
And when we do that, several studies have

469
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:13,323
shown that you can use the eigen modes

470
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:13,323
extracted from this graphaloplassian to

471
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:13,323
reconstruct kind of classic functional

472
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:21,404
networks that you record.

473
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:24,434
With functional MRI, we can reconstruct

474
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:24,434
different patterns of functional

475
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:29,486
connectivity between pairs of areas.

476
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:32,516
You can use it to reconstruct different

477
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:33,525
eg signals.

478
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:36,556
And people have even shown that you can

479
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:36,556
make predictions about the pattern of

480
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:36,556
neurodegeneration that you see in

481
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:44,634
different forms of dementia.

482
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:47,664
So this has been really fantastic

483
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:47,664
important work and a really important

484
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:47,664
proof of principle that this eigenmode

485
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:47,664
framework can be used to understand how

486
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:47,664
the structure of the system constrains

487
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:57,768
its dynamics.

488
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:00,735
And in each case, the interpretation is

489
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:00,735
that these dynamical patterns that we see

490
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:00,735
with fMRI or EEG or so on, are reflecting

491
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:00,735
excitations of these underlying eigen

492
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:00,735
modes or the resonant modes of the

493
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:12,851
anatomy of the brain.

494
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:16,890
This view very much aligns with what we

495
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:16,890
would think of as a classical view of

496
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:16,890
brain organization that I've just been

497
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,932
discussing.

498
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,956
So, following from Cahal and Broadman's

499
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:22,956
work, the idea is that at lots of

500
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:22,956
different scales, we can divide the brain

501
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:28,001
up into discrete areas.

502
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:31,004
They're connected in some way and it's

503
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:31,004
the signaling along these connections

504
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:31,004
between these discrete areas that drives

505
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:36,009
activity.

506
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:40,013
But there are reasons to think that,

507
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:40,013
particularly at coarser scales, so we

508
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:40,013
know at the fundamental cellular scale,

509
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:40,013
the network is discrete, but at coarser

510
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:40,013
scales, perhaps a different set of

511
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:53,026
approximations might be useful.

512
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:57,030
So if you look at dense reconstructions

513
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,030
of neuronal tissue, so this is, say, with

514
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,030
electron microscopy, you find that

515
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:06,033
cortical tissue is extremely dense.

516
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:10,037
It's like a really rich, thick forest of

517
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:12,039
cells and their processes.

518
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,043
And as we've talked about, there's been a

519
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
lot of debate about where you can

520
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
actually draw boundaries between discrete

521
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
areas and how valid and reliable that is

522
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:16,043
outside some kind of classic examples

523
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:28,055
seen in primary cortex.

524
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,058
And if you look more deeply at the

525
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:31,058
cellular organization of specific regions,

526
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:31,058
, here on the left we've got the cellular

527
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:31,058
organization and on the right we've got a

528
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:39,066
myelin stain.

529
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,069
You see, you get these deep penetrating

530
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
fibers that are coming in from the white

531
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:45,072
matter.

532
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:47,074
This is what this kind of classic graph

533
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:47,074
approach will pick up because we define

534
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:47,074
our nodes in the cortex and then we're

535
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:47,074
mapping the connections that pass through

536
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:54,081
the white matter.

537
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:57,084
But you can also see that there's a lot

538
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:57,084
of connectivity that's moving

539
00:19:57,084 --> 00:19:57,084
horizontally or tangential to the

540
00:19:57,084 --> 00:20:03,084
geometry of the cortex.

541
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:06,087
And so these horizontal connections allow

542
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,090
for the continuous spread of activity.

543
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,093
So rather than activity jumping between

544
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:12,093
discrete nodes, it can actually spread as

545
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:16,097
a propagating wave.

546
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:20,101
And just to emphasize some of the

547
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:20,101
limitations of the discrete model, not

548
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:20,101
long after Broadman's work, just a couple

549
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:20,101
of decades, the renowned physiologist

550
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:20,101
Lorenzo de Nou was pretty emphatic about

551
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:34,115
his concerns with the approach.

552
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:36,117
He said the only really good cyto

553
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
architectonic pictures are those of

554
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
Campbell, who, let me put in capital

555
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
letters, has been the only cyto

556
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
architectonist who has described facts

557
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:45,126
and only facts.

558
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:47,128
The German cyto architectonist has mixed

559
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
facts and theory in such a manner that

560
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
nobody can tell where facts ends and

561
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:52,133
theories begin.

562
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:56,137
So again, this is just emphasizing the

563
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:56,137
idea that while we might be able to

564
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:56,137
define discrete areas at a mesoscopic or

565
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:56,137
macroscopic resolutions, in some cases,

566
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:56,137
especially around the borders of primary

567
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:56,137
sensory or motor areas, for large swathes

568
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:56,137
of cortex, those distinctions become a

569
00:20:56,137 --> 00:21:14,149
little bit blurry.

570
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,154
So an alternative approach has emerged

571
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,156
out of neural field theory.

572
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,159
So neural field theory has been around

573
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:24,159
for several decades now and this is a

574
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:24,159
different approach to thinking about

575
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:31,166
cortical activity.

576
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,168
So the basic idea is that instead of

577
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:33,168
dividing the brain into discrete

578
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:33,168
specialized areas or nodes, we can treat

579
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:41,176
the cortex as a continuous sheep.

580
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,178
And we are actually interested in trying

581
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,178
to capture how patterns of brain activity

582
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:49,184
propagate through that continuous sheet.

583
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,186
And so this is something that you can see

584
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
in diverse types of electrophysiological

585
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,188
recordings.

586
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,191
So this, for example, this video is of

587
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:56,191
the dynamics of voltage sensitive dyes

588
00:21:56,191 --> 00:22:00,189
recorded in the mouse brain.

589
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:03,192
And you can see that you observe these

590
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
propagating waves of excitation that move

591
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
continuously through the cortex rather

592
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
than jumping from region to region as

593
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
would be implied by a kind of strongly

594
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:16,205
discrete model.

595
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,210
So a big emphasis in neural field theory

596
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:21,210
is on describing these wavelike

597
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,213
propagation patterns.

598
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:28,217
And it's been shown in recent theoretical

599
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:28,217
work that if we accept that wavelike

600
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:28,217
propagation drives neuronal activity,

601
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:28,217
then really the eigen modes that we

602
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:28,217
should be extracting or prioritizing are

603
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:28,217
those that are derived from the geometry

604
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:43,232
of the brain.

605
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:46,235
So our eigenvalue becomes this problem

606
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
here where this operator here is called

607
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
the LaPlace beltrami operator and it

608
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
describes how smoothly the geometry or

609
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
the shape or the curvature of the brain

610
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:57,246
varies through space.

611
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:00,243
And just to briefly explain why that's

612
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:00,243
the case, here we've got the wave

613
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:00,243
equation that's used in some forms of

614
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:00,243
neural field theory, at least the

615
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:09,252
divisions that we've been focusing on.

616
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:13,256
And so the basic idea is that the firing

617
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:13,256
rate of a given population of neurons B

618
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:13,256
at location R and T is given by the

619
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:22,265
Afferent field of incoming populations.

620
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:24,267
So other populations A.

621
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,269
So we've got other populations providing

622
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:26,269
this Afferent field of activity that

623
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:31,274
determines the firing rate of B.

624
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:34,277
And obviously, we then need to describe

625
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
what this afferent field looks like and

626
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
that's given by this part of the equation

627
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:39,282
here.

628
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:41,284
So on the left here, this set of terms

629
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:41,284
describes how the field evolves through

630
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:44,287
time.

631
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:46,289
We're not going to focus on that today

632
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:46,289
over here, which is what we're interested

633
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:46,289
in, where we've got how the field is

634
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:53,296
evolving through space.

635
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,299
And so here we can see our friend, the

636
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,299
LaPlace Beltrami operator, which

637
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:01,298
describes the geometry.

638
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:03,300
And here we've got the length scale of

639
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,302
axonal connectivity.

640
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:07,304
In this model, we make a very simple

641
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:08,305
assumption about connectivity.

642
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:11,308
We assume each point is connected to its

643
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
neighbors in a distance dependent and

644
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:14,311
isotropic way.

645
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:16,313
And that distance dependence is roughly

646
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:17,314
exponential.

647
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:19,316
So the idea is that areas nearby to a

648
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:19,316
given location R will have a strong

649
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:19,316
influence and that influence declines

650
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:19,316
roughly exponentially as a function of

651
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:27,324
distance.

652
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:31,328
And the speed of that decay is given by

653
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:33,330
this R term here.

654
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,332
You can see that geometry is firmly

655
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:37,334
embedded in this equation.

656
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:39,336
Now, I should point out this isn't

657
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:39,336
something that's just been plucked out of

658
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:42,338
thin air.

659
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:44,341
This is a damped wave equation that has

660
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:44,341
been used for centuries to describe wave

661
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:44,341
dynamics in all sorts of different media.

662
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:49,346
.

663
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:52,349
And so from that physics, we know very

664
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,349
well that the geometry of the system

665
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,349
constrains the spatial properties of wave

666
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:58,355
propagation.

667
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:01,352
And you can start from first principles

668
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:01,352
of neuronal biophysics and derive this

669
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:03,354
equation.

670
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:08,359
And given all that work, we know that the

671
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
eigen modes of the LaPlace Beltrami

672
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:08,359
operator actually correspond to the

673
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:15,366
standing waves of the dynamics.

674
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:16,367
So what are standing waves?

675
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:19,370
So in this simple example, we've got two

676
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
traveling waves here, a blue and a green.

677
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,372
.

678
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:23,374
And as they interact with each other, you

679
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:23,374
get these patterns of constructive and

680
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:23,374
destructive interference represented by

681
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:23,374
this red line here, that cause these very

682
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:23,374
large amplitude fluctuations that are

683
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:33,384
fixed in space.

684
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:35,386
So they're not actually traveling like

685
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:35,386
the original carrier waves, they're fixed

686
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:38,389
in space.

687
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:39,390
So that's why they're called standing

688
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,391
waves.

689
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:42,393
And they're a nice example of resonance.

690
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:45,396
So these fluctuations in the red trace

691
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
are much larger in amplitude than the

692
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:50,401
original carrier waves.

693
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:52,403
So it's an example of resonance where we'

694
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:52,403
're getting a larger response in the

695
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:55,406
system than the energy that we put in.

696
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:57,408
And just to convince you that this is

697
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:57,408
something real here, for example, we have

698
00:25:57,408 --> 00:26:02,407
a pool of water, a classic wave system.

699
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:05,410
If you apply vibrations at a specific

700
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:05,410
point in the pool, you see these waves

701
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:09,414
that travel out.

702
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,416
They hit the opposite wall, reflect back

703
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,417
and start to interact.

704
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:15,420
And then you see the emergence of these

705
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
standing wave patterns that are fixed in

706
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
space but show these very large scale

707
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:22,427
amplitude fluctuations.

708
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,431
Another classic example is the Cladney

709
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:26,431
plate.

710
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:29,434
So if you arrange dust particles on a

711
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
plate and then you apply some vibration

712
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
at a particular frequency, the dust

713
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
particles will settle into these complex

714
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:37,442
patterns.

715
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:39,444
The pattern is determined by the specific

716
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:39,444
frequency that you apply and specifically

717
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:44,449
where you apply the vibration.

718
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,452
And the patterns correspond to the eigen

719
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:48,453
modes of the plate.

720
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:51,456
And again, those patterns are determined

721
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:51,456
by the physical properties of the plate

722
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:51,456
things like its stiffness, its geometry

723
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:57,462
and so on.

724
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:01,460
This is a little bit gratuitous, but you

725
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:01,460
can extend the idea to three dimensions

726
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:01,460
and you can actually cause the particles

727
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,465
to levitate.

728
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:09,468
Again, in this case, they're trapped

729
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:09,468
within the nodal lines of sound waves

730
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:09,468
that are being projected in three

731
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:16,475
dimensions.

732
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:20,479
And this does have real world

733
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,480
consequences.

734
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,484
So this is a video of the Tacoma Narrows

735
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,486
bridge in the 1940s.

736
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:30,489
The engineers didn't pay enough attention

737
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:31,490
to eigen modes.

738
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,492
And so on this particular day, crosswinds

739
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:33,492
hit the bridge in just the right spots

740
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:33,492
and at just the right frequencies to

741
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:39,498
excite the eigen modes of the bridge.

742
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,500
So you triggered these resonant responses

743
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,500
and created these large scale amplitude

744
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,500
fluctuations that ultimately led to the

745
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:47,506
collapse of the bridge.

746
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:54,513
So hopefully, that background has kind of

747
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:54,513
illustrated that there's sort of two

748
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:54,513
different views of thinking about which

749
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:54,513
anatomical properties of the brain might

750
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:54,513
be more important in constraining

751
00:27:54,513 --> 00:28:08,521
dynamics.

752
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,524
So on the one hand, we have the classical

753
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
kind of connectome centric view in which

754
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
we view the cortex as comprising discrete

755
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
areas and dynamics are dominated by node

756
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:21,534
to node transmission.

757
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,536
The connectivity between areas is

758
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:23,536
topologically complex and not homogeneous,

759
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:23,536
, and we very much think that that's very

760
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:28,541
important.

761
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,543
And so we prioritize measuring that.

762
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,547
We don't really directly account for the

763
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:34,547
spatial embedding of the network or its

764
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,550
geometry.

765
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,552
We can look at it secondarily, but it's

766
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,553
not baked into the model.

767
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,556
And because we're interested in

768
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:43,556
connectivity, that means we need to

769
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,558
measure it.

770
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,560
So from a practical perspective, at least,

771
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
, if you're dealing with neuroimaging

772
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
data, you need a T one weighted image to

773
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
measure brain anatomy but also diffusion

774
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
MRI image to be able to measure brain

775
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:56,569
connectivity.

776
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,567
The other perspective, which is a

777
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:00,567
geometrically informed perspective that

778
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:00,567
arises out of neural field theory, views

779
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:07,574
the cortex as a continuous sheet.

780
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:09,576
We're not making distinctions between

781
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:10,577
different areas of the cortex.

782
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:13,580
We think dynamics are dominated by

783
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:13,580
propagating waves of excitation,

784
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:13,580
especially at these mesoscopic and

785
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,585
macroscopic scales.

786
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:20,587
We approximate connectivity between

787
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:20,587
different points of the cortex as being

788
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:24,591
homogeneous and distance dependent.

789
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,594
So we know that there is a strong

790
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:29,596
distance dependent in connectivity.

791
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:30,597
It doesn't explain everything.

792
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:32,599
So some things are missed, but we know it'

793
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,601
's certainly an important feature.

794
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,603
So then the question is how far we can

795
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:37,604
get with this approximation.

796
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:40,607
And a nice feature of this approach is

797
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
that we are directly accounting for

798
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
spatial and geometric effects, the

799
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
physical properties of the brain, which

800
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
are overlooked by the connectome approach.

801
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:48,615
.

802
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:50,617
A nice practical benefit of this approach

803
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:50,617
is that because we approximate

804
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:50,617
connectivity in a simple way, we don't

805
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:56,622
actually have to measure it.

806
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:57,624
We can derive our basis set simply by

807
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,626
looking at the geometry of the brain.

808
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:02,623
And so we only need a T one weighted scan,

809
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:02,623
, which is very standard in MRI

810
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:04,625
experiments.

811
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:08,629
So hopefully that's set the scene for

812
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:08,629
thinking about different anatomical

813
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:08,629
constraints on the brain and which ones

814
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:14,635
we might want to prioritize.

815
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:16,637
I'll now hand over to James.

816
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,639
He'll talk about how we went about

817
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:18,639
testing these different ideas and trying

818
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:18,639
to understand which constraints might be

819
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:24,645
more important for dynamics.

820
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,649
James: Thank you, Alex.

821
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:34,655
I'm going to focus more on the things

822
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:34,655
that we found in the paper that we

823
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:37,658
recently published.

824
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:40,661
I think a lot of you have the link for it,

825
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:40,661
, but let us know and send us a message

826
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:46,667
if you want to want us for the link.

827
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:49,670
So basically we start with we're trying

828
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:49,670
to answer and test the theory on which

829
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:49,670
modes of the brain could best describe

830
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:58,679
activity measured in FMI.

831
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,675
So we'll begin by how do we actually

832
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:02,677
measure these modes.

833
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:06,681
So geometric modes are based on the T one

834
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:06,681
weighted image, which is a standard

835
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:06,681
imaging tool that people use in the field.

836
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:13,688
.

837
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:16,691
And you can extract a model of the

838
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:16,691
cortical surface here on the right, and

839
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:24,699
there are robust pipelines to do so.

840
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:26,701
And you can do that on a population

841
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
average sense.

842
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:30,705
Basically, you get a group template of

843
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:30,705
the surface, or you can do that on an

844
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:34,709
individual basis.

845
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:39,714
On the other hand, connector modes need

846
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:39,714
deficient MRI and a structural MRI

847
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:39,714
because you need to kind of align the two.

848
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:44,719
.

849
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:48,723
And then we run a tractography pipeline,

850
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:48,723
basically finding connections between

851
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:53,728
regions in the brain.

852
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,732
And then from there you can construct a

853
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:57,732
vertex level or even region level

854
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:02,731
connector matrix.

855
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:04,733
Basically it's a matrix where each

856
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:04,733
element represents the connection of one

857
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:04,733
region or one vertex to another region or

858
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:11,740
another vertex.

859
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,744
And you feed this cortical surface or

860
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:15,744
this connector matrix in the eigenvalue

861
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:15,744
problem equations that Alex has mentioned

862
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:24,753
in the previous slides.

863
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:28,757
And then how do we test the performance

864
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:30,759
of these geometric and connector modes?

865
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,764
Basically, we focus a lot on FMI data.

866
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:40,769
So there are several open access data

867
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:43,772
sets that are available.

868
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:47,776
For example, the popular Human Connector

869
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:47,776
Project, which roughly has about 1200

870
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:47,776
participants, but we focus on 255

871
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:47,776
participants who are completely unrelated.

872
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:55,784
.

873
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:58,787
There are no twins and no siblings.

874
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:02,785
And within the Human Connector Project

875
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
data set for each subject, they have what

876
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:09,792
we call task evoke data.

877
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:14,797
Basically, these are functional activity

878
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:14,797
that was recorded whilst each participant

879
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:22,805
was performing a particular task.

880
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:25,808
And Hcp has a suite of seven different

881
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:28,811
tasks, and within each task several.

882
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:31,814
Different contrasts within it.

883
00:33:31,814 --> 00:33:34,817
And then we also analyze resting state

884
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:35,818
data.

885
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:37,820
Basically, resting state data is where

886
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:37,820
the participant is just inside the

887
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,824
scanner and just not doing anything.

888
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:44,827
And you just scan brain activity through

889
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
time and you can construct a functional

890
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
connectivity as well, where each element

891
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
of this matrix represents how correlated

892
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:58,841
the activity is between two regions.

893
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:02,839
We also analyze data from what we call

894
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,840
neural vault.

895
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:06,843
It's an open access repository of

896
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:06,843
thousands and thousands of different maps

897
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:11,848
that people have contributed.

898
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:15,852
And each map was acquired with distinct

899
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:15,852
experimental protocols and we took about

900
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:22,859
10,000 of those from Neurovolt.

901
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,864
And again, the level of heterogeneity in

902
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:27,864
the different tasks is quite remarkable

903
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:34,871
in the Neurovolt.

904
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:38,875
So we wanted to do our analysis on quite

905
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:38,875
different tasks to make sure we are

906
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:45,882
capturing something really meaningful.

907
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,886
So just to remind yourselves of what we'

908
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:51,888
're going to do next.

909
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:54,891
So basically, Alex already had mentioned

910
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:54,891
this.

911
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,894
You extract, for example, this spatial

912
00:34:57,894 --> 00:34:57,894
map.

913
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:00,891
Say that's the task evolved map and we

914
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:00,891
decompose that into different sets of

915
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,893
eigen modes.

916
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,896
So these patterns could be the geometric

917
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:05,896
modes or they could be the connector

918
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,899
modes.

919
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:13,904
And it will be weighted by a coefficient

920
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
A, and the weights represent how each

921
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
mode is expressed for that particular map.

922
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:21,912
.

923
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:26,917
And you can truncate the number of modes

924
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:26,917
that you want to use and then you can

925
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:26,917
reconstruct back the data by just taking

926
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:26,917
a linear sum of the coefficient

927
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:26,917
multiplied by the geometric or the

928
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:42,933
connector modes.

929
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,936
So what did we find by doing these

930
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:46,937
analyses?

931
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,941
So first I'm going to show you how the

932
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:50,941
spatial maps look like in terms of

933
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:54,945
reconstruction.

934
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,947
So on the left I'm showing you the

935
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:56,947
different task develop special maps, and

936
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:56,947
these are group average maps for the

937
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:04,949
human connector project data set.

938
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:07,952
And again, these are the seven tasks for

939
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:08,953
that data set.

940
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:11,956
And then we ask, okay, if we use about

941
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:11,956
ten modes, how would this patient map

942
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:15,960
look like?

943
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,963
And for this result, we're focusing on

944
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:19,964
the geometric modes.

945
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:23,968
So the reconstruction looks like this.

946
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:26,971
From afar they look quite different, but

947
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
if you actually look a bit closely, it

948
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
already captures the kind of the large

949
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
scale core scale patterns that you can

950
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:37,982
see from the data.

951
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:39,984
For example, this relational map.

952
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:41,986
You can clearly see this deemergence of

953
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:42,987
this big pattern.

954
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:45,990
Now, what happens if we incorporate more

955
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,991
modes into it?

956
00:36:47,991 --> 00:36:49,994
So we increase the number of modes to 100.

957
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
.

958
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:52,997
And now you can see that the

959
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
reconstruction almost looks like the

960
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
empirical data, but there are still

961
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
subtle differences, especially in the

962
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
more localized activity, for example,

963
00:36:52,997 --> 00:37:05,004
here in the arrows.

964
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:09,008
And if we increase it further, you can

965
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:09,008
see that we can better capture those

966
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:09,008
isolated localized patterns just by

967
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:18,017
increasing it to 200 modes.

968
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:20,019
So you can see that the modes are

969
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:20,019
actually really an efficient basis set

970
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:25,024
for task evoke data.

971
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:27,026
We do the same for resting state data.

972
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,029
We increase the number of modes in here

973
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,029
and compare the functional connectivity

974
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,029
based from the empirical data and the

975
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:35,034
reconstruction.

976
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:37,036
And we see the same thing that as you

977
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:37,036
increase the number of modes to 200, we

978
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:41,040
can capture the empirical data.

979
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,043
And you can do this in a more systematic

980
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
way by calculating how well can we

981
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
reconstruct the empirical data just by

982
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
taking the correlation of the empirical

983
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
and the reconstruction in reconstructed

984
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
maps as a function of an increasing

985
00:37:44,043 --> 00:38:00,053
number of modes.

986
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:04,057
And we see that indeed the reconstruction

987
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:04,057
accuracy increases as we increase the

988
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:08,061
number of modes.

989
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:13,066
And up to 200, we can get about 85% to

990
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:13,066
90% accuracy, which is quite efficient

991
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:13,066
given that we do the analysis on a

992
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:13,066
cortical surface with about 30,000

993
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:27,080
vertices.

994
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,083
So mathematically, the maximum number of

995
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
modes available to us is about 30,000,

996
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
and using 200 out of the 30,000, we can

997
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
already reconstruct the data quite

998
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:41,094
efficiently.

999
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:46,099
And then we've shown that the modes are

1000
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:46,099
quite powerful and efficient in

1001
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:51,104
representing the data.

1002
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:54,107
We now test the Hypotheses or the

1003
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
questions that Alex has laid a while ago,

1004
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
that are the geometric modes more

1005
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
parsimonious than the other anatomical

1006
00:38:54,107 --> 00:39:05,112
modes?

1007
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:08,115
And when I say anatomical modes, again,

1008
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,115
we're focusing on the connector modes,

1009
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,115
which is based on the connectivity matrix,

1010
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,115
, but we also test another anatomical

1011
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:20,127
mode based on an EDR rule.

1012
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:22,129
So an EDR rule is the exponential

1013
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
distance rule, which as Alex has

1014
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
mentioned a while ago, which is that

1015
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
because the assumption of neuroflu theory

1016
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
is that the connections are very

1017
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
localized and also organized in a

1018
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
distance dependent way, specifically, the

1019
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
connection weight changes exponentially

1020
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:45,152
as a function of distance.

1021
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:49,156
So we want to test that hypothesis on how

1022
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:49,156
dominant that exponential distance effect

1023
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:54,161
is.

1024
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:57,164
So for the details, we just created a

1025
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:57,164
synthetic network based on a simple

1026
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:57,164
probability of connection following an

1027
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:57,164
exponential distance rule with a skating

1028
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:57,164
factor or an exponent alpha, which we

1029
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:57,164
matched from empirical diffusion MRI data.

1030
00:39:57,164 --> 00:40:17,178
.

1031
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:20,181
And again, there's a lot of empirical

1032
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:20,181
evidence of the existence of this

1033
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:25,186
exponential distance rule.

1034
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:28,189
So it's not just a hypothetical

1035
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:31,192
theoretical kind of assumption.

1036
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:35,196
We see the effect in Macaques if you

1037
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:35,196
follow the weight as a function of

1038
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:35,196
distance from track tracing data, and

1039
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:35,196
this is in logarithmic scale, you see

1040
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:35,196
this linear curve which represents an

1041
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:51,212
exponential in linear coordinates.

1042
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:54,215
And we see the same with human diffusion

1043
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:54,215
MRI data that the weight changes as a

1044
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:54,215
function of distance in an exponential

1045
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:54,215
distance weight, and even in other

1046
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:54,215
species like mouse rats, mimosa, and so

1047
00:40:54,215 --> 00:41:06,221
on and so forth.

1048
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:08,223
So this is a universal property found in

1049
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:09,224
a lot of different species.

1050
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:14,229
So this exponential distance rule

1051
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:14,229
connectivity is actually empirically

1052
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:21,236
valid.

1053
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:24,239
So by using these three different

1054
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:24,239
anatomical properties, we can calculate

1055
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:24,239
the modes using the equations that Alexis

1056
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:32,247
mentioned a while ago.

1057
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:35,250
And you can get these geometric modes on

1058
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,250
the left, connector modes in the middle,

1059
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,250
and the modes from the exponential

1060
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:41,256
distance rule connectivity on the right?

1061
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:44,259
And again, the modes are arranged in

1062
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
quite a unique way in that the first

1063
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
couple of modes will represent the low

1064
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
spatial frequency or patterns with very

1065
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:55,270
long spatial wavelengths.

1066
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,273
And if you go further down, you can get

1067
00:41:58,273 --> 00:41:58,273
these high special frequency or short

1068
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:02,271
special wavelength patterns.

1069
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:08,277
The basis set that the modes provide can

1070
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:12,281
capture different scales of the data.

1071
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:17,286
So how do these anatomical modes compare

1072
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:17,286
when we now reconstruct the different FMI

1073
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:23,292
data that we have?

1074
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,294
So, for resting state functional

1075
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:25,294
connectivity, we compared the three modes,

1076
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:25,294
, again by measuring the accuracy as a

1077
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:33,302
function of the number of modes.

1078
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:37,306
And you can see that the geometric modes

1079
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:37,306
outperform both of the connectome and the

1080
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:37,306
EDR modes, but you can see that the EDR

1081
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:37,306
modes are quite close to the geometric

1082
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:47,316
modes.

1083
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:52,321
So again, suggesting that the fundamental

1084
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
effect that the EDR connectivity does in

1085
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
empirical data, it highlights the

1086
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
importance of this simple but important

1087
00:42:52,321 --> 00:43:09,332
exponential distance rule connectivity.

1088
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:11,334
And we can see the same thing by

1089
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:11,334
reconstructing the different task

1090
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:15,338
activation maps that we have.

1091
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:18,341
And I'm showing you here the difference.

1092
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:21,344
So it's the geometric minus the connector

1093
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:21,344
and geometric minus DDR reconstruction

1094
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:21,344
accuracies and red means the geometric

1095
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:21,344
modes are outperforming the other

1096
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:30,353
anatomical modes.

1097
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:33,356
So in all the data sets that we have, the

1098
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:36,359
results are quite consistent.

1099
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:40,363
So again, it suggests that the geometric

1100
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:40,363
modes are more parsimonious than the

1101
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:46,369
other anatomical modes that we have.

1102
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:52,375
And then we go a bit further on, how do

1103
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:52,375
we actually use the concept of these

1104
00:43:52,375 --> 00:44:01,378
modes in analyzing FMI activation maps.

1105
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:04,381
So I just kind of just want to explain a

1106
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:04,381
little bit of what traditional approach

1107
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:04,381
we have in brain map mapping research

1108
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:10,387
edge.

1109
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:13,390
So for example, you do an experiment, you

1110
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:13,390
capture the activation map shown here for

1111
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,395
a particular task.

1112
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:20,397
And I'm showing you here the kind of the

1113
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:22,399
one B version of that.

1114
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:27,404
So the value, the activation versus the

1115
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:31,408
vertex in this cortical surface.

1116
00:44:31,408 --> 00:44:34,411
So what traditionally what we do is to

1117
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:34,411
because we want to highlight people ask,

1118
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:34,411
okay, if a person does a particular task,

1119
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:34,411
which regions of the brain are kind of

1120
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:34,411
driving those the behavioral performance

1121
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:34,411
that we have whilst performing a

1122
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:54,431
particular task.

1123
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:58,435
So what people usually do is to threshold

1124
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
these maps and and you can set threshold

1125
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
barely arbitrarily, and then you can get

1126
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
these clusters of activity and we then

1127
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
make a conclusion that these clusters of

1128
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
activity are the ones kind of driving the

1129
00:44:58,435 --> 00:44:58,435
behavioral effects that we see whilst

1130
00:44:58,435 --> 00:45:20,451
performing a task.

1131
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,454
And people can even go further and hone

1132
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:23,454
down exactly really highly localized

1133
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:29,460
regions if you increase the threshold.

1134
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,463
But if you go further back we started

1135
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:32,463
from this whole brain activation map, you

1136
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:32,463
can clearly see that by thresholding you

1137
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:32,463
actually are removing a lot of important

1138
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:32,463
activity patterns that are sub threshold,

1139
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:50,481
but they do exist.

1140
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:54,485
So it's kind of like the analogy.

1141
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,489
By doing these thresholding approach, you'

1142
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
're just looking just at the tip of the

1143
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
iceberg, you're ignoring a lot of the

1144
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
important properties of the iceberg that

1145
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
are not seen by the threshold that you

1146
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:09,494
set.

1147
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:12,497
So what we can do is to use the mode

1148
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:14,499
approach to actually look.

1149
00:46:14,499 --> 00:46:15,500
Alex: At.

1150
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:23,508
James: Look at the properties of all the

1151
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:25,510
activation maps.

1152
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,513
And here on the left, I'm showing you

1153
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:30,515
here the power of each mode.

1154
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:33,518
So basically the weights that we obtained

1155
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:33,518
from the reconstructions that we had a

1156
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:37,522
while ago.

1157
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:41,526
And the figure on the left shows you the

1158
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:41,526
results that we have on average for the

1159
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:49,534
Human Connector Project data set.

1160
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:52,537
And on the right is for the 10,000 maps

1161
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:54,539
from Neurovolt.

1162
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:58,542
So what you can see here actually is most

1163
00:46:58,542 --> 00:46:58,542
of the power is contained within about 50

1164
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:02,541
modes.

1165
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:05,544
And if you remember, the modes represent

1166
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:05,544
and each mode represents a different

1167
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:05,544
wavelength and they are arranged and that

1168
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:05,544
the first couple of modes represent this

1169
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:05,544
long spatial wavelength, spatial

1170
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:18,557
structure.

1171
00:47:18,557 --> 00:47:21,560
So what this means is that actually in

1172
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
FMI activation maps, most of the power is

1173
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
within those long wavelengths, kind of

1174
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
suggesting that indeed, even by

1175
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
performing a particular task, you are

1176
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
actually activating this almost whole

1177
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
brain so you can see this almost whole

1178
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
brain activity that, again, you will miss

1179
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:50,588
out if you do some thresholding effect.

1180
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:52,591
And to further emphasize the importance

1181
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
of these long wavelength patterns, we did

1182
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
a simple experiment where we tried to

1183
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
remove, say, the first couple long

1184
00:47:52,591 --> 00:48:02,595
wavelength modes.

1185
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:04,597
And that's the solid curve that you see

1186
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:04,597
in here.

1187
00:48:05,598 --> 00:48:07,600
And by doing so, if we start removing

1188
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:07,600
those long wavelength modes, the

1189
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:07,600
reconstruction accuracy completely drops,

1190
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:15,608
even by just removing 25% of them.

1191
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:17,610
But if we just remove the short

1192
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:17,610
wavelength modes so starting from the

1193
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:17,610
right, the effect on the reconstruction

1194
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:25,618
accuracy is not that significant.

1195
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:29,622
So again, alluding to the fact that these

1196
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:29,622
long wavelength modes are really

1197
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:29,622
important and they describe the important

1198
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:29,622
structure found in activation maps from

1199
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:39,632
FMI data.

1200
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:44,637
So again, we've shown how the modes can

1201
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:44,637
explain and represent spatial activation

1202
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:49,642
patterns.

1203
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:52,645
What happens with the dynamics and the

1204
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:52,645
way we can do this is we go back to the

1205
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:52,645
crux of the neural field theory, which

1206
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:52,645
the geometric argument modes were based

1207
00:48:52,645 --> 00:49:02,649
from.

1208
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,651
And Neurofield theory is very generalized.

1209
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:04,651
.

1210
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:06,653
You can construct different populations

1211
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
of excitatory inhibitory neurons and you

1212
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
can even connect the thyroids and so on

1213
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:11,658
and so forth.

1214
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:14,661
But the important bits to remember is

1215
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:14,661
that mirror field theory relies on the

1216
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:14,661
idea that activation propagates through

1217
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:20,667
space as waves.

1218
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:25,672
And to simplify the experiment that we

1219
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
want to do, because we want to model the

1220
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
activity as a function of time, we just

1221
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
focus on the cortex and we simulate the

1222
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
equation based from the wave model and we

1223
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:45,692
tune the parameter.

1224
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,694
But if you look at the equation, there

1225
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:47,694
are only two parameters and we fix one of

1226
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:50,697
them.

1227
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:54,701
So basically, the model is only relying

1228
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:57,704
on tuning one free parameter.

1229
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:01,702
And what we did was to compare that with

1230
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:04,705
a more sophisticated neuromass model.

1231
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:06,707
So, neuromass models rely on the

1232
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:07,708
connector.

1233
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:10,711
So basically you have regions in the

1234
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:10,711
brain that they are connected and the

1235
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:10,711
connections are based from diffusion MRI

1236
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:10,711
and each region will have its own

1237
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:10,711
dynamical properties so they evolve

1238
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:22,723
through time.

1239
00:50:23,724 --> 00:50:26,727
So it relies a lot of on this connection

1240
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:28,729
and again, local dynamics.

1241
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:31,732
But it's important to highlight that this

1242
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:31,732
highly sophisticated model has about 19

1243
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:31,732
parameters and we fix about 15 adults,

1244
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:31,732
but we still need to kind of tune about

1245
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:39,740
four.

1246
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:44,745
So in comparison to the wave model, again,

1247
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
, wave model only has one and what we did

1248
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
was to how well can it recapitulate

1249
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:54,755
functional connectivity data.

1250
00:50:55,756 --> 00:50:58,759
So here I'm showing you an example for

1251
00:50:58,759 --> 00:50:58,759
the empirical functional connectivity

1252
00:50:58,759 --> 00:50:58,759
that we have and the resulting model

1253
00:50:58,759 --> 00:50:58,759
based functional connectivity for both

1254
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:10,765
the wave and the neuromass models.

1255
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:15,770
And we can kind of quantify how well the

1256
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:15,770
model based functional connectivity

1257
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:15,770
results stack up with respect to the

1258
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:27,782
empirical data in a variety of ways.

1259
00:51:27,782 --> 00:51:31,786
One can look at how well does the edge FC.

1260
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:31,786
.

1261
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:34,789
So basically each element of this matrix

1262
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:34,789
compares between the empirical and the

1263
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:34,789
model based data and you can see that

1264
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:34,789
both models are performing quite

1265
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:43,798
similarly.

1266
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:46,801
We can also look at the average

1267
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:49,804
connectivity within each region.

1268
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:52,807
So basically you're taking the average of

1269
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:52,807
a row or a column and you can see that

1270
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:52,807
the wave model now outperforms the

1271
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:59,814
neuromus model by a bit.

1272
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:03,812
And you can gain further because these

1273
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
properties, the first two properties are

1274
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:08,817
based on static FC.

1275
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:10,819
Basically you're kind of averaging the

1276
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:11,820
effects across time.

1277
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:15,824
But we also measured how well two models

1278
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:15,824
compare in capturing dynamical properties

1279
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:21,830
through time.

1280
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,833
And you see that the wave model actually

1281
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,836
outperforms the neural mass model.

1282
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:31,840
And so in summary, for this, it's just to

1283
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:31,840
show that the simplicity of the wave

1284
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:31,840
model can capture a lot of these

1285
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:40,849
properties of functional data.

1286
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:45,854
Again, highlighting the idea that this

1287
00:52:45,854 --> 00:52:45,854
wave evolving auto traveling in space and

1288
00:52:45,854 --> 00:52:45,854
time in the brain is probably a good

1289
00:52:45,854 --> 00:52:54,863
approximation.

1290
00:52:55,864 --> 00:52:59,868
We also simulated the effect if we

1291
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:02,865
stimulate, say, the visual cortex.

1292
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:06,869
So we just ping the visual cortex and

1293
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:06,869
allow it to the activity to propagate

1294
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:11,874
through space and time.

1295
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:14,877
And this will be the propagation starts

1296
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:14,877
from the visual cortex and then it goes

1297
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:20,883
to the frontal cortex.

1298
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:22,885
And I think I want to highlight one

1299
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:22,885
observation that we found is that we can

1300
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:22,885
see that when we started from the visual

1301
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:22,885
cortex, the activity starts to separate

1302
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:32,895
into two.

1303
00:53:33,896 --> 00:53:35,898
In the psychology and neuroscience

1304
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:35,898
literature, people have actually found

1305
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:35,898
this effect and they call it the

1306
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:35,898
separation into the dorsal and ventral

1307
00:53:35,898 --> 00:53:43,906
stream.

1308
00:53:43,906 --> 00:53:46,909
And each stream has important cognitive

1309
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:47,910
implications.

1310
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:52,915
But people have tried to explain this

1311
00:53:52,915 --> 00:53:52,915
separation by capturing the complex layer

1312
00:53:52,915 --> 00:54:00,917
specific activity, individual cortex.

1313
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:04,921
But what this simple experiment that we

1314
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:04,921
have done has shown that maybe the

1315
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:04,921
geometry and the idea of waves

1316
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:04,921
propagating could be sufficient in

1317
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:04,921
obtaining these kind of physiological

1318
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:17,934
effect.

1319
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:22,939
And then we also tried to compare it with

1320
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:22,939
how well does it recapitulate the visual

1321
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:22,939
hierarchy that people have found in

1322
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:29,946
primates.

1323
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:35,952
For example, this work in the last couple

1324
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
of years where they also did a simulation

1325
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:45,962
where they stimulated the visual cortex.

1326
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:48,965
And what they found was if you follow

1327
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
regions along the visual hierarchy in the

1328
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
macaque cortex, you see the activity

1329
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
patterns are kind of delayed in a

1330
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
hierarchical way, so they follow the same

1331
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:48,965
kind of relationship as the visual

1332
00:54:48,965 --> 00:55:03,974
hierarchy.

1333
00:55:03,974 --> 00:55:05,976
So we did the same thing.

1334
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:08,979
We compared the activity, the amplitude

1335
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:08,979
of the activity by matching the regions

1336
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:08,979
that people found in the visual hierarchy

1337
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:16,986
of the maca cortex.

1338
00:55:16,987 --> 00:55:20,991
And we tried to find the regions in the

1339
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:20,991
human brain and then we see the same

1340
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:24,995
effect.

1341
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:28,999
And then when we compared it to a typical

1342
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:28,999
measure of hierarchy in the neuroimaging

1343
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:28,999
space, by using the intracortical myelin

1344
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:28,999
map, which is just the ratio of t one and

1345
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:28,999
T two, we see the effect that the time to

1346
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:28,999
peak of these activation patterns well

1347
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:28,999
captures the rank of the intracortical

1348
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:50,021
myelin, again highlighting that.

1349
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:54,025
Indeed, what we're getting is capturing

1350
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:54,025
this hierarchical kind of processing

1351
00:55:54,025 --> 00:56:00,025
starting from the visual cortex.

1352
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:05,030
And think of the last result that I want

1353
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,030
to highlight is the subcortex, because

1354
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:13,038
again, the brain is not just the cortex.

1355
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:16,041
So what we did was to also calculate the

1356
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
modes from subcortical regions and what

1357
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
we did was to mask these subcortical

1358
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
regions and perform the same and solve

1359
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,041
the same equation using the whole plastic

1360
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:27,052
primary operator.

1361
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,055
And you can get these argument modes for

1362
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:30,055
the thalamus triadom and the hippocampus.

1363
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:32,057
.

1364
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:35,060
And we compared that to what we call in

1365
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,062
the field as functional gradients.

1366
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:40,065
Basically, they are representations, low

1367
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:40,065
dimensional representation of resting

1368
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:44,069
state FMI data.

1369
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,073
So what we did was to compare the

1370
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:48,073
geometric modes for the different

1371
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:48,073
subcortical structures and the different

1372
00:56:48,073 --> 00:57:00,079
functional gradients based on FMI data.

1373
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,082
And you can see that the modes are almost

1374
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:03,082
in perfect correspondence with the

1375
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:03,082
functional gradients and we see the same

1376
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:03,082
effect for the different structures,

1377
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:03,082
again, probably highlighting the idea

1378
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:03,082
that the geometric effects that we solve

1379
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:03,082
in the cortex are much more dominant in

1380
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:03,082
the subcortex, that geometry really

1381
00:57:03,082 --> 00:57:27,106
constraints function.

1382
00:57:30,109 --> 00:57:33,112
Just to tie things together, what are the

1383
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:33,112
advantages of this approach that we

1384
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:37,116
found?

1385
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:40,119
First, it's a more physical understanding

1386
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:40,119
of the relationship between structure and

1387
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:40,119
function based on ideas in physics

1388
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:40,119
engineering that has been used in the

1389
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:49,128
last century.

1390
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:52,131
The vectoring modes are only based on T

1391
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:53,132
one weighted images.

1392
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:57,135
So it's very simple to perform and the

1393
00:57:57,135 --> 00:57:57,135
analysis can be done by anyone with

1394
00:57:57,135 --> 00:58:03,136
structural T one weighted image.

1395
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:05,138
And hence you can apply it in quite

1396
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:05,138
different experimental contexts in both

1397
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:05,138
humans, other species, health and disease.

1398
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:10,143
.

1399
00:58:11,144 --> 00:58:13,146
And finally, to summarize things,

1400
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:13,146
hopefully we've shown that geometric

1401
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:13,146
modes are indeed more parsimonious than

1402
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:20,153
other anatomical modes.

1403
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:23,156
And this is confirming a lot of the

1404
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:23,156
predictions from theoretical calculations

1405
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:23,156
of near field theory and highlights the

1406
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:23,156
importance of treating the brain as this

1407
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:23,156
really physical system in correspondence

1408
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:23,156
with what people are doing in physics and

1409
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:40,173
engineering.

1410
00:58:41,174 --> 00:58:44,177
But it also highlights the idea that the

1411
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
effects that we see in FMI might be

1412
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
dominated by the effect of this simple

1413
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
local and exponential distance rule

1414
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:54,187
connectivity.

1415
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:58,191
However, the contributions of long range

1416
00:58:58,191 --> 00:58:58,191
connections are still there, but what we'

1417
00:58:58,191 --> 00:58:58,191
're highlighting is maybe their influence

1418
00:58:58,191 --> 00:58:58,191
may not be observable with the resolution

1419
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:12,199
that we currently have with FMI data.

1420
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:15,202
So it would be interesting to see and

1421
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
perform these experiments in a much more

1422
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
highly resolved, say, track tracing data

1423
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
from other species that we found that

1424
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
evoked activity is dominated by these

1425
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
long wavelength modes, which challenges a

1426
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
lot of the traditional approach we have

1427
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
in the Neuroimaging field where we focus

1428
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
a lot on these focal activations and that

1429
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
traveling waves shaped by geometry are

1430
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
sufficient to explain a lot of

1431
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:44,231
physiological phenomena.

1432
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:48,235
They just emerged from the model and we

1433
00:59:48,235 --> 00:59:48,235
didn't baked all these physiological

1434
00:59:48,235 --> 00:59:52,239
phenomena into the model.

1435
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,243
And finally that geometric constraints

1436
00:59:56,243 --> 00:59:56,243
seem to be universally exist in both

1437
00:59:56,243 --> 00:59:56,243
cortex and subcortex and that we can use

1438
00:59:56,243 --> 00:59:56,243
one single approach to study the whole

1439
00:59:56,243 --> 01:00:09,022
brain quite nicely.

1440
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:12,313
And I just want to add both Alex and I

1441
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:12,313
would like to thank all the other co

1442
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:15,682
authors of the work.

1443
01:00:15,688 --> 01:00:18,939
It has been a truly multi institute

1444
01:00:18,939 --> 01:00:19,047
collaboration.

1445
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:23,466
All the open access data set that we have

1446
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:23,466
used and if people are interested in

1447
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:23,466
doing our analysis, we have written an

1448
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:23,466
open access software package repository

1449
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:35,611
in GitHub.

1450
01:00:35,616 --> 01:00:36,740
You can access that in here.

1451
01:00:36,748 --> 01:00:39,071
So people can analyze modes in the brain

1452
01:00:39,071 --> 01:00:39,071
in quite different contexts that they

1453
01:00:39,071 --> 01:00:39,071
want to do and I think that's where we

1454
01:00:39,071 --> 01:00:47,797
want to end.

1455
01:00:47,805 --> 01:00:47,893
Thank you.

1456
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:52,312
Daniel: Awesome.

1457
01:00:52,324 --> 01:00:54,559
Well, thank you for the great

1458
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:55,673
presentation.

1459
01:00:57,803 --> 01:00:58,978
Lot of places to go.

1460
01:00:59,996 --> 01:01:01,662
First I'll pass to Dean.

1461
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:05,088
Dean: Thank you gentlemen.

1462
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:09,495
I first got wind of this paper through

1463
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:09,495
another individual in the active

1464
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:09,495
inference community and I think I was the

1465
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:09,495
one that may have pounded the table that

1466
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:09,495
we might want to do a guest stream on

1467
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:09,495
this and it's ticked the paper and really

1468
01:01:09,495 --> 01:01:26,115
brought it to life.

1469
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:28,358
So thank you very much, I really

1470
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:28,358
appreciate it, especially some of the

1471
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:32,747
dynamic images.

1472
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:35,037
I think it really helps in terms of

1473
01:01:35,037 --> 01:01:35,037
explaining what you guys were trying to

1474
01:01:35,037 --> 01:01:35,037
do your work with and your subject matter

1475
01:01:35,037 --> 01:01:42,716
on.

1476
01:01:42,718 --> 01:01:43,829
So I'll just start with that.

1477
01:01:43,835 --> 01:01:45,002
I have some questions later on.

1478
01:01:45,003 --> 01:01:49,043
But just first of all, thank you for a

1479
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:51,068
fantastic explanation.

1480
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,093
Alex: Thank you.

1481
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,148
Daniel: When you present this in a

1482
01:01:59,148 --> 01:01:59,148
neuroscience setting, what's a common

1483
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:03,122
response or reaction?

1484
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:06,153
From the introduction, I could really

1485
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:06,153
tell how careful you were to speak to the

1486
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:06,153
totality and the different threads in

1487
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:13,228
neuroscience.

1488
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:16,253
So after all that set up and all the

1489
01:02:16,253 --> 01:02:16,253
statistical analysis that's presented,

1490
01:02:16,253 --> 01:02:16,253
where does that put people in terms of

1491
01:02:16,253 --> 01:02:16,253
their own understanding of the way that

1492
01:02:16,253 --> 01:02:16,253
they've been doing complementary

1493
01:02:16,253 --> 01:02:16,253
methodologies or orienting their research

1494
01:02:16,253 --> 01:02:30,398
questions that way.

1495
01:02:34,436 --> 01:02:37,467
Alex: Yeah, I think generally people are

1496
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:37,467
at least we found that people are quite

1497
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:41,507
interested.

1498
01:02:42,516 --> 01:02:45,545
I guess the approach is a bit different

1499
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:45,545
to how a neuroscientist would typically

1500
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:45,545
think about the brain but kind of aligns

1501
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:45,545
with how, say a physicist might narrowly

1502
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:45,545
easily start approaching thinking about

1503
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:59,681
or modeling the brain.

1504
01:02:59,682 --> 01:03:01,640
And so the work was really trying to

1505
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:01,640
bring those two kind of perspectives

1506
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,663
together.

1507
01:03:04,678 --> 01:03:09,720
I think the reaction is usually kind of

1508
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:09,720
this is really interesting, how do I make

1509
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:09,720
sense of it or what I do practically, I

1510
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:09,720
guess some people might kind of split it

1511
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:09,720
artificially into this comparison of odd

1512
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:09,720
geometry versus connectivity which is

1513
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:09,720
probably not the right way to think about

1514
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:35,988
it.

1515
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:39,029
The way we like to think about it is that

1516
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,029
we're sort of comparing two different

1517
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,029
models and each of those models makes

1518
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,029
certain approximations and prioritizes

1519
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:49,120
different features.

1520
01:03:50,138 --> 01:03:53,164
The approach we put forward in this paper

1521
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:53,164
emphasizes the role of geometry and it

1522
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:53,164
does have connectivity embedded in that

1523
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:59,219
model.

1524
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,179
It's just a kind of simplified

1525
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:02,197
approximation of connectivity.

1526
01:04:02,198 --> 01:04:05,222
This kind of homogeneous distance

1527
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:05,222
dependent journal whereas typical

1528
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:05,222
connectome centric view will try to

1529
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:05,222
capture all the complex connectivity but

1530
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:05,222
we'll ignore also the horizontal

1531
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:05,222
connectivity that really is what drives

1532
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:05,222
activity spreading through the brain that'

1533
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:23,404
's completely ignored.

1534
01:04:23,404 --> 01:04:26,434
And so really the idea behind this work

1535
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:26,434
was to kind of test in a way between

1536
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:26,434
these two approaches and see which one's

1537
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:26,434
approximations were kind of more useful

1538
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:36,534
in a sense.

1539
01:04:39,566 --> 01:04:41,583
Daniel: Dean, want to add something or I

1540
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:42,594
can make a comment there?

1541
01:04:43,602 --> 01:04:45,620
Dean: No finish this because then I'm

1542
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:45,620
going to ask my questions about the Jello.

1543
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,640
.

1544
01:04:47,642 --> 01:04:50,669
Daniel: Yeah, well, the statistics was

1545
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:50,669
very clear and it was very interesting

1546
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:50,669
how with two different data sets there

1547
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:50,669
were similar curves with also very

1548
01:04:50,669 --> 01:05:00,714
different number of samples.

1549
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:03,745
So it was almost like some of the

1550
01:05:03,745 --> 01:05:03,745
statistical distributions were latched

1551
01:05:03,745 --> 01:05:03,745
onto relatively early and then that

1552
01:05:03,745 --> 01:05:11,826
captured the big continent.

1553
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:16,876
And a lot of the connections are local.

1554
01:05:16,878 --> 01:05:19,905
And this is, of course, a topic to

1555
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:19,905
explore about the molecular and the

1556
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:19,905
mechanistic electromagnetic basis and

1557
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:19,905
whether this to what extent it represents

1558
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:19,905
traveling propagating electrochemical

1559
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:19,905
waves and or loading heavily on simply

1560
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:19,905
diffuse local connections and even the

1561
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:40,110
blurry line between those two.

1562
01:05:40,117 --> 01:05:43,149
So it is really like a question about

1563
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:43,149
what is being captured because even the

1564
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:43,149
EDR with the spread captures a variance

1565
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:43,149
component related to local abundant,

1566
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:43,149
direct, fast acting connections in some

1567
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:43,149
regions and distant connections maybe

1568
01:05:43,149 --> 01:06:02,273
over the days.

1569
01:06:03,282 --> 01:06:08,330
Distal connections really do matter as

1570
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:12,373
the Jello sets and things change.

1571
01:06:12,377 --> 01:06:16,413
But at the exact timescale that some of

1572
01:06:16,413 --> 01:06:16,413
these patterns are happening at your work

1573
01:06:16,413 --> 01:06:16,413
is showing new information and comparison

1574
01:06:16,413 --> 01:06:27,528
with different ways it's been looked at.

1575
01:06:31,569 --> 01:06:35,606
James: Yeah, I think one of the things

1576
01:06:35,606 --> 01:06:35,606
that it highlighted even probably just in

1577
01:06:35,606 --> 01:06:35,606
my head is we've been focusing a lot on

1578
01:06:35,606 --> 01:06:35,606
trying to capture the effects of this

1579
01:06:35,606 --> 01:06:35,606
complex connectivity and we ignore all

1580
01:06:35,606 --> 01:06:35,606
these lateral, horizontal local diffusing

1581
01:06:35,606 --> 01:06:56,817
connections.

1582
01:06:57,823 --> 01:07:01,803
But what the work has now kind of shown,

1583
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:01,803
it highlighted maybe the issues that we

1584
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:01,803
have with FMI because truly both of these

1585
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:13,921
worlds happen probably simultaneously.

1586
01:07:13,926 --> 01:07:16,958
But just the effects that we're seeing in

1587
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:16,958
FMI is probably not the most efficient

1588
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:16,958
way to capture both worlds or it cannot

1589
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:16,958
hung down the specifics of one world over

1590
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:27,062
the other.

1591
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:33,120
In the results that we're getting is that

1592
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:33,120
the effects of this very localized

1593
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:33,120
connectivity probably dominates a lot of

1594
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:42,212
what we see there FMI.

1595
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:46,255
But time will tell if we improve the ways

1596
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:46,255
we capture brain activity with OpenAI and

1597
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:46,255
we can really kind of particularly focus

1598
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:46,255
on the different aspects of the

1599
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:57,369
approximations.

1600
01:07:59,384 --> 01:08:01,348
To me, that's the kind of the beauty of

1601
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:02,354
the work.

1602
01:08:02,354 --> 01:08:06,394
It now highlighted these effects into the

1603
01:08:06,394 --> 01:08:08,411
broader audience.

1604
01:08:09,427 --> 01:08:12,451
Alex: Yeah, everything that we've

1605
01:08:12,451 --> 01:08:12,451
presented is really addressing things

1606
01:08:12,451 --> 01:08:17,503
that we were at measure with fMRI.

1607
01:08:17,504 --> 01:08:19,529
So on pretty coarse spatial and temporal

1608
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:19,529
scales, there's some theoretical work

1609
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:19,529
suggesting that kind of the more complex

1610
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:19,529
aspects of connectivity that can't be

1611
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:19,529
explained by an EDR might play an

1612
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:19,529
important role in supporting dynamic

1613
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:19,529
transitions between different brain

1614
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:34,674
states.

1615
01:08:35,681 --> 01:08:37,703
But that would happen on a very rapid

1616
01:08:37,703 --> 01:08:37,703
scale that could be missed with fMRI or

1617
01:08:37,703 --> 01:08:37,703
at least a typically organized fMRI

1618
01:08:37,703 --> 01:08:42,756
experiment.

1619
01:08:42,758 --> 01:08:44,778
And so one thing we're interested in

1620
01:08:44,778 --> 01:08:44,778
looking at further is trying to pick that

1621
01:08:44,778 --> 01:08:44,778
apart a little bit and trying to isolate

1622
01:08:44,778 --> 01:08:44,778
the functional contributions of those

1623
01:08:44,778 --> 01:08:53,863
more complicated connections.

1624
01:08:56,894 --> 01:08:57,899
Daniel: Cool.

1625
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,876
Dean: Dean, can I ask about the metaphor

1626
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:04,912
of the spoon tapping on the cello there?

1627
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:07,947
Metaphorically speaking, that seems like

1628
01:09:07,947 --> 01:09:07,947
an external perturbation on something

1629
01:09:07,947 --> 01:09:12,997
that can respond to that.

1630
01:09:14,012 --> 01:09:17,041
Now, you'll appreciate I'm asking from a

1631
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:19,060
very naive point of view.

1632
01:09:19,061 --> 01:09:20,079
I'm comfortable with it.

1633
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:24,113
Is there any difference then in terms of,

1634
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:24,113
say, something that happens

1635
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:24,113
interoceptively, like something that's

1636
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:24,113
simply coming from within system and does

1637
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:24,113
that show up in the same way as when

1638
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:24,113
there's a response to an external

1639
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:38,251
stimuli?

1640
01:09:39,267 --> 01:09:40,271
Alex: Yeah.

1641
01:09:40,271 --> 01:09:43,301
So the actual underlying model, a key

1642
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:43,301
component that we haven't really talked

1643
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:43,301
about, is that you have thalamocortical

1644
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:43,301
loops and there's a driving input from

1645
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:43,301
the thalamus that influences the wave

1646
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:57,445
activity in the cortex.

1647
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:02,431
And they could be sensory thalamic nuclei

1648
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:02,431
or they could be interceptive inputs as

1649
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:06,477
well.

1650
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:09,504
And they would be expected to drive

1651
01:10:09,504 --> 01:10:09,504
cortical activity in different and

1652
01:10:09,504 --> 01:10:14,551
spatially non uniform ways.

1653
01:10:16,572 --> 01:10:18,591
Really distinguishing between those

1654
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:18,591
different types of inputs, as far as I'm

1655
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:22,632
aware, hasn't been modeled yet.

1656
01:10:22,632 --> 01:10:24,654
It's all been kind of at a simple level

1657
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:24,654
where you treat the cortex homogeneously

1658
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:28,698
and you have a single thalamic nucleus.

1659
01:10:28,698 --> 01:10:31,725
I mean, some people have started to split

1660
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:31,725
them up, but that would be that the

1661
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:31,725
underlying principle and the model could

1662
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:31,725
be extended in such a way that you could

1663
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:31,725
potentially distinguish between

1664
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:31,725
interreceptive and extra receptive inputs.

1665
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:44,849
.

1666
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:46,869
Dean: Can I ask him one more?

1667
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,892
James: Dan, I just want to add, for

1668
01:10:48,892 --> 01:10:48,892
example, the visual cortex experiment

1669
01:10:48,892 --> 01:10:51,927
that we perform.

1670
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:53,947
It's a really simple perturbation.

1671
01:10:53,947 --> 01:10:55,969
Right, but it could represent different

1672
01:10:55,969 --> 01:10:55,969
types of perturbation we just can't

1673
01:10:55,969 --> 01:11:00,950
particularly capture at the moment.

1674
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,974
But it's like an overlying if we perturb

1675
01:11:02,974 --> 01:11:02,974
it in a certain way this will be the

1676
01:11:02,974 --> 01:11:05,008
effect that we see.

1677
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,038
Dean: You must have known I was going to

1678
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:08,038
ask next thing because that was the

1679
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:08,038
direction I was going with that visual

1680
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:12,079
cortex example.

1681
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:16,113
So from the active inference community,

1682
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:16,113
one of the things that we're always

1683
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:16,113
dealing with is surprise, say versus

1684
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:22,175
sensory attenuation.

1685
01:11:22,176 --> 01:11:25,203
And then on the third vertices, the

1686
01:11:25,203 --> 01:11:25,203
seeming unawareness prior to the surprise

1687
01:11:25,203 --> 01:11:25,203
or the attenuated state, but still

1688
01:11:25,203 --> 01:11:32,270
available.

1689
01:11:32,272 --> 01:11:35,305
And so I'm kind of curious, when you move

1690
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:35,305
away from the visual can you still have

1691
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:35,305
these sort of same waves going through

1692
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:35,305
the brain because other sensory uptake is

1693
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:35,305
causing that same you get a surprising

1694
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:35,305
feeling, like a sense of weightlessness

1695
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:52,476
perhaps.

1696
01:11:52,478 --> 01:11:56,518
Right, or you're an astronaut and that's

1697
01:11:56,518 --> 01:12:00,499
now something you become attenuated to.

1698
01:12:03,522 --> 01:12:06,553
I know it kind of stuck with the fMRI but

1699
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:06,553
it just seems so the possibilities in

1700
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:06,553
terms of what you guys are opening up

1701
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:14,634
just seems really interesting.

1702
01:12:14,636 --> 01:12:18,672
Is that something like the interoceptive

1703
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:18,672
thing where you can see this now having

1704
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:24,738
opening up new areas of inquiry?

1705
01:12:28,778 --> 01:12:31,805
Alex: Yeah, so I think there's some

1706
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:31,805
really interesting work where people have

1707
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:31,805
looked at recursive neural nets

1708
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:31,805
structured in such a way that you can get

1709
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:31,805
wavelike propagation between the elements

1710
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:31,805
of the network and have shown that the

1711
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:31,805
systems that have that wavelike

1712
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:31,805
propagation, it actually facilitates

1713
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:31,805
their ability to predict what's happening

1714
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:57,060
in, say, a movie.

1715
01:12:57,067 --> 01:13:00,033
So it improves their predictive

1716
01:13:00,033 --> 01:13:02,057
performance physiologically.

1717
01:13:02,059 --> 01:13:05,082
It'll have shown that just with simple

1718
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:05,082
visual stimulation you get these back to

1719
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:05,082
front propagations but there's also front

1720
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:05,082
to back propagations which are presumably

1721
01:13:05,082 --> 01:13:14,176
encoding the predictions.

1722
01:13:14,177 --> 01:13:17,206
And so then the question is how do the

1723
01:13:17,206 --> 01:13:17,206
top down predictions and the bottom up

1724
01:13:17,206 --> 01:13:17,206
sensory input get reconciled between the

1725
01:13:17,206 --> 01:13:25,289
interactions of these waves?

1726
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:30,332
I think these are kind of really

1727
01:13:30,332 --> 01:13:30,332
interesting ways forward that we're still

1728
01:13:30,332 --> 01:13:30,332
coming to terms with and we haven't

1729
01:13:30,332 --> 01:13:30,332
really quite made sense of what the ways

1730
01:13:30,332 --> 01:13:44,469
mean for computation.

1731
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,502
I know that Peter Robinson, who's on the

1732
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:47,502
slide here has written a couple of papers

1733
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:47,502
talking about how these fields can relate

1734
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:47,502
to predictions but yeah, I think this is

1735
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:47,502
kind of a very new exciting area that is

1736
01:13:47,502 --> 01:14:02,592
worth exploring.

1737
01:14:02,599 --> 01:14:05,628
Daniel: Yeah, one kind of connection

1738
01:14:05,628 --> 01:14:05,628
there is like the standing wave that you

1739
01:14:05,628 --> 01:14:11,689
showed in the physical water pool.

1740
01:14:12,695 --> 01:14:15,724
And so now when we're looking at a solid

1741
01:14:15,724 --> 01:14:15,724
color visually and there's some stable

1742
01:14:15,724 --> 01:14:15,724
non equilibrium steady state or stable

1743
01:14:15,724 --> 01:14:15,724
representation or stable population code

1744
01:14:15,724 --> 01:14:15,724
or all these different things which may

1745
01:14:15,724 --> 01:14:15,724
not be exhaustive or incompatible like at

1746
01:14:15,724 --> 01:14:33,900
all, but there's some standing wave.

1747
01:14:33,901 --> 01:14:36,938
Now maybe that is component number 99,

1748
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:40,970
just like principal component 99.

1749
01:14:40,971 --> 01:14:43,006
Its amplitude might be small but there's

1750
01:14:43,006 --> 01:14:43,006
like some mode that's ramping up and it's

1751
01:14:43,006 --> 01:14:43,006
associated positively or it's ramping

1752
01:14:43,006 --> 01:14:51,083
down.

1753
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:53,100
It's associated negatively.

1754
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:58,152
And there's some standing pattern that

1755
01:14:58,152 --> 01:14:58,152
amidst the pelting of new sensory

1756
01:14:58,152 --> 01:14:58,152
observations in like a Bayesian updating

1757
01:14:58,152 --> 01:15:07,188
setting, it is remaining the same.

1758
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:09,205
Now the more inertia you have on the

1759
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:09,205
distribution, the more stable it's going

1760
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:11,227
to be.

1761
01:15:11,228 --> 01:15:13,246
Which is like equivalent to saying the

1762
01:15:13,246 --> 01:15:13,246
less attention you pay to sensory stimuli,

1763
01:15:13,246 --> 01:15:13,246
, the more stable your priors are going

1764
01:15:13,246 --> 01:15:17,288
to be.

1765
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:21,320
It could be a prior about perception,

1766
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:21,320
could be a prior about action and there

1767
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:27,385
are descending motor patterns as well.

1768
01:15:27,386 --> 01:15:30,413
And all these different modes are being

1769
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:30,413
played like in an apartment building and

1770
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:30,413
there's like different songs but they're

1771
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:30,413
happening in different frequency, spatial,

1772
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:30,413
, temporal and frequency bands so that we

1773
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:30,413
can tune in to different songs like

1774
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:30,413
different radio stations, but with more

1775
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:48,594
spatial richness.

1776
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:55,663
It's a total expansion of the palate that

1777
01:15:55,663 --> 01:15:55,663
recapitulates certain aspects of topology

1778
01:15:55,663 --> 01:15:55,663
and helps us even identify residuals that

1779
01:15:55,663 --> 01:16:08,734
are most apt to be explained that way.

1780
01:16:09,746 --> 01:16:12,778
But it also opens up to these big waves

1781
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:12,778
that get filtered out, like by low pass,

1782
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:12,778
potentially filtering in different data

1783
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:12,778
sets so that shorter term relationships

1784
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:25,901
can become more apparent.

1785
01:16:25,905 --> 01:16:28,935
But that can be the ripple on the wave

1786
01:16:28,935 --> 01:16:28,935
and so end up throwing out a huge amount

1787
01:16:28,935 --> 01:16:28,935
just of the sheer information content of

1788
01:16:28,935 --> 01:16:37,023
rich, dynamical data sets.

1789
01:16:43,082 --> 01:16:46,109
James: Yeah, really interesting concept,

1790
01:16:46,109 --> 01:16:48,132
trying to wrap my head around it.

1791
01:16:49,149 --> 01:16:52,179
Yes, it's really cool because again, we

1792
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:52,179
still don't know because what we found is

1793
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:52,179
that for example, in different task data

1794
01:16:52,179 --> 01:16:52,179
that we have, not all modes are equally

1795
01:16:52,179 --> 01:17:03,220
excited.

1796
01:17:03,221 --> 01:17:05,247
Certain modes are excited in quite

1797
01:17:05,247 --> 01:17:05,247
different ways and we don't know yet what

1798
01:17:05,247 --> 01:17:10,298
these combinations mean.

1799
01:17:10,299 --> 01:17:14,331
Truly behaviorally, cognitively.

1800
01:17:16,351 --> 01:17:20,390
But yeah, we'll keep working on it as

1801
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:23,420
palace and see what happens.

1802
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:27,462
Dean: That's one more quick question.

1803
01:17:27,467 --> 01:17:30,494
I appreciate the geometry part of it.

1804
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:38,577
So does any of this speak also to sort of

1805
01:17:38,577 --> 01:17:38,577
the tunneling effects of that eigenvalue

1806
01:17:38,577 --> 01:17:38,577
or eigen mode eigenvalue quantum piece

1807
01:17:38,577 --> 01:17:38,577
where you can be riding the surface of

1808
01:17:38,577 --> 01:17:38,577
this and appreciating that the

1809
01:17:38,577 --> 01:17:38,577
parsimonious speak to that surface

1810
01:17:38,577 --> 01:18:03,764
effect?

1811
01:18:04,771 --> 01:18:07,807
Is there anything about this that also

1812
01:18:07,807 --> 01:18:07,807
helps us understand better how something

1813
01:18:07,807 --> 01:18:07,807
goes through the wave, like quite

1814
01:18:07,807 --> 01:18:07,807
literally across from one slope, past the

1815
01:18:07,807 --> 01:18:21,948
crown and onto the other side?

1816
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:24,974
Or is that again something that you guys

1817
01:18:24,974 --> 01:18:24,974
weren't really spending a lot of time

1818
01:18:24,974 --> 01:18:27,000
on?

1819
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,002
But I did notice, I pulled up the paper

1820
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:29,002
and I noticed on page eleven you were

1821
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:29,002
talking about some of the ways that you

1822
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:36,009
were analyzing the volumes.

1823
01:18:36,009 --> 01:18:39,012
So that's the context that I was curious

1824
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:39,012
about, that sort of tunneling piece to go

1825
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:39,012
along with how we sort of follow the

1826
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:47,020
patterns on the surface.

1827
01:18:52,025 --> 01:18:54,027
Alex: I'm not quite sure I follow you're

1828
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
asking.

1829
01:18:57,030 --> 01:19:01,028
Daniel: Let me try to see where it comes

1830
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
as I see it, Dean's, a quantum tunneling

1831
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
connoisseur post even and with the basis

1832
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
set of the sine wave, it's like imposing

1833
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
this kind of oscillatory pattern and then

1834
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:20,047
you're up, waiting or downweighting.

1835
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:23,050
But is it possible to use a basis set or

1836
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,050
is it possible to detect modes in your

1837
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,050
analysis where there's an effect locally

1838
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,050
and then there's like a tunnel and there'

1839
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,050
's like a region that the wave doesn't

1840
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:35,062
appear to pass through?

1841
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:47,074
Dean: By the way.

1842
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,075
Thank you, Daniel.

1843
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,085
James: Stumped.

1844
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:00,081
Alex: I guess it means on what you mean

1845
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:01,082
by tunneling, right?

1846
01:20:01,082 --> 01:20:04,085
So, like each mode, like if you look at

1847
01:20:04,085 --> 01:20:04,085
the high frequency modes, they are quite

1848
01:20:04,085 --> 01:20:04,085
patchy and so there'll be sort of

1849
01:20:04,085 --> 01:20:04,085
disjointed areas of high amplitude and

1850
01:20:04,085 --> 01:20:04,085
low amplitude, but they fluctuate in time,

1851
01:20:04,085 --> 01:20:14,095
, right?

1852
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:16,097
Like they're standing waves.

1853
01:20:16,097 --> 01:20:18,099
And so they'll kind of alternate up and

1854
01:20:18,099 --> 01:20:19,100
down.

1855
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:21,102
So in a sense it looks like there's

1856
01:20:21,102 --> 01:20:21,102
coupling over long distances, but that's

1857
01:20:21,102 --> 01:20:21,102
just due to the standing wave dynamics,

1858
01:20:21,102 --> 01:20:21,102
which is just driven by the interference

1859
01:20:21,102 --> 01:20:32,113
pattern of the traveling waves.

1860
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:35,116
So I'm not sure if that's kind of what

1861
01:20:35,116 --> 01:20:35,116
you were getting at, but I guess from a

1862
01:20:35,116 --> 01:20:35,116
perspective of just if you were just

1863
01:20:35,116 --> 01:20:35,116
looking at the standing wave dynamics, it

1864
01:20:35,116 --> 01:20:35,116
would look like things in spatially

1865
01:20:35,116 --> 01:20:35,116
disjoint locations were kind of coupled

1866
01:20:35,116 --> 01:20:49,130
in some way.

1867
01:20:51,132 --> 01:20:55,136
Daniel: It's like one jello, it stays put

1868
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:55,136
where you hit it and it stays put 1 mile

1869
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:55,136
away and it oscillates between like a

1870
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:55,136
jump rope or it could be it somewhere

1871
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:55,136
that's also very variable, then be like

1872
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:55,136
the opposite of a jump rope with one mode.

1873
01:20:55,136 --> 01:21:12,147
.

1874
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:16,151
And that's what's captured in the set of

1875
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:18,153
functions that are then parameterized.

1876
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:23,158
So then when you assemble them or when

1877
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:23,158
you superimpose them, you could get kind

1878
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:23,158
of digitized looking outcome patterns in

1879
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:23,158
terms of the real empirical correlations

1880
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:40,175
and it's map, not territory.

1881
01:21:40,175 --> 01:21:43,178
And it's tempting to interpret these very

1882
01:21:43,178 --> 01:21:43,178
literally as with many statistical tools.

1883
01:21:43,178 --> 01:21:45,180
.

1884
01:21:46,181 --> 01:21:48,183
When I think, as we've discussed, there's

1885
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:48,183
multiple possible mechanisms and in your

1886
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:48,183
paper and in your work, you've probably

1887
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:48,183
thought of many, many mechanisms that

1888
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:48,183
lend themselves to unique empirical

1889
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:58,193
predictions.

1890
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:04,193
But basis set decomposition is used like

1891
01:22:04,193 --> 01:22:04,193
in SPM, which is kind of like one of the

1892
01:22:04,193 --> 01:22:11,200
precedents of active inference.

1893
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,202
And the work by Karl Frist and others, it'

1894
01:22:13,202 --> 01:22:15,204
's using basis sets as.

1895
01:22:20,209 --> 01:22:21,210
Alex: They used.

1896
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:22,211
They use it everywhere.

1897
01:22:25,214 --> 01:22:28,217
Daniel: Do you have any closing or near

1898
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:28,217
closing thoughts or where does the work

1899
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:32,221
go?

1900
01:22:33,222 --> 01:22:35,224
What data sets are salient or questions

1901
01:22:35,224 --> 01:22:35,224
or cognitive phenomena or what are you

1902
01:22:35,224 --> 01:22:35,224
excited about for your lab and for the

1903
01:22:35,224 --> 01:22:40,229
fields.

1904
01:22:43,232 --> 01:22:44,233
James: Your lab?

1905
01:22:47,236 --> 01:22:50,239
Alex: There's a few different ways that

1906
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,241
we're interested in progressing it.

1907
01:22:53,242 --> 01:22:56,245
So one is, I guess, trying to reconcile

1908
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:56,245
this purely geometric approach that makes

1909
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:56,245
a very simple approximation with

1910
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:56,245
connectivity, with the actual

1911
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:56,245
connectivity of the brain, and trying to

1912
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:56,245
understand if the contributions of these

1913
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:56,245
kind of complex connections are not so

1914
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:56,245
easily revealed by a classic fMRI

1915
01:22:56,245 --> 01:23:14,257
experiment.

1916
01:23:14,257 --> 01:23:16,259
What are their contributions to

1917
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:17,260
dynamics?

1918
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:20,263
And is there a way of kind of bringing

1919
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:20,263
some of that complex connectivity into

1920
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:20,263
the wave model and trying to get some

1921
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:27,270
traction on that question?

1922
01:23:30,273 --> 01:23:34,277
Another aspect is we've done the simplest

1923
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:35,278
thing.

1924
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:37,280
We treat all areas of the cortex as

1925
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:37,280
homogeneous, but we know that's not the

1926
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,283
case.

1927
01:23:41,284 --> 01:23:44,286
Areas vary in terms of the cell density,

1928
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:44,286
degree of myelination, level of synaptic

1929
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:49,292
complexity and density and so on.

1930
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:51,294
And so that, in a sense, could be

1931
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:52,295
imagined.

1932
01:23:52,295 --> 01:23:54,297
You could imagine that as changing the

1933
01:23:54,297 --> 01:23:55,298
effective geometry of the cortex.

1934
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:57,300
And so we're playing around with how do

1935
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:57,300
you introduce that heterogeneity and how

1936
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:57,300
does that change the mode structure and

1937
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:57,300
does that have an impact on your ability

1938
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:06,303
to reconstruct dynamics?

1939
01:24:08,305 --> 01:24:11,308
We're then also interested in sort of

1940
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
taking this forward to leverage these

1941
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
approaches for thinking about different

1942
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
ways in which we might be able to map

1943
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
brain changes in different disorders or

1944
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:23,320
variations across species and so on.

1945
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,322
And so kind of like classical SPM

1946
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:25,322
analyses, but making inference at the

1947
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:25,322
modal level and seeing if that can

1948
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:34,331
provide some useful insights.

1949
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:37,334
So there's a few different strategies.

1950
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:44,341
Daniel: Any other comments or thoughts?

1951
01:24:46,343 --> 01:24:46,343
Alex: No.

1952
01:24:46,343 --> 01:24:48,345
Daniel: Dean, where do you go after

1953
01:24:48,345 --> 01:24:48,345
this?

1954
01:24:48,345 --> 01:24:49,346
Dean?

1955
01:24:49,346 --> 01:24:52,349
In your own neuroimaging career?

1956
01:24:52,349 --> 01:24:53,350
Dean: No.

1957
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:53,350
Stop it.

1958
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:55,352
I just think it was a very clear picture.

1959
01:24:55,352 --> 01:24:55,352
.

1960
01:24:55,352 --> 01:24:59,356
And again, I really appreciated the paper

1961
01:24:59,356 --> 01:24:59,356
itself, but today's presentation sort of

1962
01:24:59,356 --> 01:25:05,356
brought it to life and made it.

1963
01:25:06,357 --> 01:25:10,361
I know that you guys were really trying

1964
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,361
to focus on making sure that you got all

1965
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,361
of your formalities in a row, but just

1966
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,361
the way you presented it today made it

1967
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,361
even more come alive in terms of the

1968
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,361
mechanisms that you use to sort of come

1969
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:30,381
up with a clearer picture.

1970
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:32,383
That's what I came away with.

1971
01:25:32,383 --> 01:25:34,385
So, again, thank you very much.

1972
01:25:35,386 --> 01:25:35,386
Alex: Cool.

1973
01:25:35,386 --> 01:25:37,388
James: Thanks for the invitation.

1974
01:25:37,388 --> 01:25:37,388
Alex: Thank you.

1975
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:38,389
Yeah.

1976
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:40,391
Daniel: We'll look forward to seeing the

1977
01:25:40,391 --> 01:25:42,393
continuation of this trajectory.

1978
01:25:42,393 --> 01:25:43,394
You're always welcome.

1979
01:25:43,394 --> 01:25:44,395
Come back.

1980
01:25:44,395 --> 01:25:46,397
So thank you both.

1981
01:25:47,398 --> 01:25:47,398
James: Thank you.

1982
01:25:47,398 --> 01:25:48,399
Alex: Thanks, guys.

1983
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:48,399
Daniel: See you.

1984
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:49,400
Bye.
