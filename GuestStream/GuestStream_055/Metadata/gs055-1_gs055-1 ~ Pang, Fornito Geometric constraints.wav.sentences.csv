2450	4014	2	B	0.9999	Hello and welcome everyone.
4132	7358	3	B	1	This is Active Inference guest stream number 55.1.
7444	10126	4	B	0.55087	It's August 30, 2023.
10308	20910	5	B	0.77	Today we are going to have a presentation followed by a discussion on geometric constraints on human brain function by James Pang and Alex Fornito.
21890	24350	6	B	0.99999	Thank you again for joining.
24890	27618	7	B	0.95323	Really looking forward to the presentation and the discussion.
27714	32150	8	B	0.99573	So please off to you two to introduce yourself and continue however you like.
32220	33000	9	B	0.99888	Thank you.
33850	35666	10	A	0.62065	Well, thanks very much, Daniel.
35858	37394	11	A	0.99966	My name is Alex Fornito.
37442	49260	12	A	0.91738	I'm based in the School of Psychological Sciences and Turn Institute for Brain and Mental Health at Monash University, and James Penn, who is a research fellow working in the team.
49790	55326	13	A	0.95	And so the idea today was that we were going to talk a little bit about this work.
55428	67860	14	A	0.77803	I'll begin by providing a bit of a historical and theoretical background and then James will take over and jump into the specifics of what we did and what we found.
69910	87080	15	A	0.89756	We're assuming some basic understanding of neuroscience and some elements of human brain imaging and we'll go through a little bit of maths, but hopefully it'll be enough to give a picture and if there's any questions about it afterwards, we'll be happy to try and answer them.
88350	98250	16	A	0.99997	So a key motivating factor for this work is really trying to understand how the structure or anatomy of the brain constrains its function.
98400	106714	17	A	1	And if you look at a diverse range of systems found throughout nature, we know that the structure of the system can change its dynamics.
106762	115700	18	A	0.99983	So, for example, the shape of a racing car will influence its aerodynamics and how fast it can go.
116390	125166	19	A	1	The folding patterns of a protein will influence the other proteins that it can interact with and have quite large effects.
125198	133010	20	A	0.98691	So here, for example, we've got example of the hemoglobin protein in a healthy person and someone with sickle cell anemia.
133090	138150	21	A	1	And this change in the geometry of the protein leads to a 20 year difference in life expectancy.
139390	144598	22	A	1	And here we've got the molecular structures of diamond and graphite.
144694	149398	23	A	0.71097	So both of these materials are made of the same atoms.
149414	150966	24	A	0.61793	They're all purely carbon atoms.
150998	153710	25	A	0.9999	It's just the bonds between them that are different.
153860	160634	26	A	1	And that difference is sufficient to create quite a variation in the properties of the material.
160682	173166	27	A	0.99994	So diamond being one of the hardest substances on Earth and valued at somewhere between twelve to $90 million per kilo, whereas graphite is one of the most brittle and only costs you about $20 per kilo.
173358	181560	28	A	1	And so this is essentially the reason why we don't propose to people with H two B pencil, we use diamond rings instead.
183930	185942	29	A	1	Now, the brain is no different.
185996	195738	30	A	0.99927	We think anatomy constraints function, but there has been a long standing debate about the specific properties that are the most relevant and how we should best conceptualize them.
195824	211546	31	A	0.98	And this can be traced back to the days of Ramani Kahal and Camilla Golgi, two people considered to be some of the founding fathers of modern neuroscience, golgi developed a technique for staining neurons that allowed you to visualize their structure under the microscope.
211658	224260	32	A	0.98	And Cahal really perfected that technique and studied the nervous system in extensive detail and really laid down the foundations for what we think about the anatomy of the brain to this day.
225350	231026	33	A	1	Now, both of these men were recognized for their efforts in 1906 with a Nobel prize.
231138	237954	34	A	1	But even at the award ceremony, when giving their lectures, they were in bitter disagreement.
238082	251414	35	A	0.98745	So if you actually look at the recordings of their lectures, cahal says, we applied Golgi's method, and our observations revealed, in my opinion, the terminal arrangement of the nerve fibers.
251542	256442	36	A	0.99943	Nerve elements possess reciprocal relationships in continuity, but not in continuity.
256586	266686	37	A	0.79526	So here he's saying that cells are fundamentally discrete elements separated in physical space and that there's a gap between them at the synapse.
266718	270690	38	A	1	The synaptic cleft and signaling occurs through this gap.
272310	274562	39	A	0.12269	Olga, on the other hand, didn't agree.
274696	286834	40	A	0.99935	He said, while I admire the brilliancy of the doctrine, which is a worthy product of the high intellect of my illustrious Spanish colleague, I cannot agree with him on some points of an anatomical nature, which are for the theory of fundamental importance.
286962	293466	41	A	1	I found myself unable to follow the current of opinion because I was confronted by one concrete anatomical fact.
293648	298730	42	A	0.72	This was the existence of the formation, which I have called the diffuse nerve network.
299070	302582	43	A	0.82	And so, for Golgi, all the cells were continuous.
302646	304522	44	A	0.99983	They form one continuous network.
304586	311870	45	A	0.99988	There was no point of separation between them, and signaling occurred through this continuous network.
313350	324018	46	A	1	Now, ultimately, a growing body of evidence, and you can see it in Golgi's statements, was starting to favor Cahal's model.
324184	335510	47	A	0.99945	But really, it was only resolved in the 1940s with the advent of electron microscopy, where people could actually resolve synapses and saw that they were spatially disjoint.
335930	344940	48	A	1	And this ultimately established the neuron doctrine as the fundamental theory about how the nerve, the system is organized at a cellular level.
346510	364126	49	A	0.97	And this basic idea that we can divide the brain up into discrete units was then carried through to different scales, most famously by Corbinian Broadman, who developed a parcellation of the cortex based on cyto architectonic grounds.
364318	376040	50	A	0.99998	His idea was that different parts of the cortex have different cellular properties, and so they define these discrete areas that are functionally specialized in some way.
377850	382806	51	A	0.99	And certainly this has been a very influential idea in neuroscience ever since.
382988	406234	52	A	0.98992	But around the same time, in fact, a couple of years earlier, the neurologist Alfred Campbell published his own cytoacyctonic map, and he agreed that you could identify discrete boundaries largely in primary zones, but then in the cortex in between, it was a lot more difficult to find sharp outlines or boundaries.
406362	412190	53	A	1	And he suggested that actually the changes were more gradual or continuous in nature.
414310	426534	54	A	0.80668	Broadman's view became more popular and certainly became sort of the dominant theory in neuroscience, even though subsequent attempts to try to replicate it were different.
426572	431880	55	A	0.99	And so different anatomists would parcelate the brain in different ways, using different boundaries and so on.
432730	451770	56	A	0.91376	But nonetheless, this kind of congruence between the discrete model of cahal and discrete model of Broadman eventually led to the idea that essentially we can think about the brain as a multiscale network where at the cellular level we can identify discrete cells that are connected by synapses.
451930	466654	57	A	1	Then we can scale up at the population level at a mesoscale resolution and identify how population of cells are linked by bundles of axons and then all the way through to the macro scales, which is what you sort of see when you look at one of Broadman's maps.
466702	473570	58	A	1	You have these broad, roughly so architectonic areas connected by white matter bundles.
475450	491554	59	A	0.99	And in the last two or so decades we've had the measurement techniques for characterizing these networks on a vast scale and there's been a pretty well established pipeline for mapping these networks.
491682	498534	60	A	0.51541	So the basic idea is that we have the brain, we divide it up into these discrete areas and they act as our network nodes.
498662	504078	61	A	1	And then for every pair of nodes we measure some aspect of structural or functional connectivity between them.
504164	507710	62	A	0.99999	Functional connectivity being some aspect of coupling in activity.
508050	511930	63	A	1	And then we can represent that in the form of a connectivity matrix.
512010	522302	64	A	0.99966	So each row and column represents a different region and each element tells you about the type and strength of connectivity between areas that can equivalently be represented as a graph.
522366	531590	65	A	1	And then with that graph representation, we can apply all sorts of different analytic tools to understand different aspects about how the network is connected and organized.
532810	540920	66	A	0.99	And this basic approach has been used quite extensively to understand how the underlying anatomical properties of the network constrain function.
541230	542806	67	A	1	This is one of my favorite examples.
542838	547530	68	A	1	This was a study of two different worms, c Elegance and P Pacificus.
547870	553414	69	A	0.99999	Both of their nervous systems in the head have been mapped at the level of each cell and synapse and they're actually identical.
553462	559534	70	A	0.99992	So they've got the same type of cells, the same number of cells, it's just the connectivity between them that's different.
559572	563778	71	A	0.89	And that's what you see in this network projection here that the topology of the network is different.
563944	578146	72	A	0.97	And in this study they showed that changes in the connectivity of just two hub neurons were sufficient to elicit a difference in the behavior of the animals, such that P Pacificus is a predator of sea elegance.
578178	582150	73	A	0.99	And here you can see Pacificus eating poor sea elegance for lunch.
583930	591626	74	A	1	Now, we can't lock humans up in a room and see who eats who and try to understand how their anatomy constraints function in that way.
591648	599002	75	A	0.99983	But we can do things like use MRI to measure anatomical connectivity and functional connectivity and correlate the two.
599056	603520	76	A	1	And it's pretty consistent finding that we generally find there is a correlation between them.
604210	609674	77	A	0.99999	We can run computational models where we have a structural network, we simulate the activity.
609722	613434	78	A	1	Then we apply, say, a lesion to that network and look at the effects on the activity.
613482	622500	79	A	1	And we can show, for example, that if you lesion a hub area you have quite a dramatic impact on brain function compared to if you lesion a more weakly connected non hub area.
623190	624814	80	A	0.58	Or we could use clinical studies.
624862	634342	81	A	1	We could look at cases where there are naturally arising lesions through stroke or some other form of brain damage and we can understand the functional impairments that result.
634396	649050	82	A	0.98765	So, for example, in this case, people with lesions to certain types of hub areas with diffuse connectivity showed much more generalized cognitive impairments than people with lesions to areas with more specific patterns of connectivity.
650450	651470	83	A	0.99967	So this is great.
651540	660078	84	A	1	This has been really informative and great for understanding the role of individual brain regions or connections in brain function.
660244	668654	85	A	0.99999	But it doesn't really give us a coherent, unified perspective about how dynamics emerge from the underlying structure.
668702	670530	86	A	0.99841	It's all a little bit piecemeal.
671190	690060	87	A	0.53	Now, if we want to develop such a coherent understanding we can draw some inspiration from different physics and engineering where typically the structural constraints on the dynamics of a system are studied by understanding the eigenmodes of the system.
691070	697114	88	A	0.68	Now, the eigen modes of a system are found by solving an eigenvalue problem such as this one.
697232	708282	89	A	0.99978	So an eigenvector we can think of as something that we measure about a system that doesn't change its direction if it's subjected to some kind of transformation.
708426	711786	90	A	0.99971	So if that's the case, then this equality holds.
711818	719250	91	A	0.99972	So the idea here is that PSI is our vector, something we measure about the system subjected to some transformation L.
719400	727974	92	A	1	And if PSI is an eigenvector, then the transformed eigenvector is equal to the eigenvector just scaled by some value.
728092	733778	93	A	0.9939	So the transformation can scale the vector, but it doesn't change its direction.
733954	740330	94	A	1	And so if that's the case, then this scaling factor, lambda, is what we call an eigenvalue and PSI is an eigenvector.
741230	746406	95	A	1	This kind of equation is applied to a lot of different systems and a lot of different contexts.
746518	764394	96	A	0.99918	But when we're studying the eigen modes of a system, typically our L term here is an operator called the Laplacian operator which essentially describes how smoothly some kind of structural property of the system varies through an appropriate spatial embedding.
764522	775490	97	A	0.99495	So I'll come back a little bit to what that means because we can make different choices for what we use in L and that determines the specific anatomical properties that we prioritize.
776170	792410	98	A	0.99977	But for now, I just want to emphasize that a key property of these eigenvectors is that they're orthogonal and so that then we can use them as a basis set for reconstructing different activity patterns that we might see in the network.
793710	799626	99	A	0.98469	So I guess the most famous example of a basis set that many people will be familiar with is a Fourier set.
799728	809242	100	A	0.99698	So, for example, here we have some one dimensional signal, and we can decompose that signal as a weighted sum of sine and cosine functions of varying frequencies.
809386	815114	101	A	0.99995	So here you've got the different functions, different frequencies, and here you've got some weighting factors.
815162	819330	102	A	1	And we can reconstruct this signal as a weighted sum of these functions.
819830	826578	103	A	0.99995	In a similar way, we can extract our Eigen modes of the brain based on some particular anatomical property.
826744	834770	104	A	1	And we end up with these spatial patterns here that are organized again in terms of spatial frequency or the wavelength of fluctuation.
834850	847050	105	A	0.99999	So here you can see we've got a very low frequency fluctuation moving from back to front, top to bottom, medial, lateral, and then as you move up, you get these more high frequency fluctuations.
847470	853386	106	A	0.7	And so then we can use these patterns to reconstruct any spatial map that we observe on the brain.
853418	857706	107	A	0.80447	So it could be a map of brain activity recorded during a particular task.
857738	862538	108	A	1	It could be, say, a map of cortical thickness variations or gray matter volume variations.
862714	867146	109	A	0.56877	It's sufficiently general to allow you to reconstruct any type of map.
867258	869646	110	A	0.69	And so we can do that just as a weighted sum.
869678	877190	111	A	0.99998	So here Y represents our map, and then we represent that as a weighted sum of our modes with the A coefficients representing the weights.
881290	889666	112	A	0.76837	Sorry, I should emphasize that that explanation can be a little bit abstract for people who aren't familiar with Eigen modes.
889698	893222	113	A	1	And it is always a bit of a challenge to get an intuition.
893286	899274	114	A	1	And so you can do what one of the people in the team did and asked Chat GPT to explain eigenmodes to a ten year old.
899312	901642	115	A	1	And it turns out that it does a pretty good job.
901696	904894	116	A	1	I was quite happy with this explanation, so I thought I'd share it.
905092	910058	117	A	0.98681	So our Chat GPT says, of course, let's imagine we have a wobbly jiggly bowl of jelly.
910154	912478	118	A	0.99985	When you poke it, it wiggles and shakes, right?
912644	920802	119	A	1	Now, imagine if you poke the jelly in different spots or with different amounts of force, each time you poke it differently, the jelly wiggles and shakes in a different way.
920936	922994	120	A	0.46315	Eigenmos are like those different ways.
923032	925620	121	A	1	The jelly wiggles and shakes when you poke it.
926470	931222	122	A	0.99832	So essentially, seeing this video here, the jelly is poked and it wobbles in a particular way.
931276	937830	123	A	1	If you poke the jelly in a different spot or with a different amount of force, you'll trigger a different pattern of vibration.
938170	943814	124	A	1	And so commonly, Eigen modes are used in the context of systems that vibrate.
943942	954800	125	A	0.99	And the idea is these Eigen modes correspond to preferred patterns of vibration when the system is perturbed, and those preferred patterns are just dictated by the structural properties of that system.
955490	965682	126	A	0.79961	We can extend it more generally and think about it more as how a system responds to any type of excitation and how an excitation spreads through some connected system.
965736	969742	127	A	0.97	And the Eigen modes correspond to the preferred patterns of excitation.
969886	972820	128	A	0.99987	Again determined by the physical properties of the system.
975590	991754	129	A	0.97513	So naturally, given everything we've been talking about and these ideas that the brain is a multiscale network, we need to make a choice about how we define alloplastian what specific anatomical properties are we going to extract our eigen modes from?
991872	996170	130	A	1	And so a natural choice would be to extract them from brain connectivity.
996510	999642	131	A	0.99	And we can do this quite in a reasonably straightforward way.
999696	1002682	132	A	0.99987	We get some map of the connections in the brain.
1002826	1005834	133	A	0.9998	We map connectivity between every pair of nodes.
1005882	1009466	134	A	0.99999	After we apply some discretization, we define our discrete nodes.
1009498	1011546	135	A	0.99999	We map every pair of connections.
1011738	1013782	136	A	0.97873	We represent that in the form of a matrix.
1013866	1016802	137	A	1	And then we extract this quantity here.
1016856	1018718	138	A	0.9998	It's called a graph Laplacian.
1018894	1022866	139	A	1	The details are not so important, but that's essentially our l operator here.
1022968	1029510	140	A	1	And it describes how smoothly connectivity varies as we move from node to node in the network.
1031050	1041466	141	A	1	And when we do that, several studies have shown that you can use the eigen modes extracted from this graphaloplassian to reconstruct kind of classic functional networks that you record.
1041568	1049718	142	A	0.6	With functional MRI, we can reconstruct different patterns of functional connectivity between pairs of areas.
1049894	1053546	143	A	1	You can use it to reconstruct different eg signals.
1053738	1064450	144	A	1	And people have even shown that you can make predictions about the pattern of neurodegeneration that you see in different forms of dementia.
1065510	1077906	145	A	0.99745	So this has been really fantastic important work and a really important proof of principle that this eigenmode framework can be used to understand how the structure of the system constrains its dynamics.
1078018	1092170	146	A	1	And in each case, the interpretation is that these dynamical patterns that we see with fMRI or EEG or so on, are reflecting excitations of these underlying eigen modes or the resonant modes of the anatomy of the brain.
1094190	1100294	147	A	1	This view very much aligns with what we would think of as a classical view of brain organization that I've just been discussing.
1100342	1108778	148	A	0.98695	So, following from Cahal and Broadman's work, the idea is that at lots of different scales, we can divide the brain up into discrete areas.
1108874	1116770	149	A	0.99631	They're connected in some way and it's the signaling along these connections between these discrete areas that drives activity.
1118310	1133510	150	A	0.99976	But there are reasons to think that, particularly at coarser scales, so we know at the fundamental cellular scale, the network is discrete, but at coarser scales, perhaps a different set of approximations might be useful.
1133850	1146646	151	A	0.99989	So if you look at dense reconstructions of neuronal tissue, so this is, say, with electron microscopy, you find that cortical tissue is extremely dense.
1146678	1152270	152	A	0.79338	It's like a really rich, thick forest of cells and their processes.
1153250	1168770	153	A	1	And as we've talked about, there's been a lot of debate about where you can actually draw boundaries between discrete areas and how valid and reliable that is outside some kind of classic examples seen in primary cortex.
1169350	1179314	154	A	1	And if you look more deeply at the cellular organization of specific regions, here on the left we've got the cellular organization and on the right we've got a myelin stain.
1179442	1185366	155	A	1	You see, you get these deep penetrating fibers that are coming in from the white matter.
1185468	1194698	156	A	1	This is what this kind of classic graph approach will pick up because we define our nodes in the cortex and then we're mapping the connections that pass through the white matter.
1194864	1203802	157	A	0.99283	But you can also see that there's a lot of connectivity that's moving horizontally or tangential to the geometry of the cortex.
1203946	1209178	158	A	0.99	And so these horizontal connections allow for the continuous spread of activity.
1209354	1216930	159	A	0.99987	So rather than activity jumping between discrete nodes, it can actually spread as a propagating wave.
1218710	1234226	160	A	0.93	And just to emphasize some of the limitations of the discrete model, not long after Broadman's work, just a couple of decades, the renowned physiologist Lorenzo de Nou was pretty emphatic about his concerns with the approach.
1234338	1245254	161	A	0.99935	He said the only really good cyto architectonic pictures are those of Campbell, who, let me put in capital letters, has been the only cyto architectonist who has described facts and only facts.
1245382	1252880	162	A	1	The German cyto architectonist has mixed facts and theory in such a manner that nobody can tell where facts ends and theories begin.
1253810	1274610	163	A	0.9999	So again, this is just emphasizing the idea that while we might be able to define discrete areas at a mesoscopic or macroscopic resolutions, in some cases, especially around the borders of primary sensory or motor areas, for large swathes of cortex, those distinctions become a little bit blurry.
1277050	1281874	164	A	0.99939	So an alternative approach has emerged out of neural field theory.
1282002	1291318	165	A	0.99997	So neural field theory has been around for several decades now and this is a different approach to thinking about cortical activity.
1291414	1301174	166	A	0.99984	So the basic idea is that instead of dividing the brain into discrete specialized areas or nodes, we can treat the cortex as a continuous sheep.
1301302	1309514	167	A	1	And we are actually interested in trying to capture how patterns of brain activity propagate through that continuous sheet.
1309642	1313966	168	A	0.57	And so this is something that you can see in diverse types of electrophysiological recordings.
1313998	1320734	169	A	0.99913	So this, for example, this video is of the dynamics of voltage sensitive dyes recorded in the mouse brain.
1320862	1336520	170	A	1	And you can see that you observe these propagating waves of excitation that move continuously through the cortex rather than jumping from region to region as would be implied by a kind of strongly discrete model.
1339150	1344970	171	A	0.99896	So a big emphasis in neural field theory is on describing these wavelike propagation patterns.
1345470	1363470	172	A	0.76	And it's been shown in recent theoretical work that if we accept that wavelike propagation drives neuronal activity, then really the eigen modes that we should be extracting or prioritizing are those that are derived from the geometry of the brain.
1363630	1377560	173	A	0.99274	So our eigenvalue becomes this problem here where this operator here is called the LaPlace beltrami operator and it describes how smoothly the geometry or the shape or the curvature of the brain varies through space.
1378090	1389994	174	A	0.76	And just to briefly explain why that's the case, here we've got the wave equation that's used in some forms of neural field theory, at least the divisions that we've been focusing on.
1390112	1402634	175	A	1	And so the basic idea is that the firing rate of a given population of neurons B at location R and T is given by the Afferent field of incoming populations.
1402682	1404062	176	A	0.85431	So other populations A.
1404116	1411520	177	A	0.82682	So we've got other populations providing this Afferent field of activity that determines the firing rate of B.
1412210	1419730	178	A	1	And obviously, we then need to describe what this afferent field looks like and that's given by this part of the equation here.
1419880	1424210	179	A	0.79036	So on the left here, this set of terms describes how the field evolves through time.
1424280	1433640	180	A	0.99991	We're not going to focus on that today over here, which is what we're interested in, where we've got how the field is evolving through space.
1434170	1441158	181	A	0.98	And so here we can see our friend, the LaPlace Beltrami operator, which describes the geometry.
1441254	1445370	182	A	0.56	And here we've got the length scale of axonal connectivity.
1445710	1448566	183	A	0.99979	In this model, we make a very simple assumption about connectivity.
1448598	1454430	184	A	0.99999	We assume each point is connected to its neighbors in a distance dependent and isotropic way.
1454580	1457242	185	A	0.99	And that distance dependence is roughly exponential.
1457306	1467410	186	A	0.99942	So the idea is that areas nearby to a given location R will have a strong influence and that influence declines roughly exponentially as a function of distance.
1468150	1473140	187	A	1	And the speed of that decay is given by this R term here.
1473830	1477546	188	A	0.93	You can see that geometry is firmly embedded in this equation.
1477678	1482022	189	A	1	Now, I should point out this isn't something that's just been plucked out of thin air.
1482076	1489738	190	A	1	This is a damped wave equation that has been used for centuries to describe wave dynamics in all sorts of different media.
1489904	1498918	191	A	1	And so from that physics, we know very well that the geometry of the system constrains the spatial properties of wave propagation.
1499094	1503470	192	A	0.99	And you can start from first principles of neuronal biophysics and derive this equation.
1506290	1515290	193	A	0.98	And given all that work, we know that the eigen modes of the LaPlace Beltrami operator actually correspond to the standing waves of the dynamics.
1515370	1516830	194	A	0.99623	So what are standing waves?
1516990	1521186	195	A	0.9998	So in this simple example, we've got two traveling waves here, a blue and a green.
1521368	1533800	196	A	1	And as they interact with each other, you get these patterns of constructive and destructive interference represented by this red line here, that cause these very large amplitude fluctuations that are fixed in space.
1534250	1538050	197	A	0.98741	So they're not actually traveling like the original carrier waves, they're fixed in space.
1538140	1540230	198	A	0.99986	So that's why they're called standing waves.
1540390	1542534	199	A	0.99	And they're a nice example of resonance.
1542662	1550342	200	A	0.99993	So these fluctuations in the red trace are much larger in amplitude than the original carrier waves.
1550406	1555326	201	A	0.93034	So it's an example of resonance where we're getting a larger response in the system than the energy that we put in.
1555508	1562382	202	A	1	And just to convince you that this is something real here, for example, we have a pool of water, a classic wave system.
1562516	1569026	203	A	0.6	If you apply vibrations at a specific point in the pool, you see these waves that travel out.
1569128	1572606	204	A	0.99998	They hit the opposite wall, reflect back and start to interact.
1572718	1582470	205	A	1	And then you see the emergence of these standing wave patterns that are fixed in space but show these very large scale amplitude fluctuations.
1584250	1586946	206	A	0.99988	Another classic example is the Cladney plate.
1586978	1597130	207	A	0.99897	So if you arrange dust particles on a plate and then you apply some vibration at a particular frequency, the dust particles will settle into these complex patterns.
1597470	1604190	208	A	1	The pattern is determined by the specific frequency that you apply and specifically where you apply the vibration.
1604530	1608906	209	A	1	And the patterns correspond to the eigen modes of the plate.
1609018	1617780	210	A	1	And again, those patterns are determined by the physical properties of the plate things like its stiffness, its geometry and so on.
1619190	1626738	211	A	1	This is a little bit gratuitous, but you can extend the idea to three dimensions and you can actually cause the particles to levitate.
1626914	1636470	212	A	0.99999	Again, in this case, they're trapped within the nodal lines of sound waves that are being projected in three dimensions.
1639390	1641654	213	A	1	And this does have real world consequences.
1641782	1647180	214	A	0.99994	So this is a video of the Tacoma Narrows bridge in the 1940s.
1648110	1651574	215	A	1	The engineers didn't pay enough attention to eigen modes.
1651622	1659626	216	A	1	And so on this particular day, crosswinds hit the bridge in just the right spots and at just the right frequencies to excite the eigen modes of the bridge.
1659658	1667410	217	A	0.99993	So you triggered these resonant responses and created these large scale amplitude fluctuations that ultimately led to the collapse of the bridge.
1670710	1688946	218	A	0.99974	So hopefully, that background has kind of illustrated that there's sort of two different views of thinking about which anatomical properties of the brain might be more important in constraining dynamics.
1689058	1701230	219	A	0.99966	So on the one hand, we have the classical kind of connectome centric view in which we view the cortex as comprising discrete areas and dynamics are dominated by node to node transmission.
1702050	1708638	220	A	1	The connectivity between areas is topologically complex and not homogeneous, and we very much think that that's very important.
1708724	1710960	221	A	1	And so we prioritize measuring that.
1711490	1717822	222	A	1	We don't really directly account for the spatial embedding of the network or its geometry.
1717886	1720820	223	A	0.99998	We can look at it secondarily, but it's not baked into the model.
1721750	1725266	224	A	1	And because we're interested in connectivity, that means we need to measure it.
1725288	1736550	225	A	0.99983	So from a practical perspective, at least, if you're dealing with neuroimaging data, you need a T one weighted image to measure brain anatomy but also diffusion MRI image to be able to measure brain connectivity.
1738330	1747494	226	A	1	The other perspective, which is a geometrically informed perspective that arises out of neural field theory, views the cortex as a continuous sheet.
1747542	1750986	227	A	0.99959	We're not making distinctions between different areas of the cortex.
1751178	1758362	228	A	1	We think dynamics are dominated by propagating waves of excitation, especially at these mesoscopic and macroscopic scales.
1758506	1764938	229	A	1	We approximate connectivity between different points of the cortex as being homogeneous and distance dependent.
1765114	1769134	230	A	0.99998	So we know that there is a strong distance dependent in connectivity.
1769182	1770626	231	A	1	It doesn't explain everything.
1770728	1774574	232	A	0.99999	So some things are missed, but we know it's certainly an important feature.
1774622	1777918	233	A	0.99992	So then the question is how far we can get with this approximation.
1778094	1788070	234	A	0.99	And a nice feature of this approach is that we are directly accounting for spatial and geometric effects, the physical properties of the brain, which are overlooked by the connectome approach.
1788650	1796026	235	A	0.76	A nice practical benefit of this approach is that because we approximate connectivity in a simple way, we don't actually have to measure it.
1796128	1799686	236	A	1	We can derive our basis set simply by looking at the geometry of the brain.
1799718	1804910	237	A	1	And so we only need a T one weighted scan, which is very standard in MRI experiments.
1806210	1814554	238	A	0.99916	So hopefully that's set the scene for thinking about different anatomical constraints on the brain and which ones we might want to prioritize.
1814682	1816122	239	A	0.97056	I'll now hand over to James.
1816186	1824770	240	A	0.38432	He'll talk about how we went about testing these different ideas and trying to understand which constraints might be more important for dynamics.
1826970	1828390	241	C	0.98112	Thank you, Alex.
1831930	1837474	242	C	0.99779	I'm going to focus more on the things that we found in the paper that we recently published.
1837522	1846186	243	C	1	I think a lot of you have the link for it, but let us know and send us a message if you want to want us for the link.
1846288	1858234	244	C	0.95472	So basically we start with we're trying to answer and test the theory on which modes of the brain could best describe activity measured in FMI.
1858282	1862110	245	C	0.9996	So we'll begin by how do we actually measure these modes.
1862470	1873618	246	C	0.99651	So geometric modes are based on the T one weighted image, which is a standard imaging tool that people use in the field.
1873784	1884246	247	C	1	And you can extract a model of the cortical surface here on the right, and there are robust pipelines to do so.
1884348	1886998	248	C	1	And you can do that on a population average sense.
1887084	1894570	249	C	0.99998	Basically, you get a group template of the surface, or you can do that on an individual basis.
1896350	1904560	250	C	1	On the other hand, connector modes need deficient MRI and a structural MRI because you need to kind of align the two.
1904930	1913330	251	C	1	And then we run a tractography pipeline, basically finding connections between regions in the brain.
1914470	1922510	252	C	1	And then from there you can construct a vertex level or even region level connector matrix.
1922590	1931430	253	C	0.99997	Basically it's a matrix where each element represents the connection of one region or one vertex to another region or another vertex.
1932010	1944970	254	C	0.85	And you feed this cortical surface or this connector matrix in the eigenvalue problem equations that Alex has mentioned in the previous slides.
1945390	1950770	255	C	0.98	And then how do we test the performance of these geometric and connector modes?
1950870	1955680	256	C	0.99999	Basically, we focus a lot on FMI data.
1956210	1963700	257	C	0.99958	So there are several open access data sets that are available.
1964070	1975874	258	C	0.79503	For example, the popular Human Connector Project, which roughly has about 1200 participants, but we focus on 255 participants who are completely unrelated.
1975922	1978530	259	C	0.99815	There are no twins and no siblings.
1978690	1989722	260	C	0.96	And within the Human Connector Project data set for each subject, they have what we call task evoke data.
1989856	2002074	261	C	0.99947	Basically, these are functional activity that was recorded whilst each participant was performing a particular task.
2002122	2008074	262	C	0.97	And Hcp has a suite of seven different tasks, and within each task several.
2008122	2011758	263	C	0.99922	Different contrasts within it.
2011924	2015218	264	C	0.99	And then we also analyze resting state data.
2015304	2021250	265	C	0.99997	Basically, resting state data is where the participant is just inside the scanner and just not doing anything.
2021320	2038550	266	C	1	And you just scan brain activity through time and you can construct a functional connectivity as well, where each element of this matrix represents how correlated the activity is between two regions.
2039130	2043830	267	C	0.77542	We also analyze data from what we call neural vault.
2044190	2051018	268	C	0.99991	It's an open access repository of thousands and thousands of different maps that people have contributed.
2051114	2062670	269	C	0.68	And each map was acquired with distinct experimental protocols and we took about 10,000 of those from Neurovolt.
2063270	2074318	270	C	0.82	And again, the level of heterogeneity in the different tasks is quite remarkable in the Neurovolt.
2074334	2085670	271	C	0.99823	So we wanted to do our analysis on quite different tasks to make sure we are capturing something really meaningful.
2086650	2091562	272	C	0.95741	So just to remind yourselves of what we're going to do next.
2091616	2094842	273	C	0.97467	So basically, Alex already had mentioned this.
2094976	2097974	274	C	0.98	You extract, for example, this spatial map.
2098022	2102890	275	C	0.9954	Say that's the task evolved map and we decompose that into different sets of eigen modes.
2102970	2108350	276	C	0.99988	So these patterns could be the geometric modes or they could be the connector modes.
2108690	2121950	277	C	1	And it will be weighted by a coefficient A, and the weights represent how each mode is expressed for that particular map.
2122110	2142166	278	C	1	And you can truncate the number of modes that you want to use and then you can reconstruct back the data by just taking a linear sum of the coefficient multiplied by the geometric or the connector modes.
2142358	2146886	279	C	0.99985	So what did we find by doing these analyses?
2147078	2154442	280	C	0.99979	So first I'm going to show you how the spatial maps look like in terms of reconstruction.
2154586	2164690	281	C	0.99986	So on the left I'm showing you the different task develop special maps, and these are group average maps for the human connector project data set.
2164840	2168100	282	C	1	And again, these are the seven tasks for that data set.
2168550	2175894	283	C	1	And then we ask, okay, if we use about ten modes, how would this patient map look like?
2175932	2179590	284	C	1	And for this result, we're focusing on the geometric modes.
2180490	2183286	285	C	0.99973	So the reconstruction looks like this.
2183468	2197530	286	C	0.99978	From afar they look quite different, but if you actually look a bit closely, it already captures the kind of the large scale core scale patterns that you can see from the data.
2197600	2199206	287	C	0.99986	For example, this relational map.
2199238	2202670	288	C	1	You can clearly see this deemergence of this big pattern.
2203010	2206926	289	C	1	Now, what happens if we incorporate more modes into it?
2207028	2209870	290	C	0.99963	So we increase the number of modes to 100.
2210020	2225714	291	C	1	And now you can see that the reconstruction almost looks like the empirical data, but there are still subtle differences, especially in the more localized activity, for example, here in the arrows.
2225842	2238114	292	C	1	And if we increase it further, you can see that we can better capture those isolated localized patterns just by increasing it to 200 modes.
2238242	2245738	293	C	0.99996	So you can see that the modes are actually really an efficient basis set for task evoke data.
2245904	2247962	294	C	0.99999	We do the same for resting state data.
2248016	2255274	295	C	0.99999	We increase the number of modes in here and compare the functional connectivity based from the empirical data and the reconstruction.
2255322	2261598	296	C	1	And we see the same thing that as you increase the number of modes to 200, we can capture the empirical data.
2261764	2280786	297	C	1	And you can do this in a more systematic way by calculating how well can we reconstruct the empirical data just by taking the correlation of the empirical and the reconstruction in reconstructed maps as a function of an increasing number of modes.
2280898	2288722	298	C	0.97	And we see that indeed the reconstruction accuracy increases as we increase the number of modes.
2288866	2307098	299	C	1	And up to 200, we can get about 85% to 90% accuracy, which is quite efficient given that we do the analysis on a cortical surface with about 30,000 vertices.
2307274	2321330	300	C	0.99999	So mathematically, the maximum number of modes available to us is about 30,000, and using 200 out of the 30,000, we can already reconstruct the data quite efficiently.
2322070	2331766	301	C	0.79	And then we've shown that the modes are quite powerful and efficient in representing the data.
2331868	2345814	302	C	0.99294	We now test the Hypotheses or the questions that Alex has laid a while ago, that are the geometric modes more parsimonious than the other anatomical modes?
2345942	2360314	303	C	0.99	And when I say anatomical modes, again, we're focusing on the connector modes, which is based on the connectivity matrix, but we also test another anatomical mode based on an EDR rule.
2360362	2385266	304	C	0.9777	So an EDR rule is the exponential distance rule, which as Alex has mentioned a while ago, which is that because the assumption of neuroflu theory is that the connections are very localized and also organized in a distance dependent way, specifically, the connection weight changes exponentially as a function of distance.
2385378	2394298	305	C	0.99993	So we want to test that hypothesis on how dominant that exponential distance effect is.
2394384	2417220	306	C	0.66164	So for the details, we just created a synthetic network based on a simple probability of connection following an exponential distance rule with a skating factor or an exponent alpha, which we matched from empirical diffusion MRI data.
2417590	2425666	307	C	0.98	And again, there's a lot of empirical evidence of the existence of this exponential distance rule.
2425698	2431922	308	C	0.9884	So it's not just a hypothetical theoretical kind of assumption.
2432066	2451194	309	C	0.99992	We see the effect in Macaques if you follow the weight as a function of distance from track tracing data, and this is in logarithmic scale, you see this linear curve which represents an exponential in linear coordinates.
2451322	2466046	310	C	1	And we see the same with human diffusion MRI data that the weight changes as a function of distance in an exponential distance weight, and even in other species like mouse rats, mimosa, and so on and so forth.
2466078	2469502	311	C	0.9999	So this is a universal property found in a lot of different species.
2469566	2481030	312	C	0.99947	So this exponential distance rule connectivity is actually empirically valid.
2481770	2492698	313	C	0.94375	So by using these three different anatomical properties, we can calculate the modes using the equations that Alexis mentioned a while ago.
2492784	2501646	314	C	0.77	And you can get these geometric modes on the left, connector modes in the middle, and the modes from the exponential distance rule connectivity on the right?
2501828	2515534	315	C	1	And again, the modes are arranged in quite a unique way in that the first couple of modes will represent the low spatial frequency or patterns with very long spatial wavelengths.
2515662	2522610	316	C	1	And if you go further down, you can get these high special frequency or short special wavelength patterns.
2524630	2532120	317	C	0.98	The basis set that the modes provide can capture different scales of the data.
2533130	2543242	318	C	0.95276	So how do these anatomical modes compare when we now reconstruct the different FMI data that we have?
2543376	2553914	319	C	0.99145	So, for resting state functional connectivity, we compared the three modes, again by measuring the accuracy as a function of the number of modes.
2554042	2567742	320	C	0.99	And you can see that the geometric modes outperform both of the connectome and the EDR modes, but you can see that the EDR modes are quite close to the geometric modes.
2567886	2589654	321	C	0.96909	So again, suggesting that the fundamental effect that the EDR connectivity does in empirical data, it highlights the importance of this simple but important exponential distance rule connectivity.
2589782	2595898	322	C	0.54	And we can see the same thing by reconstructing the different task activation maps that we have.
2595984	2598730	323	C	0.83	And I'm showing you here the difference.
2598800	2610714	324	C	0.9678	So it's the geometric minus the connector and geometric minus DDR reconstruction accuracies and red means the geometric modes are outperforming the other anatomical modes.
2610762	2616270	325	C	0.99516	So in all the data sets that we have, the results are quite consistent.
2616430	2626920	326	C	0.99827	So again, it suggests that the geometric modes are more parsimonious than the other anatomical modes that we have.
2627930	2641750	327	C	1	And then we go a bit further on, how do we actually use the concept of these modes in analyzing FMI activation maps.
2642330	2650410	328	C	0.9977	So I just kind of just want to explain a little bit of what traditional approach we have in brain map mapping research edge.
2650490	2658954	329	C	0.99996	So for example, you do an experiment, you capture the activation map shown here for a particular task.
2659002	2662094	330	C	1	And I'm showing you here the kind of the one B version of that.
2662132	2671198	331	C	0.99862	So the value, the activation versus the vertex in this cortical surface.
2671374	2694786	332	C	0.99975	So what traditionally what we do is to because we want to highlight people ask, okay, if a person does a particular task, which regions of the brain are kind of driving those the behavioral performance that we have whilst performing a particular task.
2694818	2720270	333	C	0.97239	So what people usually do is to threshold these maps and and you can set threshold barely arbitrarily, and then you can get these clusters of activity and we then make a conclusion that these clusters of activity are the ones kind of driving the behavioral effects that we see whilst performing a task.
2720350	2729110	334	C	1	And people can even go further and hone down exactly really highly localized regions if you increase the threshold.
2729530	2750290	335	C	0.99995	But if you go further back we started from this whole brain activation map, you can clearly see that by thresholding you actually are removing a lot of important activity patterns that are sub threshold, but they do exist.
2750390	2754270	336	C	0.99632	So it's kind of like the analogy.
2755330	2769140	337	C	0.99997	By doing these thresholding approach, you're just looking just at the tip of the iceberg, you're ignoring a lot of the important properties of the iceberg that are not seen by the threshold that you set.
2769590	2774834	338	C	0.99606	So what we can do is to use the mode approach to actually look.
2774872	2775460	339	A	1	At.
2779690	2785154	340	C	1	Look at the properties of all the activation maps.
2785282	2790646	341	C	1	And here on the left, I'm showing you here the power of each mode.
2790678	2797546	342	C	0.99989	So basically the weights that we obtained from the reconstructions that we had a while ago.
2797728	2809694	343	C	1	And the figure on the left shows you the results that we have on average for the Human Connector Project data set.
2809812	2814254	344	C	1	And on the right is for the 10,000 maps from Neurovolt.
2814382	2822430	345	C	0.99978	So what you can see here actually is most of the power is contained within about 50 modes.
2822590	2838262	346	C	1	And if you remember, the modes represent and each mode represents a different wavelength and they are arranged and that the first couple of modes represent this long spatial wavelength, spatial structure.
2838406	2870002	347	C	0.99679	So what this means is that actually in FMI activation maps, most of the power is within those long wavelengths, kind of suggesting that indeed, even by performing a particular task, you are actually activating this almost whole brain so you can see this almost whole brain activity that, again, you will miss out if you do some thresholding effect.
2870136	2882274	348	C	1	And to further emphasize the importance of these long wavelength patterns, we did a simple experiment where we tried to remove, say, the first couple long wavelength modes.
2882322	2884870	349	C	1	And that's the solid curve that you see in here.
2885020	2895594	350	C	1	And by doing so, if we start removing those long wavelength modes, the reconstruction accuracy completely drops, even by just removing 25% of them.
2895712	2905898	351	C	0.99999	But if we just remove the short wavelength modes so starting from the right, the effect on the reconstruction accuracy is not that significant.
2905994	2919220	352	C	0.99729	So again, alluding to the fact that these long wavelength modes are really important and they describe the important structure found in activation maps from FMI data.
2920550	2929634	353	C	0.89276	So again, we've shown how the modes can explain and represent spatial activation patterns.
2929762	2942538	354	C	1	What happens with the dynamics and the way we can do this is we go back to the crux of the neural field theory, which the geometric argument modes were based from.
2942704	2944934	355	C	1	And Neurofield theory is very generalized.
2944982	2951702	356	C	1	You can construct different populations of excitatory inhibitory neurons and you can even connect the thyroids and so on and so forth.
2951846	2960750	357	C	0.99745	But the important bits to remember is that mirror field theory relies on the idea that activation propagates through space as waves.
2961730	2985106	358	C	0.97	And to simplify the experiment that we want to do, because we want to model the activity as a function of time, we just focus on the cortex and we simulate the equation based from the wave model and we tune the parameter.
2985298	2990362	359	C	0.99993	But if you look at the equation, there are only two parameters and we fix one of them.
2990416	2997290	360	C	0.99988	So basically, the model is only relying on tuning one free parameter.
2998270	3004190	361	C	1	And what we did was to compare that with a more sophisticated neuromass model.
3004260	3007562	362	C	0.99892	So, neuromass models rely on the connector.
3007626	3022900	363	C	0.99978	So basically you have regions in the brain that they are connected and the connections are based from diffusion MRI and each region will have its own dynamical properties so they evolve through time.
3023510	3028310	364	C	0.99978	So it relies a lot of on this connection and again, local dynamics.
3028970	3039400	365	C	0.99999	But it's important to highlight that this highly sophisticated model has about 19 parameters and we fix about 15 adults, but we still need to kind of tune about four.
3040170	3054400	366	C	0.99967	So in comparison to the wave model, again, wave model only has one and what we did was to how well can it recapitulate functional connectivity data.
3055570	3070690	367	C	0.99979	So here I'm showing you an example for the empirical functional connectivity that we have and the resulting model based functional connectivity for both the wave and the neuromass models.
3071030	3087400	368	C	1	And we can kind of quantify how well the model based functional connectivity results stack up with respect to the empirical data in a variety of ways.
3087770	3091814	369	C	1	One can look at how well does the edge FC.
3091862	3103550	370	C	0.99961	So basically each element of this matrix compares between the empirical and the model based data and you can see that both models are performing quite similarly.
3104290	3109066	371	C	0.99997	We can also look at the average connectivity within each region.
3109098	3119620	372	C	0.99999	So basically you're taking the average of a row or a column and you can see that the wave model now outperforms the neuromus model by a bit.
3119990	3128070	373	C	0.99	And you can gain further because these properties, the first two properties are based on static FC.
3128410	3131942	374	C	0.99995	Basically you're kind of averaging the effects across time.
3132076	3141322	375	C	0.99881	But we also measured how well two models compare in capturing dynamical properties through time.
3141456	3147674	376	C	1	And you see that the wave model actually outperforms the neural mass model.
3147872	3160560	377	C	0.99	And so in summary, for this, it's just to show that the simplicity of the wave model can capture a lot of these properties of functional data.
3161170	3174770	378	C	0.67135	Again, highlighting the idea that this wave evolving auto traveling in space and time in the brain is probably a good approximation.
3175930	3182994	379	C	0.51768	We also simulated the effect if we stimulate, say, the visual cortex.
3183122	3191338	380	C	0.99997	So we just ping the visual cortex and allow it to the activity to propagate through space and time.
3191424	3200310	381	C	1	And this will be the propagation starts from the visual cortex and then it goes to the frontal cortex.
3200470	3212400	382	C	1	And I think I want to highlight one observation that we found is that we can see that when we started from the visual cortex, the activity starts to separate into two.
3213430	3223086	383	C	0.99997	In the psychology and neuroscience literature, people have actually found this effect and they call it the separation into the dorsal and ventral stream.
3223118	3227990	384	C	1	And each stream has important cognitive implications.
3228570	3240406	385	C	0.99999	But people have tried to explain this separation by capturing the complex layer specific activity, individual cortex.
3240518	3257280	386	C	0.99994	But what this simple experiment that we have done has shown that maybe the geometry and the idea of waves propagating could be sufficient in obtaining these kind of physiological effect.
3259730	3269730	387	C	1	And then we also tried to compare it with how well does it recapitulate the visual hierarchy that people have found in primates.
3270390	3285682	388	C	0.99999	For example, this work in the last couple of years where they also did a simulation where they stimulated the visual cortex.
3285746	3303770	389	C	1	And what they found was if you follow regions along the visual hierarchy in the macaque cortex, you see the activity patterns are kind of delayed in a hierarchical way, so they follow the same kind of relationship as the visual hierarchy.
3303930	3305230	390	C	0.999	So we did the same thing.
3305300	3316006	391	C	0.99976	We compared the activity, the amplitude of the activity by matching the regions that people found in the visual hierarchy of the maca cortex.
3316058	3324834	392	C	1	And we tried to find the regions in the human brain and then we see the same effect.
3324952	3350910	393	C	1	And then when we compared it to a typical measure of hierarchy in the neuroimaging space, by using the intracortical myelin map, which is just the ratio of t one and T two, we see the effect that the time to peak of these activation patterns well captures the rank of the intracortical myelin, again highlighting that.
3350980	3360910	394	C	0.99999	Indeed, what we're getting is capturing this hierarchical kind of processing starting from the visual cortex.
3361730	3373278	395	C	1	And think of the last result that I want to highlight is the subcortex, because again, the brain is not just the cortex.
3373374	3387954	396	C	0.99975	So what we did was to also calculate the modes from subcortical regions and what we did was to mask these subcortical regions and perform the same and solve the same equation using the whole plastic primary operator.
3388002	3392198	397	C	1	And you can get these argument modes for the thalamus triadom and the hippocampus.
3392374	3397574	398	C	0.99	And we compared that to what we call in the field as functional gradients.
3397622	3404400	399	C	0.9999	Basically, they are representations, low dimensional representation of resting state FMI data.
3405650	3420338	400	C	0.94237	So what we did was to compare the geometric modes for the different subcortical structures and the different functional gradients based on FMI data.
3420504	3447180	401	C	0.99	And you can see that the modes are almost in perfect correspondence with the functional gradients and we see the same effect for the different structures, again, probably highlighting the idea that the geometric effects that we solve in the cortex are much more dominant in the subcortex, that geometry really constraints function.
3450370	3457360	402	C	0.99994	Just to tie things together, what are the advantages of this approach that we found?
3458290	3469410	403	C	1	First, it's a more physical understanding of the relationship between structure and function based on ideas in physics engineering that has been used in the last century.
3469910	3473582	404	C	1	The vectoring modes are only based on T one weighted images.
3473726	3483010	405	C	0.99801	So it's very simple to perform and the analysis can be done by anyone with structural T one weighted image.
3483170	3490890	406	C	0.72	And hence you can apply it in quite different experimental contexts in both humans, other species, health and disease.
3491550	3500954	407	C	1	And finally, to summarize things, hopefully we've shown that geometric modes are indeed more parsimonious than other anatomical modes.
3501082	3520210	408	C	1	And this is confirming a lot of the predictions from theoretical calculations of near field theory and highlights the importance of treating the brain as this really physical system in correspondence with what people are doing in physics and engineering.
3521350	3534818	409	C	0.99705	But it also highlights the idea that the effects that we see in FMI might be dominated by the effect of this simple local and exponential distance rule connectivity.
3534994	3552718	410	C	0.99586	However, the contributions of long range connections are still there, but what we're highlighting is maybe their influence may not be observable with the resolution that we currently have with FMI data.
3552884	3584630	411	C	0.99878	So it would be interesting to see and perform these experiments in a much more highly resolved, say, track tracing data from other species that we found that evoked activity is dominated by these long wavelength modes, which challenges a lot of the traditional approach we have in the Neuroimaging field where we focus a lot on these focal activations and that traveling waves shaped by geometry are sufficient to explain a lot of physiological phenomena.
3585690	3592700	412	C	0.85136	They just emerged from the model and we didn't baked all these physiological phenomena into the model.
3593390	3609230	413	C	0.88	And finally that geometric constraints seem to be universally exist in both cortex and subcortex and that we can use one single approach to study the whole brain quite nicely.
3609730	3615842	414	C	0.94	And I just want to add both Alex and I would like to thank all the other co authors of the work.
3615896	3619490	415	C	0.9	It has been a truly multi institute collaboration.
3619990	3635154	416	C	1	All the open access data set that we have used and if people are interested in doing our analysis, we have written an open access software package repository in GitHub.
3635202	3636438	417	C	1	You can access that in here.
3636524	3647018	418	C	0.99931	So people can analyze modes in the brain in quite different contexts that they want to do and I think that's where we want to end.
3647104	3647980	419	C	0.99664	Thank you.
3651570	3652174	420	B	0.9948	Awesome.
3652292	3655790	421	B	0.9938	Well, thank you for the great presentation.
3657090	3658846	422	B	0.44652	Lot of places to go.
3659028	3661630	423	B	1	First I'll pass to Dean.
3664630	3665890	424	D	0.98264	Thank you gentlemen.
3667110	3686182	425	D	1	I first got wind of this paper through another individual in the active inference community and I think I was the one that may have pounded the table that we might want to do a guest stream on this and it's ticked the paper and really brought it to life.
3686316	3692502	426	D	0.99242	So thank you very much, I really appreciate it, especially some of the dynamic images.
3692646	3702206	427	D	1	I think it really helps in terms of explaining what you guys were trying to do your work with and your subject matter on.
3702228	3703342	428	D	0.99998	So I'll just start with that.
3703396	3705342	429	D	1	I have some questions later on.
3705396	3711870	430	D	0.99984	But just first of all, thank you for a fantastic explanation.
3713430	3714420	431	A	0.99664	Thank you.
3718060	3723300	432	B	0.97491	When you present this in a neuroscience setting, what's a common response or reaction?
3723380	3733864	433	B	0.99999	From the introduction, I could really tell how careful you were to speak to the totality and the different threads in neuroscience.
3733912	3750850	434	B	0.99799	So after all that set up and all the statistical analysis that's presented, where does that put people in terms of their own understanding of the way that they've been doing complementary methodologies or orienting their research questions that way.
3754680	3761830	435	A	1	Yeah, I think generally people are at least we found that people are quite interested.
3762680	3779240	436	A	1	I guess the approach is a bit different to how a neuroscientist would typically think about the brain but kind of aligns with how, say a physicist might narrowly easily start approaching thinking about or modeling the brain.
3779320	3783390	437	A	0.98	And so the work was really trying to bring those two kind of perspectives together.
3784880	3815930	438	A	1	I think the reaction is usually kind of this is really interesting, how do I make sense of it or what I do practically, I guess some people might kind of split it artificially into this comparison of odd geometry versus connectivity which is probably not the right way to think about it.
3817180	3829100	439	A	1	The way we like to think about it is that we're sort of comparing two different models and each of those models makes certain approximations and prioritizes different features.
3830880	3839048	440	A	1	The approach we put forward in this paper emphasizes the role of geometry and it does have connectivity embedded in that model.
3839154	3842796	441	A	0.94348	It's just a kind of simplified approximation of connectivity.
3842828	3863424	442	A	0.99	This kind of homogeneous distance dependent journal whereas typical connectome centric view will try to capture all the complex connectivity but we'll ignore also the horizontal connectivity that really is what drives activity spreading through the brain that's completely ignored.
3863472	3876490	443	A	1	And so really the idea behind this work was to kind of test in a way between these two approaches and see which one's approximations were kind of more useful in a sense.
3879660	3882490	444	B	0.98242	Dean, want to add something or I can make a comment there?
3883340	3887112	445	D	0.99721	No finish this because then I'm going to ask my questions about the Jello.
3887256	3900480	446	B	1	Yeah, well, the statistics was very clear and it was very interesting how with two different data sets there were similar curves with also very different number of samples.
3900900	3911680	447	B	0.99984	So it was almost like some of the statistical distributions were latched onto relatively early and then that captured the big continent.
3911760	3916664	448	B	0.69	And a lot of the connections are local.
3916862	3940130	449	B	1	And this is, of course, a topic to explore about the molecular and the mechanistic electromagnetic basis and whether this to what extent it represents traveling propagating electrochemical waves and or loading heavily on simply diffuse local connections and even the blurry line between those two.
3940740	3962390	450	B	0.99919	So it is really like a question about what is being captured because even the EDR with the spread captures a variance component related to local abundant, direct, fast acting connections in some regions and distant connections maybe over the days.
3963240	3972410	451	B	0.73851	Distal connections really do matter as the Jello sets and things change.
3972780	3987870	452	B	0.99995	But at the exact timescale that some of these patterns are happening at your work is showing new information and comparison with different ways it's been looked at.
3991970	4016770	453	C	0.99	Yeah, I think one of the things that it highlighted even probably just in my head is we've been focusing a lot on trying to capture the effects of this complex connectivity and we ignore all these lateral, horizontal local diffusing connections.
4017450	4033210	454	C	0.66855	But what the work has now kind of shown, it highlighted maybe the issues that we have with FMI because truly both of these worlds happen probably simultaneously.
4033630	4047280	455	C	0.9988	But just the effects that we're seeing in FMI is probably not the most efficient way to capture both worlds or it cannot hung down the specifics of one world over the other.
4049330	4062290	456	C	0.66924	In the results that we're getting is that the effects of this very localized connectivity probably dominates a lot of what we see there FMI.
4063030	4077990	457	C	0.85077	But time will tell if we improve the ways we capture brain activity with OpenAI and we can really kind of particularly focus on the different aspects of the approximations.
4079470	4082442	458	C	0.99	To me, that's the kind of the beauty of the work.
4082496	4088170	459	C	0.68	It now highlighted these effects into the broader audience.
4089790	4097338	460	A	0.76	Yeah, everything that we've presented is really addressing things that we were at measure with fMRI.
4097434	4114500	461	A	0.9964	So on pretty coarse spatial and temporal scales, there's some theoretical work suggesting that kind of the more complex aspects of connectivity that can't be explained by an EDR might play an important role in supporting dynamic transitions between different brain states.
4115190	4122690	462	A	0.69056	But that would happen on a very rapid scale that could be missed with fMRI or at least a typically organized fMRI experiment.
4122850	4133450	463	A	0.99	And so one thing we're interested in looking at further is trying to pick that apart a little bit and trying to isolate the functional contributions of those more complicated connections.
4136510	4137018	464	B	0.98895	Cool.
4137104	4144240	465	D	0.68266	Dean, can I ask about the metaphor of the spoon tapping on the cello there?
4144610	4152800	466	D	0.89781	Metaphorically speaking, that seems like an external perturbation on something that can respond to that.
4154230	4159074	467	D	0.99	Now, you'll appreciate I'm asking from a very naive point of view.
4159192	4160980	468	D	0.30332	I'm comfortable with it.
4161350	4178150	469	D	0.56	Is there any difference then in terms of, say, something that happens interoceptively, like something that's simply coming from within system and does that show up in the same way as when there's a response to an external stimuli?
4179790	4180154	470	A	0.98	Yeah.
4180192	4197630	471	A	0.99386	So the actual underlying model, a key component that we haven't really talked about, is that you have thalamocortical loops and there's a driving input from the thalamus that influences the wave activity in the cortex.
4198050	4206722	472	A	1	And they could be sensory thalamic nuclei or they could be interceptive inputs as well.
4206856	4214180	473	A	1	And they would be expected to drive cortical activity in different and spatially non uniform ways.
4216230	4222262	474	A	0.99998	Really distinguishing between those different types of inputs, as far as I'm aware, hasn't been modeled yet.
4222316	4228834	475	A	0.9998	It's all been kind of at a simple level where you treat the cortex homogeneously and you have a single thalamic nucleus.
4228882	4244030	476	A	1	I mean, some people have started to split them up, but that would be that the underlying principle and the model could be extended in such a way that you could potentially distinguish between interreceptive and extra receptive inputs.
4245010	4246014	477	D	0.99703	Can I ask him one more?
4246052	4251790	478	C	0.60833	Dan, I just want to add, for example, the visual cortex experiment that we perform.
4251860	4253754	479	C	0.99958	It's a really simple perturbation.
4253802	4260034	480	C	1	Right, but it could represent different types of perturbation we just can't particularly capture at the moment.
4260072	4265860	481	C	0.99999	But it's like an overlying if we perturb it in a certain way this will be the effect that we see.
4267030	4272920	482	D	0.97	You must have known I was going to ask next thing because that was the direction I was going with that visual cortex example.
4273770	4282534	483	D	0.75135	So from the active inference community, one of the things that we're always dealing with is surprise, say versus sensory attenuation.
4282662	4292078	484	D	1	And then on the third vertices, the seeming unawareness prior to the surprise or the attenuated state, but still available.
4292244	4312718	485	D	0.92	And so I'm kind of curious, when you move away from the visual can you still have these sort of same waves going through the brain because other sensory uptake is causing that same you get a surprising feeling, like a sense of weightlessness perhaps.
4312894	4320920	486	D	0.96	Right, or you're an astronaut and that's now something you become attenuated to.
4323210	4334474	487	D	0.95	I know it kind of stuck with the fMRI but it just seems so the possibilities in terms of what you guys are opening up just seems really interesting.
4334672	4344910	488	D	1	Is that something like the interoceptive thing where you can see this now having opening up new areas of inquiry?
4348850	4377110	489	A	0.99	Yeah, so I think there's some really interesting work where people have looked at recursive neural nets structured in such a way that you can get wavelike propagation between the elements of the network and have shown that the systems that have that wavelike propagation, it actually facilitates their ability to predict what's happening in, say, a movie.
4377770	4382726	490	A	0.98482	So it improves their predictive performance physiologically.
4382918	4394650	491	A	0.47068	It'll have shown that just with simple visual stimulation you get these back to front propagations but there's also front to back propagations which are presumably encoding the predictions.
4394810	4405950	492	A	1	And so then the question is how do the top down predictions and the bottom up sensory input get reconciled between the interactions of these waves?
4407190	4424034	493	A	0.92	I think these are kind of really interesting ways forward that we're still coming to terms with and we haven't really quite made sense of what the ways mean for computation.
4424082	4442250	494	A	1	I know that Peter Robinson, who's on the slide here has written a couple of papers talking about how these fields can relate to predictions but yeah, I think this is kind of a very new exciting area that is worth exploring.
4442910	4451950	495	B	1	Yeah, one kind of connection there is like the standing wave that you showed in the physical water pool.
4452530	4473074	496	B	1	And so now when we're looking at a solid color visually and there's some stable non equilibrium steady state or stable representation or stable population code or all these different things which may not be exhaustive or incompatible like at all, but there's some standing wave.
4473202	4480134	497	B	0.84	Now maybe that is component number 99, just like principal component 99.
4480172	4491386	498	B	0.99957	Its amplitude might be small but there's like some mode that's ramping up and it's associated positively or it's ramping down.
4491408	4493130	499	B	0.998	It's associated negatively.
4495010	4507854	500	B	0.97	And there's some standing pattern that amidst the pelting of new sensory observations in like a Bayesian updating setting, it is remaining the same.
4507972	4511714	501	B	1	Now the more inertia you have on the distribution, the more stable it's going to be.
4511832	4517906	502	B	0.99999	Which is like equivalent to saying the less attention you pay to sensory stimuli, the more stable your priors are going to be.
4518008	4527542	503	B	0.53	It could be a prior about perception, could be a prior about action and there are descending motor patterns as well.
4527676	4548510	504	B	1	And all these different modes are being played like in an apartment building and there's like different songs but they're happening in different frequency, spatial, temporal and frequency bands so that we can tune in to different songs like different radio stations, but with more spatial richness.
4551010	4568500	505	B	0.63532	It's a total expansion of the palate that recapitulates certain aspects of topology and helps us even identify residuals that are most apt to be explained that way.
4569610	4585130	506	B	0.99986	But it also opens up to these big waves that get filtered out, like by low pass, potentially filtering in different data sets so that shorter term relationships can become more apparent.
4585550	4597370	507	B	0.99991	But that can be the ripple on the wave and so end up throwing out a huge amount just of the sheer information content of rich, dynamical data sets.
4603310	4608340	508	C	0.93	Yeah, really interesting concept, trying to wrap my head around it.
4609990	4623074	509	C	0.44541	Yes, it's really cool because again, we still don't know because what we found is that for example, in different task data that we have, not all modes are equally excited.
4623202	4630818	510	C	0.99993	Certain modes are excited in quite different ways and we don't know yet what these combinations mean.
4630924	4634170	511	C	0.58924	Truly behaviorally, cognitively.
4636190	4643100	512	C	0.86559	But yeah, we'll keep working on it as palace and see what happens.
4645650	4647280	513	D	0.53568	That's one more quick question.
4647730	4650480	514	D	0.99	I appreciate the geometry part of it.
4653570	4683420	515	D	0.96653	So does any of this speak also to sort of the tunneling effects of that eigenvalue or eigen mode eigenvalue quantum piece where you can be riding the surface of this and appreciating that the parsimonious speak to that surface effect?
4684110	4701822	516	D	1	Is there anything about this that also helps us understand better how something goes through the wave, like quite literally across from one slope, past the crown and onto the other side?
4701876	4707230	517	D	0.65	Or is that again something that you guys weren't really spending a lot of time on?
4707380	4716286	518	D	0.99998	But I did notice, I pulled up the paper and I noticed on page eleven you were talking about some of the ways that you were analyzing the volumes.
4716398	4727590	519	D	0.99998	So that's the context that I was curious about, that sort of tunneling piece to go along with how we sort of follow the patterns on the surface.
4732430	4734800	520	A	0.76243	I'm not quite sure I follow you're asking.
4737490	4760970	521	B	0.98	Let me try to see where it comes as I see it, Dean's, a quantum tunneling connoisseur post even and with the basis set of the sine wave, it's like imposing this kind of oscillatory pattern and then you're up, waiting or downweighting.
4760990	4775180	522	B	0.99178	But is it possible to use a basis set or is it possible to detect modes in your analysis where there's an effect locally and then there's like a tunnel and there's like a region that the wave doesn't appear to pass through?
4787060	4787616	523	D	0.95817	By the way.
4787638	4788800	524	D	0.99989	Thank you, Daniel.
4797240	4798208	525	C	0.9237	Stumped.
4798384	4801844	526	A	0.88	I guess it means on what you mean by tunneling, right?
4801882	4814776	527	A	0.99983	So, like each mode, like if you look at the high frequency modes, they are quite patchy and so there'll be sort of disjointed areas of high amplitude and low amplitude, but they fluctuate in time, right?
4814798	4816216	528	A	1	Like they're standing waves.
4816248	4819084	529	A	1	And so they'll kind of alternate up and down.
4819202	4832080	530	A	0.99957	So in a sense it looks like there's coupling over long distances, but that's just due to the standing wave dynamics, which is just driven by the interference pattern of the traveling waves.
4833220	4849670	531	A	0.69949	So I'm not sure if that's kind of what you were getting at, but I guess from a perspective of just if you were just looking at the standing wave dynamics, it would look like things in spatially disjoint locations were kind of coupled in some way.
4851560	4872860	532	B	0.77547	It's like one jello, it stays put where you hit it and it stays put 1 mile away and it oscillates between like a jump rope or it could be it somewhere that's also very variable, then be like the opposite of a jump rope with one mode.
4873920	4878676	533	B	1	And that's what's captured in the set of functions that are then parameterized.
4878728	4900464	534	B	0.9993	So then when you assemble them or when you superimpose them, you could get kind of digitized looking outcome patterns in terms of the real empirical correlations and it's map, not territory.
4900512	4905960	535	B	1	And it's tempting to interpret these very literally as with many statistical tools.
4906460	4918620	536	B	0.98509	When I think, as we've discussed, there's multiple possible mechanisms and in your paper and in your work, you've probably thought of many, many mechanisms that lend themselves to unique empirical predictions.
4920480	4931148	537	B	0.96966	But basis set decomposition is used like in SPM, which is kind of like one of the precedents of active inference.
4931244	4935170	538	B	0.97	And the work by Karl Frist and others, it's using basis sets as.
4940180	4941196	539	A	0.50716	They used.
4941318	4942660	540	A	0.90211	They use it everywhere.
4945240	4952550	541	B	0.99996	Do you have any closing or near closing thoughts or where does the work go?
4953340	4960760	542	B	0.99	What data sets are salient or questions or cognitive phenomena or what are you excited about for your lab and for the fields.
4963580	4964650	543	C	0.66219	Your lab?
4967840	4972830	544	A	0.99805	There's a few different ways that we're interested in progressing it.
4973920	4994512	545	A	0.97903	So one is, I guess, trying to reconcile this purely geometric approach that makes a very simple approximation with connectivity, with the actual connectivity of the brain, and trying to understand if the contributions of these kind of complex connections are not so easily revealed by a classic fMRI experiment.
4994656	4997200	546	A	1	What are their contributions to dynamics?
4997360	5007450	547	A	1	And is there a way of kind of bringing some of that complex connectivity into the wave model and trying to get some traction on that question?
5010780	5015144	548	A	0.99999	Another aspect is we've done the simplest thing.
5015182	5020670	549	A	0.99997	We treat all areas of the cortex as homogeneous, but we know that's not the case.
5021280	5029150	550	A	0.99914	Areas vary in terms of the cell density, degree of myelination, level of synaptic complexity and density and so on.
5029760	5032312	551	A	1	And so that, in a sense, could be imagined.
5032376	5035596	552	A	1	You could imagine that as changing the effective geometry of the cortex.
5035628	5046020	553	A	1	And so we're playing around with how do you introduce that heterogeneity and how does that change the mode structure and does that have an impact on your ability to reconstruct dynamics?
5048840	5063144	554	A	0.99987	We're then also interested in sort of taking this forward to leverage these approaches for thinking about different ways in which we might be able to map brain changes in different disorders or variations across species and so on.
5063182	5074088	555	A	0.98	And so kind of like classical SPM analyses, but making inference at the modal level and seeing if that can provide some useful insights.
5074264	5077340	556	A	0.9943	So there's a few different strategies.
5082940	5084920	557	B	0.99994	Any other comments or thoughts?
5086140	5086600	558	A	0.77024	No.
5086670	5088904	559	B	0.95827	Dean, where do you go after this?
5088942	5089476	560	B	0.9987	Dean?
5089588	5092356	561	B	0.99971	In your own neuroimaging career?
5092548	5093096	562	D	0.99756	No.
5093198	5093896	563	D	0.99952	Stop it.
5093998	5095736	564	D	0.99	I just think it was a very clear picture.
5095768	5105390	565	D	1	And again, I really appreciated the paper itself, but today's presentation sort of brought it to life and made it.
5106720	5130128	566	D	1	I know that you guys were really trying to focus on making sure that you got all of your formalities in a row, but just the way you presented it today made it even more come alive in terms of the mechanisms that you use to sort of come up with a clearer picture.
5130304	5132244	567	D	0.90702	That's what I came away with.
5132282	5134310	568	D	0.99967	So, again, thank you very much.
5135560	5135924	569	A	0.96592	Cool.
5135962	5137136	570	C	0.99998	Thanks for the invitation.
5137248	5137924	571	A	0.99669	Thank you.
5138042	5138660	572	A	0.81	Yeah.
5138810	5142592	573	B	0.99034	We'll look forward to seeing the continuation of this trajectory.
5142656	5143356	574	B	0.99844	You're always welcome.
5143418	5144364	575	B	0.66442	Come back.
5144482	5146510	576	B	0.99889	So thank you both.
5147200	5147724	577	C	0.99976	Thank you.
5147762	5148300	578	A	0.99669	Thanks, guys.
5148370	5148844	579	B	0.99981	See you.
5148882	5149080	580	B	0.97791	Bye.
