00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,860
hello and welcome everyone this is

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,440
active inference guest stream number

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,500
55.1 it's August 30th 2023

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,240
today we are going to have a

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,120
presentation followed by a discussion

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,220
on geometric constraints on human brain

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,900
function by James Payne and Alex fornito

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,960
thank you again for joining

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,160
really looking forward to the

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,140
presentation and the discussion so

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,300
please off to YouTube to introduce

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,159
yourself and continue however you like

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,960
thank you

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,660
oh thanks very much Daniel uh my name is

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,780
Alex Bonita I'm based in the school of

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,280
psychological sciences and internal

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,079
Institute for brain and mental health at

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,320
Monash University and we had James pen

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,780
who is a research fellow working in the

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,559
team and so the idea today was that we

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,539
were going to talk a little bit about

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,360
this work I'll begin by providing a bit

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,440
of a

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,960
historical and theoretical background

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,199
and then James will take over and jump

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,900
into the specifics of what we did and

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,280
what we found

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,960
uh

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,260
we're assuming some basic understanding

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,540
of Neuroscience and some elements of

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,180
human brain Imaging and we'll go through

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,159
a little bit of maths but hopefully

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,100
it'll be enough to give a picture and if

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,299
there's any questions about it

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,920
afterwards we'll be happy to try and

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,380
answer them

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,460
so a key motivating factor for this work

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,579
is really trying to understand how the

39
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,960
structure or anatomy of the brain

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,240
constrains its function and if you look

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,640
at a diverse range of systems found

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,000
throughout nature uh we know that the

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,560
structure of the system constrained its

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,979
Dynamic so for example the the shape of

45
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,579
a racing car will influence its

46
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,619
aerodynamics and how fast it can go the

47
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,659
folding patterns of a protein will

48
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,299
influence the other proteins that it can

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,979
interact with and quite have quite large

50
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,079
effects so here for example we've got an

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,099
example of the hemoglobin protein in a

52
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,420
healthy person and someone with sickle

53
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,280
cell anemia and this change in the

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,080
geometry of the protein leads to a

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,160
20-year difference in life expectancy

56
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,680
and here we've got the molecular

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,200
structures of diamond and graphite so

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,040
both of these materials are made of the

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
same atoms they're all purely carbon

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,819
atoms it's just the bonds between them

61
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,739
that are different and that difference

62
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,879
is sufficient to create quite

63
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,560
A variation in the properties of the

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,060
material so Diamond being one of the

65
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,239
hardest substances on Earth and valued

66
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,160
at somewhere between 12 to 90 million

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,440
dollars per kilo whereas graphite is one

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
of the most brittle and only cost you

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,060
about twenty dollars per kilo and so

70
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,980
this is essentially the reason why we

71
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,280
don't propose to people with h2b pencil

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
we used diamond rings instead

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,480
now the brain is no different we think

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,700
Anatomy constraints function but there

75
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,700
has been a long-standing debate about

76
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,319
the specific properties that are the

77
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,760
most relevant and how we should best

78
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,860
conceptualize them and this can be

79
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,159
traced back to the days of ramonica Hall

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
and Camilla Golgi two people considered

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,300
to be some of the founding fathers of

82
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,940
modern Neuroscience Golgi developed a

83
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,500
technique for staining neurons that

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,360
allowed you to visualize their structure

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,599
under the microscope and kahal really

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
perfected that technique and studied the

87
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,760
nervous system in extensive detail and

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,099
really laid down the foundations for we

89
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,680
think about the anatomy of the brain to

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,420
this state

91
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,879
now both of these men were recognized

92
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,580
for their efforts in 1906 with a Nobel

93
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,640
Prize but even at the award ceremony

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,000
when giving their lectures they were in

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,040
bitter disagreement so if you actually

96
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,959
look at the recordings of their lectures

97
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,200
kahal says we applied golgi's method in

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,060
our observations revealed in my opinion

99
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,980
the terminal arrangement of the nerve

100
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,379
fibers nerve elements possess reciprocal

101
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,599
relationships in contiguity but not in

102
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,440
continuity so here is saying that cells

103
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,358
are fundamentally discrete elements

104
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,820
separated in physical space and that

105
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,460
there's a a gap between them at the

106
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,740
synapse the synaptic clip and that's and

107
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,400
signaling occurs through this Gap

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,160
OG on the other hand didn't agree he

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,080
said while I admire the Brilliance of

110
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,520
the doctrine which is a worthy product

111
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,320
of the high intellect of my illustria

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,419
Spanish colleague I cannot agree with

113
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:43,979
him on some points of an anatomical

114
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,720
nature which are for the theory of

115
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,880
fundamental importance I found myself

116
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,979
unable to follow the current of opinion

117
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,259
because I was confronted by one concrete

118
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,759
anatomical fact

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,979
this was the existence of the formation

120
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,199
which I have called the diffuse nerve

121
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,220
Network

122
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,220
and so for golgiene all the cells were

123
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,199
continuous they form one continuous

124
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,600
Network there was no point of separation

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,419
between them and signaling occurred

126
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,320
through this continuous Network

127
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,860
now ultimately

128
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,259
uh the growing body of evidence and you

129
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,900
can see it in golgi's statements was

130
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,600
starting to favor kahal's model but

131
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
really it was only resolved in the 1940s

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,340
with the Advent of electron microscopy

133
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,780
where people could actually resolve

134
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,900
synapses and saw that they were

135
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,120
spatially disjoint

136
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,800
and this ultimately established the

137
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,520
neuron Doctrine as the fundamental

138
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,440
theory about how the nervous system is

139
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,680
organized at a cellular level

140
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,500
and this basic idea that we can divide

141
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,020
the brain up into discrete units was

142
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,000
then carried through to different scales

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,139
most famously by corbinian brodman who

144
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,720
developed a persolation of the context

145
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,020
based on a site of architectonic grounds

146
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,440
his idea was that different parts of the

147
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,419
cortex have different cellular

148
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,520
properties and so they Define these

149
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,320
discrete areas that are functionally

150
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,580
specialized in in some way

151
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,740
uh and certainly this has been a very

152
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,259
influential idea in Neuroscience ever

153
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,319
since but around the same time in fact a

154
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,419
couple of years earlier the neurologist

155
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,660
Alfred Campbell published his own signal

156
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,800
architectonic map and he agreed that you

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
could identify discrete boundaries

158
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
largely in primary zones but then in the

159
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,060
cortex in between there was a lot more

160
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,660
difficult to find sharp outlines or

161
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,180
boundaries and he suggested that

162
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,280
actually the changes were more gradual

163
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,138
or continuous in nature

164
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,380
boardman's view became more popular and

165
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,840
certainly became sort of the dominant

166
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,699
theory in neuroscience

167
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,520
even though subsequent attempts to try

168
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,020
to replicate it were different and so

169
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,880
different anatomists would parsolate the

170
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,500
brain in different ways using different

171
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,900
boundaries and so on

172
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,900
but nonetheless this kind of uh

173
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,240
congruence between the discrete model of

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,039
kahal and discrete model of broadman

175
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,319
eventually led to the idea that you know

176
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,819
essentially we can think about the brain

177
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,280
as a multi-scale network we're at the

178
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,759
cellular level we can identify

179
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,960
discrete cells that are connected by

180
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,780
synapses then we can scale up at the

181
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,599
population level the mesoscope mesoscale

182
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,280
resolution and identify our population

183
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,400
of cells are linked by bundles of exons

184
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,380
and then all the way through to the

185
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,300
macro scales which is what you sort of

186
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,560
see when you look at one of Rodman's

187
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,699
Maps you have these broad roughly

188
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,840
sub-architectonic areas connected by

189
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,340
white matter bundles

190
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,599
and in the last two or so decades we've

191
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,900
had the measurement techniques for

192
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,780
characterizing these networks on a vast

193
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,580
scale and there's been a pretty well

194
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,800
established pipeline for mapping these

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,259
networks so the basic idea is that we

196
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,419
have the brain we Define we divide it up

197
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,280
into these discrete areas and they act

198
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,620
as our Network nodes and then for every

199
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,539
pair of nodes we measure some aspect of

200
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,280
structural or functional connectivity

201
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,139
between them functional connectivity

202
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,060
being some aspect of coupling in

203
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,199
activity

204
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,120
and then we can represent that in the

205
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,760
form of a connectivity Matrix so each

206
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,260
row and column represents a different

207
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,419
region and each element tells you about

208
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,099
the type and strength of connectivity

209
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,260
between areas and that coin can

210
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,360
equivalently be represented as a graph

211
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,399
and then with that graph representation

212
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,500
we can apply all sorts of different

213
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,360
analytic tools to understand different

214
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,399
aspects about how the network is is

215
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,980
connected and organized

216
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,320
and this is this basic approach has been

217
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,839
used quite extensively to understand how

218
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,580
the underlying anatomical properties of

219
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,920
the network constrain function this is

220
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,540
one of my favorite examples this was a

221
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,300
study of two different worms C elegans

222
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,120
and pacificus uh both of their nervous

223
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
systems and the head have been mapped at

224
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,779
the level of each cell and synapse and

225
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,040
they're actually identical so they've

226
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,320
got the same type of cells the same

227
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,180
number of cells it's just the

228
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,440
connectivity between them that's

229
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,700
different and that's what you see in

230
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,320
this network projection here that the

231
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,660
topology of the Network's different in

232
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,060
this study they showed that changes in

233
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,700
the connectivity of just two Hub neurons

234
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,040
were sufficient to

235
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,620
elicit a difference in the behavior of

236
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,019
the animals such that pacificus is a

237
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,940
predator of c elegans and here you can

238
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,640
see pacificus eating poor C elegans for

239
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,880
lunch

240
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,040
now we can't lock humans up in a room

241
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,019
and see who eats who and try to

242
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,940
understand how their Anatomy constraints

243
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,500
function in that way but we can do

244
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,380
things like use MRI to measure

245
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,480
anatomical connectivity and functional

246
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,399
connectivity and correlate the two and

247
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,140
it's pretty consistent in finding that

248
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,580
we generally find there is a correlation

249
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,779
between them

250
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,899
uh we can run computational models where

251
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,360
we have a structural Network we simulate

252
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,339
the activity then we apply say a lesion

253
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:12,959
to that Network and look at the effects

254
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,880
on the activity and we can show for

255
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,260
example that if you leisure in a hub

256
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,060
area you have quite a dramatic impact on

257
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,980
brain function compared to a theologian

258
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,399
a more weakly connected non-hub area

259
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,080
or we could use clinical studies we

260
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,180
could look at cases where there are

261
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,980
naturally arising lesions through a

262
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,360
stroke or some other form of brain

263
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,120
damage and we can understand the

264
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,740
functional impairments that result so

265
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,040
for example in this case uh people with

266
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,320
lesions to certain types of Hub areas

267
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
with diffuse connectivity showed much

268
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,100
more generalized cognitive impairments

269
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,860
than people with lesions to areas with

270
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,640
more specific patterns of connectivity

271
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,440
so this is great this has been really

272
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,140
informative and great for understanding

273
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,720
the role of individual brain regions or

274
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,899
Connections in brain function but it

275
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,019
doesn't really give us a coherent

276
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,019
unified perspective about how Dynamics

277
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,820
emerge from the underlying structure

278
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,279
it's all a little bit piecemeal

279
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,320
now if we wanna

280
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,839
develop such a coherent understanding we

281
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,579
can draw some inspiration from different

282
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,200
uh

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
the physics and Engineering where

284
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,660
typically the structural

285
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,060
constraints on the Dynamics of a system

286
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,160
are studied by understanding the eigen

287
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,260
modes of the system

288
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,899
now the arguments of a system are found

289
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,600
by solving an eigenvalue problem such as

290
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,420
this one so an eigenvector we can think

291
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,279
of as something that we measure about a

292
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,180
system that doesn't change its direction

293
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,399
if it's subjected to some kind of

294
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,680
transformation so if that's the case

295
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,560
then this equality holds so the idea

296
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,680
here is that PSI is our Vector something

297
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,839
we measure about the system subjected to

298
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,440
some transformation L and uh if PSI is

299
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,019
an eigenvector then the transformed

300
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,880
eigenvector is equal to the eigenvector

301
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,380
just scaled by some back value so we can

302
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,240
the transformation can scale the vector

303
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,100
but it doesn't change its direction

304
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,899
and so if that's the case then this

305
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,880
scaling Factor Lambda is what we call an

306
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,240
eigenvalue and PSI is an eigenvector

307
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,180
this kind of equation is applied to a

308
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,560
lot of different systems a lot of

309
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,540
different contexts but when we're

310
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,220
studying the eigen modes of a system

311
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,320
typically

312
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
our L term here is is an operator called

313
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,540
the laplacian operator which essentially

314
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,360
describes how smoothly some kind of

315
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,579
structural property of the system varies

316
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,579
through an appropriate spatial embedding

317
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,220
so I'll come back a little bit to what

318
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,019
that means because we can make different

319
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,660
choices for what we use in L and that

320
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,639
determines the specific anatomical

321
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,339
properties that we prioritize

322
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,839
but for now I just want to emphasize

323
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,920
that a e property of these eigenvectors

324
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
is that they're orthogonal and so that

325
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,980
we then we can use them as an

326
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,899
a basis set for reconstructing different

327
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,760
activity patterns that we might see in

328
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,740
the network

329
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,560
so I guess the most famous example of a

330
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,940
basis set that many people will be

331
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,459
familiar with is a Fourier set so for

332
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,660
example here we have some

333
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,579
one-dimensional signal and we can

334
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,920
decompose that signal as a weighted sum

335
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,380
of sine and cosine functions of varying

336
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,079
frequencies so here you've got the the

337
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,579
different functions different

338
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,500
frequencies and here you've got some

339
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,300
weighting factors and we can reconstruct

340
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,579
this signal as a weighted sum of these

341
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:39,959
functions

342
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,240
in a similar way we can extract our

343
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,120
eigen modes of the brain based on some

344
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,040
particular anatomical property

345
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,420
and we end up with these spatial

346
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,540
patterns here that are organized again

347
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,700
in terms of spatial frequency or the

348
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,740
wavelength of fluctuation so here you

349
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,139
can see we've got a very low frequency

350
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,360
fluctuation moving from Back to Front

351
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,120
top to bottom media lateral and then as

352
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,459
you move up you get these more high

353
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,620
frequency fluctuations

354
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,839
and so then we can use these patterns to

355
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,420
reconstruct any spatial map that we

356
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,820
observe on the brain so it could be a

357
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,160
map of brain activity recorded during a

358
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,320
particular task it could be say a map of

359
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,060
cortical thickness variations or gray

360
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,279
matter volume variations uh it's

361
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,620
sufficiently General to allow you to

362
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,959
reconstruct any type of map and so we

363
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,940
can do that just as a weighted sum so

364
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,459
here y represents our map and then we

365
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,079
represent that as a weighted sum of our

366
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,880
modes with the a coefficients

367
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,959
representing the weights

368
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,540
and people oh sorry

369
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,880
um I should emphasize that that

370
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,579
explanation can be a little bit abstract

371
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,139
for people who aren't familiar with

372
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,880
eigen modes and it is always a bit of a

373
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,880
challenge to get an intuition and so you

374
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,199
can do what one of the people in the

375
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,959
team did and and ask chat GPT to explain

376
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,420
eigenmodes to a 10 year old and it turns

377
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,100
out that it does a pretty good job I was

378
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,779
quite happy with this explanation so I

379
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,339
thought I'd share it

380
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,740
so I'll check gbt says of course let's

381
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,720
imagine we have a wobbly jiggly ball of

382
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,699
jelly when you poke it it Wiggles and

383
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,220
shakes right now imagine if you poke the

384
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,779
jelly in different spots or with

385
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,639
different amounts of force each time you

386
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,440
poke it differently the jelly Wiggles

387
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,660
and shakes in a different way eigen

388
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,399
modes are like those different ways the

389
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,139
jelly Wiggles and shakes when you poke

390
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,519
it

391
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,680
so essentially seeing this video here

392
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,899
the jelly is poke and it wobbles in a

393
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,699
particular way if you poke the jelly in

394
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,440
a different spot or with a different

395
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,880
amount of force you'll trigger a

396
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,940
different pattern of vibration and so

397
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,459
commonly eigen modes are used in the

398
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,579
context of systems that vibrate and the

399
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,620
idea is these eigen modes correspond to

400
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,959
Preferred patterns of vibration when the

401
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,180
system is perturbed and those preferred

402
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,800
plans are just dictated by the

403
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,620
structural properties of that system we

404
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,480
can we can extend it more generally and

405
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,060
think about it more as how a system

406
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,579
responds to any type of excitation and

407
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,740
how an excitation spreads through some

408
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,959
connected system and the eigen modes

409
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,000
correspond to the preferred patterns of

410
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,399
excitation again determined by the

411
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,660
physical properties of the system

412
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,160
so

413
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,019
naturally given everything we've been

414
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,480
talking about and these ideas that the

415
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,820
brain is a multi-scale network we need

416
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,060
to make a choice about how we Define

417
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,680
alloplastian what specific anatomical

418
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,660
properties are we going to extract our

419
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,180
eigen modes from and so Natural Choice

420
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,339
would be to extract them from brain

421
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,680
connectivity right and we can do this

422
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,540
quite in a reasonably straightforward

423
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,940
way we get some map of the connections

424
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,880
in the brain we map connectivity between

425
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,399
every pair of nodes after we apply some

426
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,320
discretization we Define our discrete

427
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,899
nodes we map every pair of connections

428
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,399
we represent that in the form of a

429
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,519
matrix and then we extract this quantity

430
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,500
here it's called the graph laplacian

431
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,540
it's the details are not so important

432
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,399
but that's essentially our L operator

433
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,160
here and it describes how smoothly

434
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,339
connectivity varies as we move from node

435
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,099
to node in the network

436
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,679
and when we do that we can several

437
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,240
Studies have shown that you can use the

438
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,040
eigen modes extracted from this graph

439
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,799
laplacian to reconstruct kind of classic

440
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,199
functional networks that you record with

441
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,900
functional MRI

442
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,119
we can reconstruct different patterns of

443
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,980
functional connectivity between Pairs of

444
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,500
areas like you can use it to reconstruct

445
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,620
different EG signals and people have

446
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,039
even shown that you can make predictions

447
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,120
about the pattern of neurodegeneration

448
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,740
that you see in different forms of

449
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,539
dementia

450
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,940
so this has been really fantastic

451
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,520
important work and a really important

452
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,860
proof of principle that this eigenmode

453
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,620
framework can be used to understand how

454
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,179
the structure of the system constrains

455
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,640
its Dynamics and in each case the

456
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,380
interpretation is that these dynamical

457
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,500
patterns that we see with fmri or EEG or

458
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,860
so on are reflecting excitations of

459
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,200
these underlying eigen modes or the

460
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,760
resonant modes of the anatomy of the

461
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,940
brain

462
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,440
this V very much aligns with what we

463
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,419
would think of as a classical view of a

464
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,860
brain organization that I've just been

465
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,799
discussing so following from kahal and

466
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,080
broadman's work the idea is that lots of

467
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,240
different scales we can divide the brain

468
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,640
up into discrete areas they're connected

469
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,640
in some way and it's the signaling along

470
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,500
these connections between these discrete

471
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,340
areas that drives activity

472
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,160
but there are reasons to think that

473
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,039
particularly at coarser scale so we know

474
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,860
at the fundamental cellular scale the

475
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,660
network is discrete but at coarser

476
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,660
Scales perhaps a different set of

477
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,000
approximations might be useful

478
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,360
so if you look at dense reconstructions

479
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,640
of neuronal tissue so this is say with

480
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,980
electron microscopy

481
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,000
you find that cortical tissue is

482
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,580
extremely dented it's like a really rich

483
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,460
thick forest of cells and their

484
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,320
processes

485
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,799
and as we've talked about the there's

486
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,679
been a lot of debate about where you can

487
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,240
actually draw boundaries between

488
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,700
discrete areas and how valid that and

489
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,160
reliable that is outside some kind of

490
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,020
classic examples saying in primary

491
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,460
cortex

492
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,980
and if you look more deeply at the

493
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,600
cellular organization of specific

494
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,700
regions here on the left we've got the

495
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,380
cellular organization and on the right

496
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,320
we've got a myelin stain you see you get

497
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,220
these deep penetrating fibers that are

498
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,960
coming in from the white matter this is

499
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,880
what this kind of classic graph approach

500
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,400
will pick up because we divide we Define

501
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
our nodes in the cortex and then we're

502
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,640
mapping the connections that pass

503
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,960
through the white matter

504
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,200
they can also say that there's a lot of

505
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,840
connectivity that's moving horizontally

506
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,240
or tangential to the geometry of the

507
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,400
cortex and so these horizontal

508
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,620
connections allow for the continuous

509
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,580
spread of activity so rather than

510
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,380
actively jumping between discrete nodes

511
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,140
it can actually spread as a propagating

512
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,080
wave

513
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,660
[Music]

514
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,200
and you know just to emphasize the some

515
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,260
of the limitations of the discrete model

516
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,900
uh not long after broadman's work just a

517
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,400
couple of decades the renowned

518
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,200
physiologist lorento Deno was pretty

519
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,600
emphatic about uh his his concerns with

520
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,580
the approach he said the only really

521
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,380
good site of architectonic pictures of

522
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,240
those of Campbell who let me put in

523
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,700
capital letters as the being the only

524
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,860
side of architectonist who has described

525
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,620
facts and only facts the German cyto

526
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,360
architect honest has mixed facts and

527
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,340
theory in such a manner that nobody can

528
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,820
tell where facts ends in theories begin

529
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,059
so again this is just emphasizing the

530
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,100
idea that while we might be able to

531
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,220
Define discrete areas at a mesoscopic or

532
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,580
macroscopic resolutions in some cases

533
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,440
especially around the borders of primary

534
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,220
sensory or motor areas but large swathes

535
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,620
of Cortex those distinctions become a

536
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,399
little bit blurry

537
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,520
so an alternative approach has emerged

538
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,919
out of neural field Theory so neural

539
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,200
field theory has been around for several

540
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
decades now

541
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,640
and this is a different approach to

542
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,520
thinking about cortical activity so uh

543
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,080
the basic idea is that instead of

544
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,000
dividing the brain into discrete

545
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,059
specialized areas or nodes we can treat

546
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,000
the cortex as a continuous shape and we

547
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
actually uninterested in trying to

548
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,100
capture our patterns of brain activity

549
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,440
propagate through that continuous shape

550
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
and so this is something that you can

551
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,740
see in diverse types of

552
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,600
electrophysiological recordings so this

553
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,059
for example this video is of the

554
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,919
Dynamics of voltage-sensitive dyes

555
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,500
recorded in in the mouse brain and you

556
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,200
can see that you observe these

557
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,539
propagating waves of excitation that

558
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,640
move continuously through the cortex

559
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,220
rather than jumping from region to

560
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,600
region as would be implied by a kind of

561
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,320
strongly discrete model

562
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,720
so a big emphasis in neural field theory

563
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,640
is on describing these wave-like

564
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,620
propagation patterns

565
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,539
and it's been shown in recent

566
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,179
theoretical work that if we accept the

567
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,640
wave like propagation drives neuronal

568
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,720
activity then really the eigen modes

569
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,179
that we should be extracting or

570
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,760
prioritizing are those that are derived

571
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,679
from the geometry of the brain

572
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,500
so our eigenvalue becomes this problem

573
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,980
here where this operator here is called

574
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,380
the LaPlace Beltrami operator and it

575
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,659
describes how smoothly the geometry or

576
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,340
the shape or the curvature of the brain

577
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,260
varies through space

578
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,179
and just to briefly explain why that's

579
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,740
the case here we've got the wave

580
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,140
equation that's used in some forms of

581
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,400
neural field Theory list of the

582
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,840
divisions that we've been focusing on

583
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,260
and so the basic idea is that the firing

584
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,799
rate of a given population of neurons B

585
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,700
at location R and T is given by the

586
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,980
afferent field of incoming population so

587
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,380
other populations a so we've got other

588
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,240
populations providing this afferent

589
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,700
field of activity

590
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,919
that determines the firing rate of B

591
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,559
and obviously we then need to describe

592
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,320
what this afferent field looks like and

593
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,880
that's given by this part of the

594
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,080
equation here

595
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,000
so on the left here this set of terms

596
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,980
describes how the field evolves through

597
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,480
time we're not going to focus on that

598
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,700
today over here which is what we're

599
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,000
interested in where we've got how the

600
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,299
field is evolving through space

601
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,120
and so here we can see our friend the

602
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,580
LaPlace Beltrami operator which

603
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,100
describes the geometry and here we've

604
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,500
got the length scale of axonal

605
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,140
connectivity so in this model we make a

606
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,039
very simple assumption about

607
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,020
conductivity we assume each point is

608
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,360
connected to its neighbors in a distance

609
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,240
dependent and isotropic way and that

610
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,740
distance dependence is roughly

611
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,900
exponential so the idea is that areas

612
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,659
nearby to a given location are will have

613
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,760
a strong influence and that influence

614
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,340
declines roughly exponentially as a

615
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,200
function of distance

616
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,080
and uh that the the speed of that decay

617
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,900
is given by this R term here

618
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,179
you can see that geometry is firmly

619
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,179
embedded in this equation now I should

620
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,440
point out this isn't something that's

621
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,480
just been plucked out of thin air this

622
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,720
is a damped wave equation that has been

623
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,880
used for centuries to describe wave

624
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,679
Dynamics in all sorts of different media

625
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,100
and so from that physics we know very

626
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,659
well that the geometry of the system

627
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,840
constrains the spatial properties of the

628
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,280
wave propagation

629
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,020
and you can start from first principles

630
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,000
of neuronal biophysics and derive this

631
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,299
equation

632
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,059
and given all that work we know that the

633
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,480
eigen modes of the LaPlace Beltrami

634
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,980
operator actually correspond to the

635
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,840
standing waves of the Dynamics so what

636
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,940
are standing waves so in this simple

637
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,559
like example we've got two traveling

638
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,200
waves here a blue and a green and as

639
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,760
they interact with each other you get

640
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,559
these patterns of constructive and

641
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,020
destructive interference uh represented

642
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,659
by this red line here that cause these

643
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,760
very large amplitude fluctuations that

644
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,220
are fixed in space right so they're not

645
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,419
actually traveling like the original

646
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,520
carrier waves they're fixed in space so

647
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,559
that's why they're called standing waves

648
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,539
and they're a nice example of resonance

649
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,260
so these fluctuations in the red

650
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,419
in the red Trace are much larger in

651
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,100
amplitude than the original carrier

652
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,720
waves so it's an example of resonance

653
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,279
where we're getting a larger response in

654
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,659
the system than the energy that we put

655
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:55,620
in

656
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,360
and just to convince you that this is

657
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,760
something real here for example we have

658
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,000
a pool of water a classic wave system if

659
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,159
you apply vibrations at a specific point

660
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,340
in in the pool you see these waves that

661
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,679
travel out they hit the opposite wall

662
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,140
reflect back and start to interact and

663
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,880
then you see these the emergence of

664
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,559
these standing wave patterns that are

665
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,260
fixed in space but show these very large

666
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,000
scale amplitude fluctuations

667
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,880
another classic example is the clubny

668
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,799
plate so if you arrange dust particles

669
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,200
on a plate and then you apply some

670
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,659
vibration at a particular frequency the

671
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,820
dust particles will settle into these uh

672
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,340
complex patterns uh the pattern is

673
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,840
determined by the specific frequency

674
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,179
that you apply and specifically where

675
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,779
you apply the vibration and the pattern

676
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,700
the patterns correspond to the eigen

677
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,980
modes of the plane and again those

678
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,200
patterns are determined by the physical

679
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,080
properties of the plate things like its

680
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,539
stiffness its geometry and so on

681
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,460
gratuitous but you can extend the idea

682
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,620
to three dimensions and you can actually

683
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,799
cause the particles to levitate again in

684
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:10,919
this case they're trapped within the

685
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,100
nodal lines of sound waves that are

686
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,260
being projected in three dimensions

687
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,880
and this does have real world

688
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,580
consequences so this is a video of the

689
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,039
Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the 1940s

690
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,600
the engineers didn't pay enough

691
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,240
attention to eigen modes and so on this

692
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,279
particular day Crosswinds hit the bridge

693
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,720
in just the right spots and just the

694
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,760
right frequencies to excite the

695
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,200
eigenmerge of the bridge so you

696
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,179
triggered these resonant responses and

697
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,039
create these large-scale amplitude

698
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,380
fluctuations that ultimately led to the

699
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,039
collapse of the bridge

700
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:56,100
so uh hopefully a background has kind of

701
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,799
Illustrated that there's sort of two

702
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,799
different views of thinking about uh

703
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,500
which anatomical Pro properties of the

704
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,799
brain might be more more important in

705
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,960
constraining Dynamics so on the one hand

706
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,000
we have the classical kind of connectome

707
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,480
centric view in which we view the cortex

708
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,360
as comprising discrete areas and

709
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,220
Dynamics are dominated by node to node

710
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,200
transmission

711
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,260
uh the connectivity between areas is

712
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,159
topologically complex and not

713
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,020
homogeneous and we very much think that

714
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,460
that's very important and so we

715
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,320
prioritize measuring that

716
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,340
we don't really directly account for the

717
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,440
spatial embedding of the network or its

718
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,360
geometry we can look at it secondarily

719
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,480
but it's not baked into the model

720
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,679
and because we're interested in

721
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,000
connectivity that means we need to

722
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,200
measure it so from a practical

723
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,880
perspective at least if you're dealing

724
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,220
with new Imaging data you need a T1

725
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,140
weighted image to measure brain anatomy

726
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,240
but also diffusion MRI image to be able

727
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,220
to measure brain connectivity

728
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,860
the other perspective uh which is a

729
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,480
geometrically informed perspective that

730
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,880
arises out of neural field Theory views

731
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,860
the cortex as a continuous sheet we're

732
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,299
not making distinctions between

733
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,880
different areas of the cortex we think

734
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,860
Dynamics are dominated by propagating

735
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,320
waves of excitation especially these

736
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,020
mesoscopic and macroscopic scales we

737
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,520
approximate connectivity between

738
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,320
different points of the cortex as being

739
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,679
being homogeneous and distance dependent

740
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,600
so we know that there is a strong

741
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,460
distance dependent in connectivity it

742
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,440
doesn't explain everything so some

743
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,659
things are missed but we know it's

744
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,159
certainly an important feature so then

745
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,779
the question is how far we can get with

746
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,279
this approximation

747
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,200
and a nice feature of this approach is

748
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,059
that we are directly accounting for

749
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,860
spatial and geometric effects the

750
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,659
physical properties of the brain which

751
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,399
are overlooked by the connectome

752
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,580
approach the nice practical benefit of

753
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,500
this approach is that because we

754
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,539
approximate connectivity in a simple way

755
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,640
we don't actually have to measure it we

756
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,440
can derive our basis set simply by

757
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,059
looking at the geometry of the brain and

758
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,100
surrounding it a T1 weighted scan which

759
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,240
is is very standard in MRI experiments

760
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,240
so hopefully that's set the scene for

761
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,340
thinking about different anatomical

762
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,200
constraints on the brain and which ones

763
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,419
we might want to prioritize I'll now

764
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,340
hand over to James he'll talk about how

765
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,080
we went about testing these different

766
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,860
ideas and trying to understand which

767
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,059
constraints might be more important for

768
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,880
Dynamics

769
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,140
all right thank you Alex sir

770
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,320
I'm gonna focus more on the things that

771
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,200
we found in the paper that we recently

772
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,299
published I think a lot of you have the

773
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,000
link for it but there's no incentive

774
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,620
message if you want

775
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,740
to rewind us for the the link so

776
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,500
basically we start with we're trying to

777
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,020
answer and test the theory on which

778
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,080
modes of the brain uh could best uh

779
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,740
describe activity measured in FMI so

780
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,600
we'll Begin by how do we actually

781
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,980
measure these modes so uh geometric

782
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,980
modes are based on the T1 weighted image

783
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,460
which is a standard Imaging tool that

784
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,700
people use in the field and you can

785
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,720
extract

786
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,320
a model of the cortical surface uh here

787
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,740
on the right and this there are robust

788
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,320
pipelines to do so and you can do that

789
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,600
on a population average sense basically

790
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,700
you get a group

791
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,799
template of the surface or you can do

792
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:35,340
that on an individual basis

793
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,340
uh on the other hand connector modes

794
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,880
need diffusion MRI and structure MRI

795
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,100
because you need to kind of align the

796
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,940
two

797
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,200
and then we run a cryptography pipeline

798
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,899
basically finding connections between

799
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,140
regions in the brain

800
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,200
and then from there you can construct a

801
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,260
Vertex level or even region level

802
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,779
connector Matrix basically

803
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,720
it's a matrix where each element

804
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,220
represents the connection of one region

805
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,440
or one vertex to another region or

806
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,899
another vertex

807
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:13,620
and

808
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,520
you feed these cortical surface or these

809
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,440
connector Matrix in the eigenvalue

810
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,140
problem equations that Alex has

811
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,559
mentioned in the previous slides

812
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,600
and then how do we test the performance

813
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,840
of these geometric and connector modes

814
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,299
basically we focus a lot on FMI data

815
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,880
so we uh

816
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,419
there are several open access data sets

817
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:45,419
in that are available for example the

818
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,000
the popular human connection project

819
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,120
which is uh which roughly has about 1200

820
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,820
participants but we focus on 255

821
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,500
participants who are completely

822
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,720
unrelated there are no Twins and no

823
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,960
siblings and within the human connection

824
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,399
project that is said we you can for each

825
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,000
subject uh they have what we call task

826
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,279
evoke data basically these are

827
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,120
functional activity uh whilst that that

828
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,760
was recorded was each participant was

829
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,460
performing a particular task and hcp has

830
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,100
a suite of seven different tasks in

831
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,260
within each task several several

832
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,980
different uh uh contrasts within it

833
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,100
and then we also analyze resting state

834
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,159
data basically State data is where the

835
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,779
the participant is just inside the

836
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:41,700
scanner and just not doing anything and

837
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,260
you just scan uh the brain activity

838
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,260
through time and you can construct a

839
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,700
functional connectivity as well over

840
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,360
each element of this Matrix represents

841
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,179
how correlated the activity is between

842
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,220
two regions

843
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,000
we also analyze data from what we call

844
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,039
numerable it's as I said it's an Open

845
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,679
Access repository of

846
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,300
thousands and thousands of different

847
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,699
maps that people have contributed and

848
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,379
each map was acquired with distinct

849
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:18,320
experimental uh protocols

850
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,940
and we talk about ten thousand of those

851
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,760
from your evolve uh and again uh it's a

852
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,280
the level of

853
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,820
um heterogeneity in the different tasks

854
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,440
uh is quite remarkable in the neurobot

855
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,619
so we wanted to make we wanted to

856
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:38,879
um

857
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,060
do our analyzes on on quite different

858
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,918
tasks to make sure we are capturing

859
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,679
something really meaningful

860
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,879
so just to remind uh yourselves of what

861
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,699
we're going to do next so basically

862
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:55,739
Alice already mentioned this to you

863
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,320
extract for example the spatial map say

864
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,300
that's the task about that and we

865
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,220
decomposed that into different sets of

866
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,160
wagon modes so these patterns could be

867
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,320
the geometric modes or they could be the

868
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,680
connective nodes and it will be weighted

869
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,800
by a coefficient a and the weights

870
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:20,400
represent how each mode is expressed uh

871
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,520
for that particular map and you can

872
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,859
truncate the number of modes that you

873
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,859
can that you want to use and then you

874
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:32,460
can reconstruct back the uh

875
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,839
the the data by just taking a linear sum

876
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:37,859
of

877
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,200
the coefficient multiplied by the

878
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,480
geometric or the connected modes

879
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,140
so what did we find by doing these

880
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,220
analyzes

881
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,520
so first I'm going to show you this how

882
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,460
the special Maps look like in terms of

883
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,800
reconstruction so on the left I'm

884
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,500
showing you the different tasks of

885
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,200
special maps and these are group average

886
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,900
maps for the human connection project

887
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,420
data set and again these are the seven

888
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,579
tasks for that data set

889
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,579
and then we ask okay how if we use about

890
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,599
10 modes uh how would this patient map

891
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,460
look like and for this result we're

892
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,520
focusing on the geometric modes

893
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,160
so the Reconstruction looks like this

894
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,540
from afar you they look quite they look

895
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,280
quite different but if you actually look

896
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,460
a bit closely it already captures the

897
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,099
kind of the large scale uh core scale

898
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:37,800
patterns that you can see from the data

899
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,660
for example this relational map you can

900
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,940
clearly see these the emergence of this

901
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,079
big pattern

902
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,839
now what happens if we incorporate more

903
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,720
modes into it so we increase the number

904
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,480
of modes to 100 and now you can see that

905
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,900
the Reconstruction almost uh looks like

906
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,780
the empirical data but there are still

907
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,420
subtle differences especially especially

908
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,020
in the more localized

909
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,420
activity for example here in the IRS and

910
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,820
if we increase it further you can see

911
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,180
that we can better capture those

912
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,920
isolated

913
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,500
localized patents uh just by increasing

914
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,280
it to 200 modes so you can see that the

915
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,040
modes are actually really an efficient

916
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,700
basis set for task give up data we do

917
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,380
the same for resting state data we

918
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,839
increase the number of modes in here and

919
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,579
compare the functional connectivity of

920
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,800
based from the empirical data and the

921
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,480
Reconstruction and we see the same thing

922
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,920
that has to increase the number of

923
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,140
months to 200 we can connect we can

924
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,540
capture the empirical data and you can

925
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,180
do this in a more systematic way

926
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,960
by calculating how well can we can

927
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,420
reconstruct the empirical data just by

928
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,700
you know taking the correlation of the

929
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,740
empirical and the reconstruction

930
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,280
in reconstructed Maps as a function of

931
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,040
an increasing number of modes and we see

932
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,700
that indeed the Reconstruction accuracy

933
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,099
increases as we increase the number of

934
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,640
modes and up to 200 we can get about you

935
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,300
know

936
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,200
80 85 to 90 accuracy which is quite

937
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,320
efficient given that uh we do the

938
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,540
analysis on a but on a cortical surface

939
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,960
with about thirty thousand vertices so

940
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,540
mathematically the maximum number of

941
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,180
modes available to us is about 30 000

942
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,960
and using 200 out of the 30 000 we can

943
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,440
already reconstruct the data quite uh

944
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,119
efficiently

945
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,640
and then we now

946
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,720
so we've shown that the modes are quite

947
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,760
powerful and efficient in representing

948
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,260
uh the data we now test the

949
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,839
hypotheses or the the questions that

950
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,980
Alex has laid a while ago that are the

951
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,260
geometric modes more passive onions than

952
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,720
the other anatomical modes and when I

953
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,940
say anatomical mods again we're focusing

954
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,780
on the connector modes which is based on

955
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,359
uh the connectivity Matrix but we also

956
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,599
test another anatomical mode based on

957
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,960
uh at EDR rule so an EDR rule is the

958
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,960
exponential distance rule which as Alex

959
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,420
has mentioned a while ago uh which is

960
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,240
that

961
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,560
because the Assumption of near field

962
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,440
theory is that the connections are very

963
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,040
localized and also uh organized in a

964
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,440
distance dependent way spec because

965
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,619
specifically the connection-wide changes

966
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,060
exponentially as a function of distance

967
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,900
so we want to test that uh hypothesis on

968
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,660
how dominant that exponential distance

969
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
effect

970
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,880
Ace set for the the

971
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,980
details we just created a synthetic

972
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,400
network based on a simple probability of

973
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,260
connection following an exponential

974
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,920
distance rule with a scaling factor or

975
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,640
an exponent in Alpha which we matched uh

976
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,359
from empirical diffusion MRI data and

977
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,440
again

978
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
there's a lot of uh empirical evidence

979
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,839
of the existence of this exponential

980
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,480
distance rule so it's not just a a

981
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,200
hypothetical theoretical

982
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,900
kind of assumption we see the effect in

983
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,280
mechanics if you follow the wet

984
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,660
as a function of distance from track

985
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,920
facing data and this is in uh

986
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,780
logarithmic scale you see this linear

987
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,480
curve which represents an exponential in

988
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,440
uh

989
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,020
linear you know coordinates and we see

990
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,660
the same with human uh diffusion MRI

991
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,060
data that the way changes as a function

992
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,980
of distance in an exponential distance

993
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,060
way and even in in other species like

994
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,000
Mouse rats marmosets and so on and so

995
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,920
forth so this is a universal property

996
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,040
found in a lot of different species so

997
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,780
this exponential distance through

998
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,060
connectivity

999
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:19,680
could be uh is actually uh

1000
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,780
empirically valid

1001
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,400
so by using these three different uh

1002
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,859
anatomical properties we can calculate

1003
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,140
the modes using the equations that

1004
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,599
Alexis mentioned Omega and you can get

1005
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,160
these geometric modes on the left

1006
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,859
connector modes in Noodle and the modes

1007
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:39,500
from the exponential distance through

1008
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,680
connectivity on the right and again the

1009
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,800
modes are arranged in quite a unique way

1010
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,680
in that the first couple of modes will

1011
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,040
represent the low spatial frequency or

1012
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,599
patterns with very long special

1013
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,240
wavelengths and if you go further down

1014
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,880
you can get this high spatial frequency

1015
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,000
or short spatial wavelength patterns so

1016
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,480
it's a very uh so the basis set that the

1017
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,880
modes provide

1018
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,200
can capture different scales of the data

1019
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,099
so how do these and anatomical modes

1020
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:20,700
compare when we now reconstruct uh the

1021
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,880
different uh FMI data that we have so

1022
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,260
for resting state functional

1023
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,520
connectivity

1024
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,660
We compare the three modes Again by

1025
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,820
measuring the accuracy as a function of

1026
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,339
the number of modes and you can see that

1027
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:38,400
the geometric mode outperform both of

1028
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,780
the connector and the EDR mounts but you

1029
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,900
can see that either amounts are quite uh

1030
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,480
close to the geometric modes but so

1031
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,079
again suggesting that the the

1032
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,180
fundamental effect that the EDR

1033
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,339
connectivity

1034
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:57,960
uh

1035
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,599
that's in in you know empirical data so

1036
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,880
they like it it highlights the

1037
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,260
importance of this simple but uh

1038
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,579
important exponential distance through

1039
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,040
connectivity and we can see the same

1040
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,200
thing for by reconstructing the

1041
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,660
different task activation maps that we

1042
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,660
have again I'm showing you here the

1043
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,520
difference so it's the geometric minus

1044
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,240
the connector and geometric minor stedia

1045
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,520
reconstruction accuracies and red means

1046
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,800
the geometric modes are outperforming

1047
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,680
the the other atomical modes so

1048
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,960
in all the assets that we have the

1049
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,280
results are quite consistent so again it

1050
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,460
suggests that the geometric modes uh are

1051
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,700
more passive values uh than the other

1052
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,000
anatomical modes that we have

1053
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,060
and then we we golf it bit further on

1054
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,000
how do we actually use the concept of

1055
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,560
these modes uh in analyzing uh

1056
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,520
for my uh activation Maps

1057
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,500
so I'll just kind of just want to

1058
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,420
explain a little bit of what the

1059
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,180
traditional approach we have in brain

1060
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,760
map mapping research so for example you

1061
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,940
do an experiment you

1062
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,520
capture the activation map shown here

1063
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,859
for a particular task and I'm showing

1064
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,079
you here the kind of the 1B version of

1065
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,040
that so the value of the activation

1066
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,960
versus the the vertex in this cortical

1067
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,540
surface so what traditionally what we do

1068
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,880
is to uh

1069
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,680
because we because we want to highlight

1070
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,220
we want people ask okay if a person does

1071
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,980
a particular task which regions of the

1072
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,579
brain are kind of driving those

1073
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:50,300
the

1074
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,280
the behavioral performance that we had

1075
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,900
when it was performing a particular task

1076
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,020
so what people usually do is to

1077
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,440
threshold these Maps uh and you can set

1078
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,760
professional

1079
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,819
barely arbitrarily uh and then you can

1080
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:09,780
get these clusters of activity and we we

1081
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,060
then make a conclusion that these

1082
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,520
clusters of activity are the ones kind

1083
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,420
of driving the behavioral uh effects

1084
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,819
that we see whilst performing a task and

1085
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,160
people can even go further and you know

1086
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,280
hone down exactly really really highly

1087
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,380
localized regions if you increase the

1088
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,640
threshold

1089
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,839
but if you go further back uh we started

1090
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,140
from this whole brain activation map

1091
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,599
you can clearly see that by thresholding

1092
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,280
you're actually removing a lot of

1093
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,560
important you know uh activity patents

1094
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,260
uh that are sub threshold but they but

1095
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,980
they do exist so it's kind of like uh

1096
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,220
the analogy is you know it's by doing

1097
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,339
this these uh thresholding approach you

1098
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,079
just looking just at the tip of the

1099
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:02,880
iceberg you're ignoring a lot of the

1100
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,640
important properties of the iceberg that

1101
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,640
are not seen by the threshold that you

1102
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,660
sent

1103
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,020
so what we can do is to use the mode

1104
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,920
approach to actually look at uh

1105
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,460
the uh and and kind of look at the

1106
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,020
properties of all the of activation maps

1107
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,240
and here on the left I'm showing you

1108
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,760
here the power

1109
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,160
of each mode so basically the whites

1110
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,920
that we obtained from the

1111
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,079
reconstructions that we had in a while

1112
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,440
ago and

1113
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:44,040
the figure on the left shows you the

1114
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,780
results we have

1115
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,540
on average for the human connecting

1116
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,900
project data set and on the right is for

1117
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,480
the 10 000 maps from your Evo

1118
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,280
so what you can see here actually is

1119
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,400
most of the power is already is

1120
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,140
contained within about zero you know

1121
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,680
about 50 modes and if you remember the

1122
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,660
modes represent

1123
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,819
and each mode represents a different

1124
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,339
wavelength and they are arranged and at

1125
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:13,140
the first couple of modes represent

1126
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,280
these long spatial wavelength uh spatial

1127
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,220
structure so what this means is that

1128
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,020
actually in

1129
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,579
in

1130
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,980
FMI activation Maps

1131
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,980
most of the power

1132
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,040
is is within those long wavelengths kind

1133
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,640
of suggesting that indeed by even by

1134
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,579
performing a particular task you you are

1135
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:41,280
actually activating these almost whole

1136
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,020
brain uh

1137
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,940
yeah yeah so you can see this almost

1138
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,640
whole brain activity that again you will

1139
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,619
miss out if you do some thresholding

1140
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,440
effect and the further emphasize the

1141
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,240
importance of these long wavelength

1142
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,579
patterns we did a simple experiment

1143
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:59,880
where we tried to remove say the first

1144
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,760
couple uh long wavelength modes and

1145
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,500
that's the solid curve that you see in

1146
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,740
here and by doing so we start removing

1147
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,260
those long wavelength modes we the

1148
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,720
Reconstruction accuracy completely drops

1149
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,380
even by just removing 25 of them but if

1150
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,020
we just remove the you know the short

1151
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,760
wavelength modes so starting from the

1152
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,339
right the effect on the Reconstruction

1153
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:26,400
accuracy is not that uh significant so

1154
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,260
again alluding to the fact that these

1155
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,079
long wave electrons are really important

1156
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,220
uh and they describe uh the important

1157
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,260
structure found in the activation maps

1158
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,680
from FMI that

1159
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,700
so again so we've shown how the modes

1160
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,819
can explain and and represent spatial

1161
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,940
activation patterns what happens with

1162
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,980
the Dynamics

1163
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,119
and the way we can do this is we go back

1164
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,520
to the Crux of the neural field Theory

1165
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,680
which were to be the geometric arguments

1166
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,260
were based from and neurophy theory is

1167
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,940
very generalized you can you know

1168
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,680
construct different populations of

1169
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,540
excitatory inhibition units and you can

1170
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,579
even connect the thighs inside so forth

1171
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:13,980
but the important bits to remember is

1172
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,900
that very few theory that relies on the

1173
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,240
idea that activation propagates through

1174
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,800
space as waves

1175
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,940
and to simplify the the

1176
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,680
experiment that we want to do because we

1177
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,619
want to model the activity as a function

1178
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,060
of time

1179
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,839
we just focus on the cortex and we

1180
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,859
simulate the equation based from the

1181
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:43,980
wave model and we should

1182
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,339
the parameter but if you look at the

1183
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:48,780
equation there's there are only two

1184
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,819
parameters and we fix one of them so

1185
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:55,200
basically the model is uh only relying

1186
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,260
on tuning one free parameter

1187
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,380
and what we did was to compare that with

1188
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,260
uh a more sophisticated very Mass model

1189
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,200
so there are mass models rely on the

1190
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,540
connector so basically you have regions

1191
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,180
in the brain that they are connected and

1192
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,060
the connections are based from diffusion

1193
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,200
MRI and each region will have its own

1194
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,180
dynamical properties so they evolve

1195
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,839
through through time so you realize a

1196
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,060
lot of this on this connection and again

1197
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,619
local Dynamics

1198
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:30,900
but it's important to highlight that

1199
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,940
this highly sophisticated model has

1200
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,240
about 19 parameters and we fix about 15

1201
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,280
of those but we still need to kind of

1202
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,880
tune about four uh say in comparison to

1203
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,579
the wave model again

1204
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:46,800
model only has one and what we did was

1205
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,040
to how well can it become recapitulate

1206
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,619
uh functional connectivity uh data

1207
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:59,880
so here I'm showing you an example uh

1208
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,059
for the empirical functional

1209
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,579
connectivity that we have and the

1210
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:07,319
resulting model based functional

1211
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,480
connectivity for both the wave and the

1212
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,980
mirror Mass models

1213
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,540
and we can uh kind of

1214
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,200
quantify how well the the model based

1215
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,000
functional connectivity

1216
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,300
results uh stack up with respect to the

1217
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,780
empirical data in a in a variety of ways

1218
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,300
one can look at how well

1219
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,880
that's the edge FC so basically each

1220
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,480
element of this Matrix

1221
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,339
Compares between the empirical and the

1222
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:39,900
model based data and you can see that

1223
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,480
both models are you know performing

1224
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,400
quite similarly

1225
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,440
we can also look at the average

1226
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,440
connectivity within each region so

1227
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,839
basically you're taking the average of a

1228
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,660
row or a column and you can see that the

1229
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,839
wave model now outperforms the mirror

1230
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,000
Mass model by a bit

1231
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,079
and you can gain further because these

1232
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,599
properties the first two properties are

1233
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,780
based on static FC basically you you're

1234
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,640
kind of averaging the effects across

1235
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,420
time but we also mentioned our two

1236
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,200
models compare in capturing uh

1237
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,740
dynamical properties full time and you

1238
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,800
see that the way model actually

1239
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,900
performs uh the neural Mass model

1240
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,540
and so in summary for this it's just to

1241
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,940
show that the Simplicity of the wave

1242
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,520
model uh

1243
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,900
can capture a lot of these properties of

1244
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,720
functional data again highlighting the

1245
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,559
the idea that these wave

1246
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:49,920
evolving or traveling in in space and

1247
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,280
time in the brain is probably a good

1248
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,040
approximation

1249
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,540
we also simulated uh the effect if we

1250
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:03,780
stimulate say the visual cortex so we

1251
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,460
just ping these beautiful cortex and

1252
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:10,020
allow it to the activity to propagate uh

1253
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,900
through space and time and this will be

1254
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,579
the propagation starts from the physical

1255
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:17,339
cortex and then it goes to the frontal

1256
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:19,020
uh

1257
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,780
uh cortex and I think I want to

1258
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,520
highlight one observation that we found

1259
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,740
is that

1260
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,140
we can see that when we started from

1261
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,839
division Politics the activity starts to

1262
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,619
separate into two and in the psychology

1263
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:36,780
and your science literature

1264
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,880
people operate have actually found this

1265
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,460
effect and they call it the separation

1266
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,500
into the dorsal and ventral stream and

1267
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,880
each stream has important uh cognitive

1268
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,599
implications

1269
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:53,040
but people have uh tried to explain the

1270
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,480
Separation by capturing the complex

1271
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,760
layer specific activity in the video

1272
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,520
quartix but what this simple experiment

1273
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,619
that we have done has shown that maybe

1274
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,440
the geometry and the idea of waves

1275
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,000
propagating

1276
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,440
could be sufficient in uh obtaining

1277
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,040
these uh kind of physiological effect

1278
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,380
um and then we also tried to compare it

1279
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:26,040
with how well does it we capitulate the

1280
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,780
visual hierarchy that people have found

1281
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,160
in primates for for example this work by

1282
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,839
uh

1283
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,960
uh in the last uh

1284
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,160
a couple of years where they uh also did

1285
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,280
a simulation uh where they stimulated

1286
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,800
the the cortex and what they found was

1287
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,920
if you followed regions along the visual

1288
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,040
hierarchy in the macaque cortex you see

1289
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,740
the activity patterns are kind of

1290
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,960
delayed in a hierarchical way so they

1291
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,500
follow the same kind of uh

1292
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,500
relationship as the visual hierarchy so

1293
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,300
we did the same thing we compared the

1294
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,359
activity the Ambit should

1295
00:55:08,359 --> 00:55:12,119
of the activity by matching the regions

1296
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:14,819
that people found individual hierarchy

1297
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:18,300
of the macarthics and we we tried to

1298
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,339
find the regions in the human brain

1299
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:25,559
and then we see the same effect and then

1300
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,420
we when we compared it to a typical

1301
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,960
measure of hierarchy in the new Imaging

1302
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,680
Space by using the intercortical map

1303
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,619
which is just the ratio of T1 and T2

1304
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:41,520
we see the affected the time to peak of

1305
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,400
these activation patterns

1306
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,540
uh what captures the rack of the

1307
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,640
infracorical Marine again highlighting

1308
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,880
that indeed what we're getting is

1309
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,460
capturing this this hierarchical kind of

1310
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,440
processing uh

1311
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,740
uh starting from Individual cortex

1312
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,500
and think of the last result that I want

1313
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,020
to highlight is the uh

1314
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,660
the subcortex because

1315
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,059
again the brain is just not it's not

1316
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:14,640
just the cortex so what we did was to

1317
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,740
also calculate the modes from

1318
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,619
subcortical regions and what we did was

1319
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:21,599
to mask the subcortical regions and

1320
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,020
perform the same uh and and uh

1321
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,000
solve the same equation using the

1322
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,440
LaPlace with primary operator and you

1323
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,660
can get these Arguments for the thymus

1324
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,540
spray item in the hippocampus and we

1325
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,599
compared that to what we call in the

1326
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,160
field as functional gradients basically

1327
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,800
they are representations uh low

1328
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,140
dimensional representation of resting

1329
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,099
state FMI data so

1330
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:49,500
what we did was to

1331
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,619
compare the geometric modes for the

1332
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,280
different subcortical structures and the

1333
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,220
different functional gradients based on

1334
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:03,059
FMI data and you can see that the modes

1335
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:04,800
uh

1336
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,599
uh

1337
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,300
almost perfect in perfect correspondence

1338
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,180
with the functional gradients and we see

1339
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,619
the same effect for the different

1340
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:16,200
structures again probably highlighting

1341
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,140
the idea that the geometric effects that

1342
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,079
we solve in the cortex are much more

1343
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,619
dominant in the subcortics that geometry

1344
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:28,920
really constraints function

1345
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,119
um

1346
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,540
just to tie things together

1347
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,319
um

1348
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,420
what are the advantages of this approach

1349
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,339
that we found

1350
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:40,400
first it's a it's a more physical

1351
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,540
understanding of the relationship

1352
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,280
between structure and function based on

1353
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,160
ideas in physics engineering that has

1354
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,920
been used in the last century

1355
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,319
the convection modes are only based on

1356
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,680
T1 rated images so it's very simple to

1357
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,220
perform and the analysis can be done by

1358
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,460
anyone with a structural T1 weighted

1359
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,700
image and hence you can apply it in

1360
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,559
quite different experimental contexts in

1361
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:10,319
both humans other species health and

1362
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,579
disease

1363
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:14,940
and finally to summarize things

1364
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,339
I hopefully we've shown that drastic

1365
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,319
modes are indeed more passive monies

1366
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:22,020
than other anatomical modes and this is

1367
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,660
confirming a lot of the predictions from

1368
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,079
theoretical uh

1369
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,599
calculations of near field Theory and

1370
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:32,160
highlights the importance of treating

1371
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,099
the brain as this uh really physical

1372
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:37,980
system in correspondence with what we

1373
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,420
people are doing in physics and

1374
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,640
engineering

1375
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,579
uh but it also highlights the idea that

1376
00:58:44,579 --> 00:58:47,960
the effects that we see in FMI might be

1377
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,480
dominated by the effect of this simple

1378
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,940
local and exponential distance for

1379
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,880
connectivity however uh

1380
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,700
the the uh the contributions of

1381
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,319
long-range connections are still there

1382
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:02,760
but the

1383
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,040
uh what we're highlighting is maybe the

1384
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,420
uh

1385
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,579
their influence may not be observable

1386
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:11,339
with the resolution that we currently

1387
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,740
have with FMI data so it would be

1388
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,359
interesting to see and perform these

1389
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,859
experiments in a much more highly

1390
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:19,079
resolved say track tracing data from

1391
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:20,819
other species

1392
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:25,260
uh that we found that evoked activity is

1393
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,059
dominated by these long wavelength nodes

1394
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:28,619
which is pretty much challenges a lot of

1395
00:59:28,619 --> 00:59:30,720
the traditional approach that we have in

1396
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,780
the new Imaging field where we focus a

1397
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,359
lot on these focal activations

1398
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:39,420
and that traveling waves shaped by

1399
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,880
geometry are sufficient to explain a lot

1400
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,180
of a lot of physiological phenomena by

1401
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,880
you know that they just emerge from the

1402
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,460
model and within begged all these

1403
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,980
physiological phenomena into the model

1404
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,099
uh and finally the geometric constraints

1405
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:59,520
seem to be universally uh exist in both

1406
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,160
cortex and subcortics and that we can

1407
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,500
only we can use one single approach to

1408
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,099
study the you know the whole brain uh

1409
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:09,720
quite nicely

1410
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,119
and I just wanna

1411
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,160
both Alex and I would like to thank all

1412
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,440
the other co-authors of the work he has

1413
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,240
been a truly multi-institute

1414
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,040
collaboration

1415
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,440
all the Open Access Data set that we

1416
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,839
have used and if people are interested

1417
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:27,900
in doing our analyzes

1418
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,040
we have written an Open Access uh

1419
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,220
software package repository in GitHub

1420
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,200
you can access that in here so people

1421
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,420
can you know

1422
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,640
analyze valves in the brain in quite

1423
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,000
different contexts that they want to do

1424
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,040
and I think that's where we want to end

1425
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,700
thank you

1426
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,359
awesome well thank you for the great

1427
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,119
presentation

1428
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:01,020
a lot of places to go first all past to

1429
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,559
Dean

1430
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,260
um thank you gentlemen I I

1431
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,619
I first got winded this paper through uh

1432
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:12,900
another individual on the active

1433
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,460
inference community

1434
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,339
and I think I was the one that may have

1435
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:20,099
pounded the table that we might want to

1436
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:23,760
do a a guest stream on this and it's

1437
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,740
picked the paper and really brought it

1438
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,420
to life so

1439
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,220
thank you very much I really appreciate

1440
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,119
it especially some of the dynamic images

1441
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:34,440
I think it really helps in terms of

1442
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,680
explaining what you guys were trying to

1443
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,880
um

1444
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,520
trying to do your work with in your and

1445
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,960
your subject matter on so I'll just

1446
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,400
start with that I have some questions

1447
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,520
later on but just first of all thank you

1448
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,020
for uh

1449
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,819
for a fantastic

1450
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:53,520
um explanation

1451
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,180
thank you

1452
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,299
well you present this in a neuroscience

1453
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,760
setting what's a common response or

1454
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,160
reaction from the introduction

1455
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,799
I could really tell how careful you were

1456
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:08,819
to

1457
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:12,420
speak to the totality and the different

1458
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,480
threads in Neuroscience so after all

1459
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,200
that set up and all the statistical

1460
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,119
analysis that's presented

1461
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,520
where does that put people in terms of

1462
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,079
their own understanding of the way that

1463
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:26,520
they've been doing

1464
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,220
complementary methodologies or orienting

1465
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,598
their research questions that way

1466
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,099
yeah I think um

1467
01:02:37,099 --> 01:02:39,839
and generally people I mean at least we

1468
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,599
found that people are quite interested

1469
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:45,960
um I guess the approach is a bit

1470
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,500
different to how a neuroscientist would

1471
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,440
typically think about the brain but kind

1472
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,839
of aligns with how say you know a

1473
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:56,880
physicist might now Lively start

1474
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,859
approaching thinking about a modeling

1475
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:00,480
the brain and so the work was really

1476
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,220
trying to bring those two kind of

1477
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,500
perspectives together

1478
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,119
um you know I think the other reaction

1479
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:09,059
is is usually kind of yeah this is this

1480
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:10,799
is really interesting

1481
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,660
um you know then

1482
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,579
how do I how do I make sense of it or

1483
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:16,619
what I do practically

1484
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:19,799
um you know there has been

1485
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:21,480
I guess

1486
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,180
there is

1487
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:26,819
some people might kind of split

1488
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:28,260
split it artificially into this

1489
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,000
comparison of odd geometry versus

1490
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,619
connectivity

1491
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:34,740
um which is probably not the right way

1492
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,240
to think about it

1493
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,160
um it's you know the way we like to

1494
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,319
think about it is that

1495
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,059
um you know we're sort of comparing two

1496
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:44,339
different models and each of those

1497
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:47,220
models makes certain approximations and

1498
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,920
prioritizes different features

1499
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,520
um

1500
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,200
the you know the approach we put forward

1501
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,780
in this paper emphasizes the role of

1502
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,260
geometry and it does have connectivity

1503
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:00,960
embedded in that model it's just a kind

1504
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,460
of simplified approximation of

1505
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,200
connectivity this kind of homogeneous

1506
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,559
distance dependent panel

1507
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:09,960
um whereas you know typical connectome

1508
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,599
Centric view will try to capture all the

1509
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,119
complex connectivity but we'll ignore

1510
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,240
also the horizontal connectivity

1511
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,460
um that really is what drives activity

1512
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,799
spreading through the brain that's

1513
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,839
completely ignored and so really you

1514
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,579
know the idea behind this work was to

1515
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:29,760
kind of test in a way between these two

1516
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,940
approaches and you know say which ones

1517
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,640
approximations were kind of more useful

1518
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,240
in a sense

1519
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,400
do you want to add something or I can

1520
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,380
make a comment there

1521
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,359
no finish finish this because then I'm

1522
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,559
going to ask my questions about the

1523
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,180
cello yeah well the statistics was very

1524
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,460
clear and and it was very interesting

1525
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:56,760
how with two different data sets there

1526
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,920
was similar curves with also very

1527
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,020
different number of samples

1528
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,020
so it was almost like the the some of

1529
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,940
the statistical distributions were

1530
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,640
latched onto relatively early

1531
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,980
and then that like captured the big

1532
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,400
continent and um

1533
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,680
a lot of the connections are local this

1534
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,319
is and this is of course a topic to

1535
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:21,299
explore about the molecular and the

1536
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:24,480
mechanistic electromagnetic basis and

1537
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,339
whether this to what extent it

1538
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,760
represents traveling propagating

1539
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,200
electrochemical waves

1540
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,799
and or loading heavily on simply

1541
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,920
diffuse local connections and and even

1542
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,740
the the blurry line between those two

1543
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:43,079
so it is really like a question about

1544
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:44,940
what is being captured because even the

1545
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,200
EDR with the spread

1546
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:51,180
captures a variance component related to

1547
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:55,500
local abundance direct fast acting

1548
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,180
connections

1549
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,599
in some regions and distance connections

1550
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:03,299
maybe over the days

1551
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:07,619
digital connections really do matter as

1552
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:10,980
as the the jello sets

1553
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,960
and things change

1554
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,599
but at the exact time scale that some of

1555
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,660
these patterns are happening at your

1556
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:22,020
work is showing new

1557
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,539
information

1558
01:06:23,539 --> 01:06:26,520
and comparison with different ways it's

1559
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,480
been looked at

1560
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,000
yeah

1561
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,200
um I mean

1562
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,000
I think one of the

1563
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,339
things that it highlighted or even

1564
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:43,319
probably just you know in my head is

1565
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,839
we've been focusing a lot on

1566
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,240
trying to capture the effects of this

1567
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,780
complex connectivity right and we ignore

1568
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,900
all these lateral horizontal local you

1569
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,539
know diffusing connections

1570
01:06:57,539 --> 01:07:00,119
but what the work has now kind of shown

1571
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:03,000
it highlighted the kind of maybe the

1572
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,400
issues that we have with FMI right maybe

1573
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,839
you know

1574
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:09,240
because truly the both of these roles

1575
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,220
happen

1576
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,440
probably you know simultaneously right

1577
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,539
but just the effects that we're seeing

1578
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:17,160
in FMI

1579
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,140
but it's probably not the most efficient

1580
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:23,099
way to capture Both Worlds uh or it

1581
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:25,980
cannot hung down the specifics of one

1582
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,839
world over the other

1583
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:29,339
uh

1584
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:31,799
in the resource that we're getting is

1585
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:35,220
the the effects of this you know very

1586
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,559
localized connectivity

1587
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:41,099
probably dominates uh a lot of what we

1588
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:44,460
see there FMI uh but

1589
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,760
time will tell if you know we improve

1590
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,520
the ways we capture right activated with

1591
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,680
openai and this is really kind of

1592
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,839
particularly focused on the different

1593
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:58,559
aspects of the approximations

1594
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,160
uh to me that's the kind of the beauty

1595
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,559
of the work it now highlighted these

1596
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:05,460
effects

1597
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:09,960
into the you know broader audience

1598
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,660
yeah I think that definitely I mean you

1599
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,400
know everything that we've presented is

1600
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,799
really addressing things that we measure

1601
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,560
with fmri so on pretty course spatial

1602
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,540
and temporal scales there's some

1603
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:24,179
theoretical work suggesting that kind of

1604
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:26,100
you know the more complex aspects of

1605
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,839
connectivity that can't be explained by

1606
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,799
an EDR I play an important role in

1607
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,238
supporting Dynamic transitions between

1608
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:35,339
different brain States

1609
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:36,779
um but that would happen on a very rapid

1610
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,479
scale that could be missed with fmri at

1611
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:41,939
least a typically organized fmri

1612
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:43,920
experiment and so one thing we're

1613
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,660
interested in in looking at further is

1614
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,640
trying to pick that apart a little bit

1615
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,120
and trying to isolate the functional

1616
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,738
contributions of those more complicated

1617
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:53,939
connections

1618
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:56,580
okay

1619
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,560
cool Dean

1620
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,620
can I ask about the metaphor of the the

1621
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,640
spoon tapping on the on the cello there

1622
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,600
metaphorically speaking that seems like

1623
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,259
it's like an external perturbation on a

1624
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:14,339
on something that can respond to that

1625
01:09:14,339 --> 01:09:15,359
now

1626
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,819
he'll appreciate I'm I'm asking from a

1627
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:19,738
very naive point of view and

1628
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,439
uncomfortable with it is there any

1629
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:24,738
difference then in in terms of say

1630
01:09:24,738 --> 01:09:26,779
something that happens

1631
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:28,859
interceptively like something that's

1632
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:31,679
simply coming from within system and

1633
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,380
does that does that show up in the same

1634
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:37,020
way as when there's a response to an

1635
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,839
external stimuli

1636
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,719
yeah so you know the actual underlying

1637
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,880
model a key component that we haven't

1638
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,640
really talked about is that you have uh

1639
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:51,060
thalamo cortical loops and there's a

1640
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,660
driving input from the thalamus that

1641
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,000
influences the wave activity in the

1642
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,960
cortex

1643
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,860
and uh you know they could be sensory

1644
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:04,520
thalamic nuclei or they could be

1645
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,920
interceptive inputs as well and they are

1646
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,719
would be expected to drive cortical

1647
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:12,360
activity in different and you know

1648
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,179
spatially non-uniform ways

1649
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:17,580
um you know really distinguishing

1650
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,560
between those different types of inputs

1651
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,140
as far as I'm aware hasn't been modeled

1652
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,840
yet it's all been kind of a a simple

1653
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,699
level where you treat the cortex

1654
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:28,140
homogeneously and you have a single

1655
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,760
thalamic nucleus I mean some people have

1656
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,800
started to split them up

1657
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,679
um but you know that would be that the

1658
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:36,420
underlying principle and the model could

1659
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:38,400
be extended

1660
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,140
um in such a way that you could

1661
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,480
potentially distinguish between

1662
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:45,799
interceptive and extra receptive inputs

1663
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,679
I just want to add for example the

1664
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,840
visual cortex experiment that we perform

1665
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,179
it's a really simple perturbation right

1666
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:56,760
but it could represent different types

1667
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,800
of perturbation and we just can't you

1668
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,120
know particularly capture at the moment

1669
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,940
but it's like an overlying if we perturb

1670
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,800
it in a certain way this will be the

1671
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,920
effect that we see uh but yeah you might

1672
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,880
want to know what I was going to ask

1673
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,020
next thing because that was the

1674
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,520
direction I was going with that visual

1675
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,920
cortex example so

1676
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,500
so from the active infants Community one

1677
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,060
of the things that we're always dealing

1678
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,980
with is surprise

1679
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:23,280
say versus sensory attenuation and then

1680
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,159
on the third vertices the

1681
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,679
seeming unawareness prior to the

1682
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:31,320
surprise or the attenuated state but

1683
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,900
still available and so I'm kind of

1684
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,400
curious

1685
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,940
when you move away from the visual

1686
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,699
can you still have these sort of same

1687
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:43,739
waves going through the brain because

1688
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:47,699
other sensory uptake is causing that

1689
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:50,280
same you get a surprise in feeling like

1690
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,400
a sense of weightlessness perhaps right

1691
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,420
or your your an astronaut and

1692
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,480
that's now something new you become

1693
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,980
attenuated to what

1694
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,340
is there I know it kind of stuck with

1695
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:09,300
the fmri but it just seems so the

1696
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,100
possibilities in terms of what you guys

1697
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,900
are opening up

1698
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,360
just seems really interesting is that

1699
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,440
something

1700
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,860
like the Interceptor thing where you can

1701
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,780
see this now having

1702
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:26,659
opening up new new areas of inquiry

1703
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,780
uh yeah so I think there's some really

1704
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,219
interesting work

1705
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:33,350
where

1706
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,659
[Music]

1707
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:34,620
um

1708
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:38,100
people have looked at

1709
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,620
um recursive neural Nets

1710
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:43,679
uh structured in such a way that you can

1711
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,800
get wave-like propagation between the

1712
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,199
elements of the network and have shown

1713
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,760
that the systems that have that wave

1714
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,860
like propagation uh it actually

1715
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,960
facilitates their ability to predict

1716
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,020
what's happening in same movie

1717
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,340
um so it improves their predictive

1718
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:03,600
performance uh physiologically it'll

1719
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,620
have shown that you know just with

1720
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,600
simple visual stimulation you get these

1721
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,340
back to front propagations but there's

1722
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:09,719
also front

1723
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,659
to back propagations which are

1724
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:15,420
presumably encoding the predictions and

1725
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,900
so then the question is

1726
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,820
how do the

1727
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,320
top down predictions in the bottom-up

1728
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,000
censoring will get reconciled between

1729
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,520
the interactions of these waves

1730
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,580
um you know I think these are kind of

1731
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:32,820
really interesting ways forward that

1732
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:34,860
we're still coming to terms with and

1733
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,840
we're not we haven't really quite

1734
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,100
[Music]

1735
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,300
um

1736
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:43,440
made sense of what the what the wires

1737
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,120
mean for computation I know that Peter

1738
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,560
Robinson who's on the slide here has

1739
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,840
written a couple of papers

1740
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,380
um talking about how these fields can

1741
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,120
relate to predictions

1742
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,239
um yeah but yeah I think this is kind of

1743
01:13:57,239 --> 01:13:58,020
a

1744
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,500
very new exciting area that um is worth

1745
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,940
exploring

1746
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:06,120
yeah one kind of connection there is

1747
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,480
like the standing wave that you showed

1748
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,659
in the physical water pool

1749
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:16,199
and so now when we're looking at a solid

1750
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:17,820
color visually

1751
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,179
there's some St and there's some stable

1752
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:22,320
non-equilibrium steady state or stable

1753
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,000
representation or a stable population

1754
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,500
code or all these different things which

1755
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,540
which may not be

1756
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:28,280
um

1757
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,840
exhaustive or incompatible like at all

1758
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,960
but there's some standing wave now maybe

1759
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,000
that is

1760
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,480
component number 99 just like principle

1761
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,280
component 99 it's amplitude might be

1762
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,239
small

1763
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:44,640
but there's like some

1764
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,199
mode

1765
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:48,719
that is that's ramping up and its

1766
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,360
Associated positively or it's ramping

1767
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,840
down its Associated negatively

1768
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,900
and and there's some

1769
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:00,600
standing pattern that emits the pelting

1770
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,940
of new sensory observations and like a

1771
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,820
Bayesian updating setting

1772
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:08,760
it is remaining the same now the more

1773
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,500
inertia you have on the distribution the

1774
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,360
more stable it's going to be which is

1775
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,679
like equivalent to saying the less

1776
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,900
attention you pay to sensory stimuli the

1777
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,580
more stable your your priors are going

1778
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,080
to be it could be a prior about

1779
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,060
perception it could be a prior about

1780
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,280
action

1781
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,340
and there are descending motor

1782
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,040
patterns as well and all these different

1783
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,520
modes are being played like

1784
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,739
in an apartment building and there's

1785
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:36,300
like different songs but they're

1786
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,340
happening in different frequency spatial

1787
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:41,040
temporal and frequency bands so that we

1788
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,340
can tune in to different songs like

1789
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,620
different radio stations

1790
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:50,300
but with more spatial richness

1791
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,380
it's a total expansion of the palette

1792
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,440
that

1793
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,340
recapitulates certain aspects of

1794
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,600
topology and helps us even identify

1795
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,300
residuals that are are most apt to be

1796
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,560
explained

1797
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,659
that way

1798
01:16:09,659 --> 01:16:14,219
but it also opens up to like these big

1799
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:17,280
waves that get filtered out like by low

1800
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,980
pass potentially filtering in different

1801
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,300
data sets

1802
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,179
so that shorter term relationships can

1803
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,679
become more apparent

1804
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,560
but that can be the Ripple on the wave

1805
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,900
and so end up throwing out a huge amount

1806
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:34,320
just of the sheer information contents

1807
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,199
of Rich dynamical data sets

1808
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,920
yeah really interesting concept trying

1809
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,800
to wrap my hair around it

1810
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,140
uh yes it's it's really cool because you

1811
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,520
know again

1812
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,699
we we still don't know what because what

1813
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:58,260
we found is that for example in a

1814
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:01,320
different task data that we have not all

1815
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,140
modes are equally excited certain modes

1816
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:07,140
are excited in quite different ways and

1817
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,020
we don't know what yet what these

1818
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:13,080
combinations mean truly uh behaviorally

1819
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,320
cognitively and

1820
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,040
but yeah we'll we'll keep working on it

1821
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,140
as far as and

1822
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:25,100
see what happens yeah

1823
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,320
tell us one more quick question so so I

1824
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,260
appreciate the geometry part of it

1825
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,000
um

1826
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
so

1827
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:40,260
does any of this

1828
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:43,800
speak also to the the sort of the

1829
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,500
tunneling effects of the sort of that

1830
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,540
eigen value or eigen mode eigenvalue

1831
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,800
Quantum peace where

1832
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,659
it's you know you could be rotting the

1833
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:56,280
surface of this and appreciating that

1834
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,600
the the parsimonious speaking

1835
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:04,140
speak to that surface effect

1836
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,719
is there anything about this that also

1837
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,380
helps us understand better how something

1838
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:14,340
goes you know from through the wave like

1839
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:18,780
quite literally across from one one

1840
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:21,659
slope past the crown and on to the other

1841
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:24,540
side or is that again something that you

1842
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,520
guys weren't really spending a lot of

1843
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,000
time on but I did notice I I pulled out

1844
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,820
the paper and I noticed on page 11 you

1845
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,620
were talking about some of the ways that

1846
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:37,080
you were analyzing the volumes so that's

1847
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,719
the context that I was curious about

1848
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:42,780
that sort of tunneling piece to go along

1849
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:46,080
with how we sort of follow the the

1850
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,400
patterns on the surface

1851
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,300
well I'm not quite sure I follow you

1852
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,460
asking how

1853
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:59,520
let me try to let me try to see where it

1854
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,699
comes as I see it Dean's a Quantum

1855
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:06,299
tunneling connoisseur

1856
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,520
most even

1857
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:13,380
and uh with the basis set of the sine

1858
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:14,820
wave

1859
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,659
it's like imposing this kind of

1860
01:19:17,659 --> 01:19:19,679
oscillatory pattern and then you're

1861
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,420
you're up waiting or down waiting but is

1862
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,340
it possible to use a basis set or is it

1863
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,500
possible to detect modes in your

1864
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,320
analysis where there's like an effect

1865
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,900
locally and then there's like a then

1866
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,520
there's like a tunnel and there's like a

1867
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,380
region that the wave doesn't appear to

1868
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,860
pass through

1869
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,320
oh

1870
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:50,480
by the way thank you Daniel

1871
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:59,699
oh we're stumped I guess it means on

1872
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:02,400
what you mean by tunneling right so like

1873
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,199
each mode like if you look at the high

1874
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,480
frequency modes they are quite patchy

1875
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,140
and so they'll be sort of disjointed

1876
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:12,239
areas of high amplitude and low

1877
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,640
amplitude but they fluctuate in time

1878
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,320
right like then there's standing waves

1879
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,780
and so they'll kind of alternate up and

1880
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,060
down so in a sense it looks like there's

1881
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:23,760
coupling over long distances

1882
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,540
um

1883
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,760
but

1884
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,679
um that's just due to the standing wide

1885
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:30,300
dynamics which is just driven by the

1886
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,560
interference pattern of the traveling

1887
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,000
rights

1888
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,659
um so you know I'm not sure if that's

1889
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:38,340
kind of what you're getting at but I

1890
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,980
guess yeah from a perspective of just if

1891
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,480
you're just looking at the standing wave

1892
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,120
Dynamics it would look like things in

1893
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,340
spatially disjoint locations were kind

1894
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,719
of uh coupled in some way okay

1895
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:54,120
it's like one jello

1896
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:57,960
it it stays put where you hit it and it

1897
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:58,980
stays put

1898
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,659
one mile away

1899
01:21:00,659 --> 01:21:02,699
and it oscillates between like a jump

1900
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:04,500
rope

1901
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,840
um or it could be hit somewhere that's

1902
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,060
also very variable then be like the

1903
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,860
opposite of a jump rope

1904
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:14,040
with one one mode

1905
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,980
and that's what's captured in the set of

1906
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,960
functions that are then parameterized so

1907
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,360
then when you assemble them or when you

1908
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,760
um superimpose them you you could get

1909
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,620
like

1910
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,699
um

1911
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:30,440
kind of digitized looking

1912
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:34,620
outcome patterns in terms of the real

1913
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:38,120
empirical correlations

1914
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,100
and it's map not territory and it's

1915
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,900
tempting to interpret these very

1916
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:46,620
literally as with many statistical tools

1917
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,060
one I think as we've discussed like

1918
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:49,260
there's there's multiple possible

1919
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,120
mechanisms and in your paper and in your

1920
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,320
work you probably

1921
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,239
thought of many many

1922
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,460
chanisms that lend themselves to like

1923
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,380
unique empirical predictions

1924
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,159
but

1925
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,920
basis set decomposition is used like in

1926
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,120
SPM

1927
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,000
which is kind of like the

1928
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,739
one of the precedents of active

1929
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:12,780
inference and and the work by Carl first

1930
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:17,059
and others it's using basis sets as well

1931
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,920
so

1932
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,500
yeah they used uh they use it everywhere

1933
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,260
do you have any closing

1934
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:31,199
or or near closing like thoughts or

1935
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,940
where does the work go

1936
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:35,040
how do people what data sets are Salient

1937
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,739
or questions or cognitive phenomena or

1938
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:39,179
like what are you excited about for your

1939
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:42,500
lab and for the fields

1940
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,340
your left

1941
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:49,140
I mean there's there's a few different

1942
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:51,780
uh ways that we're interested in in

1943
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,880
progressing it um

1944
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:57,480
so one is I guess trying to reconcile

1945
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:00,360
this uh purely geometric approach that

1946
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,980
makes a very simple approximation with

1947
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,300
connectivity with the actual

1948
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,460
connectivity of the brain and trying to

1949
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:07,199
understand

1950
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,520
if

1951
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,260
the contributions of these kind of

1952
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:12,300
complex connections are not so easily

1953
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,880
revealed by classic fmri experiment or

1954
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,980
what are their contributions to Dynamics

1955
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,860
and is there a way of kind of uh

1956
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,420
bringing some of that complex

1957
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,760
connectivity into the into the wave

1958
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,580
model and trying to get some traction on

1959
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,860
that question

1960
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,500
um

1961
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,900
another aspect is

1962
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,280
you know we've done the simplest thing

1963
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,380
we trade all areas of the cortex is

1964
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,260
homogeneous but we know that's not the

1965
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,020
case uh areas vary in terms of the cell

1966
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:45,540
density degree of myelination and level

1967
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:48,540
of synaptic complexity and density and

1968
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,980
so on

1969
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,960
um and so that in a sense could be

1970
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,460
imagine you could imagine that it's

1971
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:55,320
changing the effective geometry of the

1972
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,080
cortex and so we're playing around with

1973
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,760
how do you introduce that heterogeneity

1974
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,020
and how does that change the mode

1975
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:03,600
structure and uh does that have an

1976
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,219
impact on your ability to reconstruct

1977
01:24:05,219 --> 01:24:07,820
Dynamics

1978
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:08,940
um

1979
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,620
we're then also interested in sort of

1980
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,320
taking this board to

1981
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,540
leverage these approaches for thinking

1982
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,040
about different ways in which we might

1983
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,780
be able to map brain changes in

1984
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:21,840
different disorders or or variations

1985
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,540
across species and so on and so kind of

1986
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:25,800
like um

1987
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,620
you know classical SPM analyzes but

1988
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:31,320
making inference at the modal level and

1989
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,940
seeing if that can provide some some

1990
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:34,380
useful insights

1991
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,000
so there's a few different

1992
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
strategies

1993
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,260
any other comments or thoughts

1994
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,719
yeah Dean where where do you go after

1995
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:51,600
this Dean in your own neuroimaging

1996
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,560
career

1997
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,080
no stop it I just think it was a very

1998
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,420
clear picture and I really again I

1999
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:00,659
really appreciated the paper itself

2000
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:03,780
um but today's presentation sort of
