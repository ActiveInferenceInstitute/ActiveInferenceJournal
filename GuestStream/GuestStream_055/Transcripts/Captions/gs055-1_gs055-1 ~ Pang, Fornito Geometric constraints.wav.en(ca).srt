00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,014
Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:06,026
This is Active Inference guest stream

3
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:08,682
number 55.1. It's August 30,

4
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:11,982
2023. Today we are going to have a

5
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:15,294
presentation followed by a discussion on

6
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:17,114
geometric constraints on human brain

7
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:20,910
function by James Pang and Alex Fornito.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,206
Thank you again for joining. Really

9
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:26,854
looking forward to the presentation and

10
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:29,334
the discussion. So please off to you two

11
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:30,950
to introduce yourself and continue

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,214
however you like. Thank you. Well,

13
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:36,438
thanks very much, Daniel. My name is

14
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:39,498
Alex Vonita. I'm based in the School of

15
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:40,874
Psychological Sciences and Turn

16
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:42,858
Institute for Brain and Mental Health at

17
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:46,342
Monash University, and James Penn,

18
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:48,698
who is a research fellow working in the

19
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:51,854
team. And so the idea today

20
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:54,046
was that we were going to talk a little

21
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:56,542
bit about this work. I'll begin by

22
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:59,166
providing a bit of a historical and

23
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:01,802
theoretical background and then James

24
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:04,706
will take over and jump into the

25
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:07,234
specifics of what we did and what we

26
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:11,810
found. We're assuming some

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,594
basic understanding of neuroscience and

28
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:17,586
some elements of human brain imaging and

29
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:19,026
we'll go through a little bit of maths,

30
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:22,246
but hopefully it'll be enough to give a

31
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:23,750
picture and if there's any questions

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,366
about it afterwards, we'll be happy to

33
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:29,674
try and answer them. So a

34
00:01:29,712 --> 00:01:32,506
key motivating factor for this work is

35
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:35,146
really trying to understand how the

36
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:36,854
structure or anatomy of the brain

37
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:39,066
constrains its function. And if you look

38
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:41,502
at a diverse range of systems found

39
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:44,686
throughout nature, we know that the

40
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,254
structure of the system can change its

41
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:49,822
dynamics. So, for example, the shape of

42
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:53,266
a racing car will influence its

43
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:55,700
aerodynamics and how fast it can go.

44
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,982
The folding patterns of a protein

45
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:02,706
will influence the other proteins that

46
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:04,546
it can interact with and have quite

47
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:05,954
large effects. So here, for example,

48
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,646
we've got example of the hemoglobin

49
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:11,702
protein in a healthy person and someone

50
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,814
with sickle cell anemia. And this change

51
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,686
in the geometry of the protein leads to

52
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,150
a 20 year difference in life expectancy.

53
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,454
And here we've got the molecular

54
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:25,098
structures of diamond and graphite. So

55
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:28,714
both of these materials are made of the

56
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:30,566
same atoms. They're all purely carbon

57
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:32,654
atoms. It's just the bonds between them

58
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:34,670
that are different. And that difference

59
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,542
is sufficient to create quite a

60
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:40,286
variation in the properties of the

61
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:41,806
material. So diamond being one of the

62
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,986
hardest substances on Earth and valued

63
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:46,562
at somewhere between twelve to $90

64
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:49,138
million per kilo, whereas graphite is

65
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:51,038
one of the most brittle and only costs

66
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:54,402
you about $20 per kilo. And so this is

67
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,114
essentially the reason why we don't

68
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:59,346
propose to people with H two B pencil,

69
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,560
we use diamond rings instead.

70
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,326
Now, the brain is no different. We think

71
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:08,454
anatomy constraints function, but there

72
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:10,906
has been a long standing debate about

73
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:13,066
the specific properties that are the

74
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,634
most relevant and how we should best

75
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,714
conceptualize them. And this can be

76
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:19,974
traced back to the days of Ramani Kahal

77
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:22,346
and Camilla Golgi, two people considered

78
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:24,078
to be some of the founding fathers of

79
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,718
modern neuroscience, golgi developed a

80
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:28,366
technique for staining neurons that

81
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,202
allowed you to visualize their structure

82
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:33,434
under the microscope. And Cahal really

83
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:36,066
perfected that technique and studied the

84
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:38,706
nervous system in extensive detail and

85
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:40,674
really laid down the foundations for

86
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:42,754
what we think about the anatomy of the

87
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:46,238
brain to this day. Now, both of

88
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:48,086
these men were recognized for their

89
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:51,462
efforts in 1906 with a Nobel prize. But

90
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:54,950
even at the award ceremony, when giving

91
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,106
their lectures, they were in bitter

92
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:59,974
disagreement. So if you actually look at

93
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:02,786
the recordings of their lectures,

94
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:06,630
cahal says, we applied Golgi's method,

95
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,554
and our observations revealed, in my

96
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:10,426
opinion, the terminal arrangement of the

97
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:12,566
nerve fibers. Nerve elements possess

98
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:14,626
reciprocal relationships in continuity,

99
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:17,386
but not in continuity. So here he's

100
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,058
saying that cells are fundamentally

101
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:22,422
discrete elements separated in physical

102
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:25,714
space and that there's a gap between

103
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:28,126
them at the synapse. The synaptic cleft

104
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,690
and signaling occurs through this gap.

105
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,562
Olga, on the other hand, didn't agree.

106
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:36,766
He said, while I admire the brilliancy

107
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:38,126
of the doctrine, which is a worthy

108
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:39,606
product of the high intellect of my

109
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:41,874
illustrious Spanish colleague, I cannot

110
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:43,286
agree with him on some points of an

111
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:44,966
anatomical nature, which are for the

112
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:47,206
theory of fundamental importance. I

113
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:48,966
found myself unable to follow the

114
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,634
current of opinion because I was

115
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:52,742
confronted by one concrete anatomical

116
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:55,306
fact. This was the existence of the

117
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,874
formation, which I have called the

118
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:59,786
diffuse nerve network. And so, for

119
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:02,582
Golgi, all the cells were continuous.

120
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,766
They form one continuous network. There

121
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:07,086
was no point of separation between them,

122
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,662
and signaling occurred through this

123
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:11,870
continuous network.

124
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,330
Now, ultimately,

125
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,218
a growing body of evidence, and you can

126
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:21,762
see it in Golgi's statements, was

127
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:24,514
starting to favor Cahal's model. But

128
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,726
really, it was only resolved in the

129
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:28,594
1940s with the advent of electron

130
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:30,150
microscopy, where people could actually

131
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,886
resolve synapses and saw that they were

132
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:36,486
spatially disjoint. And this

133
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:37,926
ultimately established the neuron

134
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,738
doctrine as the fundamental theory about

135
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,654
how the nerve, the system is organized

136
00:05:43,702 --> 00:05:48,074
at a cellular level. And this basic idea

137
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:50,134
that we can divide the brain up into

138
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:52,894
discrete units was then carried through

139
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:55,726
to different scales, most famously by

140
00:05:55,828 --> 00:05:59,102
Corbinian Broadman, who developed a

141
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:02,026
parcellation of the cortex based on cyto

142
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:06,082
architectonic grounds. His idea was that

143
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,322
different parts of the cortex have

144
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,386
different cellular properties, and so

145
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:12,514
they define these discrete areas that

146
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:15,414
are functionally specialized in some

147
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:19,046
way. And certainly this has been

148
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:21,874
a very influential idea in neuroscience

149
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:24,534
ever since. But around the same time,

150
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:26,886
in fact, a couple of years earlier, the

151
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,866
neurologist Alfred Campbell published

152
00:06:28,898 --> 00:06:33,450
his own cytoacyctonic map, and he

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,326
agreed that you could identify discrete

154
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:38,774
boundaries largely in primary zones,

155
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:41,326
but then in the cortex in between, it

156
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:44,554
was a lot more difficult to find sharp

157
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:47,866
outlines or boundaries. And he suggested

158
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,614
that actually the changes were more

159
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:52,190
gradual or continuous in nature.

160
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,002
Broadman's view became more popular and

161
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:00,702
certainly became sort of the dominant

162
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,826
theory in neuroscience, even though

163
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,906
subsequent attempts to try to replicate

164
00:07:05,938 --> 00:07:07,142
it were different. And so different

165
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:09,126
anatomists would parcelate the brain in

166
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:10,422
different ways, using different

167
00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:13,602
boundaries and so on. But nonetheless,

168
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,674
this kind of congruence

169
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:18,646
between the discrete model of cahal and

170
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:20,774
discrete model of Broadman eventually

171
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:22,874
led to the idea that essentially we can

172
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,694
think about the brain as a multiscale

173
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:27,066
network where at the cellular level we

174
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:30,238
can identify discrete cells that are

175
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:32,986
connected by synapses. Then we can scale

176
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:35,278
up at the population level at a

177
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:37,806
mesoscale resolution and identify how

178
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:39,760
population of cells are linked by

179
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,846
bundles of axons and then all the way

180
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:44,626
through to the macro scales, which is

181
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:45,698
what you sort of see when you look at

182
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:47,522
one of Broadman's maps. You have these

183
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:50,894
broad, roughly so architectonic areas

184
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:53,570
connected by white matter bundles.

185
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,502
And in the last two or so

186
00:07:58,556 --> 00:08:02,754
decades we've had the measurement

187
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:05,302
techniques for characterizing these

188
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:07,554
networks on a vast scale and there's

189
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:09,874
been a pretty well established pipeline

190
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,406
for mapping these networks. So the basic

191
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:14,586
idea is that we have the brain, we

192
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,646
divide it up into these discrete areas

193
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:18,906
and they act as our network nodes. And

194
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,614
then for every pair of nodes we measure

195
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:22,554
some aspect of structural or functional

196
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,538
connectivity between them. Functional

197
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:26,270
connectivity being some aspect of

198
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,894
coupling in activity. And then we can

199
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,702
represent that in the form of a

200
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:32,926
connectivity matrix. So each row and

201
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,978
column represents a different region and

202
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,754
each element tells you about the type

203
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,322
and strength of connectivity between

204
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:40,834
areas that can equivalently be

205
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:43,106
represented as a graph. And then with

206
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:45,558
that graph representation, we can apply

207
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:47,494
all sorts of different analytic tools to

208
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:49,334
understand different aspects about how

209
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:51,590
the network is connected and organized.

210
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,334
And this basic approach has been used

211
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:57,766
quite extensively to understand how the

212
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,478
underlying anatomical properties of the

213
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:01,786
network constrain function. This is one

214
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,306
of my favorite examples. This was a

215
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:06,198
study of two different worms, c Elegance

216
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:08,886
and P Pacificus. Both of their nervous

217
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:10,378
systems in the head have been mapped at

218
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,458
the level of each cell and synapse and

219
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,798
they're actually identical. So they've

220
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:16,142
got the same type of cells, the same

221
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:17,966
number of cells, it's just the

222
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,306
connectivity between them that's

223
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:20,478
different. And that's what you see in

224
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:22,078
this network projection here that the

225
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:23,778
topology of the network is different.

226
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:26,130
And in this study they showed that

227
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,594
changes in the connectivity of just two

228
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:32,654
hub neurons were sufficient to elicit

229
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,546
a difference in the behavior of the

230
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:36,806
animals, such that P Pacificus is a

231
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:38,566
predator of sea elegance. And here you

232
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:40,738
can see Pacificus eating poor sea

233
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:42,150
elegance for lunch.

234
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,902
Now, we can't lock humans up in a room

235
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,886
and see who eats who and try to

236
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:50,886
understand how their anatomy constraints

237
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,394
function in that way. But we can do

238
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:55,334
things like use MRI to measure

239
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,366
anatomical connectivity and functional

240
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,418
connectivity and correlate the two. And

241
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:01,066
it's pretty consistent finding that we

242
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:02,514
generally find there is a correlation

243
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,930
between them. We can run computational

244
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,546
models where we have a structural

245
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:09,886
network, we simulate the activity. Then

246
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,834
we apply, say, a lesion to that network

247
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:13,434
and look at the effects on the activity.

248
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,326
And we can show, for example, that if

249
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,026
you lesion a hub area you have quite a

250
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,610
dramatic impact on brain function

251
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,006
compared to if you lesion a more weakly

252
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,034
connected non hub area. Or we could use

253
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:26,446
clinical studies. We could look at cases

254
00:10:26,478 --> 00:10:27,874
where there are naturally arising

255
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:29,606
lesions through stroke or some other

256
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:32,374
form of brain damage and we can

257
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:33,874
understand the functional impairments

258
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:35,462
that result. So, for example, in this

259
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:39,130
case, people with lesions to certain

260
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,918
types of hub areas with diffuse

261
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:42,234
connectivity showed much more

262
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:44,074
generalized cognitive impairments than

263
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:47,002
people with lesions to areas with more

264
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:50,814
specific patterns of connectivity. So

265
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:52,254
this is great. This has been really

266
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,954
informative and great for understanding

267
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,502
the role of individual brain regions or

268
00:10:57,556 --> 00:11:00,766
connections in brain function. But it

269
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:03,886
doesn't really give us a coherent,

270
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,942
unified perspective about how dynamics

271
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:08,654
emerge from the underlying structure.

272
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,506
It's all a little bit piecemeal. Now,

273
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:14,922
if we want to develop such a coherent

274
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,294
understanding we can draw some

275
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:20,086
inspiration from different physics and

276
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:21,894
engineering where typically the

277
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:25,234
structural constraints on the dynamics

278
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:28,274
of a system are studied by understanding

279
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:31,578
the eigenmodes of the system. Now, the

280
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:33,994
eigen modes of a system are found by

281
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:36,474
solving an eigenvalue problem such as

282
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:39,306
this one. So an eigenvector we can think

283
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:41,134
of as something that we measure about a

284
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:45,242
system that doesn't change its direction

285
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,294
if it's subjected to some kind of

286
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,694
transformation. So if that's the case,

287
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:52,394
then this equality holds. So the idea

288
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:55,182
here is that PSI is our vector,

289
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,802
something we measure about the system

290
00:11:56,936 --> 00:12:00,194
subjected to some transformation L. And

291
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:03,234
if PSI is an eigenvector, then the

292
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,186
transformed eigenvector is equal to the

293
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,974
eigenvector just scaled by some value.

294
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:11,586
So the transformation can scale

295
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:12,934
the vector, but it doesn't change its

296
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:15,062
direction. And so if that's the case,

297
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:17,206
then this scaling factor, lambda, is

298
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,330
what we call an eigenvalue and PSI is an

299
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,586
eigenvector. This kind of equation is

300
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,966
applied to a lot of different systems

301
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:26,794
and a lot of different contexts. But

302
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:28,938
when we're studying the eigen modes of a

303
00:12:28,944 --> 00:12:32,106
system, typically our L term

304
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:34,282
here is an operator called the Laplacian

305
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:37,598
operator which essentially describes how

306
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:39,706
smoothly some kind of structural

307
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:42,686
property of the system varies through an

308
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,986
appropriate spatial embedding. So I'll

309
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:47,154
come back a little bit to what that

310
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:48,882
means because we can make different

311
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,538
choices for what we use in L and that

312
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:53,534
determines the specific anatomical

313
00:12:53,582 --> 00:12:56,646
properties that we prioritize. But for

314
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:59,894
now, I just want to emphasize that a key

315
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,406
property of these eigenvectors is that

316
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,886
they're orthogonal and so that then we

317
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:08,614
can use them as a basis set for

318
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:10,354
reconstructing different activity

319
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:11,706
patterns that we might see in the

320
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:15,306
network. So I guess the most

321
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,226
famous example of a basis set that many

322
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:18,698
people will be familiar with is a

323
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:20,906
Fourier set. So, for example, here we

324
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:23,246
have some one dimensional signal, and we

325
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,354
can decompose that signal as a weighted

326
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:27,854
sum of sine and cosine functions of

327
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,494
varying frequencies. So here you've got

328
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:32,606
the different functions, different

329
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,286
frequencies, and here you've got some

330
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:35,566
weighting factors. And we can

331
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:37,706
reconstruct this signal as a weighted

332
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:40,610
sum of these functions. In a similar

333
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,218
way, we can extract our Eigen modes of

334
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:45,218
the brain based on some particular

335
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:47,526
anatomical property. And we end up with

336
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:49,846
these spatial patterns here that are

337
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:52,434
organized again in terms of spatial

338
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:54,246
frequency or the wavelength of

339
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,146
fluctuation. So here you can see we've

340
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:58,610
got a very low frequency fluctuation

341
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,146
moving from back to front, top to

342
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,210
bottom, medial, lateral, and then as you

343
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,274
move up, you get these more high

344
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,266
frequency fluctuations. And so then we

345
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:10,358
can use these patterns to reconstruct

346
00:14:10,454 --> 00:14:13,190
any spatial map that we observe on the

347
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,386
brain. So it could be a map of brain

348
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,230
activity recorded during a particular

349
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,214
task. It could be, say, a map of

350
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:20,938
cortical thickness variations or gray

351
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:23,098
matter volume variations. It's

352
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,518
sufficiently general to allow you to

353
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:27,826
reconstruct any type of map. And so we

354
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:29,826
can do that just as a weighted sum. So

355
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,306
here Y represents our map, and then we

356
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:33,954
represent that as a weighted sum of our

357
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:35,714
modes with the A coefficients

358
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:37,190
representing the weights.

359
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,726
Sorry, I should emphasize that that

360
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:47,474
explanation can be a little bit abstract

361
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:48,966
for people who aren't familiar with

362
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,678
Eigen modes. And it is always a bit of a

363
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:53,578
challenge to get an intuition. And so

364
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:55,098
you can do what one of the people in the

365
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,930
team did and asked Chat GPT to explain

366
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,770
eigenmodes to a ten year old. And it

367
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,386
turns out that it does a pretty good

368
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:02,714
job. I was quite happy with this

369
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,894
explanation, so I thought I'd share it.

370
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:07,466
So our Chat GPT says, of course, let's

371
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:09,454
imagine we have a wobbly jiggly bowl of

372
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,486
jelly. When you poke it, it wiggles and

373
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,786
shakes, right? Now, imagine if you poke

374
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:15,534
the jelly in different spots or with

375
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:17,266
different amounts of force, each time

376
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:18,926
you poke it differently, the jelly

377
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,802
wiggles and shakes in a different way.

378
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,994
Eigenmos are like those different ways.

379
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:24,706
The jelly wiggles and shakes when you

380
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:27,986
poke it. So essentially, seeing this

381
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,926
video here, the jelly is poked and it

382
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:31,826
wobbles in a particular way. If you poke

383
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:34,086
the jelly in a different spot or with a

384
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,186
different amount of force, you'll

385
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:37,094
trigger a different pattern of

386
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:40,566
vibration. And so commonly, Eigen modes

387
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:42,922
are used in the context of systems that

388
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,366
vibrate. And the idea is these Eigen

389
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:47,606
modes correspond to preferred patterns

390
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:49,274
of vibration when the system is

391
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:51,238
perturbed, and those preferred patterns

392
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:53,226
are just dictated by the structural

393
00:15:53,258 --> 00:15:56,346
properties of that system. We can extend

394
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:58,494
it more generally and think about it

395
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:01,054
more as how a system responds to any

396
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:03,422
type of excitation and how an excitation

397
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:05,682
spreads through some connected system.

398
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:07,906
And the Eigen modes correspond to the

399
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:10,290
preferred patterns of excitation. Again

400
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,098
determined by the physical properties of

401
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:12,820
the system.

402
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,658
So naturally, given everything we've

403
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:21,158
been talking about and these ideas that

404
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:23,446
the brain is a multiscale network, we

405
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:25,526
need to make a choice about how we

406
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:27,910
define alloplastian what specific

407
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,106
anatomical properties are we going to

408
00:16:30,128 --> 00:16:32,426
extract our eigen modes from? And so a

409
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:34,778
natural choice would be to extract them

410
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:37,226
from brain connectivity. And we can do

411
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:38,854
this quite in a reasonably

412
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:41,226
straightforward way. We get some map of

413
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,882
the connections in the brain. We map

414
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:45,486
connectivity between every pair of

415
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:47,214
nodes. After we apply some

416
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:49,178
discretization, we define our discrete

417
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:51,546
nodes. We map every pair of connections.

418
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:53,198
We represent that in the form of a

419
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:55,986
matrix. And then we extract this

420
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:57,646
quantity here. It's called a graph

421
00:16:57,678 --> 00:17:00,034
Laplacian. The details are not so

422
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:01,874
important, but that's essentially our l

423
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,290
operator here. And it describes how

424
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,622
smoothly connectivity varies as we move

425
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:11,414
from node to node in the network. And

426
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:13,926
when we do that, several studies have

427
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,794
shown that you can use the eigen modes

428
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:17,786
extracted from this graphaloplassian to

429
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:20,246
reconstruct kind of classic functional

430
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:22,026
networks that you record. With

431
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:26,070
functional MRI, we can reconstruct

432
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,446
different patterns of functional

433
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:29,718
connectivity between pairs of areas.

434
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:31,994
You can use it to reconstruct different

435
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:35,114
eg signals. And people have even shown

436
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:39,102
that you can make predictions about the

437
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:42,254
pattern of neurodegeneration that you

438
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:46,018
see in different forms of dementia. So

439
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:48,258
this has been really fantastic important

440
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:50,706
work and a really important proof of

441
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:53,230
principle that this eigenmode framework

442
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,506
can be used to understand how the

443
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:57,174
structure of the system constrains its

444
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:59,446
dynamics. And in each case, the

445
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:01,282
interpretation is that these dynamical

446
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,246
patterns that we see with fMRI or EEG or

447
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:07,622
so on, are reflecting excitations of

448
00:18:07,676 --> 00:18:09,958
these underlying eigen modes or the

449
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,546
resonant modes of the anatomy of the

450
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:15,146
brain. This view very much

451
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:17,178
aligns with what we would think of as a

452
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:18,982
classical view of brain organization

453
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,554
that I've just been discussing. So,

454
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:23,226
following from Cahal and Broadman's

455
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:24,878
work, the idea is that at lots of

456
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:26,878
different scales, we can divide the

457
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:29,146
brain up into discrete areas. They're

458
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:31,582
connected in some way and it's the

459
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:33,294
signaling along these connections

460
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:35,934
between these discrete areas that drives

461
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:40,126
activity. But there are reasons

462
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:42,926
to think that, particularly at coarser

463
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,954
scales, so we know at the fundamental

464
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:47,666
cellular scale, the network is discrete,

465
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:49,926
but at coarser scales, perhaps a

466
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:52,774
different set of approximations might be

467
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:56,354
useful. So if you look at dense

468
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,826
reconstructions of neuronal tissue, so

469
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:01,130
this is, say, with electron microscopy,

470
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,414
you find that cortical tissue

471
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,834
is extremely dense. It's like a really

472
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:11,262
rich, thick forest of cells and their

473
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,894
processes. And as we've talked

474
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:17,674
about, there's been a lot of debate

475
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:20,142
about where you can actually draw

476
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:22,494
boundaries between discrete areas and

477
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,914
how valid and reliable that is outside

478
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:27,426
some kind of classic examples seen in

479
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:31,074
primary cortex. And if you look more

480
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:32,914
deeply at the cellular organization of

481
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,878
specific regions, here on the left we've

482
00:19:34,894 --> 00:19:37,070
got the cellular organization and on the

483
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,846
right we've got a myelin stain. You see,

484
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:43,266
you get these deep penetrating fibers

485
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,934
that are coming in from the white

486
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,534
matter. This is what this kind of

487
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:48,598
classic graph approach will pick up

488
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:51,226
because we define our nodes in the

489
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:52,586
cortex and then we're mapping the

490
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,074
connections that pass through the white

491
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:56,394
matter. But you can also see that

492
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:59,574
there's a lot of connectivity that's

493
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:02,286
moving horizontally or tangential to the

494
00:20:02,308 --> 00:20:04,622
geometry of the cortex. And so these

495
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,974
horizontal connections allow for the

496
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:10,030
continuous spread of activity. So rather

497
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,926
than activity jumping between discrete

498
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,586
nodes, it can actually spread as a

499
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:16,930
propagating wave.

500
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,098
And just to emphasize some of

501
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,180
the limitations of the discrete model,

502
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,698
not long after Broadman's work, just a

503
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,166
couple of decades, the renowned

504
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,094
physiologist Lorenzo de Nou was pretty

505
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,606
emphatic about his concerns with the

506
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:35,734
approach. He said the only really good

507
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,606
cyto architectonic pictures are those of

508
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:39,474
Campbell, who, let me put in capital

509
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:41,998
letters, has been the only cyto

510
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:44,118
architectonist who has described facts

511
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:46,438
and only facts. The German cyto

512
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,234
architectonist has mixed facts and

513
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:50,198
theory in such a manner that nobody can

514
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:52,138
tell where facts ends and theories

515
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:55,214
begin. So again,

516
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:57,630
this is just emphasizing the idea that

517
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,802
while we might be able to define

518
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:02,046
discrete areas at a mesoscopic or

519
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:04,606
macroscopic resolutions, in some cases,

520
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,294
especially around the borders of primary

521
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:10,370
sensory or motor areas, for large

522
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,974
swathes of cortex, those distinctions

523
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,610
become a little bit blurry.

524
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,386
So an alternative approach has emerged

525
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:22,706
out of neural field theory. So neural

526
00:21:22,738 --> 00:21:24,994
field theory has been around for several

527
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:28,666
decades now and this is a different

528
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:30,662
approach to thinking about cortical

529
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,386
activity. So the basic idea is that

530
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:35,162
instead of dividing the brain into

531
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:38,426
discrete specialized areas or nodes, we

532
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:40,534
can treat the cortex as a continuous

533
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:43,694
sheep. And we are actually interested in

534
00:21:43,732 --> 00:21:46,554
trying to capture how patterns of brain

535
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:48,366
activity propagate through that

536
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:50,446
continuous sheet. And so this is

537
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:52,058
something that you can see in diverse

538
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:53,534
types of electrophysiological

539
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:55,074
recordings. So this, for example, this

540
00:21:55,112 --> 00:21:57,726
video is of the dynamics of voltage

541
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:00,126
sensitive dyes recorded in the mouse

542
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:03,566
brain. And you can see that you observe

543
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:06,114
these propagating waves of excitation

544
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:07,974
that move continuously through the

545
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:10,786
cortex rather than jumping from region

546
00:22:10,818 --> 00:22:13,894
to region as would be implied by a kind

547
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,520
of strongly discrete model.

548
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,446
So a big emphasis in neural field theory

549
00:22:21,478 --> 00:22:23,446
is on describing these wavelike

550
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:26,410
propagation patterns. And it's been

551
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,634
shown in recent theoretical work that if

552
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:31,514
we accept that wavelike propagation

553
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:34,960
drives neuronal activity, then really

554
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,062
the eigen modes that we should be

555
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:40,894
extracting or prioritizing are those

556
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:42,706
that are derived from the geometry of

557
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,806
the brain. So our eigenvalue becomes

558
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:48,750
this problem here where this operator

559
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,038
here is called the LaPlace beltrami

560
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:53,614
operator and it describes how smoothly

561
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:55,230
the geometry or the shape or the

562
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,934
curvature of the brain varies through

563
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:59,814
space. And just to briefly explain why

564
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:03,400
that's the case, here we've got the

565
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,818
wave equation that's used in some forms

566
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,118
of neural field theory, at least the

567
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:09,994
divisions that we've been focusing on.

568
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:13,126
And so the basic idea is that the firing

569
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,826
rate of a given population of neurons B

570
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,462
at location R and T is given by the

571
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:22,634
Afferent field of incoming populations.

572
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:24,926
So other populations A. So we've got

573
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,574
other populations providing this

574
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:29,454
Afferent field of activity that

575
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:32,574
determines the firing rate of B. And

576
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:35,054
obviously, we then need to describe what

577
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:37,018
this afferent field looks like and

578
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:38,706
that's given by this part of the

579
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:40,994
equation here. So on the left here,

580
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:42,866
this set of terms describes how the

581
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,578
field evolves through time. We're not

582
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:46,902
going to focus on that today over here,

583
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:48,486
which is what we're interested in,

584
00:23:48,588 --> 00:23:52,086
where we've got how the field is

585
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:55,206
evolving through space. And so here we

586
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:57,938
can see our friend, the LaPlace Beltrami

587
00:23:57,954 --> 00:24:01,158
operator, which describes the geometry.

588
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:03,466
And here we've got the length scale of

589
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:06,586
axonal connectivity. In this model, we

590
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:07,994
make a very simple assumption about

591
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:09,914
connectivity. We assume each point is

592
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:12,362
connected to its neighbors in a distance

593
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:15,054
dependent and isotropic way. And that

594
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:16,554
distance dependence is roughly

595
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:18,746
exponential. So the idea is that areas

596
00:24:18,778 --> 00:24:21,598
nearby to a given location R will have a

597
00:24:21,604 --> 00:24:23,662
strong influence and that influence

598
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:26,146
declines roughly exponentially as a

599
00:24:26,168 --> 00:24:29,826
function of distance. And the

600
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,114
speed of that decay is given by this R

601
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:35,586
term here. You can see that geometry is

602
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,310
firmly embedded in this equation. Now,

603
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,054
I should point out this isn't something

604
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:41,746
that's just been plucked out of thin

605
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:45,074
air. This is a damped wave equation

606
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:46,566
that has been used for centuries to

607
00:24:46,588 --> 00:24:48,778
describe wave dynamics in all sorts of

608
00:24:48,784 --> 00:24:51,626
different media. And so from that

609
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:53,498
physics, we know very well that the

610
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,962
geometry of the system constrains the

611
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,918
spatial properties of wave propagation.

612
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:00,858
And you can start from first principles

613
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,766
of neuronal biophysics and derive this

614
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:03,470
equation.

615
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,574
And given all that work, we know that

616
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:12,218
the eigen modes of the LaPlace Beltrami

617
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:13,806
operator actually correspond to the

618
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:15,678
standing waves of the dynamics. So what

619
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:18,034
are standing waves? So in this simple

620
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:19,646
example, we've got two traveling waves

621
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:22,226
here, a blue and a green. And as they

622
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:23,826
interact with each other, you get these

623
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:25,854
patterns of constructive and destructive

624
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:28,582
interference represented by this red

625
00:25:28,636 --> 00:25:30,950
line here, that cause these very large

626
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,206
amplitude fluctuations that are fixed in

627
00:25:33,228 --> 00:25:35,826
space. So they're not actually traveling

628
00:25:35,858 --> 00:25:37,026
like the original carrier waves,

629
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:38,666
they're fixed in space. So that's why

630
00:25:38,688 --> 00:25:40,666
they're called standing waves. And

631
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:43,098
they're a nice example of resonance. So

632
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:46,458
these fluctuations in

633
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:48,266
the red trace are much larger in

634
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,926
amplitude than the original carrier

635
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,654
waves. So it's an example of resonance

636
00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:53,146
where we're getting a larger response in

637
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:54,654
the system than the energy that we put

638
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:57,006
in. And just to convince you that this

639
00:25:57,028 --> 00:25:59,406
is something real here, for example, we

640
00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:01,866
have a pool of water, a classic wave

641
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:04,238
system. If you apply vibrations at a

642
00:26:04,244 --> 00:26:07,234
specific point in the pool, you see

643
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:09,586
these waves that travel out. They hit

644
00:26:09,608 --> 00:26:11,554
the opposite wall, reflect back and

645
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:14,034
start to interact. And then you see the

646
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,666
emergence of these standing wave

647
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:17,334
patterns that are fixed in space but

648
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:21,074
show these very large scale amplitude

649
00:26:21,202 --> 00:26:25,346
fluctuations. Another classic

650
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:27,414
example is the Cladney plate. So if you

651
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,218
arrange dust particles on a plate and

652
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:31,898
then you apply some vibration at a

653
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:34,134
particular frequency, the dust particles

654
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:37,130
will settle into these complex patterns.

655
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,906
The pattern is determined by the

656
00:26:38,928 --> 00:26:40,990
specific frequency that you apply and

657
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,406
specifically where you apply the

658
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:46,874
vibration. And the patterns correspond

659
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:49,294
to the eigen modes of the plate. And

660
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:51,614
again, those patterns are determined by

661
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,322
the physical properties of the plate

662
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:56,506
things like its stiffness, its geometry

663
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:59,666
and so on. This is

664
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:00,946
a little bit gratuitous, but you can

665
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:03,730
extend the idea to three dimensions and

666
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,846
you can actually cause the particles to

667
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:09,042
levitate. Again, in this case, they're

668
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:12,950
trapped within the nodal lines of sound

669
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,574
waves that are being projected in three

670
00:27:15,612 --> 00:27:16,470
dimensions.

671
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,794
And this does have real world

672
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:23,418
consequences. So this is a video of the

673
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:27,180
Tacoma Narrows bridge in the 1940s.

674
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,394
The engineers didn't pay enough

675
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,954
attention to eigen modes. And so on this

676
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,878
particular day, crosswinds hit the

677
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:36,238
bridge in just the right spots and at

678
00:27:36,244 --> 00:27:38,606
just the right frequencies to excite the

679
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:40,014
eigen modes of the bridge. So you

680
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:42,110
triggered these resonant responses and

681
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,934
created these large scale amplitude

682
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:46,178
fluctuations that ultimately led to the

683
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:47,410
collapse of the bridge.

684
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,050
So hopefully, that background

685
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,778
has kind of illustrated that there's

686
00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:00,342
sort of two different views of thinking

687
00:28:00,396 --> 00:28:04,034
about which anatomical properties

688
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,526
of the brain might be more important in

689
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:09,626
constraining dynamics. So on the one

690
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,306
hand, we have the classical kind of

691
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:14,522
connectome centric view in which we

692
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,046
view the cortex as comprising discrete

693
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:19,686
areas and dynamics are dominated by node

694
00:28:19,718 --> 00:28:22,954
to node transmission. The connectivity

695
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,562
between areas is topologically complex

696
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,374
and not homogeneous, and we very much

697
00:28:27,412 --> 00:28:29,054
think that that's very important. And so

698
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:32,170
we prioritize measuring that. We don't

699
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,434
really directly account for the spatial

700
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,154
embedding of the network or its

701
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:39,214
geometry. We can look at it secondarily,

702
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:42,354
but it's not baked into the model. And

703
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:43,634
because we're interested in

704
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:44,866
connectivity, that means we need to

705
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:46,174
measure it. So from a practical

706
00:28:46,222 --> 00:28:47,778
perspective, at least, if you're dealing

707
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:50,086
with neuroimaging data, you need a T one

708
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:51,986
weighted image to measure brain anatomy

709
00:28:52,018 --> 00:28:54,086
but also diffusion MRI image to be able

710
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,550
to measure brain connectivity.

711
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,466
The other perspective, which is a

712
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,226
geometrically informed perspective that

713
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:05,094
arises out of neural field theory,

714
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:07,494
views the cortex as a continuous sheet.

715
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,242
We're not making distinctions between

716
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:11,742
different areas of the cortex. We think

717
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:13,834
dynamics are dominated by propagating

718
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:16,094
waves of excitation, especially at these

719
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:18,814
mesoscopic and macroscopic scales. We

720
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:20,510
approximate connectivity between

721
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,654
different points of the cortex as being

722
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:25,514
homogeneous and distance dependent. So

723
00:29:25,572 --> 00:29:27,854
we know that there is a strong distance

724
00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:29,614
dependent in connectivity. It doesn't

725
00:29:29,662 --> 00:29:31,666
explain everything. So some things are

726
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,906
missed, but we know it's certainly an

727
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:35,394
important feature. So then the question

728
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:36,834
is how far we can get with this

729
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:39,318
approximation. And a nice feature of

730
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:40,994
this approach is that we are directly

731
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:43,106
accounting for spatial and geometric

732
00:29:43,138 --> 00:29:44,678
effects, the physical properties of the

733
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:46,662
brain, which are overlooked by the

734
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:49,874
connectome approach. A nice practical

735
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,102
benefit of this approach is that because

736
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:54,202
we approximate connectivity in a simple

737
00:29:54,256 --> 00:29:55,574
way, we don't actually have to measure

738
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:58,166
it. We can derive our basis set simply

739
00:29:58,198 --> 00:29:59,686
by looking at the geometry of the brain.

740
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:01,386
And so we only need a T one weighted

741
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,834
scan, which is very standard in MRI

742
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:07,610
experiments. So hopefully that's

743
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,270
set the scene for thinking about

744
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,078
different anatomical constraints on the

745
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:13,646
brain and which ones we might want to

746
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:16,122
prioritize. I'll now hand over to James.

747
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:17,906
He'll talk about how we went about

748
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:20,386
testing these different ideas and trying

749
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:23,186
to understand which constraints might be

750
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,770
more important for dynamics.

751
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,390
Thank you, Alex.

752
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,974
I'm going to focus more on the things

753
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:36,534
that we found in the paper that we

754
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:38,650
recently published. I think a lot of you

755
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,178
have the link for it, but let us know

756
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:44,298
and send us a message if you want to

757
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:47,402
want us for the link. So basically we

758
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:50,334
start with we're trying to answer and

759
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:52,814
test the theory on which modes of the

760
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:56,730
brain could best describe activity

761
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,014
measured in FMI. So we'll begin by how

762
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:03,220
do we actually measure these modes. So

763
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,994
geometric modes are based on the T one

764
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,060
weighted image, which is a standard

765
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,994
imaging tool that people use in the

766
00:31:13,032 --> 00:31:16,358
field. And you can extract a model

767
00:31:16,444 --> 00:31:19,526
of the cortical surface here on the

768
00:31:19,548 --> 00:31:22,738
right, and there are robust

769
00:31:22,834 --> 00:31:25,222
pipelines to do so. And you can do that

770
00:31:25,276 --> 00:31:26,998
on a population average sense.

771
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:30,426
Basically, you get a group template of

772
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:32,106
the surface, or you can do that on an

773
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:34,570
individual basis.

774
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,018
On the other hand, connector modes need

775
00:31:39,184 --> 00:31:41,786
deficient MRI and a structural MRI

776
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,934
because you need to kind of align the

777
00:31:43,972 --> 00:31:47,534
two. And then we run a

778
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:50,426
tractography pipeline, basically finding

779
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,626
connections between regions in the

780
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:56,226
brain. And then from there you

781
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,602
can construct a vertex level or

782
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:02,510
even region level connector matrix.

783
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,006
Basically it's a matrix where each

784
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,654
element represents the connection of one

785
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,114
region or one vertex to another region

786
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:14,070
or another vertex. And you

787
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,174
feed this cortical surface or this

788
00:32:17,212 --> 00:32:19,174
connector matrix in the eigenvalue

789
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:21,962
problem equations that Alex has

790
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,706
mentioned in the previous slides. And

791
00:32:25,728 --> 00:32:28,058
then how do we test the performance of

792
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:30,770
these geometric and connector modes?

793
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:35,002
Basically, we focus a lot on FMI

794
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:39,006
data. So there

795
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:42,786
are several open access data sets that

796
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:45,614
are available. For example, the popular

797
00:32:45,662 --> 00:32:49,166
Human Connector Project, which roughly

798
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:52,194
has about 1200 participants, but we

799
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:55,006
focus on 255 participants who are

800
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:56,978
completely unrelated. There are no twins

801
00:32:57,074 --> 00:33:00,326
and no siblings. And within the

802
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:04,886
Human Connector Project data set for

803
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:08,266
each subject, they have what we

804
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:10,714
call task evoke data. Basically, these

805
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:15,370
are functional activity

806
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,514
that was recorded whilst each

807
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:21,598
participant was performing a particular

808
00:33:21,684 --> 00:33:25,070
task. And Hcp has a suite of seven

809
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,230
different tasks, and within each task

810
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,758
several. Different contrasts within it.

811
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:34,802
And then we also analyze resting state

812
00:33:34,856 --> 00:33:36,834
data. Basically, resting state data is

813
00:33:36,872 --> 00:33:39,506
where the participant is just inside the

814
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:41,250
scanner and just not doing anything.

815
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,714
And you just scan brain

816
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:48,006
activity through time and you can

817
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:50,246
construct a functional connectivity as

818
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:53,378
well, where each element of this matrix

819
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:55,602
represents how correlated the activity

820
00:33:55,666 --> 00:34:00,200
is between two regions. We also

821
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,218
analyze data from what we call neural

822
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:07,260
vault. It's an open access repository of

823
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,082
thousands and thousands of different

824
00:34:09,136 --> 00:34:11,422
maps that people have contributed. And

825
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:15,306
each map was acquired with distinct

826
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:19,246
experimental protocols and we

827
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,470
took about 10,000 of those from

828
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,260
Neurovolt. And again,

829
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,786
the level of heterogeneity in the

830
00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:33,698
different tasks is quite remarkable in

831
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:39,234
the Neurovolt. So we wanted to do

832
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:42,486
our analysis on quite different tasks to

833
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:44,422
make sure we are capturing something

834
00:34:44,556 --> 00:34:48,490
really meaningful. So just to remind

835
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:51,274
yourselves of what we're going to do

836
00:34:51,312 --> 00:34:54,026
next. So basically, Alex already had

837
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:56,666
mentioned this. You extract, for

838
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:58,438
example, this spatial map. Say that's

839
00:34:58,454 --> 00:35:00,738
the task evolved map and we decompose

840
00:35:00,774 --> 00:35:02,890
that into different sets of eigen modes.

841
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,626
So these patterns could be the geometric

842
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:07,594
modes or they could be the connector

843
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:11,102
modes. And it will be weighted by

844
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,614
a coefficient A, and the weights

845
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:17,650
represent how each mode is expressed

846
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,394
for that particular map. And you can

847
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:26,694
truncate the number of modes that you

848
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:29,442
want to use and then you can reconstruct

849
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:34,006
back the data

850
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:37,538
by just taking a linear sum of

851
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:39,946
the coefficient multiplied by the

852
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:42,858
geometric or the connector modes. So

853
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:45,802
what did we find by doing these

854
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:49,180
analyses? So first I'm going to show you

855
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,214
how the spatial maps look like in terms

856
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,706
of reconstruction. So on the left I'm

857
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:58,622
showing you the different task develop

858
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,894
special maps, and these are group

859
00:36:00,932 --> 00:36:03,486
average maps for the human connector

860
00:36:03,518 --> 00:36:05,906
project data set. And again, these are

861
00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:08,866
the seven tasks for that data set. And

862
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:11,810
then we ask, okay, if we use about ten

863
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,686
modes, how would this patient map look

864
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:17,266
like? And for this result, we're

865
00:36:17,298 --> 00:36:21,206
focusing on the geometric modes. So the

866
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:23,910
reconstruction looks like this. From

867
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,366
afar they look

868
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:28,790
quite different, but if you actually

869
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,910
look a bit closely, it already captures

870
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,934
the kind of the large scale core scale

871
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:37,530
patterns that you can see from the data.

872
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,338
For example, this relational map. You

873
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,674
can clearly see this deemergence of this

874
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:44,590
big pattern. Now, what happens if we

875
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,774
incorporate more modes into it? So we

876
00:36:47,812 --> 00:36:49,870
increase the number of modes to 100.

877
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,406
And now you can see that the

878
00:36:51,428 --> 00:36:54,754
reconstruction almost looks like

879
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:57,586
the empirical data, but there are still

880
00:36:57,608 --> 00:37:00,866
subtle differences, especially in the

881
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:03,902
more localized activity,

882
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:06,486
for example, here in the arrows. And if

883
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:09,030
we increase it further, you can see that

884
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,390
we can better capture those isolated

885
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,534
localized patterns just by increasing it

886
00:37:16,572 --> 00:37:20,026
to 200 modes. So you can see that the

887
00:37:20,128 --> 00:37:22,854
modes are actually really an efficient

888
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:25,738
basis set for task evoke data.

889
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:27,962
We do the same for resting state data.

890
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:30,138
We increase the number of modes in here

891
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:32,358
and compare the functional connectivity

892
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,606
based from the empirical data and the

893
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,094
reconstruction. And we see the same

894
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:37,806
thing that as you increase the number of

895
00:37:37,828 --> 00:37:40,526
modes to 200, we can capture the

896
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:43,138
empirical data. And you can do this in a

897
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:46,910
more systematic way by calculating

898
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,586
how well can we reconstruct the

899
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:52,658
empirical data just by taking the

900
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:54,338
correlation of the empirical and the

901
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:57,910
reconstruction in reconstructed maps as

902
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,166
a function of an increasing number of

903
00:38:00,188 --> 00:38:03,302
modes. And we see that indeed the

904
00:38:03,356 --> 00:38:06,950
reconstruction accuracy increases as we

905
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,606
increase the number of modes. And up to

906
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:13,654
200, we can get about 85%

907
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:16,054
to 90% accuracy, which is quite

908
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:19,206
efficient given that we do the

909
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:22,830
analysis on a cortical surface

910
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,098
with about 30,000 vertices.

911
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:30,366
So mathematically, the maximum number of

912
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:33,010
modes available to us is about 30,000,

913
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,754
and using 200 out of the 30,000, we can

914
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:39,380
already reconstruct the data quite

915
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:45,746
efficiently. And then we've

916
00:38:45,778 --> 00:38:48,994
shown that the modes are quite powerful

917
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:51,766
and efficient in representing the data.

918
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:55,362
We now test the Hypotheses

919
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:59,498
or the questions that Alex has laid a

920
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,662
while ago, that are the geometric modes

921
00:39:02,726 --> 00:39:04,554
more parsimonious than the other

922
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,666
anatomical modes? And when I say

923
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:08,886
anatomical modes, again, we're focusing

924
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:11,182
on the connector modes, which is based

925
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:15,150
on the connectivity matrix, but we also

926
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,534
test another anatomical mode based on an

927
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:21,646
EDR rule. So an EDR rule is the

928
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:24,862
exponential distance rule, which as Alex

929
00:39:24,926 --> 00:39:28,260
has mentioned a while ago, which is that

930
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,486
because the assumption of neuroflu

931
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:34,274
theory is that the connections are very

932
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:37,698
localized and also organized in

933
00:39:37,704 --> 00:39:39,460
a distance dependent way,

934
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,914
specifically, the connection weight

935
00:39:42,962 --> 00:39:44,726
changes exponentially as a function of

936
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:47,000
distance. So we want to test that

937
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,522
hypothesis on how dominant that

938
00:39:50,576 --> 00:39:54,298
exponential distance effect is.

939
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:57,660
So for the

940
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,754
details, we just created a synthetic

941
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:05,326
network based on a simple probability of

942
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:07,114
connection following an exponential

943
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:10,330
distance rule with a skating factor

944
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,630
or an exponent alpha, which we matched

945
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,194
from empirical diffusion MRI data. And

946
00:40:18,312 --> 00:40:21,982
again, there's a lot of empirical

947
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:24,034
evidence of the existence of this

948
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:26,166
exponential distance rule. So it's not

949
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:30,966
just a hypothetical theoretical kind

950
00:40:30,988 --> 00:40:33,878
of assumption. We see the effect in

951
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:38,026
Macaques if you follow the weight as

952
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:39,562
a function of distance from track

953
00:40:39,616 --> 00:40:43,686
tracing data, and this is in logarithmic

954
00:40:43,718 --> 00:40:46,074
scale, you see this linear curve which

955
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:50,146
represents an exponential in linear

956
00:40:50,278 --> 00:40:52,494
coordinates. And we see the same with

957
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:55,770
human diffusion MRI data that the weight

958
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,174
changes as a function of distance in an

959
00:40:58,212 --> 00:41:01,502
exponential distance weight, and even in

960
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:04,186
other species like mouse rats,

961
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:06,338
mimosa, and so on and so forth. So this

962
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:08,498
is a universal property found in a lot

963
00:41:08,504 --> 00:41:10,786
of different species. So this

964
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:14,370
exponential distance rule connectivity

965
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:21,030
is actually empirically valid.

966
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,240
So by using these three different

967
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,706
anatomical properties, we can calculate

968
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:31,162
the modes using the equations that

969
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:33,098
Alexis mentioned a while ago. And you

970
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:34,826
can get these geometric modes on the

971
00:41:34,848 --> 00:41:36,570
left, connector modes in the middle,

972
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,646
and the modes from the exponential

973
00:41:38,678 --> 00:41:41,646
distance rule connectivity on the right?

974
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:44,878
And again, the modes are arranged in

975
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:48,318
quite a unique way in that the first

976
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:51,006
couple of modes will represent the low

977
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,854
spatial frequency or patterns with very

978
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:56,466
long spatial wavelengths. And if you go

979
00:41:56,488 --> 00:41:58,690
further down, you can get these high

980
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,482
special frequency or short special

981
00:42:00,536 --> 00:42:02,610
wavelength patterns.

982
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,614
The basis set that the modes provide can

983
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:12,120
capture different scales of the data.

984
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,694
So how do these anatomical modes compare

985
00:42:17,842 --> 00:42:21,020
when we now reconstruct the different

986
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,166
FMI data that we have? So, for resting

987
00:42:24,198 --> 00:42:27,210
state functional connectivity, we

988
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,486
compared the three modes, again by

989
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:32,686
measuring the accuracy as a function of

990
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,894
the number of modes. And you can see

991
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:37,742
that the geometric modes outperform both

992
00:42:37,876 --> 00:42:41,722
of the connectome and the EDR modes,

993
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:44,066
but you can see that the EDR modes are

994
00:42:44,088 --> 00:42:47,742
quite close to the geometric modes.

995
00:42:47,886 --> 00:42:51,460
So again, suggesting that the

996
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,370
fundamental effect that the EDR

997
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:58,526
connectivity does

998
00:42:58,648 --> 00:43:00,680
in empirical data,

999
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,750
it highlights the importance of this

1000
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,094
simple but important

1001
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:09,654
exponential distance rule connectivity.

1002
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:12,282
And we can see the same thing by

1003
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:13,958
reconstructing the different task

1004
00:43:14,054 --> 00:43:16,966
activation maps that we have. And I'm

1005
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:19,158
showing you here the difference. So it's

1006
00:43:19,174 --> 00:43:21,534
the geometric minus the connector and

1007
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:24,314
geometric minus DDR reconstruction

1008
00:43:24,362 --> 00:43:27,194
accuracies and red means the geometric

1009
00:43:27,242 --> 00:43:29,806
modes are outperforming the other

1010
00:43:29,828 --> 00:43:32,506
anatomical modes. So in all the data

1011
00:43:32,548 --> 00:43:35,138
sets that we have, the results are quite

1012
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:38,674
consistent. So again, it suggests that

1013
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:41,522
the geometric modes are more

1014
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:45,602
parsimonious than the other anatomical

1015
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:49,270
modes that we have. And then we

1016
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,374
go a bit further on, how do we actually

1017
00:43:52,492 --> 00:43:55,382
use the concept of these modes in

1018
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:59,590
analyzing FMI

1019
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,398
activation maps. So I just kind

1020
00:44:03,404 --> 00:44:05,494
of just want to explain a little bit of

1021
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:08,598
what traditional approach we have in

1022
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:10,926
brain map mapping research edge. So for

1023
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,360
example, you do an experiment, you

1024
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,518
capture the activation map shown here

1025
00:44:17,604 --> 00:44:19,578
for a particular task. And I'm showing

1026
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,626
you here the kind of the one B version

1027
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:25,166
of that. So the value, the activation

1028
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,030
versus the vertex in this cortical

1029
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,154
surface. So what traditionally what we

1030
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:36,706
do is to because

1031
00:44:36,728 --> 00:44:39,734
we want to highlight people ask, okay,

1032
00:44:39,932 --> 00:44:42,482
if a person does a particular task,

1033
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:45,334
which regions of the brain are kind of

1034
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:51,414
driving those the

1035
00:44:51,452 --> 00:44:53,238
behavioral performance that we have

1036
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,110
whilst performing a particular task. So

1037
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,874
what people usually do is to threshold

1038
00:44:57,922 --> 00:45:01,342
these maps and and you can set

1039
00:45:01,396 --> 00:45:04,270
threshold barely arbitrarily,

1040
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,894
and then you can get these clusters of

1041
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:10,846
activity and we then make a

1042
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:12,426
conclusion that these clusters of

1043
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:15,134
activity are the ones kind of driving

1044
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:18,610
the behavioral effects that we

1045
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,882
see whilst performing a task. And people

1046
00:45:20,936 --> 00:45:24,050
can even go further and hone down

1047
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,298
exactly really highly localized regions

1048
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:30,534
if you increase the threshold. But if

1049
00:45:30,572 --> 00:45:34,262
you go further back we started from

1050
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:37,574
this whole brain activation map, you can

1051
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:39,734
clearly see that by thresholding you

1052
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:41,800
actually are removing a lot of important

1053
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,274
activity patterns that are

1054
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:50,894
sub threshold, but they do exist. So

1055
00:45:51,012 --> 00:45:54,270
it's kind of like the analogy.

1056
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:58,890
By doing these thresholding approach,

1057
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,718
you're just looking just at the tip of

1058
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,526
the iceberg, you're ignoring a lot of

1059
00:46:02,548 --> 00:46:05,070
the important properties of the iceberg

1060
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:08,034
that are not seen by the threshold that

1061
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:11,474
you set. So what we can

1062
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:13,794
do is to use the mode approach to

1063
00:46:13,832 --> 00:46:15,460
actually look. At.

1064
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,680
Look at the properties of all the

1065
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,342
activation maps. And here on the left,

1066
00:46:26,396 --> 00:46:29,994
I'm showing you here the power of

1067
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:32,394
each mode. So basically the weights that

1068
00:46:32,432 --> 00:46:35,494
we obtained from the reconstructions

1069
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:41,040
that we had a while ago. And the

1070
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,266
figure on the left shows you the results

1071
00:46:44,298 --> 00:46:47,582
that we have on average for the

1072
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:50,286
Human Connector Project data set. And on

1073
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:53,266
the right is for the 10,000 maps from

1074
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:55,554
Neurovolt. So what you can see here

1075
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:58,082
actually is most of the power is

1076
00:46:58,136 --> 00:47:01,682
contained within about 50

1077
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:04,734
modes. And if you remember, the modes

1078
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:08,274
represent and each mode represents

1079
00:47:08,322 --> 00:47:09,734
a different wavelength and they are

1080
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:12,086
arranged and that the first couple of

1081
00:47:12,108 --> 00:47:14,354
modes represent this long spatial

1082
00:47:14,402 --> 00:47:18,262
wavelength, spatial structure.

1083
00:47:18,406 --> 00:47:22,860
So what this means is that actually in

1084
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:27,340
FMI activation maps, most of the power

1085
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,726
is within those long wavelengths, kind

1086
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,858
of suggesting that indeed,

1087
00:47:34,954 --> 00:47:37,310
even by performing a particular task,

1088
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,718
you are actually activating this almost

1089
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:44,226
whole brain so you can

1090
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:46,382
see this almost whole brain activity

1091
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:48,530
that, again, you will miss out if you do

1092
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,182
some thresholding effect. And to further

1093
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,442
emphasize the importance of these long

1094
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,934
wavelength patterns, we did a simple

1095
00:47:55,992 --> 00:47:58,466
experiment where we tried to remove,

1096
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:01,874
say, the first couple long wavelength

1097
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,798
modes. And that's the solid curve that

1098
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:06,854
you see in here. And by doing so, if we

1099
00:48:06,892 --> 00:48:08,614
start removing those long wavelength

1100
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:11,190
modes, the reconstruction accuracy

1101
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,214
completely drops, even by just removing

1102
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:18,634
25% of them. But if we just remove the

1103
00:48:18,672 --> 00:48:20,446
short wavelength modes so starting from

1104
00:48:20,468 --> 00:48:22,766
the right, the effect on the

1105
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:24,926
reconstruction accuracy is not that

1106
00:48:25,108 --> 00:48:27,246
significant. So again, alluding to the

1107
00:48:27,268 --> 00:48:28,906
fact that these long wavelength modes

1108
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:32,510
are really important and they describe

1109
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,034
the important structure found in

1110
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:39,220
activation maps from FMI data.

1111
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,018
So again, we've shown how the

1112
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:47,634
modes can explain and represent spatial

1113
00:48:47,682 --> 00:48:50,886
activation patterns. What happens with

1114
00:48:50,988 --> 00:48:54,326
the dynamics and the

1115
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,686
way we can do this is we go back to the

1116
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:00,202
crux of the neural field theory, which

1117
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:01,914
the geometric argument modes were based

1118
00:49:01,952 --> 00:49:04,314
from. And Neurofield theory is very

1119
00:49:04,352 --> 00:49:06,522
generalized. You can construct different

1120
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,646
populations of excitatory inhibitory

1121
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:10,026
neurons and you can even connect the

1122
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:12,426
thyroids and so on and so forth. But the

1123
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:13,946
important bits to remember is that

1124
00:49:13,968 --> 00:49:15,950
mirror field theory relies on the idea

1125
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,720
that activation propagates through space

1126
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:23,490
as waves. And to simplify

1127
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,114
the experiment that we want to do,

1128
00:49:28,152 --> 00:49:31,026
because we want to model the activity as

1129
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:34,706
a function of time, we just focus on the

1130
00:49:34,728 --> 00:49:38,182
cortex and we simulate the

1131
00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:41,640
equation based from the wave model

1132
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,106
and we tune the parameter.

1133
00:49:45,298 --> 00:49:48,038
But if you look at the equation, there

1134
00:49:48,044 --> 00:49:49,946
are only two parameters and we fix one

1135
00:49:49,968 --> 00:49:54,490
of them. So basically, the model is only

1136
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,290
relying on tuning one free parameter.

1137
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,520
And what we did was to compare that with

1138
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,190
a more sophisticated neuromass model.

1139
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,926
So, neuromass models rely on the

1140
00:50:06,948 --> 00:50:09,230
connector. So basically you have regions

1141
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,934
in the brain that they are connected and

1142
00:50:11,972 --> 00:50:15,086
the connections are based from diffusion

1143
00:50:15,198 --> 00:50:19,042
MRI and each region will have its own

1144
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:21,330
dynamical properties so they evolve

1145
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:25,090
through time. So it relies a lot of

1146
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,350
on this connection and again, local

1147
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,038
dynamics. But it's important to

1148
00:50:30,044 --> 00:50:32,194
highlight that this highly sophisticated

1149
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:35,622
model has about 19 parameters and we fix

1150
00:50:35,676 --> 00:50:37,734
about 15 adults, but we still need to

1151
00:50:37,772 --> 00:50:41,174
kind of tune about four. So in

1152
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:42,920
comparison to the wave model, again,

1153
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,314
wave model only has one and what we did

1154
00:50:46,352 --> 00:50:50,170
was to how well can it recapitulate

1155
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,400
functional connectivity data.

1156
00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:00,734
So here I'm showing you an example for

1157
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,502
the empirical functional connectivity

1158
00:51:03,566 --> 00:51:06,290
that we have and the resulting model

1159
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,274
based functional connectivity for both

1160
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:10,690
the wave and the neuromass models.

1161
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,420
And we can kind of

1162
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,934
quantify how well the model based

1163
00:51:19,052 --> 00:51:22,754
functional connectivity results stack

1164
00:51:22,802 --> 00:51:26,086
up with respect to the empirical data in

1165
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:29,162
a variety of ways. One can look at how

1166
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:32,682
well does the edge FC. So basically each

1167
00:51:32,736 --> 00:51:36,634
element of this matrix compares between

1168
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:39,034
the empirical and the model based data

1169
00:51:39,072 --> 00:51:41,550
and you can see that both models are

1170
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,894
performing quite similarly. We can

1171
00:51:44,932 --> 00:51:47,706
also look at the average connectivity

1172
00:51:47,898 --> 00:51:49,994
within each region. So basically you're

1173
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:53,182
taking the average of a row or a column

1174
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:55,666
and you can see that the wave model now

1175
00:51:55,768 --> 00:51:59,026
outperforms the neuromus model by a

1176
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:02,750
bit. And you can gain further

1177
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:05,358
because these properties, the first two

1178
00:52:05,464 --> 00:52:08,070
properties are based on static FC.

1179
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,566
Basically you're kind of averaging the

1180
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:13,222
effects across time. But we also

1181
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:16,418
measured how well two models compare

1182
00:52:16,594 --> 00:52:20,326
in capturing dynamical properties

1183
00:52:20,438 --> 00:52:23,366
through time. And you see that the wave

1184
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:26,726
model actually outperforms the neural

1185
00:52:26,758 --> 00:52:29,754
mass model. And so in summary, for this,

1186
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,446
it's just to show that the simplicity of

1187
00:52:32,468 --> 00:52:35,854
the wave model can

1188
00:52:35,892 --> 00:52:38,942
capture a lot of these properties of

1189
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:42,786
functional data. Again, highlighting the

1190
00:52:42,808 --> 00:52:47,214
idea that this wave evolving auto

1191
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:50,974
traveling in space and time in the brain

1192
00:52:51,022 --> 00:52:54,770
is probably a good approximation.

1193
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:00,086
We also simulated the effect if

1194
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:02,994
we stimulate, say, the visual cortex.

1195
00:53:03,122 --> 00:53:05,286
So we just ping the visual cortex and

1196
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:08,970
allow it to the activity to propagate

1197
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:12,666
through space and time. And this will be

1198
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:14,486
the propagation starts from the visual

1199
00:53:14,518 --> 00:53:17,610
cortex and then it goes to the frontal

1200
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,834
cortex. And I think I want to highlight

1201
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:26,046
one observation that we found is that we

1202
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:28,078
can see that when we started from the

1203
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:30,686
visual cortex, the activity starts to

1204
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,638
separate into two. In the psychology

1205
00:53:34,734 --> 00:53:37,666
and neuroscience literature, people have

1206
00:53:37,688 --> 00:53:40,354
actually found this effect and they call

1207
00:53:40,392 --> 00:53:42,434
it the separation into the dorsal and

1208
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:44,162
ventral stream. And each stream has

1209
00:53:44,216 --> 00:53:47,990
important cognitive implications.

1210
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,326
But people have tried to explain

1211
00:53:52,508 --> 00:53:56,150
this separation by capturing the complex

1212
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,538
layer specific activity, individual

1213
00:53:59,644 --> 00:54:02,406
cortex. But what this simple experiment

1214
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:04,730
that we have done has shown that maybe

1215
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,254
the geometry and the idea of waves

1216
00:54:07,302 --> 00:54:11,600
propagating could be sufficient in

1217
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:16,538
obtaining these kind of physiological

1218
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:20,334
effect. And then

1219
00:54:20,372 --> 00:54:23,394
we also tried to compare it with how

1220
00:54:23,432 --> 00:54:26,126
well does it recapitulate the visual

1221
00:54:26,158 --> 00:54:28,546
hierarchy that people have found in

1222
00:54:28,728 --> 00:54:34,498
primates. For example, this work in

1223
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:38,194
the last couple of years

1224
00:54:38,392 --> 00:54:42,690
where they also did a simulation

1225
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,682
where they stimulated the visual cortex.

1226
00:54:45,746 --> 00:54:47,794
And what they found was if you follow

1227
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:50,666
regions along the visual hierarchy in

1228
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:54,454
the macaque cortex, you see the activity

1229
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:56,666
patterns are kind of delayed in a

1230
00:54:56,688 --> 00:54:58,314
hierarchical way, so they follow the

1231
00:54:58,352 --> 00:55:02,094
same kind of relationship

1232
00:55:02,212 --> 00:55:04,766
as the visual hierarchy. So we did the

1233
00:55:04,788 --> 00:55:06,650
same thing. We compared the activity,

1234
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:10,110
the amplitude of the activity

1235
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,750
by matching the regions that people

1236
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,166
found in the visual hierarchy of the

1237
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:19,060
maca cortex. And we tried to find the

1238
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:23,506
regions in the human brain and

1239
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,586
then we see the same effect. And then

1240
00:55:25,688 --> 00:55:27,682
when we compared it to a typical measure

1241
00:55:27,746 --> 00:55:31,122
of hierarchy in the neuroimaging

1242
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:34,114
space, by using the intracortical myelin

1243
00:55:34,162 --> 00:55:36,246
map, which is just the ratio of t one

1244
00:55:36,268 --> 00:55:40,058
and T two, we see the effect that the

1245
00:55:40,144 --> 00:55:41,974
time to peak of these activation

1246
00:55:42,022 --> 00:55:45,462
patterns well captures

1247
00:55:45,526 --> 00:55:49,574
the rank of the intracortical myelin,

1248
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:51,486
again highlighting that. Indeed, what

1249
00:55:51,508 --> 00:55:54,510
we're getting is capturing this

1250
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:59,422
hierarchical kind of processing starting

1251
00:55:59,476 --> 00:56:03,034
from the visual cortex. And think of

1252
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:04,734
the last result that I want to highlight

1253
00:56:04,782 --> 00:56:08,366
is the subcortex,

1254
00:56:08,558 --> 00:56:12,114
because again, the brain is not

1255
00:56:12,232 --> 00:56:14,594
just the cortex. So what we did was to

1256
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:16,598
also calculate the modes from

1257
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:19,494
subcortical regions and what we did was

1258
00:56:19,532 --> 00:56:21,414
to mask these subcortical regions and

1259
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:25,346
perform the same and solve

1260
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:26,886
the same equation using the whole

1261
00:56:26,908 --> 00:56:28,326
plastic primary operator. And you can

1262
00:56:28,348 --> 00:56:29,958
get these argument modes for the

1263
00:56:29,964 --> 00:56:32,198
thalamus triadom and the hippocampus.

1264
00:56:32,374 --> 00:56:35,674
And we compared that to what

1265
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,126
we call in the field as functional

1266
00:56:37,158 --> 00:56:38,634
gradients. Basically, they are

1267
00:56:38,672 --> 00:56:41,146
representations, low dimensional

1268
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:43,722
representation of resting state FMI

1269
00:56:43,786 --> 00:56:47,374
data. So what

1270
00:56:47,412 --> 00:56:51,034
we did was to compare the geometric

1271
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:53,742
modes for the different subcortical

1272
00:56:53,806 --> 00:56:56,978
structures and the different

1273
00:56:57,064 --> 00:57:00,338
functional gradients based on FMI data.

1274
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:05,540
And you can see that the modes are

1275
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:09,462
almost in perfect correspondence with

1276
00:57:09,516 --> 00:57:12,166
the functional gradients and we see the

1277
00:57:12,188 --> 00:57:13,542
same effect for the different

1278
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,986
structures, again, probably highlighting

1279
00:57:16,018 --> 00:57:18,954
the idea that the geometric effects that

1280
00:57:18,992 --> 00:57:21,994
we solve in the cortex are much more

1281
00:57:22,032 --> 00:57:25,542
dominant in the subcortex, that geometry

1282
00:57:25,606 --> 00:57:27,180
really constraints function.

1283
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:33,200
Just to tie things together,

1284
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,266
what are the advantages of this approach

1285
00:57:36,298 --> 00:57:39,742
that we found? First, it's a more

1286
00:57:39,796 --> 00:57:41,902
physical understanding of the

1287
00:57:41,956 --> 00:57:43,258
relationship between structure and

1288
00:57:43,284 --> 00:57:45,630
function based on ideas in physics

1289
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:48,114
engineering that has been used in the

1290
00:57:48,152 --> 00:57:51,586
last century. The vectoring modes are

1291
00:57:51,608 --> 00:57:54,130
only based on T one weighted images. So

1292
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,854
it's very simple to perform and the

1293
00:57:56,892 --> 00:58:00,582
analysis can be done by anyone with

1294
00:58:00,716 --> 00:58:03,782
structural T one weighted image. And

1295
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:05,734
hence you can apply it in quite

1296
00:58:05,772 --> 00:58:07,730
different experimental contexts in both

1297
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,122
humans, other species, health and

1298
00:58:10,176 --> 00:58:13,462
disease. And finally, to summarize

1299
00:58:13,526 --> 00:58:16,746
things, hopefully we've shown that

1300
00:58:16,768 --> 00:58:18,394
geometric modes are indeed more

1301
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:20,306
parsimonious than other anatomical

1302
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:23,246
modes. And this is confirming a lot of

1303
00:58:23,268 --> 00:58:25,790
the predictions from theoretical

1304
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,414
calculations of near field theory and

1305
00:58:30,452 --> 00:58:32,026
highlights the importance of treating

1306
00:58:32,058 --> 00:58:35,874
the brain as this really physical system

1307
00:58:36,072 --> 00:58:38,386
in correspondence with what people are

1308
00:58:38,408 --> 00:58:41,954
doing in physics and engineering. But it

1309
00:58:41,992 --> 00:58:45,054
also highlights the idea that the

1310
00:58:45,112 --> 00:58:47,926
effects that we see in FMI might be

1311
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,446
dominated by the effect of this simple

1312
00:58:51,548 --> 00:58:53,858
local and exponential distance rule

1313
00:58:53,874 --> 00:58:55,720
connectivity. However,

1314
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,926
the contributions of long range

1315
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:03,146
connections are still there, but what

1316
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:06,714
we're highlighting is maybe their

1317
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:09,034
influence may not be observable with the

1318
00:59:09,072 --> 00:59:11,534
resolution that we currently have with

1319
00:59:11,572 --> 00:59:14,046
FMI data. So it would be interesting to

1320
00:59:14,068 --> 00:59:15,918
see and perform these experiments in a

1321
00:59:15,924 --> 00:59:17,822
much more highly resolved, say, track

1322
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:22,062
tracing data from other species that

1323
00:59:22,116 --> 00:59:25,074
we found that evoked activity is

1324
00:59:25,112 --> 00:59:26,654
dominated by these long wavelength

1325
00:59:26,702 --> 00:59:28,882
modes, which challenges a lot of the

1326
00:59:28,936 --> 00:59:30,962
traditional approach we have in the

1327
00:59:31,096 --> 00:59:33,794
Neuroimaging field where we focus a lot

1328
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:36,982
on these focal activations and that

1329
00:59:37,036 --> 00:59:40,214
traveling waves shaped by geometry are

1330
00:59:40,252 --> 00:59:42,806
sufficient to explain a lot of

1331
00:59:42,908 --> 00:59:44,630
physiological phenomena.

1332
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,586
They just emerged from the model and we

1333
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:50,902
didn't baked all these physiological

1334
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:54,586
phenomena into the model. And finally

1335
00:59:54,688 --> 00:59:56,794
that geometric constraints seem to be

1336
00:59:56,832 --> 01:00:00,038
universally exist in both cortex and

1337
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:03,214
subcortex and that we can use one

1338
01:00:03,252 --> 01:00:06,910
single approach to study the whole brain

1339
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:11,740
quite nicely. And I just want to add

1340
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,046
both Alex and I would like to thank all

1341
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:16,226
the other co authors of the work. It has

1342
01:00:16,248 --> 01:00:18,286
been a truly multi institute

1343
01:00:18,398 --> 01:00:21,602
collaboration. All the open access data

1344
01:00:21,656 --> 01:00:24,194
set that we have used and if people are

1345
01:00:24,232 --> 01:00:27,490
interested in doing our analysis,

1346
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:32,546
we have written an open access software

1347
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:35,478
package repository in GitHub. You can

1348
01:00:35,484 --> 01:00:37,800
access that in here. So people can

1349
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:41,546
analyze modes in the brain in quite

1350
01:00:41,648 --> 01:00:43,740
different contexts that they want to do

1351
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:47,018
and I think that's where we want to end.

1352
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:47,980
Thank you.

1353
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:54,574
Awesome. Well, thank you for the great

1354
01:00:54,772 --> 01:00:58,206
presentation. Lot of places to

1355
01:00:58,228 --> 01:01:01,630
go. First I'll pass to Dean.

1356
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:07,874
Thank you gentlemen. I first got

1357
01:01:07,912 --> 01:01:11,090
wind of this paper through another

1358
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,054
individual in the active inference

1359
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:16,166
community and I think I was the one that

1360
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:19,574
may have pounded the table that we might

1361
01:01:19,612 --> 01:01:22,918
want to do a guest stream on this and

1362
01:01:23,084 --> 01:01:25,378
it's ticked the paper and really brought

1363
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:28,394
it to life. So thank you very much, I

1364
01:01:28,432 --> 01:01:30,746
really appreciate it, especially some of

1365
01:01:30,768 --> 01:01:33,434
the dynamic images. I think it really

1366
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:35,226
helps in terms of explaining what you

1367
01:01:35,248 --> 01:01:39,322
guys were trying

1368
01:01:39,376 --> 01:01:41,706
to do your work with and your subject

1369
01:01:41,738 --> 01:01:43,342
matter on. So I'll just start with that.

1370
01:01:43,396 --> 01:01:46,334
I have some questions later on. But just

1371
01:01:46,372 --> 01:01:50,510
first of all, thank you for a fantastic

1372
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:54,420
explanation. Thank you.

1373
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,244
When you present this in a neuroscience

1374
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:02,664
setting, what's a common response or

1375
01:02:02,702 --> 01:02:05,624
reaction? From the introduction, I could

1376
01:02:05,662 --> 01:02:08,476
really tell how careful you were to

1377
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:12,220
speak to the totality and the different

1378
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,244
threads in neuroscience. So after all

1379
01:02:15,282 --> 01:02:17,740
that set up and all the statistical

1380
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,904
analysis that's presented, where does

1381
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:23,744
that put people in terms of their own

1382
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,116
understanding of the way that they've

1383
01:02:25,148 --> 01:02:28,012
been doing complementary methodologies

1384
01:02:28,076 --> 01:02:29,920
or orienting their research questions

1385
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:30,850
that way.

1386
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,564
Yeah, I think generally people

1387
01:02:38,602 --> 01:02:40,804
are at least we found that people are

1388
01:02:40,922 --> 01:02:44,108
quite interested. I guess the approach

1389
01:02:44,304 --> 01:02:47,976
is a bit different to how

1390
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:50,424
a neuroscientist would typically think

1391
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:53,256
about the brain but kind of aligns with

1392
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:55,892
how, say a physicist might narrowly

1393
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:58,124
easily start approaching thinking about

1394
01:02:58,162 --> 01:02:59,964
or modeling the brain. And so the work

1395
01:03:00,002 --> 01:03:01,564
was really trying to bring those two

1396
01:03:01,602 --> 01:03:05,420
kind of perspectives together. I think

1397
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,956
the reaction is usually kind of this is

1398
01:03:08,978 --> 01:03:09,870
really interesting,

1399
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,896
how do I make sense of it or what I do

1400
01:03:14,918 --> 01:03:15,680
practically,

1401
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:24,084
I guess some

1402
01:03:24,122 --> 01:03:27,236
people might kind of split it

1403
01:03:27,258 --> 01:03:29,088
artificially into this comparison of odd

1404
01:03:29,104 --> 01:03:32,788
geometry versus connectivity which

1405
01:03:32,954 --> 01:03:34,984
is probably not the right way to think

1406
01:03:35,022 --> 01:03:38,472
about it. The way we like to think about

1407
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:41,944
it is that we're sort of comparing two

1408
01:03:41,982 --> 01:03:44,280
different models and each of those

1409
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:47,036
models makes certain approximations and

1410
01:03:47,058 --> 01:03:49,100
prioritizes different features.

1411
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,364
The approach we put forward in this

1412
01:03:52,402 --> 01:03:55,336
paper emphasizes the role of geometry

1413
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:58,072
and it does have connectivity embedded

1414
01:03:58,136 --> 01:04:00,816
in that model. It's just a kind of

1415
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:02,288
simplified approximation of

1416
01:04:02,294 --> 01:04:04,140
connectivity. This kind of homogeneous

1417
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:08,460
distance dependent journal whereas

1418
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:11,636
typical connectome centric view will try

1419
01:04:11,658 --> 01:04:13,504
to capture all the complex connectivity

1420
01:04:13,552 --> 01:04:16,544
but we'll ignore also the horizontal

1421
01:04:16,592 --> 01:04:19,856
connectivity that really is what drives

1422
01:04:19,888 --> 01:04:22,224
activity spreading through the brain

1423
01:04:22,272 --> 01:04:24,736
that's completely ignored. And so really

1424
01:04:24,858 --> 01:04:27,128
the idea behind this work was to kind of

1425
01:04:27,294 --> 01:04:29,464
test in a way between these two

1426
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:32,756
approaches and see which one's

1427
01:04:32,788 --> 01:04:35,572
approximations were kind of more useful

1428
01:04:35,636 --> 01:04:36,490
in a sense.

1429
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,304
Dean, want to add something or I can

1430
01:04:41,342 --> 01:04:44,716
make a comment there? No finish this

1431
01:04:44,738 --> 01:04:45,756
because then I'm going to ask my

1432
01:04:45,778 --> 01:04:48,252
questions about the Jello. Yeah, well,

1433
01:04:48,386 --> 01:04:52,224
the statistics was very clear and

1434
01:04:52,342 --> 01:04:54,272
it was very interesting how with two

1435
01:04:54,326 --> 01:04:57,312
different data sets there were similar

1436
01:04:57,446 --> 01:04:59,344
curves with also very different number

1437
01:04:59,382 --> 01:05:03,556
of samples. So it was almost like some

1438
01:05:03,578 --> 01:05:05,668
of the statistical distributions were

1439
01:05:05,754 --> 01:05:09,332
latched onto relatively early and then

1440
01:05:09,386 --> 01:05:14,696
that captured the big continent. And a

1441
01:05:14,718 --> 01:05:17,176
lot of the connections are local. And

1442
01:05:17,198 --> 01:05:19,524
this is, of course, a topic to explore

1443
01:05:19,572 --> 01:05:21,812
about the molecular and the mechanistic

1444
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,224
electromagnetic basis and whether this

1445
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,784
to what extent it represents traveling

1446
01:05:27,832 --> 01:05:31,980
propagating electrochemical waves and or

1447
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:35,448
loading heavily on simply diffuse

1448
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:38,696
local connections and even the blurry

1449
01:05:38,728 --> 01:05:42,224
line between those two. So it is really

1450
01:05:42,262 --> 01:05:43,664
like a question about what is being

1451
01:05:43,702 --> 01:05:45,616
captured because even the EDR with the

1452
01:05:45,638 --> 01:05:49,216
spread captures a

1453
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:52,036
variance component related to local

1454
01:05:52,138 --> 01:05:55,440
abundant, direct, fast acting

1455
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,728
connections in some regions and distant

1456
01:05:59,824 --> 01:06:02,390
connections maybe over the days.

1457
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,810
Distal connections really do matter

1458
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:11,272
as the Jello sets and

1459
01:06:11,326 --> 01:06:13,848
things change. But at the exact

1460
01:06:13,934 --> 01:06:15,876
timescale that some of these patterns

1461
01:06:15,908 --> 01:06:19,276
are happening at your work is

1462
01:06:19,378 --> 01:06:22,830
showing new information

1463
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,456
and comparison with different ways it's

1464
01:06:26,488 --> 01:06:27,870
been looked at.

1465
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:36,302
Yeah, I think one of the things

1466
01:06:36,356 --> 01:06:39,520
that it highlighted even probably just

1467
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:43,626
in my head is we've

1468
01:06:43,658 --> 01:06:46,654
been focusing a lot on trying to capture

1469
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:49,250
the effects of this complex connectivity

1470
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:52,734
and we ignore all these lateral,

1471
01:06:52,782 --> 01:06:56,770
horizontal local diffusing connections.

1472
01:06:57,450 --> 01:07:00,466
But what the work has now kind of shown,

1473
01:07:00,658 --> 01:07:03,526
it highlighted maybe the issues that we

1474
01:07:03,548 --> 01:07:07,190
have with FMI because

1475
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,280
truly both of these worlds happen

1476
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:14,426
probably simultaneously. But just the

1477
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:17,482
effects that we're seeing in FMI is

1478
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:19,754
probably not the most efficient way to

1479
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:23,706
capture both worlds or it cannot hung

1480
01:07:23,738 --> 01:07:26,686
down the specifics of one world over the

1481
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:30,766
other. In the results that

1482
01:07:30,788 --> 01:07:33,294
we're getting is that the effects of

1483
01:07:33,332 --> 01:07:36,690
this very localized connectivity

1484
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:40,866
probably dominates a lot of what we

1485
01:07:40,888 --> 01:07:44,994
see there FMI. But time will

1486
01:07:45,032 --> 01:07:49,202
tell if we improve the ways we capture

1487
01:07:49,346 --> 01:07:51,574
brain activity with OpenAI and we can

1488
01:07:51,612 --> 01:07:54,454
really kind of particularly focus on the

1489
01:07:54,492 --> 01:07:57,990
different aspects of the approximations.

1490
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:02,058
To me, that's the kind of the beauty of

1491
01:08:02,064 --> 01:08:04,202
the work. It now highlighted these

1492
01:08:04,256 --> 01:08:08,170
effects into the broader audience.

1493
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:13,546
Yeah, everything that we've

1494
01:08:13,578 --> 01:08:15,854
presented is really addressing things

1495
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:17,934
that we were at measure with fMRI. So on

1496
01:08:17,972 --> 01:08:19,994
pretty coarse spatial and temporal

1497
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:22,350
scales, there's some theoretical work

1498
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:25,334
suggesting that kind of the more complex

1499
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:27,186
aspects of connectivity that can't be

1500
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:29,314
explained by an EDR might play an

1501
01:08:29,352 --> 01:08:32,254
important role in supporting dynamic

1502
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:33,854
transitions between different brain

1503
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:36,386
states. But that would happen on a very

1504
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:38,578
rapid scale that could be missed with

1505
01:08:38,584 --> 01:08:41,202
fMRI or at least a typically organized

1506
01:08:41,266 --> 01:08:43,778
fMRI experiment. And so one thing we're

1507
01:08:43,794 --> 01:08:45,622
interested in looking at further is

1508
01:08:45,676 --> 01:08:47,574
trying to pick that apart a little bit

1509
01:08:47,612 --> 01:08:50,966
and trying to isolate the functional

1510
01:08:50,998 --> 01:08:52,582
contributions of those more complicated

1511
01:08:52,646 --> 01:08:53,450
connections.

1512
01:08:56,510 --> 01:09:00,326
Cool. Dean, can I ask about the metaphor

1513
01:09:00,358 --> 01:09:04,240
of the spoon tapping on the cello there?

1514
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:06,800
Metaphorically speaking, that seems like

1515
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:11,214
an external perturbation on something

1516
01:09:11,252 --> 01:09:12,800
that can respond to that.

1517
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:17,618
Now, you'll appreciate I'm asking from a

1518
01:09:17,624 --> 01:09:19,630
very naive point of view. I'm

1519
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:22,290
comfortable with it. Is there any

1520
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,914
difference then in terms of, say,

1521
01:09:25,112 --> 01:09:27,714
something that happens interoceptively,

1522
01:09:27,762 --> 01:09:30,022
like something that's simply coming from

1523
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:33,414
within system and does that show

1524
01:09:33,452 --> 01:09:35,814
up in the same way as when there's a

1525
01:09:35,852 --> 01:09:38,150
response to an external stimuli?

1526
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:42,906
Yeah. So the actual underlying model,

1527
01:09:43,008 --> 01:09:45,130
a key component that we haven't really

1528
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,194
talked about, is that you have

1529
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:50,826
thalamocortical loops and there's a

1530
01:09:50,848 --> 01:09:53,454
driving input from the thalamus that

1531
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:56,798
influences the wave activity in the

1532
01:09:56,804 --> 01:10:01,022
cortex. And they could be

1533
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:04,354
sensory thalamic nuclei or they could be

1534
01:10:04,472 --> 01:10:07,634
interceptive inputs as well. And they

1535
01:10:07,752 --> 01:10:09,582
would be expected to drive cortical

1536
01:10:09,646 --> 01:10:12,846
activity in different and spatially non

1537
01:10:12,878 --> 01:10:14,180
uniform ways.

1538
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,034
Really distinguishing between those

1539
01:10:18,072 --> 01:10:19,986
different types of inputs, as far as I'm

1540
01:10:20,018 --> 01:10:22,854
aware, hasn't been modeled yet. It's all

1541
01:10:22,892 --> 01:10:25,654
been kind of at a simple level where you

1542
01:10:25,692 --> 01:10:27,478
treat the cortex homogeneously and you

1543
01:10:27,484 --> 01:10:29,126
have a single thalamic nucleus. I mean,

1544
01:10:29,148 --> 01:10:30,554
some people have started to split them

1545
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:33,946
up, but that would

1546
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:35,786
be that the underlying principle and the

1547
01:10:35,808 --> 01:10:39,434
model could be extended in such a way

1548
01:10:39,472 --> 01:10:41,062
that you could potentially distinguish

1549
01:10:41,126 --> 01:10:42,634
between interreceptive and extra

1550
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:45,806
receptive inputs. Can I ask him one

1551
01:10:45,828 --> 01:10:48,846
more? Dan, I just want to add, for

1552
01:10:48,868 --> 01:10:51,114
example, the visual cortex experiment

1553
01:10:51,162 --> 01:10:52,974
that we perform. It's a really simple

1554
01:10:53,092 --> 01:10:54,894
perturbation. Right, but it could

1555
01:10:54,932 --> 01:10:56,766
represent different types of

1556
01:10:56,788 --> 01:10:59,294
perturbation we just can't particularly

1557
01:10:59,342 --> 01:11:00,786
capture at the moment. But it's like an

1558
01:11:00,808 --> 01:11:03,330
overlying if we perturb it in a certain

1559
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,860
way this will be the effect that we see.

1560
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,834
You must have known I was going to ask

1561
01:11:08,872 --> 01:11:09,942
next thing because that was the

1562
01:11:09,996 --> 01:11:11,346
direction I was going with that visual

1563
01:11:11,378 --> 01:11:14,738
cortex example. So from the active

1564
01:11:14,754 --> 01:11:16,646
inference community, one of the things

1565
01:11:16,668 --> 01:11:18,438
that we're always dealing with is

1566
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,654
surprise, say versus sensory

1567
01:11:21,702 --> 01:11:24,010
attenuation. And then on the third

1568
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,510
vertices, the seeming unawareness

1569
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:29,862
prior to the surprise or the attenuated

1570
01:11:29,926 --> 01:11:33,338
state, but still available. And so I'm

1571
01:11:33,354 --> 01:11:36,574
kind of curious, when you move away from

1572
01:11:36,612 --> 01:11:40,638
the visual can you still have these

1573
01:11:40,724 --> 01:11:42,686
sort of same waves going through the

1574
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:46,414
brain because other sensory uptake

1575
01:11:46,462 --> 01:11:49,138
is causing that same you get a

1576
01:11:49,144 --> 01:11:50,674
surprising feeling, like a sense of

1577
01:11:50,712 --> 01:11:55,278
weightlessness perhaps. Right, or you're

1578
01:11:55,374 --> 01:11:58,598
an astronaut and that's now something

1579
01:11:58,684 --> 01:12:00,920
you become attenuated to.

1580
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:06,418
I know it kind of stuck with the fMRI

1581
01:12:06,514 --> 01:12:09,750
but it just seems so the possibilities

1582
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:12,634
in terms of what you guys are opening up

1583
01:12:12,832 --> 01:12:15,322
just seems really interesting. Is that

1584
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:19,018
something like the interoceptive thing

1585
01:12:19,104 --> 01:12:21,180
where you can see this now having

1586
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:24,910
opening up new areas of inquiry?

1587
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:30,574
Yeah, so I think there's some really

1588
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:35,022
interesting work where people

1589
01:12:35,076 --> 01:12:39,086
have looked at recursive

1590
01:12:39,118 --> 01:12:42,370
neural nets structured in such a way

1591
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,550
that you can get wavelike propagation

1592
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:48,478
between the elements of the network and

1593
01:12:48,504 --> 01:12:50,246
have shown that the systems that have

1594
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:52,774
that wavelike propagation, it actually

1595
01:12:52,812 --> 01:12:55,106
facilitates their ability to predict

1596
01:12:55,218 --> 01:12:58,246
what's happening in, say, a movie. So it

1597
01:12:58,268 --> 01:13:00,070
improves their predictive performance

1598
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:04,042
physiologically. It'll have shown that

1599
01:13:04,096 --> 01:13:05,946
just with simple visual stimulation you

1600
01:13:05,968 --> 01:13:07,946
get these back to front propagations but

1601
01:13:07,968 --> 01:13:11,370
there's also front to back propagations

1602
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:13,806
which are presumably encoding the

1603
01:13:13,828 --> 01:13:17,040
predictions. And so then the question is

1604
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:21,758
how do the top down predictions and

1605
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:22,926
the bottom up sensory input get

1606
01:13:22,948 --> 01:13:24,926
reconciled between the interactions of

1607
01:13:24,948 --> 01:13:28,546
these waves? I think these are kind

1608
01:13:28,568 --> 01:13:32,530
of really interesting ways forward that

1609
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,226
we're still coming to terms with and we

1610
01:13:36,248 --> 01:13:39,762
haven't really quite made

1611
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:43,366
sense of what the ways mean

1612
01:13:43,388 --> 01:13:44,834
for computation. I know that Peter

1613
01:13:44,882 --> 01:13:46,326
Robinson, who's on the slide here has

1614
01:13:46,348 --> 01:13:50,182
written a couple of papers talking about

1615
01:13:50,316 --> 01:13:52,746
how these fields can relate to

1616
01:13:52,768 --> 01:13:56,042
predictions but yeah,

1617
01:13:56,096 --> 01:13:58,842
I think this is kind of a very new

1618
01:13:58,896 --> 01:14:02,250
exciting area that is worth exploring.

1619
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:05,966
Yeah, one kind of connection there is

1620
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:09,418
like the standing wave that you showed

1621
01:14:09,514 --> 01:14:13,134
in the physical water pool. And so

1622
01:14:13,172 --> 01:14:16,450
now when we're looking at a solid color

1623
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,478
visually and there's some stable non

1624
01:14:20,494 --> 01:14:22,254
equilibrium steady state or stable

1625
01:14:22,302 --> 01:14:24,354
representation or stable population code

1626
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:25,826
or all these different things which may

1627
01:14:25,848 --> 01:14:29,462
not be exhaustive or

1628
01:14:29,516 --> 01:14:31,426
incompatible like at all, but there's

1629
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:34,760
some standing wave. Now maybe that is

1630
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:39,346
component number 99, just like principal

1631
01:14:39,378 --> 01:14:41,194
component 99. Its amplitude might be

1632
01:14:41,232 --> 01:14:45,770
small but there's like some mode

1633
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:49,142
that's ramping up and it's associated

1634
01:14:49,206 --> 01:14:51,606
positively or it's ramping down. It's

1635
01:14:51,638 --> 01:14:53,130
associated negatively.

1636
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:58,510
And there's some standing pattern

1637
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:01,674
that amidst the pelting of new sensory

1638
01:15:01,722 --> 01:15:03,594
observations in like a Bayesian updating

1639
01:15:03,642 --> 01:15:07,854
setting, it is remaining the same.

1640
01:15:07,972 --> 01:15:09,726
Now the more inertia you have on the

1641
01:15:09,748 --> 01:15:11,138
distribution, the more stable it's going

1642
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:13,026
to be. Which is like equivalent to

1643
01:15:13,048 --> 01:15:14,386
saying the less attention you pay to

1644
01:15:14,408 --> 01:15:16,706
sensory stimuli, the more stable your

1645
01:15:16,728 --> 01:15:18,510
priors are going to be. It could be a

1646
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,706
prior about perception, could be a prior

1647
01:15:20,738 --> 01:15:24,386
about action and there are descending

1648
01:15:24,498 --> 01:15:27,542
motor patterns as well.

1649
01:15:27,676 --> 01:15:30,994
And all these different modes are being

1650
01:15:31,132 --> 01:15:34,426
played like in an apartment building and

1651
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:36,294
there's like different songs but they're

1652
01:15:36,342 --> 01:15:37,718
happening in different frequency,

1653
01:15:37,814 --> 01:15:40,666
spatial, temporal and frequency bands so

1654
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:43,994
that we can tune in to different songs

1655
01:15:44,042 --> 01:15:47,006
like different radio stations, but with

1656
01:15:47,028 --> 01:15:48,510
more spatial richness.

1657
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:54,510
It's a total expansion of the palate

1658
01:15:55,490 --> 01:15:59,038
that recapitulates certain aspects

1659
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:02,130
of topology and helps us even identify

1660
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:05,854
residuals that are most apt

1661
01:16:05,902 --> 01:16:08,500
to be explained that way.

1662
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:13,510
But it also opens up to these

1663
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,854
big waves that get filtered out, like by

1664
01:16:16,892 --> 01:16:19,606
low pass, potentially filtering in

1665
01:16:19,628 --> 01:16:22,854
different data sets so that shorter term

1666
01:16:22,982 --> 01:16:25,130
relationships can become more apparent.

1667
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:28,010
But that can be the ripple on the wave

1668
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:30,762
and so end up throwing out a huge amount

1669
01:16:30,816 --> 01:16:34,602
just of the sheer information content of

1670
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:37,370
rich, dynamical data sets.

1671
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:46,254
Yeah, really interesting concept,

1672
01:16:46,422 --> 01:16:48,340
trying to wrap my head around it.

1673
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:52,740
Yes, it's really cool because again,

1674
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:56,674
we still don't know because what we

1675
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,414
found is that for example, in different

1676
01:16:58,472 --> 01:17:01,506
task data that we have, not all modes

1677
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:04,086
are equally excited. Certain modes are

1678
01:17:04,108 --> 01:17:07,334
excited in quite different ways and we

1679
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:10,322
don't know yet what these combinations

1680
01:17:10,386 --> 01:17:12,998
mean. Truly behaviorally,

1681
01:17:13,094 --> 01:17:14,170
cognitively.

1682
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:19,562
But yeah, we'll keep working

1683
01:17:19,616 --> 01:17:23,100
on it as palace and see what happens.

1684
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:28,142
That's one more quick question. I

1685
01:17:28,196 --> 01:17:30,480
appreciate the geometry part of it.

1686
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:37,394
So does

1687
01:17:37,432 --> 01:17:41,860
any of this speak also to

1688
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:46,306
sort of the tunneling effects of that

1689
01:17:46,408 --> 01:17:49,990
eigenvalue or eigen mode eigenvalue

1690
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:53,798
quantum piece where you can

1691
01:17:53,804 --> 01:17:55,254
be riding the surface of this and

1692
01:17:55,292 --> 01:18:01,010
appreciating that the parsimonious speak

1693
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,634
to that surface effect? Is there

1694
01:18:04,672 --> 01:18:07,194
anything about this that also helps us

1695
01:18:07,232 --> 01:18:10,940
understand better how something goes

1696
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:15,098
through the wave, like quite literally

1697
01:18:15,194 --> 01:18:19,530
across from one slope,

1698
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,822
past the crown and onto the other side?

1699
01:18:21,876 --> 01:18:24,494
Or is that again something that you guys

1700
01:18:24,532 --> 01:18:26,622
weren't really spending a lot of time

1701
01:18:26,676 --> 01:18:29,986
on? But I did notice, I pulled up the

1702
01:18:30,008 --> 01:18:32,626
paper and I noticed on page eleven you

1703
01:18:32,648 --> 01:18:34,386
were talking about some of the ways that

1704
01:18:34,408 --> 01:18:36,674
you were analyzing the volumes. So

1705
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:39,202
that's the context that I was curious

1706
01:18:39,266 --> 01:18:42,086
about, that sort of tunneling piece to

1707
01:18:42,108 --> 01:18:45,958
go along with how we sort of follow the

1708
01:18:46,044 --> 01:18:47,590
patterns on the surface.

1709
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:54,210
I'm not quite sure I follow you're

1710
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:58,430
asking. Let me try to

1711
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,802
see where it comes as I see it, Dean's,

1712
01:19:01,866 --> 01:19:07,170
a quantum tunneling connoisseur post

1713
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:10,642
even and with

1714
01:19:10,696 --> 01:19:13,970
the basis set of the sine wave,

1715
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:17,410
it's like imposing this kind of

1716
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,066
oscillatory pattern and then you're up,

1717
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,446
waiting or downweighting. But is it

1718
01:19:21,468 --> 01:19:23,206
possible to use a basis set or is it

1719
01:19:23,228 --> 01:19:25,334
possible to detect modes in your

1720
01:19:25,372 --> 01:19:29,330
analysis where there's an effect locally

1721
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:31,898
and then there's like a tunnel and

1722
01:19:31,904 --> 01:19:33,254
there's like a region that the wave

1723
01:19:33,302 --> 01:19:35,180
doesn't appear to pass through?

1724
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,800
By the way. Thank you, Daniel.

1725
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,404
Stumped. I guess it means on what you

1726
01:20:00,442 --> 01:20:02,756
mean by tunneling, right? So, like each

1727
01:20:02,858 --> 01:20:04,096
mode, like if you look at the high

1728
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:06,356
frequency modes, they are quite patchy

1729
01:20:06,388 --> 01:20:09,220
and so there'll be sort of disjointed

1730
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:12,104
areas of high amplitude and low

1731
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:14,584
amplitude, but they fluctuate in time,

1732
01:20:14,622 --> 01:20:16,348
right? Like they're standing waves. And

1733
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:18,636
so they'll kind of alternate up and

1734
01:20:18,658 --> 01:20:20,556
down. So in a sense it looks like

1735
01:20:20,578 --> 01:20:23,100
there's coupling over long distances,

1736
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,504
but that's just due to the standing wave

1737
01:20:28,552 --> 01:20:30,016
dynamics, which is just driven by the

1738
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:31,356
interference pattern of the traveling

1739
01:20:31,388 --> 01:20:35,708
waves. So I'm

1740
01:20:35,724 --> 01:20:37,184
not sure if that's kind of what you were

1741
01:20:37,222 --> 01:20:39,456
getting at, but I guess from a

1742
01:20:39,478 --> 01:20:41,236
perspective of just if you were just

1743
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:42,784
looking at the standing wave dynamics,

1744
01:20:42,832 --> 01:20:45,440
it would look like things in spatially

1745
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,608
disjoint locations were kind of coupled

1746
01:20:48,624 --> 01:20:49,670
in some way.

1747
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,584
It's like one jello, it stays

1748
01:20:55,632 --> 01:20:59,252
put where you hit it and it stays put 1

1749
01:20:59,306 --> 01:21:02,276
mile away and it oscillates between like

1750
01:21:02,298 --> 01:21:05,820
a jump rope or it could be

1751
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:07,992
it somewhere that's also very variable,

1752
01:21:08,056 --> 01:21:10,460
then be like the opposite of a jump rope

1753
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,696
with one mode. And that's

1754
01:21:14,728 --> 01:21:17,416
what's captured in the set of functions

1755
01:21:17,448 --> 01:21:18,976
that are then parameterized. So then

1756
01:21:18,998 --> 01:21:21,168
when you assemble them or when you

1757
01:21:21,254 --> 01:21:26,896
superimpose them, you could get kind

1758
01:21:26,918 --> 01:21:31,760
of digitized looking outcome

1759
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,360
patterns in terms of the real empirical

1760
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,204
correlations and

1761
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:40,896
it's map, not territory. And it's

1762
01:21:40,928 --> 01:21:42,612
tempting to interpret these very

1763
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:45,060
literally as with many statistical

1764
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:48,004
tools. When I think, as we've discussed,

1765
01:21:48,132 --> 01:21:50,056
there's multiple possible mechanisms and

1766
01:21:50,078 --> 01:21:51,396
in your paper and in your work, you've

1767
01:21:51,428 --> 01:21:53,610
probably thought of many, many

1768
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,300
mechanisms that lend themselves to

1769
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,620
unique empirical predictions.

1770
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,832
But basis set decomposition

1771
01:22:03,896 --> 01:22:06,956
is used like in SPM, which is kind of

1772
01:22:06,978 --> 01:22:10,556
like one of the precedents of active

1773
01:22:10,588 --> 01:22:12,796
inference. And the work by Karl Frist

1774
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:15,170
and others, it's using basis sets as.

1775
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:22,660
They used. They use it everywhere.

1776
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:29,252
Do you have any closing or

1777
01:22:29,306 --> 01:22:31,636
near closing thoughts or where does the

1778
01:22:31,658 --> 01:22:35,192
work go? What data sets are salient or

1779
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:37,816
questions or cognitive phenomena or what

1780
01:22:37,838 --> 01:22:39,576
are you excited about for your lab and

1781
01:22:39,598 --> 01:22:40,760
for the fields.

1782
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:44,650
Your lab?

1783
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,552
There's a few different ways that we're

1784
01:22:50,616 --> 01:22:52,830
interested in progressing it.

1785
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,368
So one is, I guess, trying to reconcile

1786
01:22:57,464 --> 01:23:00,144
this purely geometric approach that

1787
01:23:00,182 --> 01:23:01,824
makes a very simple approximation with

1788
01:23:01,862 --> 01:23:03,152
connectivity, with the actual

1789
01:23:03,206 --> 01:23:05,296
connectivity of the brain, and trying to

1790
01:23:05,318 --> 01:23:08,816
understand if the

1791
01:23:08,838 --> 01:23:10,492
contributions of these kind of complex

1792
01:23:10,556 --> 01:23:12,576
connections are not so easily revealed

1793
01:23:12,608 --> 01:23:15,156
by a classic fMRI experiment. What are

1794
01:23:15,178 --> 01:23:17,876
their contributions to dynamics? And is

1795
01:23:17,898 --> 01:23:20,756
there a way of kind of bringing some of

1796
01:23:20,778 --> 01:23:23,684
that complex connectivity into the wave

1797
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:26,520
model and trying to get some traction on

1798
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,450
that question?

1799
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:34,456
Another aspect is we've done

1800
01:23:34,478 --> 01:23:36,468
the simplest thing. We treat all areas

1801
01:23:36,484 --> 01:23:39,356
of the cortex as homogeneous, but we

1802
01:23:39,378 --> 01:23:42,268
know that's not the case. Areas vary in

1803
01:23:42,274 --> 01:23:43,868
terms of the cell density, degree of

1804
01:23:43,874 --> 01:23:46,328
myelination, level of synaptic

1805
01:23:46,424 --> 01:23:50,284
complexity and density and so on. And so

1806
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:52,312
that, in a sense, could be imagined.

1807
01:23:52,376 --> 01:23:53,856
You could imagine that as changing the

1808
01:23:53,878 --> 01:23:55,856
effective geometry of the cortex. And so

1809
01:23:55,878 --> 01:23:58,096
we're playing around with how do you

1810
01:23:58,118 --> 01:23:59,936
introduce that heterogeneity and how

1811
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:02,468
does that change the mode structure and

1812
01:24:02,634 --> 01:24:04,304
does that have an impact on your ability

1813
01:24:04,352 --> 01:24:06,020
to reconstruct dynamics?

1814
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,516
We're then also interested in sort of

1815
01:24:10,538 --> 01:24:13,872
taking this forward to leverage

1816
01:24:13,936 --> 01:24:15,464
these approaches for thinking about

1817
01:24:15,502 --> 01:24:17,256
different ways in which we might be able

1818
01:24:17,278 --> 01:24:18,824
to map brain changes in different

1819
01:24:18,862 --> 01:24:22,072
disorders or variations across

1820
01:24:22,126 --> 01:24:24,890
species and so on. And so kind of like

1821
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,372
classical SPM analyses, but making

1822
01:24:29,426 --> 01:24:31,404
inference at the modal level and seeing

1823
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:33,096
if that can provide some useful

1824
01:24:33,128 --> 01:24:35,630
insights. So there's a few different

1825
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,340
strategies.

1826
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:46,600
Any other comments or thoughts? No.

1827
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:49,476
Dean, where do you go after this? Dean?

1828
01:24:49,588 --> 01:24:52,356
In your own neuroimaging career?

1829
01:24:52,548 --> 01:24:55,052
No. Stop it. I just think it was a very

1830
01:24:55,106 --> 01:24:57,484
clear picture. And again, I really

1831
01:24:57,522 --> 01:25:01,404
appreciated the paper itself, but

1832
01:25:01,522 --> 01:25:03,996
today's presentation sort of brought it

1833
01:25:04,018 --> 01:25:07,388
to life and made it. I know that you

1834
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:08,576
guys were really trying to focus on

1835
01:25:08,598 --> 01:25:10,370
making sure that you got all of your

1836
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,816
formalities in a row, but just the way

1837
01:25:16,838 --> 01:25:20,644
you presented it today made it even more

1838
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:25,056
come alive in terms of the mechanisms

1839
01:25:25,088 --> 01:25:28,884
that you use to sort of come up with a

1840
01:25:28,922 --> 01:25:31,972
clearer picture. That's what I came away

1841
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:34,310
with. So, again, thank you very much.

1842
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,476
Cool. Thanks for the invitation. Thank

1843
01:25:37,498 --> 01:25:40,516
you. Yeah. We'll look forward to seeing

1844
01:25:40,698 --> 01:25:42,592
the continuation of this trajectory.

1845
01:25:42,656 --> 01:25:45,052
You're always welcome. Come back. So

1846
01:25:45,186 --> 01:25:47,964
thank you both. Thank you. Thanks,

1847
01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:48,844
guys. See you.
