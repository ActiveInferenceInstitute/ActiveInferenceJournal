00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,246
Hello,
and welcome to the Active Inference Lab.

2
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:17,517
This is Active Inference
Gueststream number 3.1.

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,187
And we're really excited to be here today
with Sarah Hashkes.

4
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,191
We are going to be talking about,
as the title slide suggests,

5
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,228
Active Inference, VR and psychedelics.

6
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,698
So, Sarah, I'll leave it to you
to just introduce

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,834
the topic yourself
and the ideas however you want.

8
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,237
And it sounds like
we're going to be having

9
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,840
a first section of the presentation,
then a question answer

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,343
and then a second section
of the presentation.

11
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,712
At that, we're going to have a second
overall discussion.

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,914
So with that kind of structure in mind,

13
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,350
just introduce yourself
and please take it away.

14
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,519
Hi, everyone.

15
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:56,222
So, yeah, we're going to be talking
first about my research

16
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,260
in VR and Active and friends
and then my research in psychedelics

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,630
and how it relates to a few issues
about active inference.

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,701
And we'll have a short break
in the middle for questions that I have.

19
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,171
My name is Sarah Houseguests.

20
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,641
I have a master's degree
in cognitive neuroscience.

21
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:19,946
I opened the first VR lab in the motor
control department at Radboud,

22
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,349
where I was researching VR.

23
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:28,488
Its effect on our brain body connection
within the predictive coding framework.

24
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:33,193
I am now CEO of Redlich Motion,
where a startup that combines

25
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:37,697
neuroscience and immersive technology
and we're focusing on

26
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,101
empowering the psychedelic ecosystem
with embodied tech.

27
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,304
So now let's get right to it.

28
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:48,942
A lot of this is basically all of this
lecture is based on my research

29
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:55,615
from academia was pretty nice to go back
and read all the things from 2017.

30
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:00,720
But before I actually get into it,
I like to activate our actors

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,991
and friends
and very short interactive experience.

32
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,661
So wherever you are,
especially if you've been sitting a lot,

33
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,731
actually suggest you stand up

34
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:15,468
and hopefully you can see
my hand on the screen.

35
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,172
And I'm going to ask you
to put your hand in front of my screen

36
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,608
and just follow it for a few minutes.

37
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,743
Do it with your mouse.

38
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,811
Move your mouse.

39
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,778
Yeah. Okay.

40
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,314
Well, okay. We can do that, too.

41
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,849
You can see.

42
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,851
Oh, I see.
You're not seeing my face in this.

43
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,086
Okay. Yeah.

44
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,422
So follow the mouse for a few seconds

45
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,226
and see if you can track this.

46
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,295
So what just happened here?

47
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:47,100
So, okay, I gave you auditory

48
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,138
instruction
that hit your brain and created a goal.

49
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,908
A top down prediction

50
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,709
that you were supposed
to. Well, you didn't see my hand.

51
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:57,944
You saw my mouse.

52
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,381
But basically, that prediction was that

53
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:05,251
the position of your hand to the mouse
should be the same position.

54
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,122
The difference should be zero. Now

55
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,291
your eye.

56
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:16,362
And we're then giving you bottom up
sensory input that we're telling you.

57
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,133
Oh, there's this difference
between the mouse and the hand.

58
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,571
And due to active inference,
wanting to minimize

59
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,074
this prediction error,
your hand was moved towards the mouse.

60
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:32,178
So this is a very simple example
of active inference.

61
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,880
And this follow me

62
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,383
instruction and activity

63
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:42,889
is really quite basic for how we learn
motor skills as children.

64
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,793
And you can see this in the way
kids play games

65
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:51,030
with if Simon says, you know, patty cake
and the way children's

66
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,033
look to their adult figures to actually

67
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,036
copy them and learn movement patterns

68
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,375
and this Follow Me example
was part of the research I was doing.

69
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,911
So we'll get into that

70
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,212
though.

71
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,581
What exactly was I trying to do?

72
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:14,420
Well, I was really hoping that
if I could receive visual cues

73
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,793
from inside of a body of a professional
mover, I would be able to activate

74
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:25,331
this active inference ability of my brain
and actually improve my movements.

75
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,802
I have a background
in martial arts and dance,

76
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,773
but I'm actually from Thailand,
a very, very clumsy human

77
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,645
that took me really, really, I guess
a lot longer to learn motor skills.

78
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,215
And I was looking for a way to hack this
and I kept dreaming,

79
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,852
Oh, if I could just be inside
the body of my martial arts

80
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,688
teacher,
would I be able to punch like him?

81
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,959
Would my body learn to adapt
and move faster and more accurately?

82
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:59,565
Because I would be receiving this
prediction that I am actually him. So

83
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,502
this is sort of where

84
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,972
I started
exploring how I could research this.

85
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,842
Now, why would I even think it's possible
using VR?

86
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,680
So part of the things about VR
is that it doesn't

87
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,618
just activate your visual sensation
and sensory input.

88
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:24,090
It's actually a multimodal integration
between your visual perception

89
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,994
and your proprioceptive, auditory
and even haptic.

90
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,464
If you're currently using
like haptic controllers.

91
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,135
In my experiment, I just was like
we were using the SDK, one of Oculus,

92
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,403
no haptic controllers.

93
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,740
I was connecting them to lab equipment

94
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,143
to get positions of the hands,

95
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:48,181
but we were still connecting visual
and proprioceptive sensations,

96
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,651
meaning basically
when you move your neck around,

97
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,521
the world is still moving
the way you're expecting it to move.

98
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,258
So you're getting the same upper body
and neck

99
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,295
activations of muscles
of where you are in space

100
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,031
along with your visual perception.

101
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,467
And that activates
these higher brain areas

102
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,904
and really gives you
this what we call the sense of immersive,

103
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,374
immersive ness, right? Immersion.
You're in that place.

104
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,675
Your brain believes it's real,

105
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,144
even though you know, parts of
you know that it's not.

106
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,749
Now we are really gives us
the very unique ability

107
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,851
to influence the brain
because we can start

108
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,154
controlling the relationship
between the different sense in

109
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:33,092
in ways that either fit these previous
top down biases or don't.

110
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,730
So we can this we really modulate
the amount of prediction error

111
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,501
that we're receiving and activating
in the person's brain.

112
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,238
And there's really

113
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,574
a lot of experiments out there
that that have been done.

114
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:53,112
For instance, with anorexia patients
and people with pain issues

115
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:58,184
that really prove
that we can give a new sense of self

116
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,253
to a person.

117
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,890
So when I talk about a sense of self,
what am I talking about

118
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,193
from the predictive coding perspective,
the really, really

119
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,596
great paper by apps?

120
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,266
And just curious

121
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,437
that really I go about explaining
this concept of a minimal self

122
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:23,309
being the top down prediction
that just explains

123
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,446
the sensory correlations
between the different senses.

124
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,249
And a great example
is the rubber hand experiment.

125
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,352
So if you don't know

126
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,889
this hand is
your hand is actually hidden from you.

127
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,293
Like in the photo,
but it's receiving sensory input

128
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,698
at the same frequency that you're seeing
a rubber hand being semi stimulated.

129
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,101
Now researchers are a bit cruel
with this experiment.

130
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,138
They at some point
take a hammer and smash the rubber hand

131
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:56,943
and you can really see and register
and record the physiological

132
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,580
measurements from the person
and how that person gets dressed.

133
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:06,986
Now, newer research is actually showing
that this isn't the same for everybody.

134
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,489
There's some people that seem
to be more susceptible

135
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,290
to this versus others that don't.

136
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,794
There's some amount of suggestibility
and I guess maybe

137
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,431
strength of what is your own self versus

138
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,502
how you do all this top down
prediction is in society

139
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,272
might be actually quite different
and we'll talk about that later.

140
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,373
But generally

141
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:31,043
there is the very strong ability for us
to change our sense of minimal self.

142
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,746
And we do this all the time
when we wear clothing.

143
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:38,985
Our predictive ability is become able
to just predict the way this sensation,

144
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,688
unless, you know,
you're somewhere on the autistic spectrum

145
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:47,360
and then every little itch
and things can drive you crazy,

146
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,197
but also using tools,

147
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,934
this ability to really extend
what we call our minimal self.

148
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,403
So I was hoping that

149
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,007
with VR I'd be able to transfer myself

150
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:05,745
from a clumsy person
into somebody that can do movements

151
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,881
that are much, much more difficult
and a much faster time.

152
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,352
So what did I actually do?

153
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:18,524
I needed to find the task that was known
to be a hard task that I could measure.

154
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,493
Right. What is the difference here?

155
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,063
So what was a task
that's called by manual interference?

156
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,832
So by manual interference

157
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:31,771
is basically our inability
to create different movements

158
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,073
with different patterns

159
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:37,276
and get an actual interference pattern
between them.

160
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,380
A very simple game, which is what I could
add in my experiment,

161
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,885
is try to make circle in one hand
and a square with the other

162
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,788
and just try again.

163
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:54,160
And what basically happened is that your
you go between

164
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,299
phases of making circular movement
and phases of making square movement. So

165
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,103
I set out to look at this task and see,

166
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,908
can I improve this task and people
with various VR interventions.

167
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:14,747
So oops, I don't know why
this new finding here, but okay,

168
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,817
so let's look a little bit
at the experimental design

169
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,753
exactly of all the different things
that I was doing.

170
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,023
And I'm not going to go into exactly
all the analysis.

171
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,659
You can read the paper
because I want to talk more about like

172
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,662
the actual discussions and

173
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,734
what are the ideas that come from this
that we can implement in our daily lives.

174
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,270
But there are basically

175
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,972
a few different conditions.

176
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,742
One condition was a follow me condition,

177
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:47,880
similar to what we did
at the beginning of this lecture,

178
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,617
where you had an avatar
that was able to do these movements

179
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,153
and you were instructed
to follow the avatar.

180
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,425
The other instruction was complete
the movements yourself.

181
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,459
So there's self

182
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,463
expert experiment
and there's a follow experiment.

183
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,567
Now on the follow experiment,
we were actually discover

184
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,538
that we needed to hide
the square and circle because then

185
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,608
the minute people were already predicting

186
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,278
that we're doing a squared circle,
they were not following as much.

187
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:23,649
So when you were following,
you were doing random follow movements

188
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,987
along with periodic
small parts of circles and squares,

189
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,556
which I then analyzed
specifically those effects.

190
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,127
So that was one,
just like I'm going to say, sort of this

191
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:39,198
like baseline condition to see
what is the difference between following

192
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,001
someone versus doing these movements
yourself.

193
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,838
And the second line

194
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,475
that you can see on this design
experiment

195
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,712
was a bid of making things

196
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,282
on screen here
with what we can do with VR.

197
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,318
So the second condition,

198
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,922
when you moved your right hand,
you actually saw your left hand move.

199
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,526
Now, there's no way I can recreate this
for you without putting you inside of VR.

200
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,562
It's a very trippy experience.

201
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:14,266
Everybody, like with what you're like moving your right hand, but your left hand

202
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,869
is moving

203
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,239
and that really, like, messes up
your predictions.

204
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,910
Now, the third experiment
I put you inside of the avatar

205
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,782
that was able to do these movements
and then told you, follow the movements

206
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,986
or just become this avatar and follow
the movements from within this avatar.

207
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,857
So we actually manipulated two things.

208
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,160
One is the high level path. Go right.

209
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,329
Follow versus move yourself.

210
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,166
Now we assume that the self movement has

211
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:51,137
a very strong high prior of allowing
only one task.

212
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,874
This is something that, you know,
we're sort of

213
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:00,212
meant to be doing naturalistically
one task at every given time.

214
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:04,083
We also have this basal ganglia
that's really blocking

215
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:10,656
more than one activation
of a physiological or a motor activity.

216
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,794
So that was one thing
we manipulated follow versus.

217
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:16,662
But there's

218
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,699
do yourself and the second manipulate in
was of the visual feedback right.

219
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:25,805
Do you see your own hands moving
through your weird crossed hands moving

220
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,875
or do you see an avatar's hand moving

221
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,311
from the perspective of your own hands?

222
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,749
Now, there's again

223
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:41,253
the difference here when I crossed
your hands, we're really giving you

224
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,723
lots of prediction or prediction error
that doesn't fit

225
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,261
the normal, minimal self activation
and predictions

226
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,998
that you have versus
when I'm putting you inside of an avatar

227
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:57,002
that's moving in the same way
that you are trying to move.

228
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm actually not doing something
that's against this minimal self

229
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,012
prediction, and we'll see how
these things give different results.

230
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,449
So let's go with start

231
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,920
with the first thing
that I was most hoping to get.

232
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,024
Oh, I'll just plop myself into an avatar
that can do these movements

233
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,860
and I'll be able to do that.

234
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,127
Well, that didn't work.

235
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,231
In fact, we got the exact opposite.

236
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,500
So when I say
and this increased the interference,

237
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,905
it mean that people were less able
to perform this difficult task.

238
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,975
They were having even more

239
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:42,047
periods, both hands doing the same thing,
either circle or square,

240
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,184
and not able to differentiate
each of them.

241
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:50,356
So what actually likely happened here?

242
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:50,623
Right.

243
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,994
And this is sort of a theory because
I was not looking at neural correlates.

244
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,630
I was just looking at behavioral data.

245
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,666
But there is a general consensus

246
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:05,104
in literature that the visual modality,
at least for most of us,

247
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,740
is much stronger
than proprioception and data.

248
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,579
So it seems that we were getting this
mismatch between the sensory

249
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:18,083
input, right, of I'm
seeing my hands doing the thing,

250
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,855
but I'm feeling my hand
in a different place right now.

251
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,725
I was hoping that with
that would cause active interference,

252
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,228
pulling your hand
to where they're supposed to be.

253
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,932
But it feels that the actual actually
the opposite happened.

254
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,901
And because when I asked people,

255
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,972
they were all actually believing
that they were doing the task better.

256
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,442
Some of them actually thought
they were the avatar.

257
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:47,212
They didn't even realize
that this was a preprogramed avatar.

258
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,681
They thought it was them

259
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,384
and all of them reported it to be easier.

260
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,422
So but when I looked at the data,

261
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,491
all of them
were actually doing much worse.

262
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:04,797
So it seemed that the visual modality
cause the proprioception modality

263
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,434
to actually lower and become,
you know, less accurate.

264
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,905
And your brain decided
when it has this this a higher prediction

265
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,640
or there's a few tactics it can do.

266
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,710
One is active inference,
the other is modulate

267
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,580
one of the modalities,
and it seems that that's what it did.

268
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,584
This lowered the proprioception, stuck,
stuck

269
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,554
with the sensation from the eyes,
which it could predict.

270
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,423
And that's the way it sort of minimized
the prediction error.

271
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,793
So can talk a bit more in the discussion

272
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:39,398
about the meaning of this
and how what it means for training.

273
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:43,435
But this was, again, you know, it was

274
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,471
against what

275
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,707
I was hoping and against my
my initial prediction.

276
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:53,479
But thinking about this a bit deeper,
it doesn't make sense because accurate

277
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,850
feedback of what you're actually doing
seems to be incredibly,

278
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,619
incredibly important for a learning
any type of skill.

279
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,191
So giving this false feedback
of somebody doing the movements

280
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:11,330
seems to not be the way to go around
actually teaching movements.

281
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,433
An experiment
I would love to conduct in the future

282
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,803
as having both of these as an overlay,
like have

283
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,140
the avatar
that's able to do the movements,

284
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,977
but they'll give you a physical ability

285
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,780
to actually know where your hands are.

286
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,285
And this is something that if people have
VR, they can actually download my

287
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,389
my VR app that's called meWe, which lets
you play with these things yourself,

288
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,894
but it basically records 3D movements
and then you can move around them

289
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,031
and also get haptic feedback
and see where your hands are inside.

290
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:50,002
So I played around with that a bit
with like professional jugglers

291
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:55,374
creating movements and then me stepping
inside and needing to follow their hands,

292
00:17:55,808 --> 00:18:00,145
but also receiving the feedback of where
my hands are through haptic feedback

293
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,916
and visual perception.

294
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,752
But I did not do an academic research
on that yet.

295
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,588
And that I think
could be really interesting

296
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,591
because I think
there might be something there

297
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,928
because obviously the prediction error
was increased,

298
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,465
meaning your brain needs to deal
with this prediction error in some ways.

299
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,869
So there is a potential of still creating

300
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,373
better updates and maybe activating
this active inference ability.

301
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,477
But we need to not only trust

302
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:35,447
the visual perception
in visual versus proprioception,

303
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:40,986
the visual just wins
and you don't feel where you are anymore.

304
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,988
At that same level of accuracy.

305
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,991
So that was interesting.

306
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,561
Now let's look at the other
two conditions

307
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,098
of what I found. So

308
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,867
and the other two conditions

309
00:18:54,867 --> 00:19:00,572
I found that when I actually gave people
the totally incorrect things

310
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,375
that were against their minimal self,
I crossed their hands.

311
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,577
They were moving their right hand,
seeing the left hand,

312
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,213
something that they've never,
ever experienced before.

313
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,584
They were able
to follow the avatar better,

314
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,922
but the
self movement movements were worse.

315
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,190
Right?

316
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,226
And that actually does make sense

317
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,263
because again, we're interfering

318
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,065
with that self level prediction

319
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:32,971
and having to maintain this goal
of doing a self movement

320
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:37,342
while your whole minimal self
is just like totally wonky

321
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,479
and doesn't know what's going on
and has a much higher prediction error

322
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,051
is causing interference and making you
not able to do this task as well.

323
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:52,024
But a follow a task where you don't
actually need to go is really different.

324
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,794
You don't actually need to have a goal,
high level, goal

325
00:19:55,794 --> 00:20:00,966
oriented self structure
that's creating these predictions.

326
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:06,672
You just need to really minimize
this location in space versus

327
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,809
the other person
they were actually doing better.

328
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,279
And we'll talk a little bit about why

329
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:18,617
why that might have happened.

330
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:18,884
Yeah.

331
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,288
So just
one more finding before we go into a bit

332
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:27,659
more of the discussion
is that there was actually

333
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,464
two very different strategies

334
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:36,001
might have been employed here as we see
between the two different tasks.

335
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:41,173
Right when you're in the self
task, this fire prediction error

336
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:45,644
that you need to deal with is that you
can't just make yourself disappear.

337
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,381
You need to keep maintaining the skill.

338
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:54,653
So maybe your brain created a weaker
prediction, right?

339
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,423
And then it would just like lower
that prediction error

340
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,692
by having a wider sort of,

341
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,831
I guess, and there's a lot of between
like stronger or weaker and wider.

342
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,867
My specific professor was very

343
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,938
the in the prediction
predictive coding game looking at things

344
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,641
from actually not a continuous Gaussian

345
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,111
but more of a discrete level.

346
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,080
And a lot of this is about like details,

347
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,050
the level of detail of your prediction.

348
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,787
So if you have a less detailed
prediction, you're going to decrease

349
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:33,325
your prediction error rate if you say and
we'll talk a little bit more about that

350
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,961
when we talk about psychedelics
because it's very relevant there.

351
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,332
But if you're just saying,
okay, my hand needs to be around here,

352
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:45,470
you know, versus your hand needs
to be exactly at a specific point.

353
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,573
That's another way
to decrease prediction error.

354
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,743
So on the self task, that might be
what was happening.

355
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:56,048
Your brain was just decreasing the detail
of the prediction.

356
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:00,686
In order to decrease the prediction error, which would result in worse behavior

357
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,756
versus the follow task.

358
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,759
Your brain might have reduced
the prediction

359
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,862
error by actually

360
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:14,733
reducing that visual perception
and getting on the relative

361
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,103
right between proprioception
to visual, actually

362
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,941
getting more of this proprioception,
creating these closer feedback loops with

363
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:27,045
where your body is in space
and getting this more independence

364
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:32,451
between your hands because you don't need
to have this single task anymore.

365
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,953
You're just following.

366
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,522
And an interesting finding.

367
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,592
I don't have the quote of the paper
here, but

368
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,662
there was a paper
that did the exact same task

369
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,932
but with eyes closed and just touch.

370
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,069
So people had their eyes closed
and we're just touching

371
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,406
something that was moving in a

372
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,843
by manual independent manner
and they were all able to do it. It

373
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:03,115
suddenly from becoming a very difficult
task that came a very easy task.

374
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,651
So this really shows that sometimes

375
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:11,790
and I think anybody that practices
movement, it's sort of a common trope.

376
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,426
But there's this thing of like thinking
too much.

377
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,830
So goal oriented movement can actually

378
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,335
if we are taking this goal
oriented movement and putting it in a way

379
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,872
that's too detailed,
we're telling our brains, create

380
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,942
these movement path and create
two separate movement paths.

381
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,413
That's a really not naturalistic
state for our brain to be in

382
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,584
versus when we're
just like, okay, we're following things.

383
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:44,656
That's a very naturalistic,
the low level feedback between our motor

384
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:51,496
cortex and our proprioception
and our sensation can just work.

385
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:56,701
So yeah, that
that does all sort of hopefully under.

386
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,003
Understood.

387
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,772
Now another finding

388
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,774
that that happened was that

389
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,011
there was a much higher variance.

390
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,181
Like I was expecting this
to be a very hard task for everyone.

391
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,616
That's what the literature said.

392
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,620
But I found that and again,
this is a small experiment.

393
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,390
I'm about like 13, six students, right?

394
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,293
I'm all healthy subjects,

395
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,530
young, but

396
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,200
two of them were very able

397
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,671
to do the baseline task,
and that was a surprise to some of them.

398
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:36,374
The task was so difficult
that I could barely use the data

399
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,411
because they were literally
just moving one hand.

400
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:43,348
The other hand was just freezing in space
and the other hand withdrew.

401
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,051
So they weren't even able to maintain

402
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,654
these two goals and move two hands

403
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,858
in separate ways at all.

404
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,894
So that

405
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,964
really goes to
show just how different our brains are.

406
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,767
One of the interesting things to compare
this experiment

407
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:07,072
to is binocular rivalry,
which has been written

408
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,608
a lot about
and that predictive coding literature.

409
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,012
So for whoever doesn't know
this binocular rivalry

410
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,083
is when we project
two different images onto each.

411
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,920
I so one eye is seeing one image
you can see in the picture

412
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,790
the right eye is getting a red image
with one

413
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,728
angle of direction and the left eye
is getting a different one.

414
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:34,933
Now what happens to your brain
is it actually switches your perception.

415
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:39,137
It switches between seeing
one of the images and the other images

416
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:44,142
with some short phases,
usually of like mixed perception,

417
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,245
but really just bouncing
mostly between one to the next.

418
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:51,149
Now here, too, there is a lot of variance
in the population.

419
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,452
And one of the interesting things
is that people on this

420
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,123
autistic spectrum,
which, you know, I have,

421
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:01,860
and this criticism about the
DSM and how we're classifying

422
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,563
autism and generally

423
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,599
mental health and different types of

424
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,934
brain,

425
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,637
brain abnormalities,

426
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,006
but some people definitely

427
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:19,778
have much more mixed states
than others, and different

428
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:23,048
drugs can also affect their ability
to have mixtapes.

429
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,851
And it's sort of interesting
to compare these two tests because

430
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:31,089
both of them are sort
of creating a bio stable system

431
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,159
coming from an unnatural mystic

432
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,361
task or a naturalistic

433
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,498
input that you're
not usually supposed to be doing.

434
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:44,703
Because the way our brain
was really meant to be doing

435
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:48,807
motor actions is around high level goals.

436
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,709
Completing high level goals. Right.

437
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,511
Give me the border.

438
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,480
Turn on the thing.

439
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,616
Grab bang.

440
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:02,487
There's always a high level goal
that's oriented towards one of our high,

441
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:06,224
higher level needs or lower level needs,
but like a specific need

442
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,294
that you're trying to complete.

443
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,932
And with this task of telling people,
Oh, move your hand

444
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:17,102
in this motor pathway and your other hand
in this motor pathway,

445
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:22,474
it's very naturalistic for our brain,
very similar to giving someone

446
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:28,046
these two different visuals,
which we never see in real life. So

447
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,081
again, this is really

448
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,084
correlate to this
having a very strong hyper prior

449
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:38,356
and in a binocular rivalry situation,
your brain has a very strong hyper prior.

450
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,192
No, I can just this doing one thing

451
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,028
this this is how the world works.

452
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:47,966
There can only be one thing in one place
and then your brain activates

453
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,868
in order to minimize this prediction

454
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,805
error, it goes between, okay,
and I guess I'm seeing this one now.

455
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,507
It keeps getting prediction error.

456
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,509
Oh, I guess I'm seeing the other one.

457
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,478
So it keeps jumping
between these two states

458
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,747
in order to minimize the prediction
error.

459
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,918
Now, the same thing quite likely
is happening with this

460
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,723
by manual interference
with having a very strong hyper prior

461
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:16,261
of Oh, I'm only supposed to be doing one
task at any given time.

462
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:20,365
You're just giving me two different
tasks to complete at the same time.

463
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,569
I'm going to be switching between them

464
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,571
now, possibly

465
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:31,710
when you have this different sense
of minimal stuff, this can actually

466
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,980
create different activation patterns
and let you be more in a mixed state,

467
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,117
more in an independent state,
have basically

468
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,286
weaker hyper priors around

469
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,355
either what you're seeing

470
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,559
or what your task abilities are.

471
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,230
So this might be an interesting way
of generally understanding

472
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,434
a lot of what our hyper priors
are doing to us.

473
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:00,205
And just the variance in the population
might be around

474
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,441
these hyper priors.

475
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,809
So let's, let's

476
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:09,047
now let's get into like more of like
what are these possible implications

477
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:14,385
and how can we use this data to like,
you know,

478
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,957
do cool things with rehabilitation
and even just training and getting

479
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,226
me to be less clumsy. So

480
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,495
one of the things that that

481
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:27,699
comes up from this is really naturalistic
design of movement goals.

482
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,703
Instead of telling people, move your hand

483
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:37,142
at this angle, we step over here
and we see this a lot actually in

484
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:43,681
in traditional martial arts,
they give movement names of activities

485
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,853
like in kung fu, where you have
stroking the horse that the horses mean.

486
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,455
In karate

487
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:55,560
we have a move that's called braking,
braking the wall or braking the gate.

488
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,130
So having these goals

489
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,201
that are really oriented towards
task completion

490
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:09,140
verses goals that are to low
level are much more likely

491
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,111
to activate this active
inference and ways that we want them to.

492
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,415
When we put the goals into the low

493
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,450
level patterns,

494
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,655
we're
then creating this sort of a naturalistic

495
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,324
activity and maybe

496
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:31,696
even like slowing things down
like the fast parts of our brain

497
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:35,200
that deal with bringing together
these sense modalities

498
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,936
of visual sensation and motor actions.

499
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,271
They need to stay down there.

500
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,807
They need to not be part of this
high level

501
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:47,846
stuff, you know,

502
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,915
network
a part of our hierarchical network.

503
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,052
And I think that's really interesting
because that really

504
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,588
is like what I was doing.

505
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,791
Every martial arts teacher
my whole life has told me,

506
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:03,161
Stop thinking,
I don't know what to do about this.

507
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,997
You know, how can you stop thinking?

508
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:11,436
But part of it is letting these low level
parts of your body

509
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,441
do the movements
while maintaining high level goals

510
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:20,912
that are not oriented to exactly,
oh, where is my elbow?

511
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,113
Is it here or here?

512
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,816
Where am I holding my fist?

513
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:29,754
Like all these little details work
much better if you give them high

514
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:34,225
level metaphors somehow that your brain
that the lower levels can then

515
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,729
take those predictions
and minimize prediction error.

516
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,131
So that's

517
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:44,369
another interesting part of this,
is that it might actually explain

518
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,672
some of why mirror box therapy works

519
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,911
and why mirror box therapy is now
something that's also being used in VR

520
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:57,115
and so for whoever doesn't know
where box therapy

521
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,552
is used on amputees

522
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,656
and people that have pain in one

523
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:09,928
hand, like chronic pain or even stroke,

524
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,831
people
that had suffered through a stroke.

525
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:18,002
So what you do is you take the body part
that is actually

526
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,572
okay, that doesn't have pain,
that is working.

527
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:26,311
And you use a mirror to
then get your brain to believe

528
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,881
that your other body part is also moving

529
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:34,485
and is healthy or even there
if it's an amputee.

530
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,890
And this was actually figured out by,
I think the first person was Ramachandran

531
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,760
working with amputees that were suffering
from just phantom pain

532
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,764
and how do you get rid of pain
from a limb that doesn't exist anymore?

533
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:47,465
Right.

534
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,768
This was like a top down prediction

535
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,372
from the injury
that was just not getting updated.

536
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,077
And you see this a lot in chronic
pain, really.

537
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:04,015
You see the neural circuitry
even change as the predictions for pain

538
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:09,187
just cement themselves
and become biases in your brain.

539
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:14,025
So by using this type of mirror
box therapy

540
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,395
and helps relieve the pain.

541
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:21,165
So why or how is this connected
to what we just saw?

542
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:26,104
Because the visual modality is stronger
than the proprioception modality.

543
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,240
It's not too far fetched to believe
that the visual modality

544
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,611
is also stronger than the nociceptors
the pain receptors that we're getting.

545
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:39,584
So if we can actually cause your brain
to believe and just by seeing cause

546
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:43,955
that visual perception of a healthy hand,
it might be enough to mute

547
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:48,593
the same way your proprioception
was muting to mute your nociceptors

548
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,630
and then reduce the pain.

549
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,365
So that's that's really interesting.

550
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,236
And it's interesting to see the arteries
inserting teasers with stroke victims

551
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,571
to actually help them
rehabilitate their hand.

552
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,675
And that's really interesting
because that's a little bit

553
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,278
not in accordance with what I saw

554
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,715
for my experiment,
but it might be different

555
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,919
because they might not
be getting current data about them.

556
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,322
And I think it might be really dependent
on, you know,

557
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,092
what the stroke
has actually damaged in your brain.

558
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,095
If the stroke part
has damaged your ability

559
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,697
to receive
any type of proprioceptive data,

560
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,269
then maybe getting that

561
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:35,940
dual perception might help reprogram
that.

562
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,709
That might be less of an interference
going on. I'm not sure.

563
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:43,181
It's sort of interesting to think about.

564
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,716
So let's see.
What are we left with? Oh, yeah.

565
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,421
So now
there's basically that third condition.

566
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,659
Why I gave this crossed hand condition,
and I think that's really

567
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:00,064
an underutilized mechanism
generally in any type of rehabilitation

568
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:05,470
and training, messing your brain up
even more in some ways.

569
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:09,807
And I think that that's
a very strong intervention

570
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:15,213
that we could play around with a lot more
because it's, you know, 100%

571
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,316
we're creating more prediction area
that your brain needs to deal with.

572
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:22,053
Now, how your brain will deal
with that prediction will it actually

573
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,758
remodel with to create active inference
will reduce some other sensation

574
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:33,131
might really depend on the
tasks on your brain on how we do this but

575
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:38,202
being able to increase prediction error
in your brain is a very powerful ability.

576
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:42,073
And I think that's something
that really is worth looking into more

577
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,775
when we're talking
about rehabilitation tools

578
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,447
and we see these types of things
starting to emerge in VR,

579
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,551
more with like total body replacements,
like I was talking about, about like

580
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,955
anorexia patients are putting them
in a whole new avatar

581
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:01,259
and creating a full body

582
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,660
rubber hand experiment.

583
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,063
So they're getting sensations
on their body at the same time

584
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:10,067
that they're seeing their avatar
and getting sensations.

585
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:13,304
And it's been proven
to help them remodel this

586
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:18,142
top level belief, an accurate belief
that they have about their bodies

587
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,312
being overweight, though they're not.

588
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,681
So that's very interesting.

589
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,851
But I think there's really a lot
that we can do

590
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,621
with increased massively
increasing prediction around the brain.

591
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,057
And you see this
in a lot of crazy experiments, right?

592
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:38,095
Like the upside down glasses experiment
that people just within a short

593
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,198
time were able to really adapt

594
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,433
and live in a world
where everything is upside down

595
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,469
or with like training people

596
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,706
on bikes that work in
a totally different direction. So

597
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,878
sometimes by making things harder,
we're making things easier

598
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:58,382
for our brain
or we're forcing it out of this

599
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,686
minimal potential, well,

600
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:06,524
that it might fall into say, okay,
now there's too much prediction error.

601
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,427
It's time to actually teams because

602
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,830
as we've been talking about like

603
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,933
this minimal

604
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,201
prediction error,

605
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,571
if you're in a stable state
where you've minimized prediction error,

606
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:25,276
that's not always a healthy thing
for brains.

607
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:29,080
And side note,
this is also a model of depression,

608
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,450
basically not having enough prediction
or and your brain falling

609
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,987
into a too stable state,
a low entropy state of your brain.

610
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,690
So increasing prediction
error in many ways can be very important

611
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,194
for our physical health or mental health.

612
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:48,032
And that's something that I personally
try to hack on myself all the time.

613
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,402
I'll do like dark showers
so I can't see anything.

614
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:56,974
I'll try to use my left hand
to to use toothbrushes

615
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,977
and just like very basic
daily activities that you get

616
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:04,782
very used to doing this
put another constraint on yourself

617
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,151
and make it like a fun game.

618
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:12,990
That's also a great way to train
in any type of physical task.

619
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:13,891
Okay.

620
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:20,798
So yeah, we talked a lot about the visual
dominating the proprioceptive, but why?

621
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,400
Why is that so?

622
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,303
There's a paper from 2009 not going.

623
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,572
I don't know how to pronounce that,
you know,

624
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:33,244
but their theory was
that it's around using tools

625
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,148
that in order
for us to be able to use tools,

626
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:42,753
we need to be able to not trust
the proprioceptive sensation

627
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:46,057
as much as the visual perception,
because we don't have data

628
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:49,393
from any proprioceptive data of any tool
that we're using.

629
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:54,031
So that's a very interesting theory.

630
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:57,068
But for my paper,
I think there might be something

631
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,204
actually deeper than that going on.

632
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,506
I think and this might be interesting to

633
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:06,177
figure out a way to test this on animals
that don't really use tools.

634
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,680
But I would expect it to

635
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:13,984
a positive and this might might be
very different to some animals you know

636
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,254
actually smells their smell world is much

637
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,925
more dominant for their hearing

638
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,995
but I think that for this goal
oriented movement

639
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:29,633
where we need to coordinate many body
parts, you know, you're driving a car,

640
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,670
you're just getting out of bed and

641
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,240
and getting dressed or walking.

642
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:42,012
All these things require
lots of body movements, working together.

643
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,915
So in order for that to happen,

644
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:49,153
we really need to reduce
the proprioceptive sensation

645
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:53,958
so we can get this high level goal
to dictate

646
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,329
the lower level hierarchies of the brain

647
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:02,266
to actually pull towards
the active inference.

648
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:07,004
If we had very strong perceptions
of where we are right now,

649
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,007
we wouldn't be able to move into

650
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,309
the next state of where we want to be.

651
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:16,847
So we're taking our brain
is taking this high level goal

652
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:21,452
and breaking it in to movement
predictions.

653
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:26,424
And for those movement predictions
to be able to move your body

654
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:31,328
into where we want it to be
using active inference, we need to weaken

655
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:37,902
where you are currently and have a weaker
now in order to get to the future

656
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,006
of this goal oriented movement.

657
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,742
That's that's sort of how I see it,
at least

658
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,379
a sort of

659
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,714
interesting thing
that I'd like to talk about

660
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,985
is the openness to discussions
and questions at the end is how this

661
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:59,790
connects to flow state and improv
and dance and play and all these things

662
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:06,330
that I am totally infatuated with
and want to spend most my time doing.

663
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:10,201
So flow states for
if people haven't heard

664
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,437
this term before, it's

665
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:17,274
a term that's been coined
when athletes are really anybody

666
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:20,678
that's good at a specific
task is at their peak.

667
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,682
It's been sort of

668
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:28,052
defined as freed from self-consciousness.

669
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:34,558
Now a way to look at it
through the lens of these experiments

670
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:40,130
and these hierarchical levels and
predictive coding and active inference is

671
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,234
that it's basically

672
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:47,605
inhibiting actually these higher level
abstract goals

673
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,774
and letting us get hyper accuracy

674
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,444
within this proprioception modality.

675
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:57,715
So really what we call
being in the now, right,

676
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:02,786
getting incredibly fast feedback loops
that aren't about the end goal.

677
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,223
It's not about if you
I think talk to any of these aspects,

678
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,460
it's not about winning,
it's not about getting to the end.

679
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,162
It's just like this pure joy

680
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,733
about being in the moment and

681
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,671
and letting your body be great.

682
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:25,843
And a lot of this really might have to do
with inhibiting this

683
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:30,714
higher level of our neural hierarchy
so we can get this hyper

684
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,151
accuracy of proprioception,
so we can create these vast

685
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:37,555
feedback loops between our body
and the environment

686
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,158
to get to this
like higher level of performance.

687
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,161
And this takes us to more of

688
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:49,366
like improv, dance and play
that are really non goal oriented.

689
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,602
This is sort of the definition
and how I see, you

690
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:55,606
know, there's a big difference
between games and play games.

691
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,241
There's always like you're winning,

692
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,843
you're going towards a thing
or you're losing.

693
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,480
But in play there's none of that.

694
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,950
There's just exploration.

695
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,485
The same goes really was improv dance
compared

696
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,522
to, I don't know, ballet
or choreographed dance.

697
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:16,627
You're just exploring the possibilities
face of what you can do

698
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,265
and that at least for me
and I think, well,

699
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:24,501
not only for me,
this is quite widespread.

700
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:28,973
Anybody that is into these things
I think finds them the most joyous.

701
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,209
And, you know, kids
find them the most joyous.

702
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:38,349
And it's a very, very healthy part for
our brain to not be in a goal oriented

703
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,018
movement pattern

704
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,688
and to just let go and explore

705
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,424
without having

706
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,394
a high level active inference happening.

707
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:54,465
Active inference is it's still happening,
but it's being sort of driven

708
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:59,637
more by the bottom up signals and really
the momentum moment possibilities

709
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,707
without having this like,
okay, that's going to do

710
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:11,849
let's do like a pretty move,
let's do a pirouette, let's do something.

711
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,216
Yeah.

712
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,617
So I don't think

713
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:17,121
I actually want to show this video right
now, but it's more about focus on VR.

714
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,891
But if you want to look at it,
if the cool video that's called

715
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,527
This is Your Brain on VR that we made

716
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,931
this predicting
the sound and stuff won't work.

717
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:31,869
But it sums up a bit about the
what we've been talking about,

718
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:37,307
how different modalities get expressed
are activated in your brain on VR,

719
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,344
Reprograming, your predictions
and how we can play

720
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:44,181
with these things.

721
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,717
Okay. So yep, that's the thing.

722
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:50,821
That's what that, that's awesome. Wow.

723
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:51,755
I wrote down

724
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,957
a ton of stuff.

725
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,760
So how I ask

726
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,296
some questions
and we'll head into another part.

727
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:00,464
Yeah.

728
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:03,067
Many places to jump in.

729
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:07,638
I really just cut onto this weaker
now like a weaker current moment

730
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:11,775
in order to get further
so that where you connected that

731
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,813
to accessible experiences like the play
in the martial arts, really awesome.

732
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:19,116
So when you talked about active inference
kicking in,

733
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,954
what is happening there
and what did you mean by active inference

734
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:27,124
as far as the way that individual person

735
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:31,895
might relate to it?

736
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,331
And what like domain or give me more.

737
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:35,999
You talked about how you talked

738
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,602
about predictive coding
and how active inference would kick in

739
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,473
or would go into a different mode
depending on whether.

740
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:43,273
Yeah, yeah.

741
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,143
Being a, a high level
or a low level or low level.

742
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,077
Yeah. Exactly.

743
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,480
Like we're always going to be.

744
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,381
I mean, there's always prediction error

745
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:55,586
in our brain rate
depending on what's happening now.

746
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:57,154
Are we going

747
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,923
to minimize it with as with what?

748
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:02,092
There's again,
these three different tactics

749
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,128
that your brain can employ or one,

750
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,297
reducing that sensations

751
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:11,401
to updating your prediction
three, doing an action.

752
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:18,442
So when you're just in this replay,
there's still a need

753
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:23,213
to create a prediction of your movement
pattern for it to actually happen.

754
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:23,814
Right?

755
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:28,118
But it's happening at a much lower level
of your neural hierarchy.

756
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,753
It's not happening.

757
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:34,691
But Cath, there's a high level part
that's saying, Oh, I want to look pretty.

758
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,161
I want to get my teacher to like me.

759
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,630
So I'll do something.

760
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:43,367
It's happening
at the level of the sensation,

761
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,370
at the level of what feels good

762
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,872
from the proprioception, the haptic

763
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,209
that the pure like your body

764
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:54,478
knows what's

765
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,481
joyous to your body, or these lower level

766
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,418
predictions and biases
that your body has about

767
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,988
what is joyous, healthy for your body.

768
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,391
The knowledge is there.

769
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:11,495
There are these lower level biases
that we're allowing our system

770
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,531
to collapse into a state that's being led

771
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:18,735
by these lower level biases.

772
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:22,539
And this goes, I think, like in both
ways, this can go very much into like

773
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,642
your body knows and has biases around

774
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:28,378
what's healthy and fun and feels good.

775
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:32,015
But there's also that's
where trauma is stored, too.

776
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,984
Is that an amazing book?

777
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:37,321
I think it's called The
Your Your Body Remembers and

778
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,657
both emotional and physical trauma

779
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:45,162
really are stored in our low level biases

780
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:51,168
of our prediction
around our movements and our bodies. So

781
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,503
that, too,

782
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:57,908
can be, you know, a big issue for many,
many people that to deal with this

783
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,477
and and being able to

784
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,448
go from a state
where your brain's triggered.

785
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,749
Right. And the mental health

786
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,418
basis is called like when you're
when you've been triggered

787
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:12,155
and these bias negative

788
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:15,158
biases appear
that are predicting options,

789
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:18,328
how it's going to happen,
even though there's

790
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:22,299
no objective reason for that
except your history.

791
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,969
Something's triggered that prediction.

792
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:30,107
So being able to switch into that

793
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,677
place in your brain

794
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,880
that knows what feels good for your body

795
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,518
and what's healthy for
your body is super important,

796
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:45,555
and we don't really know how to do that
in a very reliable way.

797
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:47,991
Yet, you know, there's mindfulness
practices,

798
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:51,161
breathing and stretching and massage.

799
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,731
But I think, like my biggest fear is that

800
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:58,769
we're with technology, we're actually
being pulled away from our body.

801
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,705
And that's generally what I'm trying to

802
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,009
close that gap.

803
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,211
Wow. So any sense.

804
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,513
Thanks for this answer.

805
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:11,715
And it's actually related
to this next question.

806
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:15,986
You talked about how in the avatar
was getting almost like false

807
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,387
perfect feedback.

808
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,423
It didn't improve the actual performance.

809
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,492
So it really highlighted
how the technology can't just

810
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,330
just simply mechanically demonstrate
like a scaffold.

811
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,499
It has to give somehow accurate
feedback, yet

812
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:34,504
it's often fantastical scenarios
or abstract scenarios.

813
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:39,009
So I wondered, what were your thoughts
for technology design?

814
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:43,947
How could technology
be used to actually enable and enable

815
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,450
these kinds of states
that you're getting towards?

816
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,821
Yeah,
without constraining us in that way.

817
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:51,888
Yeah.

818
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,558
So I think that was a
very big learning for me. Right.

819
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:58,395
You need to give a person accurate
feedback

820
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:02,499
of where they are too
and what they are actually doing.

821
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,635
And there

822
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:08,672
again, there might be an ability to

823
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,976
impose to such predict

824
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:17,047
things like you might be able
to still be in a first person perspective

825
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:22,152
with someone doing the movements,
but also either feel with vibrations

826
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,254
like if you train you, that's
what happens.

827
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:28,725
I just used a haptic feedback to tell you
if you're are in the right place,

828
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,794
you'll get a vibration.

829
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:34,231
So I'm strengthening your ability
to know where you actually are.

830
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:38,101
So there's sort of ways
to hack our other seventh

831
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:41,038
modalities was, you know, music

832
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:45,175
really is a bit of like gamification
when you're on the path

833
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,345
of of doing the things

834
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,548
that were you're trying to learn actively

835
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,684
this that, you know, like the dopamine,

836
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:58,655
you know, dopamine at least
within the predictive coding framework,

837
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:02,592
it's really like a precision signal
for for prediction error.

838
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:06,496
So like give some more bling bling bling

839
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,900
with a little bit randomness

840
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,703
when you are doing the things that you're
trying to learn correctly.

841
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:17,240
But you need to get that feedback
of when you're

842
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,178
doing things correctly.

843
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,680
And I think that's what was missing from

844
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,717
so from this experiment was giving

845
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:31,521
and the faster and tighter
these feedback loops are,

846
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:35,592
the more your brain will perceive them
and actually activate them.

847
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:39,963
So there is some really great,
you know, meditation tools

848
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:45,435
that you'll meditate and afterwards
you'll see your heart rate.

849
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:50,240
There's some more professional
like biofeedback rhythms that you can see

850
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,844
what's happening there with ITI or

851
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,747
heart rate in real time.

852
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,784
And that's so actually I talked to before
we started like I'm build

853
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,688
I'm starting my first hardware project
to do that

854
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:10,193
and give real time
biofeedback of heart rate with LEDs

855
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:15,365
you're going to go it's called
wisdom truffle it wisdom truffle dot com.

856
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:19,202
You'll see a trippy truffle
and basically that's

857
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,572
the idea of helping
people reach some of these

858
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,643
tighter feedback loops on a lower level

859
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:30,847
by hacking their their visual modalities
like let's use that.

860
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,284
We figured out, okay,
the visual modality is super strong,

861
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:40,290
can we connect it to other sensations
that we don't have as much insight to it?

862
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,659
Could I connect the visual modality
to heart rate?

863
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,060
Yeah, pretty easy.

864
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,763
Can I connect the visual modality
to perception? Yeah.

865
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:50,700
If you go to MU
when you dance and move your actual

866
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,104
your avatar changes color
and the sparkles change color.

867
00:52:54,437 --> 00:53:01,311
So by hacking the visual modality
that really is like our brains

868
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,348
graphic computer
it's like super strong, it's dominant.

869
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:09,986
Can we use it in different ways
to connect sensations

870
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:15,192
that we don't have as strong
and are not as dominant in us?

871
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,593
That's that's one of the things.

872
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:18,595
Awesome.

873
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:22,499
And that point
you made really about the high level

874
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,835
priors, like both
my eyes are looking at the same thing

875
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,072
and you can kind of play with that
by pushing on one lately.

876
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:29,506
And, you know,

877
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:32,943
it just does distort the image
and it sort of it just demonstrates

878
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:36,079
it's one of those examples
like the high acuity

879
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,182
in the periphery or color vision,
the periphery or the blind spot.

880
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:44,221
One of the examples that help bridge
between, for example,

881
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,690
input output, information processing,

882
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:49,059
understandings of cognitive sciences
versus

883
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,896
this really extended and predictive way
that you're talking about thing.

884
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,931
So it's really awesome
and thanks for making

885
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,100
it really accessible
with this presentation.

886
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,404
So you want to go to the second part
and that one has questions life.

887
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,174
Otherwise I'll just keep on. Very cool.
Thanks, John. Thank you.

888
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:08,311
So okay, we're good at.

889
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,981
Context, context, reset.

890
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:11,915
It's like context.

891
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,850
It's there's a context to it,

892
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:14,751
but we're still staying

893
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,321
within the predictive coding
framework and active inference. But

894
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,292
yeah, I'm going to just give, you know,
I really like this idea

895
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:26,129
of giving visual metaphor based on
all the things that I talked about.

896
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:29,366
I think that's a great way to learn and
and have

897
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,702
this intuitive understanding
both of math.

898
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:36,539
I don't know if you follow the three blue
one brown videos, but they're just

899
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:41,911
phenomenal and mathematical understanding
because it's all visual coded math.

900
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:46,182
But I'm going to give a visual metaphor.

901
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,284
You can

902
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,320
either look at the images
or even close your eyes

903
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,790
and just imagine that when your brain

904
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,960
is creating reality, it's very similar

905
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:02,232
to playing in the sand
with some buckets and making sandcastles.

906
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:07,304
And the sand is just this
constant incoming bottom up signal.

907
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,740
There's so much of it, constant sand
that's flooding

908
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:15,078
into your room, into your space,
and you have these buckets

909
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:19,382
and you're trying to take all the sand
and put them into the bucket

910
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,751
constantly to create this

911
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:23,887
reality, really.

912
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:27,023
And this is
pretty much what your brain is doing, but

913
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,328
at least in the predictive
coding framework,

914
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:35,799
with the buckets being these top down
priors and the sand being the bottom up

915
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,434
and incoming signals.

916
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:44,274
So there's a constant buckets trying
to predict and put the incoming signals

917
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:48,745
into a specific bucket
that then turns off the sand, basically.

918
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:53,016
Now, let's talk a bit
about the classical psychedelics.

919
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:53,850
Psychedelics.

920
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,820
So they're starting to expand to be,
you know,

921
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,289
like basically everything that

922
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,959
classical psychedelics or whatever

923
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:06,529
activate the five to a receptor

924
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,266
agonist just means activating.

925
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:15,572
So what really happens
when we take a classical psychedelic

926
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:19,576
is that these your brain's buckets
are getting broken down

927
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,346
into smaller
and differently shaped buckets.

928
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,483
So your priors are getting broken down.

929
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,985
They're getting diffused into

930
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,890
sort of weaker but more accurate

931
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,293
or more detailed

932
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,597
buckets that let your brain create

933
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:43,800
an actual different reality for itself.

934
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,703
Now, where is it coming from?

935
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,740
When we look at the actual micro
circuit of the brain

936
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:54,110
and this is of the cortical,

937
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,679
you have seven layers of your cortex

938
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,883
and how the neurons
are actually laid out there.

939
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,552
This is a very amazing paper by best that

940
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,056
we can see exactly the feedback loops

941
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,727
that are correlated to predictive coding.

942
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,096
Where are the

943
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,199
where's the data going, upwards of which

944
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:20,403
we see in these forward connections
in purple, it's coming in from layer

945
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:25,675
four, it's going up to layer two
and then looping to layer five.

946
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:29,512
And then where are the backwards
connections that are coming

947
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:34,350
from these higher level brain areas
that are correlated to our predictions?

948
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,852
And we see that in grit

949
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:38,621
coming from layer five,

950
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:43,593
going down to Layer four,
doing these these feedback loops.

951
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:47,030
So when we look at where
the five edge due to a receptor is,

952
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,833
we see that they're situated

953
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:53,336
very specifically on these layer five

954
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,840
on the backwards connections basically.

955
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:01,044
So we're seeing that they're activating,
hyper activating

956
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:05,048
and making the sensitivity
of these neurons

957
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,784
much more sensitive.

958
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:10,520
So that's that's why

959
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,424
the theory is that it's
causing these predictions

960
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:18,661
to fire at a much lower threshold,
if before and let's imagine

961
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,365
a whole neuronal population,
you'd need to get, you know,

962
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:27,570
X amount of neurons resonating together
to create a prediction.

963
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,672
Now you need much less of them.

964
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:33,243
Just a few neurons are like throwing out
their own prediction

965
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,912
and a few other
neurons are throwing out their prediction

966
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,615
and you're
getting many more competing predictions.

967
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:44,087
So the very simple metaphor,
if you're walking down

968
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:49,893
a forest and usual state,
you might have a probability of 0.4%.

969
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:51,961
Oh, I'm going to see some animals

970
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,665
and a 0.6% prediction
of I'm going to see some plants.

971
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,603
But after you've taken psychedelics
and these predictions have decomposed,

972
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:05,174
you're you might get a much more detailed

973
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,444
prediction possibility space.

974
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:09,445
You know,

975
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:13,950
maybe you're going to see a dog, a cat,
hey, maybe you're going to see an elf.

976
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:17,320
That's, you know, a low probability,
but it's suddenly there.

977
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:21,858
So things that were below
the threshold of probability

978
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,794
are now becoming a higher threshold

979
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,997
and part of your predictive
probability space.

980
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:31,534
Now, what really happens here up

981
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:37,440
and what's really sort of important
is how this correlates

982
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,178
with the rest of your bottom
up sensations.

983
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,248
If you are in a very getting

984
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:49,919
very clean bottom up signal,
which almost never happens,

985
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:53,523
but let's imagine
a very clear auditory signal,

986
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:59,362
at least for a moment, or very clear
visual perception that you're getting.

987
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:03,933
Suddenly you can have much
higher accurate predictions.

988
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,136
And this is, you know,
people on psychedelics,

989
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,940
including myself, will report
this quite often like, oh, wow,

990
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,612
I can see footprints in the forest
the way I've never seen them before.

991
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,982
Or this perception of hearing music

992
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:22,619
and like the audio is just so crisp
and so detailed

993
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:26,456
in ways that I don't perceive them
when I'm not on psychedelics.

994
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,393
But if you are in

995
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,530
bottom up environment
where you're getting noisy signals,

996
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,533
it's dark
things that are constantly changing.

997
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,503
There's various sounds

998
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,840
that only the possibilities
and the predictions

999
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,211
that you might be getting
are might not be as correlated

1000
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:51,547
to, you know, quote unquote,
objective reality.

1001
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:56,185
Suddenly,
your predictions can become much stronger

1002
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:59,355
and just or much less

1003
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:00,990
accurate.

1004
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,960
But still,
a type of overfitting might happen.

1005
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:09,532
That's, I think, a good word to use here
where, you know, oh, I'm in this forest.

1006
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:10,600
It's dark and gloomy.

1007
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,701
There's something moving.

1008
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:14,003
Oh, it's an elf, right?

1009
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:17,674
Because that was part of the probability
space of your prediction.

1010
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,810
And with the noisy, bottom
up incoming sensation,

1011
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:23,279
that was enough
to reduce prediction error.

1012
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:28,284
But what's important to note,
and you can see sort of in this

1013
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:32,388
very simple image,
that the decompose predictions

1014
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,758
are all less strong.

1015
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:39,028
So they're not going to turn off
as much prediction error.

1016
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:43,199
So your your brain is going to constantly
be while you're on psychedelics

1017
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,303
and the state that has higher
prediction error, which as we saw

1018
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:50,606
before and we've been talking about
when you have a higher prediction error,

1019
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:54,377
your brain has a few different tactics
that it can use to deal with it.

1020
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:59,182
One, modulating the senses
to updating predictions.

1021
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,484
Three Active inference, right?

1022
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:07,223
So this is why psychedelics offer a very,
very unique opportunity

1023
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:11,461
of updating your model, because there's
a much higher level of prediction error.

1024
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:14,731
And then under some situations,

1025
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,900
your brain might decide
to actually update the model.

1026
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,104
And if people are suffering from trauma
and depression,

1027
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:26,375
we're seeing absolutely amazing results
in research around using psychedelics

1028
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:30,847
to update people biases
around these things.

1029
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:33,316
And again,
very much depending on the setting, don't

1030
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:36,652
expect to take psychedelics
and go to a place

1031
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,789
where you don't feel safe in
and you don't have a support structure.

1032
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:43,593
And to get these benefits
in order to update your model,

1033
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:48,498
you need to be getting bottom up
sensory inputs that are very strong

1034
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,801
and accurate around
what's happening to you right now.

1035
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:56,239
But if you do that
and you are able to feel safe

1036
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:01,778
in your body like we talked before,
be in place situations or improv or flow

1037
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:07,116
that might allow your brain
to really, really heal deep

1038
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:12,655
traumas, to really reprogram deep biases
from childhood when your brain was more

1039
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,992
had this extra neuroplasticity.

1040
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:21,063
So now let's get to active inference.

1041
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:25,468
So the interesting part about these 5c2
receptors

1042
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,605
is that we don't have so many of them
in our motor cortex.

1043
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,440
There's a lot left of them.

1044
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,044
So we can actually see that active
inference

1045
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:39,515
modulates psychedelic experiences
and makes them weaker.

1046
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:44,821
And we see this both in the instructions
that people are given

1047
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:49,959
when they're doing psychedelic therapy
right now.

1048
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,229
Maps, for instance, or other

1049
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,565
universities and hospitals
that are researching this,

1050
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,568
they really tell people,
lie down, don't move.

1051
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:03,139
And when I talked to therapists
about this, they can really say,

1052
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,908
we know when something's
bubbling up with a person.

1053
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,611
We see that in their body
when they're coming too much,

1054
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,680
they start really moving.

1055
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,085
And we try to encourage them to
actually they still because then they

1056
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:21,224
when we start moving, we're actually
weakening the prediction error rate.

1057
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:26,229
Our brain is creating a prediction
that's still pretty stable because we

1058
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:27,363
don't have as many

1059
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:29,765
receptors that

1060
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,134
have been activated or activated

1061
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:36,205
because we took psychedelics
and the motor cortex.

1062
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:42,211
So our motor predictions are able
to modulate this psychedelic experience.

1063
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:47,116
And you know that the benefit of
this is that, oh wow, if you're are doing

1064
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:51,320
and you're feeling really overwhelmed,
move, do a bunch of jumping jacks,

1065
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:54,123
push ups, move around space.

1066
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,894
That's going to really help

1067
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,863
the prediction error in your brain
and help

1068
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,633
you be more back.

1069
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,903
I guess the reality you're used to.

1070
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,539
So yeah, this was a short

1071
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,876
connection between psychedelics

1072
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:17,013
and active inference

1073
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,048
that I just wanted to

1074
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:22,551
bring to the space to oh.

1075
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:25,655
Thank you. Now

1076
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,124
there is so much even that.

1077
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,558
That I could you know.

1078
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:32,662
You can answer that and I'm.

1079
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:34,263
Sure you've

1080
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:36,332
just.

1081
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,835
Perfect and I'll just then
I'll just really crop it.

1082
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:43,005
I guess I'll drop it
while I ask this first question, which is

1083
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:46,442
you point out

1084
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,845
that a lot of the even the clinical work
on psychedelics is done in a way

1085
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:55,184
where they actually prevent movement
and also like education, saying like.

1086
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:57,219
I say, prevent that, don't encourage it.
Yeah.

1087
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,654
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

1088
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,856
Totally
like putting people on the street.

1089
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:05,361
But it's, it's, it's on a continuum
with an authority as a restraint.

1090
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,463
And so just yeah, yeah.

1091
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:12,668
What is maybe the role of the body
in remote work or in

1092
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:16,605
now that we're also in again
not physically

1093
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:19,709
restrained to our chairs yet,
but it feels like that some days.

1094
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:24,080
It's a disaster. It's

1095
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:26,649
yeah I think we're

1096
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:31,420
and I'm a total motor chauvinist
when it comes to our brain.

1097
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,623
I don't know if you've heard that term
before, but no, explain that.

1098
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:35,591
Yeah.

1099
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:40,529
So basically we have a brain
in cognitive functions because we move,

1100
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:46,002
you know, when you look at the animal
at the at the designation between trees

1101
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:50,039
to algae to creatures and the crazy ocean

1102
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:53,976
to animals that move, when do you start
getting brains is when they move.

1103
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:57,847
And there's a great example
of some really insane sea

1104
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,850
creature
that moves around and has a brain.

1105
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,820
Then it finds a place to plop itself down
and digest its own brain.

1106
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:06,655
So wants.

1107
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:08,991
Yeah, it doesn't need it.

1108
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:13,763
Our our brain is needed to create
predictions with the environment.

1109
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:17,066
Right.
This is the whole predictive coding.

1110
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:20,936
And Andy Clarke has a beautiful book
and papers about

1111
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,740
about the feedback loops that we create
within with the environment.

1112
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:28,411
And if our environment
is relatively highly predictable

1113
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,547
because we're staying in the same place,
then guess what?

1114
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:34,683
We don't we we don't need this.

1115
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:40,322
And we and us as humans and Andy
Clarke also goes into that quite a lot.

1116
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:45,461
We sort of because we won out minimize
prediction error that's that's part of

1117
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:48,464
this whole free energy thing in our brain

1118
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,667
but we've done it a bit too well.

1119
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,303
You know, we've created these

1120
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:58,007
large scale active
inference cells with our environment

1121
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:01,043
shaping our supermarkets, looking the

1122
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:04,380
same, the roads to our house.

1123
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,316
And I think that's

1124
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:12,221
a really a big cause of generally
the mental health crisis

1125
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,458
that we're seeing
and especially when it comes to

1126
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:19,061
then not even moving your body,
being in the same state,

1127
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:26,402
another physiological state
that's too low entropy.

1128
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:30,673
And that's really, really
I think I'm going to even go to the

1129
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:34,577
of sentencing
like my main goal in my in my work

1130
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,981
is that one metric improve

1131
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:44,887
the amount of states
your body is for humans.

1132
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,490
If I do that then

1133
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:51,026
for, you know, modern

1134
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,865
citizens that have a total lack of this,
I am absolutely certain

1135
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,868
that we're going to see improvement
on many metrics

1136
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,337
that we're lacking.

1137
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:04,840
So when it comes

1138
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,576
right, try as much as I can to like

1139
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:11,213
not fall into this like

1140
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:13,482
I've been working remotely for

1141
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,852
even before this crazy
COVID thing happened. But,

1142
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:18,187
you know,

1143
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:22,158
do calls while you're walking outside
or stretching outside,

1144
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,095
anything that doesn't require you
to be in front of it, to the screen.

1145
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,797
Yeah. Spring or is yeah.

1146
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,935
Create like we do have the ability
to gamify and bring toys

1147
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:38,174
into our environment like you have rings
outside and punching bags and

1148
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:44,013
any anything that will create
constraints around your movements.

1149
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,916
You'll move desk, change your table,

1150
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,152
don't work from the same space
if you possibly can.

1151
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:53,389
Just keep bringing in that prediction or

1152
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:56,859
both into your body and

1153
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,294
and I think that's a very

1154
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:01,830
like incorrect way
that ergonomics is looked at.

1155
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,501
You know, ergonomics is all about
like let's find the perfect for this.

1156
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,736
Know for you to be in for many hours.

1157
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:08,904
That doesn't exist.

1158
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,840
We're not supposed to be
in a perfect position.

1159
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,510
It's going like this.

1160
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,147
Well, it's it's really
it's like a modern mental ergonomics.

1161
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:23,018
And it's the ergo the work,
the dynamics of a dynamical system.

1162
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:23,552
That's us.

1163
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:27,856
And so the ergonomics is now the back
angle for the chair, but then there's

1164
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,926
actually a ratio of the chair
and the exercise ball or whatever.

1165
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:31,594
That's not my.

1166
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:34,563
Specialty,
but it's all about taking those ratios

1167
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:39,602
because whatever is
there is no such thing as as the

1168
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:43,405
the perfect sitting state
or not moving state for.

1169
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:48,911
Your body, you know, lying down
too much gives us pressure on problems

1170
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:53,849
and people in hospital need to be turned
around to not get things.

1171
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:56,719
We are a dynamic physiological system

1172
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:01,023
and I think there's a very big gap
between

1173
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:05,361
people that are studying these systems
a lot of the times.

1174
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:10,399
And like most people and computer science
people that are just really not

1175
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,703
spending enough time
connecting to their own bodies.

1176
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:18,707
So I think, like,
I highly encourage everyone to like

1177
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:23,679
just find the time to figure out
what you are as a full human being

1178
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:28,484
is like blood and
blood pressure bones, tendons

1179
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:30,152
and be

1180
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:33,889
in that
space and let that those prediction

1181
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:37,926
take precedence
at least a little bit of your day.

1182
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:43,065
You know, one thing you mentioned
is this like top down,

1183
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:46,201
almost standardization
and synchronization

1184
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,871
and stabilization
of the lower level states.

1185
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:52,741
And then the two affordances we have kind

1186
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:56,912
of like our physical movement
and our communication, and we've seen how

1187
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:01,550
those are subject to top down
as well as bottom up constraints.

1188
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:05,087
But that is kind of what's being remapped

1189
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,823
is the constraints on our movement

1190
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:12,328
variously in our communications
networks, variously.

1191
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:16,165
And so to have a multi-scale framework
like active inference

1192
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,500
or we can talk about the remote team

1193
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,404
having input and output
and then the body, we can be like, Here's

1194
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:26,175
an algorithm that's awesome
for this sector, for this team,

1195
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:31,080
but I want to be not reinforcement
learning driven or not reward driven.

1196
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,682
I want to have a framework
that allows me to express

1197
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:37,052
these kinds of playful states
or even have a rationale

1198
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:42,124
to construct these states and design for.

1199
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:47,162
Yeah, so I think there's that was a lot,
a lot of good point you brought up.

1200
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:51,200
So maybe first
the communication thing, right,

1201
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:56,505
we're doing this, this 2D,
sometimes only voice, sometimes

1202
01:12:56,505 --> 01:13:00,476
2D screens that none of this
is naturalistic for our brains.

1203
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:01,910
Right? We're 3D creatures.

1204
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:06,014
We pick up social cues from being able
to gaze into each other's eyes, predict

1205
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,249
where you're looking at

1206
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,619
and take, and it gets worse.

1207
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,289
Number of people you bring in just

1208
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:17,526
I like group zooms for me art for sure

1209
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:22,431
there's so much awkward silence,
so much inefficiency.

1210
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,366
Who's next?

1211
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:27,703
What is the level of even
when we're in a normal social group?

1212
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:28,404
You know, I

1213
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:32,374
usually put little numbers around people
how much I think they understood me.

1214
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:32,708
Okay.

1215
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:37,246
This person understood 70%, 30%, zero.

1216
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,714
And I do the same for myself.

1217
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,649
And I try to be very honest
with people I like.

1218
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:42,985
I understand around 30% of what
you just said,

1219
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,388
and that's how we are.

1220
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:49,591
Like, we have different data

1221
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:54,196
internally and managing to like minimize
the differences in these

1222
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,433
data structures is a very difficult task,

1223
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:02,137
even when you're not working in remote
and remote work is definitely made that

1224
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,672
a lot more difficult.

1225
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:08,644
I tried to use things like VR

1226
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:12,581
and found it sometimes okay,

1227
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:17,286
but also it's an I'm a superb your,
you know, enthusiastic person

1228
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,522
and still spending more than 15 minutes
in there.

1229
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,158
And a period of time is just too much.

1230
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:29,531
It's heavy, it's clunky,
it's a close point of view.

1231
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,600
So that's that's a difficult thing.

1232
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,003
But we do try what we do tried to do
a lot of the time is create

1233
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:39,942
mockups directly in VR
and share this the mockups in VR.

1234
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:43,245
So we understand what
we're trying to build together

1235
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:47,349
from this 3D perspective.

1236
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:50,919
Generally, I'm me, you.

1237
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:54,323
We have like an air app or I'm
trying to create interactive holograms.

1238
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,993
So more on the social connection
instead of just

1239
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:04,867
getting you on like a 2D screen
or the Facebook and Instagram.

1240
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:07,870
But getting something
that moves in my face

1241
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,006
and actually interacts with me
like you can blow kisses.

1242
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,341
I don't know if you ever seen the Roger

1243
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:16,211
Rabbit movie,
but I realize I think I got it.

1244
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,814
Like I started it when I was a kid.
And then I built this thing.

1245
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:19,781
I saw the movie again

1246
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:22,851
and I was like, Oh, well,
I just thought the Roger Rabbit thing.

1247
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,120
Notices through the screen or. Something.

1248
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,156
You blow kisses
and it goes into your 3D space

1249
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:29,892
in air space,

1250
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:33,929
so you can actually move around
your space and cast the person's kisses.

1251
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:37,065
So I'm really excited
about the possibility of creating

1252
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:41,770
what's called joint action
and cognitive neuroscience remotely.

1253
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:46,508
And joint action is a physiological thing
more than anything

1254
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,811
like if they even shake your hand
or just passing you,

1255
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:53,048
that pen is when I start predicting you

1256
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:57,252
and starting to predict you
is starting to build empathy with you.

1257
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,923
So these empathy things really

1258
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:06,094
are naturalistically based
on very low level physiological data

1259
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:10,098
and without this because we're currently
constantly on zoom

1260
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,502
and you know, I,
I click here to send you a button

1261
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,939
to send you a chat or I raise my hand
by clicking a thing and.

1262
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:20,275
You see a thing over there,
it's much, much weaker

1263
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:24,813
and not really
creating of these joint actions.

1264
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,750
So I think there's a
to explore with technology

1265
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,553
was just joint actions and

1266
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:37,359
team building activities that are in VR
even if for a short period of time

1267
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:42,030
and just simple things
like let's go lock together

1268
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:46,468
or things that you would do
in physical space

1269
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:51,373
if you could be together
to just understand a bit more on this low

1270
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:55,310
level prediction of who a person is,
how they move.

1271
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:58,680
Now, we are very
so you can like mess things up.

1272
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,684
I don't know if you've ever been
in VR chat, but you can interact with

1273
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:07,623
someone as like,
Oh, I know a three meter giant

1274
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:12,694
with fire wings and I'm a tiny pixie
and you're just interacting this way.

1275
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,231
So I think that's really interesting

1276
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:20,469
and I actually can be
a very interesting way versus

1277
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:24,473
biasing things like,
Oh, what happens if we conduct interviews

1278
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,543
that are not like,
we know, we know there's a huge bias

1279
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:32,180
in the whole hiring system

1280
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,350
and building teams to begin with
that is not solve.

1281
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:38,387
There's like, okay, you do

1282
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,822
and you know, you don't even.

1283
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:41,990
Right. Sometimes h.r.

1284
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,259
Doesn't look at the names
and there's all these things

1285
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:45,794
to try to hide who the person.

1286
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:48,497
But the moment there's interviews,
you know who the person is

1287
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:52,034
and these racial biases come
in, these gender biases come in.

1288
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:55,904
So there's a lot
of really interesting ways that we be

1289
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:58,340
biasing ourselves by

1290
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,677
just, again, this excessive

1291
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:06,682
prediction error and and the ability
to really detach ourselves

1292
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:12,788
from the normal perception that we have.

1293
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:16,425
But that's really interesting
about the physical components of remote,

1294
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:20,228
whether it's a physical object
that's going to be moving

1295
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:23,999
and I don't know, like a, you know,
little jellyfish that does a movement

1296
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,600
or just synchronizing.

1297
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,004
And it made me wonder
if there was like an exercise,

1298
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:33,175
like could people just say,
okay, beginning of this video?

1299
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:33,542
Yeah,

1300
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:37,746
maybe we all just switch over a context
like let's do, you know, three claps

1301
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:41,950
and take a deep breath and just do it
and think of a, you know, purple cow and.

1302
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,652
Then just coordinate that way

1303
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:46,321
and then prepare or here's our narrative,
here's what we're here to do.

1304
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:50,992
Because that kind of stuff, the mission
which comes back to your earlier idea

1305
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:54,996
about like giving the information
in the way that's naturalistic

1306
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,032
and what is the natural unit.

1307
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,301
It's kind of a the goal, the end.

1308
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,971
And so having the group assemble
with the synchronization and and also

1309
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:07,175
a remembrance of the end is like really
an interesting implication,

1310
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:11,113
I think, of active inference,
but not some of these other subcomponent

1311
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:12,114
theories per.

1312
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:15,383
SE Yeah, and so that's our so what

1313
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:18,420
I am trying to do with this hardware is
let people synchronize their heartbeats.

1314
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,256
Let me you're over there. I'm over here.

1315
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:25,393
Let Me send you
my heart beat a beautiful glowing pulses

1316
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:30,866
and you can send me your heartbeat
and get this biophysical data

1317
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:34,669
that honestly if we were even in the same
room together, I wouldn't necessarily

1318
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:36,705
get unless
I was like touching you. Right?

1319
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,975
So I think we are
and this is the exciting part

1320
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:42,077
of like immersive
and embodied technology.

1321
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:45,614
Like we are getting to the stage
where we can start

1322
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:51,119
moving
beyond 2D video into biophysical data

1323
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,890
that lets us get a deeper understanding
and deeper connection and deeper

1324
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:59,694
synchronization with each other.

1325
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:03,131
Well,
I'm happy to talk for a little bit longer

1326
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:06,802
if you want, but I guess my closing
thought or at least correction,

1327
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,971
because maybe we'll see
or hear from you again would be like,

1328
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:13,642
what are the next steps
for applied active inference?

1329
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:18,713
Or for an individual who's curious
about these kinds of topics?

1330
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:22,150
Is there like a website
or is there a research direction?

1331
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:27,689
Where is active inference coming into
play in the next months, two years?

1332
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:27,956
Yeah.

1333
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:32,127
So honestly,
before I heard about your podcast,

1334
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:36,865
I've never heard about any stats
like focus within the predictive

1335
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:38,099
coding framework.

1336
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:40,936
I would be very excited about

1337
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:45,307
connecting and this is something I've,
I've been trying to do

1338
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:49,211
is bring movers into the it seems that
there's two different worlds.

1339
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,080
There is rumors that heat technology

1340
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:55,784
because they feel it's
taking them away from their bodies

1341
01:20:57,252 --> 01:21:00,422
and there's there's
technology and science

1342
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:04,292
and there's a very unfortunately,
very small overlap between them.

1343
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:07,529
And that's what you know,
I was very lucky I found a co-founder

1344
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:11,166
who's in both of these worlds.

1345
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:15,570
But if there was a way to bridge this gap

1346
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:19,875
and like you're saying, these, you know,
movement exercises, it's a thing

1347
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:25,847
that we do constantly and improv classes,
building physiological synchronization.

1348
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:29,517
And the things you'll see there
sometimes are just like, this is one

1349
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:32,621
organism,
you know, like people moving together,

1350
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,090
not pre-decided.

1351
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:40,061
And there's a beautiful research paper,
I think.

1352
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,329
Noy It's from,

1353
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,832
from Israel.

1354
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:48,003
There is not a faculty
I can link, link to it afterwards.

1355
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,106
But what they did is

1356
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:55,810
they tried to figure out what's going on
in the brains of

1357
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,947
improvisers

1358
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:02,584
and have a beautiful
like mathematical paper

1359
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:06,021
about the double feedback loop
that's created.

1360
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:10,258
So it's not and they tested
two conditions leader versus follower.

1361
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,094
That was more what I was testing versus

1362
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,464
there is no leader and follower.

1363
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:20,602
You're doing things together
and they found a much higher degree

1364
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:24,439
of synchronization and a very
they built a very cool paradigm

1365
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,609
of just like moving your hand
on one up and down.

1366
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,143
That's it.

1367
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:31,479
Very easy to measure,
but it was there, the data was there.

1368
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:35,283
They managed to find a much higher degree
of synchronization

1369
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:38,453
when there was no
leader and follower between

1370
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:43,091
improvisers
that were either musical improvisers

1371
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:48,196
or dancers and trained their brain
to tune in to the other person

1372
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:50,999
because when you're doing this
and this is a very

1373
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:56,504
you know, when you're talking about teams
and synchronizing and and play,

1374
01:22:56,938 --> 01:23:00,241
I think we really need a shift

1375
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:02,944
in the hierarchical structure of teams

1376
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:07,182
like I don't see
and this is something that I'm

1377
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:10,652
really exploring a CEO of a startup.

1378
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:13,922
How do I get these ideas
that I want out there?

1379
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:18,626
But how do I bring in people's ideas
so they feel that they're part of this?

1380
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:21,796
And how do we then get a cohesive

1381
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,800
product at the end of it?

1382
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,370
Not none of
these are like easy questions,

1383
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,973
but having this ability to

1384
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,075
double feedback.

1385
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:39,147
So it's not just a top down manager
that's saying, Oh, this and this

1386
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:39,614
and this.

1387
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:43,018
You guys understand this
and this and this, this is my vision.

1388
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:46,588
Don't Expect people
to be excited about your vision.

1389
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,290
Hey, that's not how these things work.

1390
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,726
If you want them to be excited
and attuned,

1391
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,497
you need as a manager
in this hierarchical structure,

1392
01:23:55,797 --> 01:24:00,168
be attuned to their visions,
what they're seeing, their perspective.

1393
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:05,507
Why did they join this project
and try to get that coordinated

1394
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:09,978
into a global vision that is,

1395
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:14,382
you know, doesn't break apart
because there's too many voices.

1396
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,886
So none this is easy.

1397
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:23,091
But I think that a lot of the times, yes,
going to the low level physiology

1398
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:27,095
first and building this low level
physical trust with each other

1399
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:30,465
and understanding with each other

1400
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:31,399
is really unique.

1401
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,735
Like me and my co-founder,
we dance together.

1402
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,437
We climb on trees together.

1403
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,138
Before he moved to Hawaii.

1404
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:40,141
Now we try to hang out in VR
and do things together, but

1405
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:43,311
it's really not the same.

1406
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,814
So figuring out

1407
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:49,451
how to do these joint physical actions
together, I think will really

1408
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:54,489
get us into the future
somehow or a future I want to be part of.

1409
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:56,991
Yeah, nice or unlikely future.

1410
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:59,694
One that I expected. When I. Saw it.

1411
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:00,628
Yeah.

1412
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:05,834
But on that tech and movers
and sort of the transdisciplinary nature

1413
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:08,636
and the potentially
productive conversation,

1414
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:10,305
we kind of

1415
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,974
think about these guestrooms
like it's too directional

1416
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:17,512
because maybe for those with a physics
background or a philosophy background,

1417
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:20,315
you've inspired them to think
about how they're

1418
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,251
doing their physical activities
or wanting to go deeper

1419
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:25,954
into a knowledge or movement tradition
they were already a part of.

1420
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,857
And then people
who that's their daily life.

1421
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:31,826
And then maybe this is the first time
they're hearing about active inference.

1422
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,996
So we can always do like event

1423
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:40,201
series or discussions or working groups
or events like that

1424
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:45,707
or projects like that
to help make that two lane freeway

1425
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:50,011
accessible for everybody and respect
both directions of the interchange.

1426
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:53,047
And it's a really important part,
like you said, with the moving away

1427
01:25:53,047 --> 01:25:55,250
from the hierarchy of disciplines,

1428
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,585
you know, it's physics,
the top dog discipline.

1429
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,288
Physics is awesome, but it's actually a.

1430
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:05,894
Really I survived project of the earth
and physics that was dramatic.

1431
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:06,261
Yeah.

1432
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:08,496
It's great.

1433
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:08,796
And then

1434
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:10,231
different
people will be drawn to different parts

1435
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:12,600
and that will be sort of
like the colony phenotype.

1436
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:17,739
And when we
when we constrain with a lower level,

1437
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:22,443
looks like we increasingly infringe
on what the higher level can be as well.

1438
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:24,179
So it's about that balance.

1439
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:27,916
And so that's a common theme
with these active inference discussions

1440
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,286
of, well, yeah,

1441
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:34,022
this is awesome,
I really appreciate this conversation.

1442
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,823
And it was a, I'm sure

1443
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:38,893
something that a lot of us will be
listen to and think about.

1444
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:43,998
So we hope to maybe interact with you
or other communities in the future.

1445
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:45,333
But this is great fun.

1446
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,068
So thanks a lot so much.

1447
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:52,707
Peace!
