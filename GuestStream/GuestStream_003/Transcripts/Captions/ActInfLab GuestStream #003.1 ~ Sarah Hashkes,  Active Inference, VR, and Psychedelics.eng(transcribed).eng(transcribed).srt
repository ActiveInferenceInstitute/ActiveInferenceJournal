1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,559
hello and welcome to the active

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,519
inference lab

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,400
this is active inference guest stream

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
number 3.1

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
and we're really excited to be here

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840
today with sarah haskis

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
we are going to be talking about as the

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,519
title slide suggests

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,640
active inference vr and psychedelics so

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,960
sarah i'll leave it to you to just

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,679
introduce

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,320
the topic yourself and the ideas however

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,280
you want

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,640
and it sounds like we're going to be

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,559
having a first section of the

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,440
presentation

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
then a question and answer and then a

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,360
second section of the presentation and

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,719
then we're going to have a second

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,840
overall discussion

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,920
so with that kind of structure in mind

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,440
just uh introduce yourself

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,559
and please take it away hi everyone

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,719
so yeah we're going to be talking first

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,600
about

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
my research in vr inactive in france and

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,640
then

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,719
my research in psychedelics and how it

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,719
relates to a few issues about

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,360
active inference and we'll have a short

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,040
break in the middle of our questions

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,200
so uh yeah my name is sarah hashquist

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,760
i have a master's degree in cognitive

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,040
neuroscience

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,920
i opened the first vr lab in the motor

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,040
control department

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,040
at radboud um where i was researching

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,920
vr's effects on our brain body

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
connection within the predictive coding

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,880
framework

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,759
i am now ceo of radix motion we're a

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,240
startup that combines neuroscience and

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,840
immersive technology

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,479
and uh we're focusing on empowering the

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,000
psychedelic ecosystem

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,200
with embodied tech so yeah let's get

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
right to it

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
a lot of this is uh basically all of

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,680
this lectures

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,159
based on my research from academia it

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,759
was pretty nice to go back

52
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,560
and and reread all the things uh from

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
2017

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,560
but uh before i actually get into it i'd

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,360
like to

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,640
activate our active and friends and

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,000
a very short interactive experience so

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
wherever you are especially if you've

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,440
been sitting a lot i actually suggest

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,878
you stand up

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,800
um and hopefully you can see my hand on

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,440
the screen

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,000
and i'm gonna ask you to put your hand

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,440
in front of my screen

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,160
and just follow it for a few minutes

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,560
moments

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
how about do it with your mouse move

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,879
your mouse yes

69
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,200
okay we can do that too if you can see

70
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
the oh you oh i see you're not seeing my

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
face in this okay

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,920
yeah so follow the mouse uh for a few

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,120
seconds

74
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,239
uh and see if you can track this

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,160
so what just happened here so okay

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
i gave you a auditory

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
um instruction that hit your brain

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,319
and created a goal a top-down prediction

79
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,000
um that you were supposed to well you

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
didn't see my hand using my mouse

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,120
but uh basically that prediction was

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
that the position of your hand

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,440
to the mouth should be the same position

84
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,680
the difference should be zero

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,720
um now uh

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
your eyes were then giving you bottom up

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
sensory input

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,280
um that were telling you oh there's this

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
difference between

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,760
the mouse and the hand and

91
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,080
due to active inference wanting to

92
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
minimize this prediction error

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
your hand was moved towards the mouse so

94
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,200
this is a very simple example

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,239
of active inference and this follow me

96
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,519
um instruction and activity

97
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,040
is really quite basic for how we learn

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,360
motor skills as children and you can see

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,799
this in the way

100
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,239
kids play games if it's simon says

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,480
or you know patty cake and the way

102
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,440
children's

103
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,080
look to their adult figures to actually

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
copy them

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
and learn movement patterns and

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,200
just follow me example was part of the

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,720
research i was doing so

108
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,239
we'll get into that so

109
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,439
what exactly was i trying to do well

110
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,239
i was really hoping that if i could

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,120
receive

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,399
visual cues from inside of a body

113
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,440
of a professional mover i would be able

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,238
to

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,479
activate this active inference ability

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,360
of my brain

117
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,240
and actually improve my movements i have

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,960
a

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
background in martial arts and dance but

120
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
i'm actually

121
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,560
from childhood a very clumsy human that

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,040
took me really really i guess a lot

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,960
longer to learn motor skills and i was

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,040
looking for a way to hack this

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
and i kept dreaming oh if i could just

126
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,840
be inside the body of my martial arts

127
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,720
teacher

128
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
would i be able to punch like him would

129
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,840
my body learn to adapt and move faster

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
and more accurately

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
because i wouldn't be receiving this

132
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,120
prediction

133
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,360
that i am actually him so um

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
this is sort of where i started uh um

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,400
exploring how i could research this

136
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960
now why would i even think it's possible

137
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
using vr

138
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,039
so part of the things about vr is that

139
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,160
it doesn't

140
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
just activate your visual sensation

141
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,840
uh and sensory input it's actually a

142
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,039
multimodal

143
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,360
integration between your visual

144
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,400
perception

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,199
and your proprioceptive auditory and

146
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,479
even haptic if you're

147
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,800
currently using uh like haptic

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,759
controllers

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,000
um in my experiment i this was like we

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
were using the sdk one of oculus

151
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,720
no haptic controllers i was connecting

152
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,759
them to

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,240
lab equipment to get positions of the

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,199
hands

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
um but we were still connecting visual

156
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
and proprioceptive sensations

157
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
meaning basically when you move your

158
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,479
neck around the world

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,639
is still moving the way you're expecting

160
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,919
it to move

161
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,800
so you're getting the same uh upper body

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,120
and neck activations of muscles of where

163
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,600
you are

164
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,479
in space along with your visual

165
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,000
perception and that activates

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
these higher brain areas and really uh

167
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
gives you this what we call the sense of

168
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
immerse immersiveness right immersion

169
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,199
you're in that place your brain believes

170
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,039
it's real even though you know parts of

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,880
you know that it's not

172
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,160
now vr really gives us a very unique

173
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
ability to influence the brain because

174
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,759
we can start controlling the

175
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,720
relationship

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,199
between the different senses in ways

177
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,319
that either fit

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,680
these previous top-down biases or don't

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,080
so we can uh this will really modulate

180
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
the amount of prediction error

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,720
that we're receiving and activating in a

182
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,319
person's brain

183
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
um and there's uh really a lot of

184
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,520
experiments out there that's

185
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,599
that have been done for instance with

186
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,199
anorexia patients

187
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,680
and people uh with pain issues that

188
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,199
really prove that

189
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
we can give a new sense of self

190
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,680
um to a person so when i talk about a

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,000
sense

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
of self what am i talking about from the

193
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
predictive coding perspective

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,039
it's the really really uh um great

195
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,479
uh paper by absentes curious

196
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,280
um that really i go about explaining

197
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,080
this concept

198
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,199
of minimal self being

199
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,240
the top-down prediction that just

200
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,960
explains the sensory correlations

201
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
between the different senses

202
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
and a great example is the rubber hand

203
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,639
experiment

204
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,680
so um if you don't know this

205
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,479
a hand is your hand is actually hidden

206
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,199
from you like

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,840
in the photo but it's receiving sensory

208
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,639
input

209
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,400
uh at the same frequency that you're

210
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,160
seeing a rubber hand

211
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,960
being simul stimulated now uh

212
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,479
researchers are a bit cruel with this

213
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,160
experiment they at some point take a

214
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,400
hammer and smash the rubber hand

215
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,039
and you can really see um and register

216
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,599
and record the physiological

217
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,440
measurements from the person and how

218
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,039
that person gets stressed

219
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,960
now neural research is actually showing

220
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
that this isn't

221
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,360
um the same for everybody there's some

222
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,840
people

223
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
that seem to be more susceptible to this

224
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,680
versus others that don't there's some

225
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,520
amount of suggestibility

226
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
and i guess maybe strength of what is

227
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,840
your own self

228
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
versus how mutable this top-down

229
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,280
prediction is

230
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,000
um in society might be actually quite

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
different and we'll talk about that

232
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,240
later

233
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
but generally this there is a very

234
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,919
strong ability for us to change our

235
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
sense of minimal self and we do this all

236
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,000
the time when we were closing

237
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,799
our predictive abilities uh become able

238
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,360
to just predict away the sensation

239
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,880
um unless you know you're somewhere on

240
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,360
their autistic spectrum and then

241
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
every little itch and and sock can drive

242
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,760
you crazy

243
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,200
um but also using tools uh

244
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,360
these abilities really extend what we

245
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
call our minimal self

246
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,880
so i was hoping that uh with vr

247
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,360
i'd be able to transfer myself from a

248
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,800
clumsy person

249
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,680
uh into somebody that can do movements

250
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
that are

251
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
much much more difficult and a much

252
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,399
faster time um

253
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,839
so um what did i actually do i needed to

254
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,040
find a task

255
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
that was known to be a hard task that i

256
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,560
could measure

257
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,560
right what is the difference here so i

258
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,000
went with a path that's called

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,959
bimanual interference so bimanual

260
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,080
interference

261
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
uh is basically our inability

262
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
to create different movements with

263
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,440
different hands

264
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,160
um and get an actual interference

265
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,600
pattern between them

266
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,160
um a very simple game which is what i

267
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,399
coded in my experiment is tray

268
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
to make a circle in one hand and a

269
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,000
square with the other

270
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,200
right and just to try for a second

271
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,399
and what basically happens uh

272
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,040
is that you're you go between phases of

273
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,720
making circular movement

274
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,839
and phases of making square movement

275
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,839
so uh i set out to look at this task and

276
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,160
see

277
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,720
can i improve this task in people with

278
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,000
various vr

279
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
interventions so um

280
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
oops i don't know why this is finding

281
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
here but okay

282
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
so let's look at a little bit of the

283
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,640
experimental design exactly

284
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
of all the different things that i was

285
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,480
doing and i'm not going to go into

286
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,399
exactly all the analysis you can read

287
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
the paper because i want to talk more

288
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,360
about like um

289
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,399
the actual discussions and you know

290
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
what are the ideas that come from this

291
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,600
that we can implement

292
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,480
in our daily lives um but there were

293
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,279
basically

294
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,320
uh a few different conditions one

295
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,519
condition was

296
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,760
a follow me condition similar to what we

297
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
did at the beginning

298
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,440
of this lecture where you had an avatar

299
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,079
that was able to do these movements and

300
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,040
your instructor to follow the avatar

301
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,320
the other instruction was complete the

302
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,440
movements yourself

303
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
so there's a self um experiment

304
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
and there's a follow experiment now on

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,720
the follow experiment

306
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
we were actually uh discovered that we

307
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,399
needed to hide

308
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,720
the square and circle because the the

309
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,079
minute people were

310
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,320
uh already predicting that we're doing a

311
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
square and circle

312
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,480
they were not following as much so

313
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
when you were following you are doing

314
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
random follow movements

315
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,720
uh along with periodic small parts of

316
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,120
circles and squares which i then analyze

317
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
specifically

318
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,600
those parts um so that was one

319
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,120
just like i'm going to say sort of base

320
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
like baseline condition to see what is

321
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
the difference between

322
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,040
following someone versus doing uh these

323
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
movements yourself

324
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,320
and um the second line that you can see

325
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
on this design experiment

326
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,519
um was a bit of

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
making things um stranger with what we

328
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,639
can do as we are

329
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,680
so the second uh condition when you

330
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,600
moved your right hand you actually saw

331
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,040
your left hand move

332
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,200
now there's no way i can recreate this

333
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
for you without putting you inside of vr

334
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
it's a very trippy experience

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
everybody's like wait

336
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
what you're like moving your right hand

337
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,639
but your left hand

338
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,079
um is is moving uh and that really like

339
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,360
messes up uh your predictions now

340
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
the third experiment i put you inside of

341
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,240
the avatar that was able to do these

342
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,120
movements

343
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,839
and then told you follow the movements

344
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,560
or just

345
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
become this avatar and follow the

346
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,480
movements from within this avatar

347
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,240
so we actually manipulated uh two things

348
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
one is the high level task goal right

349
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,639
follow versus move yourself now

350
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,440
we assume that the self movement has a

351
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,279
very strong hyper prior

352
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,000
of allowing only one task this is

353
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,800
something that

354
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,320
um you know we're sort of um

355
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,880
meant to be doing naturalistically one

356
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,720
task at every given time we also have

357
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,279
this basal ganglia that's really

358
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,639
blocking more than one activation of

359
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,079
um a physiological uh motor

360
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,040
activity so that was one thing we

361
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
manipulated follow versus

362
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
um but there's do yourself and the

363
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,839
second manipulation was of the visual

364
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,040
feedback right

365
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,360
do you see your own hands moving do you

366
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,079
see your weird cross hands moving

367
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,360
or do you see an avatar's hands

368
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,839
moving from the perspective of your own

369
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,839
hands

370
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,320
um now um there's

371
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,560
again this the difference here when i

372
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,360
crossed

373
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,839
your hands really giving you lots of

374
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,800
prediction error

375
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,399
this is a prediction error that doesn't

376
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,600
fit the normal minimal self

377
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,240
activation and predictions that you have

378
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
versus when i'm putting you inside of an

379
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,279
avatar

380
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,760
that's uh moving in the same way that

381
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,199
you are trying to move

382
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,279
i'm actually not doing something that's

383
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,639
against

384
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,760
this minimal self um prediction and

385
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,120
we'll see how these things

386
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,120
um gave different results so

387
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
let's go with the uh start with the

388
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
first thing that i was you know

389
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,320
most hoping to get oh i'll just plop

390
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,480
myself into an avatar that can do these

391
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,880
movements and i'll be able to do them

392
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,600
well that didn't work in fact we got uh

393
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,720
the exact

394
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,680
opposite so when i say this increase the

395
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,720
interference

396
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,959
it means that the people were less able

397
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,360
to perform this difficult task

398
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,880
um they were having even more uh

399
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,600
periods of both hands doing the same

400
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,079
thing

401
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,440
either circle or square and not able to

402
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,240
differentiate

403
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,920
uh each of them so um

404
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,560
what actually likely happened here right

405
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,720
and and this is sort of a theory because

406
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
um i was not looking at neural

407
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,079
correlates i was just looking at

408
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,600
behavioral data

409
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,720
but um there is a general consensus

410
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,680
in literature that the visual modality

411
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,120
at least for most of us

412
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,279
is much stronger than proprioception

413
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,399
data

414
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,519
so it seems that we were getting this

415
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
mismatch between the sensory input right

416
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,480
of i'm seeing my hands doing the thing

417
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
but i'm feeling my hand in a different

418
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,839
place

419
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,480
right now i was hoping that we that

420
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,639
would cause active inference

421
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,320
pulling your hand to where they're

422
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,759
supposed to be

423
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,600
but it seems that the actual actually

424
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
the opposite happened

425
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,000
and because when i i asked people they

426
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,639
were all

427
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,880
actually believing that they were doing

428
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,320
the task better

429
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,720
some of them actually thought they were

430
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
the avatar they didn't even realize that

431
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,360
this was a pre-programmed avatar

432
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,560
they thought it was them um and all of

433
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,839
them reported it to be

434
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
easier um so

435
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,800
but when i looked at the data all of

436
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,160
them were actually doing

437
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,040
uh much worse so it seemed that the

438
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,560
visual modality

439
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,040
caused the proprioception modality to

440
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,759
actually

441
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,920
uh lower and become you know less

442
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,880
accurate

443
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
and your brain decided when it has this

444
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,920
this

445
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,600
a higher prediction or there's a few

446
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,680
tactics it can do one is active

447
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,720
inference the other

448
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
is modulate uh one of the sense

449
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,199
modalities and it seems that that's what

450
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,560
it did just lowered the proprioception

451
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
stuck what stuck with the sensation from

452
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,800
the eyes which it could predict

453
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,480
and that's the way it sort of minimized

454
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,839
the prediction error

455
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,160
so this uh and we can talk a bit more in

456
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,320
the discussion about the meaning of this

457
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,880
and and how um what it means for

458
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,440
training

459
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,800
but this was again um you know

460
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,240
it was uh um against what i was hoping

461
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,759
and against you know my my

462
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,440
initial prediction but thinking about

463
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,800
this a bit deeper

464
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
it does make sense because accurate

465
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,800
feedback

466
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,959
of what you're actually doing seems to

467
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,199
be incredibly incredibly important for

468
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,000
learning any type of skill so giving

469
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,399
this

470
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,599
false feedback um of somebody doing the

471
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,559
movements

472
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,839
seems to not be the way to go uh around

473
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,319
actually teaching movements um an

474
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,919
experiment i would love to conduct in

475
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,839
the future is having both of these

476
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,880
as an overlay like have um

477
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,559
the avatar that's able to do the

478
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,919
movements but

479
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,280
they'll give you a physical um ability

480
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,919
to actually know where your hands are

481
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,440
and this is something that um

482
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
if people have vr they can actually

483
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
download um

484
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,600
my my vr app that's called miu which

485
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,360
lets you play with these things yourself

486
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,240
it's um

487
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,720
it basically records 3d movements and

488
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
then you can move around them and also

489
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
get haptic feedback and see where your

490
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,440
hands are

491
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
inside so i played around with that a

492
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,200
bit with like professional

493
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,679
jugglers um creating movements and then

494
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,760
me stepping inside and needing to

495
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,880
follow their hands but also receiving

496
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
the feedback of where my hands are

497
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
through haptic feedback and visual

498
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,120
perception um but i did not do an

499
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
academic research on that yet

500
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,960
and that i think could be really

501
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,480
interesting uh

502
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,320
because i think there might be something

503
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,000
there because obviously

504
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
the prediction error was increased

505
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
meaning your brain needs to deal with

506
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
this prediction error in some ways

507
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,120
so there is a potential of still

508
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,080
creating uh better updates and maybe

509
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,960
activating this active inference ability

510
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,160
but we need to not only trust the visual

511
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,039
perception

512
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,080
uh visual versus proprioception the

513
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,840
the visual just wins and you don't feel

514
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
where you are anymore at that same level

515
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,960
of accuracy

516
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,080
so that was um interesting

517
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
um now let's look at the other two

518
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,520
conditions

519
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,120
of what i found so um

520
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,600
in the other two conditions i found that

521
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,160
when i

522
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
actually gave people the totally

523
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,440
incorrect things that were against their

524
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
minimal self i crossed their hands they

525
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,039
were moving their right hand seeing the

526
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,720
left hand some things that they've never

527
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,039
ever

528
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,400
experienced before they were able

529
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,919
to follow the avatar better

530
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,400
but the self-movement movements were

531
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,440
worse

532
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,559
right and that actually does uh

533
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,200
make sense because again we're

534
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,480
interfering

535
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
with this self-level prediction and

536
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,440
having to maintain this goal of

537
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,000
doing a self-movement while your whole

538
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,080
minimal self is just like

539
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
totally wonky and doesn't know what's

540
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
going on and has a much higher

541
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,880
prediction error

542
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
um is the causing interference and um

543
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,760
making you not able to do this task as

544
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,480
well

545
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,320
but a follow task you don't actually

546
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,240
need the goal is really different you

547
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,600
don't actually uh

548
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,440
need to have a goal high-level

549
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
goal-oriented

550
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,919
self um structure that's creating these

551
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,960
predictions

552
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,400
you just need to really minimize

553
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,120
this location and space versus that the

554
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,400
other person

555
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,760
um they were actually doing better um

556
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,400
and we'll talk a little bit about uh why

557
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,880
why

558
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,640
that might have happened um

559
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,400
yeah um so just one more finding before

560
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,880
we go into a bit more of the discussion

561
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,440
is that there was actually um

562
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,480
um two very different strategies

563
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,559
might have been employed here as we see

564
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,480
between the two different tasks right

565
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,840
when you're in the self task um

566
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,440
this higher prediction error that you

567
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
need to deal with is

568
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,159
you can't just make yourself disappear

569
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,440
you need to

570
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,559
keep maintaining this goal so

571
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,600
maybe your brain created a weaker

572
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,320
prediction

573
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,440
right and then it would just like lower

574
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,799
that prediction error by

575
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,120
having a wider sort of um i guess and

576
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,720
there's a lot of between like stronger

577
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,159
weaker and wider

578
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,799
um my specific professor was very um in

579
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,640
the in the prediction predictive

580
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
coding scheme looking at things from

581
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,159
actually not a continuous gaussian

582
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,440
but more of a discrete level and a lot

583
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,360
of this is about like

584
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,919
detail the level of detail of your

585
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,039
prediction

586
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,960
so if you have a less detailed

587
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,880
prediction you're going to decrease your

588
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,480
prediction error

589
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
right if you say and we'll talk a little

590
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,919
bit more about that when we talk about

591
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,600
psychedelics because it's very relevant

592
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,400
there

593
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
but if you're just saying okay my hand

594
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,520
needs to be

595
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,960
around here you know versus your hand

596
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
needs to be exactly

597
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,640
at a specific point that's another way

598
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,559
to decrease prediction error

599
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,880
so on the self task that might be what

600
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,840
was happening

601
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,240
your brain was just decreasing the

602
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,039
detail

603
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
of the prediction in order to decrease a

604
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,080
prediction error

605
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,559
which would result in worse behavior

606
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,919
versus the follow-up task your brain

607
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,240
might have reduced the prediction uh

608
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,120
error by

609
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,799
actually reducing the visual perception

610
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,120
and

611
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,440
getting on the relative right between

612
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,520
proprioception to visual

613
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,440
actually getting more of this

614
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,679
proprioception creating these closer

615
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,280
feedback loops with

616
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,440
where your body is in space and getting

617
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,679
this more independence between your

618
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,559
hands

619
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,559
because you don't need to have this

620
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,400
single task anymore

621
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,000
you're just following um and

622
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,919
uh an interesting finding i don't have

623
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,559
the quote of the paper here but um

624
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,280
there's a paper that did the exact same

625
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,640
task but with the eyes

626
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,240
closed and just touch so people had

627
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,360
their eyes closed

628
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,559
and were just touching uh something that

629
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,760
was moving

630
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,320
in a bi-manual independent manner and

631
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
they were all able to do it and suddenly

632
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,120
from becoming a very difficult task

633
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,320
became a very easy task so

634
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,440
um this really shows that sometimes and

635
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,280
i think anybody that you know practices

636
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,840
movement is it's sort of a common trope

637
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,320
but

638
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,000
there's a thing of like thinking too

639
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,360
much so

640
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,039
goal oriented movement can actually

641
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,679
um if we are taking this goal oriented

642
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,080
movement

643
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,000
and putting it in a way that's too

644
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
detailed we're telling

645
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,799
our brains create these movement paths

646
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,960
and create two separate movement paths

647
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,039
that's a really not naturalistic state

648
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,039
for our brain to be in

649
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,320
um versus when we're just like okay

650
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,840
we're following things

651
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,120
that's a very naturalistic the low level

652
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,440
feedback between our motor cortex and

653
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,000
our proprioception and our sensation

654
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,520
can just work um

655
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,440
so yeah that that that's all sort of

656
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,039
hopefully understood um

657
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,159
now another finding that that happened

658
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:02,799
was that

659
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,919
um there was a much higher variance

660
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,000
like i was expecting this to be a very

661
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
hard task for everyone that's what the

662
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,799
literature said

663
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,640
um but i found that uh and again this is

664
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,919
a small experiment we're talking about

665
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,200
like 13

666
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,640
psych students right um uh all healthy

667
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,760
subjects

668
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,679
um young but uh

669
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,799
two of them were very able to do the

670
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,559
baseline task

671
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,880
and that was a surprise some of them the

672
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,480
task was so difficult

673
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,880
that i could barely use the data because

674
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,360
they were literally just moving one hand

675
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,120
the other hand was just freezing in

676
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,600
space and the other hand would move

677
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
so they weren't even able to maintain

678
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,120
these

679
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,400
two goals of move two hands um

680
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
in separate ways uh at all um

681
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,039
so uh that really goes to show like just

682
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,440
how

683
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,400
different our brains are one of the

684
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,159
interesting things to compare this

685
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,520
experiment to is a binocular rivalry

686
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,919
um which has been written a lot about in

687
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,000
the predictive coding literature

688
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,720
um so for whoever doesn't know this

689
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,320
binocular rivalry

690
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,200
is when we project two different images

691
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,760
onto

692
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,559
each eye so one eye is seeing one image

693
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,640
you can see in the picture

694
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,720
the right eye is getting a red image

695
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,640
with one

696
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,720
angle of direction and the left eye is

697
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
getting a different one

698
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,240
now what happens to your brain is it

699
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,120
actually

700
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,520
switches your perception switches

701
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,720
between seeing

702
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,200
one of the images and the other images

703
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,840
with

704
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,440
some short phases usually of like mixed

705
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,600
perception but really just bouncing

706
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
mostly between one to the next

707
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,159
now here too there's a lot of variants

708
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,279
in the population

709
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,880
and one of the interesting things is

710
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
that people on this

711
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
uh autistic spectrum which you know i i

712
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,159
have endless criticism about the dsm and

713
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:00,720
how

714
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,080
we're classifying uh autism and

715
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,000
generally mental health and different

716
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,679
types of um

717
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,360
brain brain abnormalities

718
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,400
um but some people

719
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,600
definitely have much more um

720
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,760
mixed dates than others and different

721
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,840
drugs can also affect the ability to

722
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,039
have mixed states

723
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,039
and it's sort of interesting to compare

724
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,200
these two tasks because

725
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
both of them are sort of creating a

726
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,679
bi-stable system

727
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,960
coming from an unnaturalistic task

728
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,320
or a naturalistic um um input that

729
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,799
you're not

730
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,440
usually supposed to be doing because the

731
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,600
way our brain was really

732
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,559
meant to be doing motor actions is

733
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,679
around

734
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,919
high level goals completing high level

735
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,720
goals right

736
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,919
give me the border um turn

737
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,520
on the thing grab bang

738
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,440
there's always a high level goal that's

739
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,120
oriented towards

740
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,080
um one of our high higher level needs or

741
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,919
lower level needs but like a specific

742
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,159
need that you're trying to complete

743
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,440
um and with this

744
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,919
task of telling people oh move your hand

745
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,840
in this motor path's way and your other

746
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,279
hand in this motor pathway

747
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,000
it's very unnaturalistic for our brain

748
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,120
very similar

749
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,399
to giving someone uh these two different

750
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,000
visuals which we never see

751
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,200
in real life so um

752
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,799
again this is really correlated to this

753
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,640
having a very strong hyper prior in

754
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,720
in a binocular rivalry situation your

755
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,640
brain has a very strong hyper prior no i

756
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,039
can just be seeing one thing

757
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,960
this is this is how the world works

758
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,640
there can only be one thing

759
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,200
in one place and then your brain

760
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,159
activates

761
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,840
in order to minimize this prediction

762
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,679
error it goes between okay

763
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,840
i'm i guess i'm seeing this one now it

764
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,520
keeps getting prediction error

765
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,600
oh i guess i'm seeing the other one so

766
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,360
it keeps jumping between

767
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
these two states in order to minimize

768
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,799
the prediction error

769
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,760
now the same thing it quite likely is

770
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,399
happening

771
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,279
with this uh bimanual interference with

772
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,399
having a very

773
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,440
strong hype of prior of oh i'm only

774
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,399
supposed to be doing

775
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,799
one task at any given time you're just

776
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,440
giving me

777
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,600
two different tasks to complete at the

778
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,600
same time

779
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,640
i'm going to be switching between them

780
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,760
now possibly when you have this

781
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,559
different sense of minimal stealth

782
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,720
this can actually create different

783
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,960
activation patterns and let you be more

784
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,039
in a mixed state more in an independent

785
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:37,760
state

786
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,720
have basically weaker hyper priors

787
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,080
around

788
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,120
either what you're seeing or

789
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,640
what your task abilities are so this

790
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,720
might be an interesting way of generally

791
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,640
like understanding

792
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,600
um a lot of what our hyper priors are

793
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,559
doing to us

794
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,279
and just the variance in the population

795
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,279
might be around these hyper priors

796
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,840
so let's let's now let's get into like

797
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,559
more like

798
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,919
what are these possible implications um

799
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,120
and and how can we use this data

800
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,240
to like you know do cool things with

801
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,399
rehabilitation and even just training

802
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,240
and getting me to be less clumsy so

803
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,080
one of the things that comes up from

804
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,000
this is really naturalistic

805
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,640
design of movement goals instead of

806
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,919
telling people

807
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,080
you know move the head your hand at this

808
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,919
angle reach

809
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,399
over here um and we see this a lot

810
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,600
actually in

811
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,640
in traditional martial arts they give

812
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,159
movements names of activities

813
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,159
like in kung fu you have stroking the

814
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,600
horse the

815
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,799
the host of maine and karate we have a

816
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,600
move that's called

817
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,880
breaking breaking the wall or breaking

818
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,080
the gate

819
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,760
so having these um goals that are really

820
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
oriented towards

821
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,880
task completion versus

822
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
goals that are too low level

823
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
are much more likely to activate this

824
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,559
active inference in ways that we want

825
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,679
them to

826
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,120
when we put the goals into two

827
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,399
low-level um patterns um

828
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,440
we're then creating this sort of

829
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,679
unnaturalistic

830
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
um activity and maybe even like

831
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,720
slowing things down like the the fast

832
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,039
parts of our brain that deal with

833
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,200
bringing together these sense modalities

834
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,960
of visual sensation and

835
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,600
motor actions they need to stay down

836
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,240
there

837
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
they need to not be part of this high

838
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,279
level

839
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,559
self um

840
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,760
you know network uh part of our

841
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,200
hierarchy called network

842
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,880
and i think that's really interesting

843
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,360
because it really

844
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,679
is like what i was saying every martial

845
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,640
arts teacher

846
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,039
my whole life has told me stop thinking

847
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,880
and i like i don't know what to do about

848
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,240
this you know how can you stop

849
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,600
thinking um but part of it is

850
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,880
uh letting these low level parts of your

851
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,399
body

852
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,519
do the movements while maintaining high

853
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,000
level

854
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,519
goals that are not oriented to exactly

855
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,399
oh where's my elbow is it here or here

856
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,200
um

857
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
where am i holding my fist like all

858
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,039
these little details

859
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,519
uh work much better if you give them

860
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,440
high level metaphors somehow

861
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,600
that your brain that the lower levels

862
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,720
can then

863
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
take those predictions and minimize

864
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,480
prediction error

865
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,840
so um another interesting

866
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,600
part of this is that it might actually

867
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,120
explain uh

868
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,159
some of why mirrorbox therapy works

869
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,720
um and and why mirror rocket therapy is

870
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,399
now something that's also being used in

871
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:52,960
vr

872
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,760
and so for whoever doesn't know

873
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,000
mirrorbox therapy

874
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,880
is used on amputees and people that have

875
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,080
pain in one hand um

876
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,600
like chronic pain or even a stroke

877
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,960
people that have suffered through a

878
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,159
stroke so what you do is you take the

879
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,279
body part that is actually okay

880
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,919
that doesn't have pain that is working

881
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,519
and you use a mirror

882
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,559
to then get your brain to believe

883
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,159
that your other body part is also moving

884
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,200
and is healthy or even there

885
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,919
if it's an amputee and this was actually

886
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,440
uh figured out by i think the first

887
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,120
person was ramachandran

888
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,799
uh working with amputees that were

889
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,799
suffering from just phantom pain

890
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,039
and how do you get rid of pain from a

891
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,440
limb that doesn't exist anymore right

892
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,880
this was like a top-down prediction

893
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,200
from the injury that was just not

894
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,039
getting updated

895
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,519
um and you see this a lot in chronic

896
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,720
pain

897
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,120
really you see the neural circuitry even

898
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,000
change

899
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,360
as the predictions for pain just cement

900
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,000
themselves

901
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,519
and become biases in your brain

902
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,720
so um by using this type of

903
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,080
mirror box therapy um it

904
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,519
helps relieve the pain so why or how is

905
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,519
this connected to what we just saw

906
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,159
because the visual modality is stronger

907
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,399
than the proprioception modality

908
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,080
it's not too far fetched to believe that

909
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
the visual modality is also stronger

910
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,399
than

911
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,480
the gnostic scepters the pain receptors

912
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,679
that we're getting

913
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,559
so if we can actually cause your brain

914
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,320
to believe and and

915
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,240
just by seeing cause that visual

916
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,399
perception of a healthy hand

917
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,720
it might be enough to mute the same way

918
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,640
your proprioception was muting

919
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,159
to mute your nasty scepters um

920
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,279
and then reduce the pain so that's

921
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,640
that's really interesting and it's

922
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
interesting to see they are also

923
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,880
starting

924
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,399
to use this with stroke victims to

925
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,240
actually help them rehabilitate their

926
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,960
hand

927
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,799
um and that's a really interesting

928
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,200
because right that's a little bit

929
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,159
not in accordance with what i saw um

930
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,520
from my experiment

931
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,280
but it might be different because they

932
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,040
might not be getting

933
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,079
um current data about the hand

934
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,079
i think it might be really dependent on

935
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,839
you know what the stroke has actually

936
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,440
damaged in your brain

937
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,599
if the stroke part has damaged your

938
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,280
ability to receive any type of

939
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,199
proprioceptive data

940
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,399
um then maybe

941
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,239
getting that visual perception uh

942
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,480
might help reprogram that there might be

943
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
less of an interference going on i'm not

944
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,000
sure it's sort of interesting to think

945
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,440
about

946
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,520
um so let's see what are we left with oh

947
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,239
yeah

948
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,440
so now there's basically that third

949
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,599
uh condition why i gave this crossed

950
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,119
hands condition

951
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,000
and i think that's really an

952
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,320
underutilized

953
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,119
mechanism generally in any type of

954
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,119
rehabilitation and training

955
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,640
um messing your brain up even more

956
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,920
in some ways and i think that that's

957
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,240
a very strong intervention that we could

958
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,599
play around with a lot

959
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,720
more uh because it's you know 100

960
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,560
percent we're creating more prediction

961
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
error that your brain needs to deal with

962
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,079
now how your brain will deal with that

963
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,320
prediction error will it actually

964
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
uh remodel whether create active

965
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,599
inference

966
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,320
will it reduce some other sensation

967
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,079
might really depend on the task

968
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,440
on your brain um on how we do this but

969
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,920
being able to increase prediction error

970
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,560
in your brain is a very powerful ability

971
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,480
and i think that's something that really

972
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,320
is worth looking into more

973
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
when we're talking about rehabilitation

974
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
tools um

975
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,000
and we see these types of things

976
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,839
starting to emerge in here more with

977
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:50,400
like

978
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,160
total body replacements like i was

979
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,079
talking about about like um

980
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,880
anorexia patients uh putting them in a

981
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,119
whole new avatar and creating a full

982
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,000
body

983
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
um rubber hand experiment so

984
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,280
they're getting sensations on their body

985
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,440
at the same time that they're seeing

986
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,240
uh their avatar getting sensations and

987
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,640
it's

988
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,280
been proven to help them remodel this

989
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,680
top

990
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,880
level uh belief and accurate belief that

991
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,480
they have about their bodies being

992
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,200
overweight

993
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,640
even though um they're not so

994
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,079
that's very interesting but i think

995
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,880
there's really a lot that we can do

996
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,440
with um increase massively increasing

997
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,800
prediction error in the brain and you

998
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
see this in a lot of crazy experiments

999
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,520
right like

1000
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,560
the upside down glasses experiment that

1001
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,040
people

1002
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
just within a short time were able to

1003
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,160
totally adapt

1004
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,760
and live in a world where everything is

1005
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,000
upside down um

1006
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
or with like training people on bikes

1007
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,839
that work in a totally different

1008
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,040
direction so

1009
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,240
um sometimes by making things harder

1010
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,440
we're making things easier um for our

1011
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,079
brain

1012
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,680
or we're forcing it out of this um

1013
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,320
minimal potential well that it might

1014
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,440
fall into

1015
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,760
it's like okay now there's too much

1016
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,599
prediction error it's time to actually

1017
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,480
change

1018
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
uh because you know as we've been

1019
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,920
talking about like

1020
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,119
um this minimal uh

1021
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,079
uh prediction error if if you're in a

1022
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,680
stable state where you've minimized

1023
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,960
prediction error

1024
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,800
that's not always a healthy thing for

1025
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,000
brains

1026
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,599
um and side note this is also

1027
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,839
a model of depression basically not

1028
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,440
having enough prediction error in your

1029
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,079
brain

1030
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,320
falling into a too stable state a low

1031
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,240
entropy state of your brain

1032
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,160
so increasing prediction error in many

1033
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,240
ways can be very important for

1034
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,200
our physical health our mental health

1035
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,760
and it's something that i personally

1036
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,560
try to hack on myself all the time i'll

1037
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,119
do like

1038
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,000
dark showers so i can't see anything uh

1039
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
i'll try to use my left hand

1040
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,240
to to to use toothbrushes just like very

1041
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,320
basic daily activities that you get very

1042
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,760
used to doing

1043
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,280
just put another constraint on yourself

1044
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,520
um and make it like a fun game it's also

1045
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,680
a great way to train

1046
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,040
in any type of physical task uh

1047
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,960
okay so uh yeah we talked a lot about

1048
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,200
uh the visual dominating their

1049
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,880
proprioceptive but why

1050
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,400
why is that so there's a paper from 2009

1051
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,960
i'm not gonna i don't know how to

1052
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,240
pronounce that you

1053
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,680
um but uh their theory was that it's

1054
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,720
around using

1055
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,000
tools that in order for us to be able to

1056
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,560
use

1057
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,599
tools we need to be able to

1058
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,160
uh not trust the proprioceptive

1059
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,920
sensation as much as the visual

1060
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,079
perception because we don't have data

1061
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,560
from any proprioceptive data of any tool

1062
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,000
that we're using

1063
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,119
um so that's a very interesting theory

1064
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,480
um but for my paper i think there might

1065
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,920
be something actually

1066
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,119
deeper than that going on i also think

1067
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,560
and this might be interesting to

1068
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,480
figure out a way to test this on animals

1069
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,640
that don't really use tools

1070
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,000
um but i would expect it to

1071
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,400
uh possibly and this might might be very

1072
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,640
different because some animals you know

1073
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,960
actually smells their smell world is

1074
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,079
much more dominant

1075
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,599
their their hearing um but

1076
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,400
i think that for this goal-oriented

1077
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,800
movement where we need to coordinate

1078
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,880
many body parts you know you're driving

1079
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,000
a car

1080
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,320
uh you're just even getting out of bed

1081
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,599
and

1082
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,960
um getting dressed or walking all these

1083
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
things require

1084
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,880
um lots of body movements working

1085
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,000
together

1086
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,200
so in order for that to happen

1087
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,240
we really need to reduce the

1088
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,359
proprioceptive sensation

1089
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,800
so we can get this high level goal

1090
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,280
to dictate the lower level hierarchies

1091
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,040
of the brain to actually pull towards

1092
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,640
the active inference

1093
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,440
if we had very strong perceptions of

1094
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,240
where we are

1095
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,680
right now we wouldn't be able to move

1096
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,000
into the next state of where we want to

1097
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,200
be

1098
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,760
so we're taking our brain is taking this

1099
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
high level goal and breaking it

1100
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,839
in to movement predictions

1101
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,839
and for those movement predictions to be

1102
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,359
able to

1103
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,240
move your body into where we want it to

1104
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,920
be using active inference

1105
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,319
we need to weaken where you are

1106
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,440
currently

1107
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,720
um and have a a weaker now in order to

1108
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,480
get to the future

1109
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,000
um of this goal-oriented movement

1110
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,400
that's that's sort of how i see it at

1111
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,920
least

1112
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,839
um a sort of interesting thing that i'd

1113
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,160
like

1114
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,599
to talk about and we can also open this

1115
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,359
to discussions and questions

1116
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,920
at the end is how this uh connects to

1117
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,880
flow state

1118
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,280
and improv and dance and play and all

1119
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,040
these things that i'm you know totally

1120
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,319
infatuated with

1121
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,520
and want to spend most of my time doing

1122
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,640
um so flow states uh for

1123
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,440
if people haven't heard this term before

1124
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:11,920
it's

1125
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,520
um a term that's been coined when

1126
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,760
uh athletes or really anybody that's

1127
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,359
good at a specific task

1128
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,000
is at their peak uh it's

1129
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,920
been sort of defined as being freed from

1130
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,880
self-consciousness

1131
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,000
now a way to look at it through this

1132
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,599
lens of the these experiments and these

1133
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,440
hierarchical levels and predictive

1134
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,760
coding and active inference

1135
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,359
is um that it's basically

1136
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,400
inhibiting actually these higher level

1137
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,880
abstract goals and letting us

1138
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,920
get hyper accuracy within this

1139
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
proprioception modality

1140
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,280
so really what we call being in the now

1141
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,920
right getting incredibly fast feedback

1142
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,560
loops

1143
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,599
that aren't about the end goal it's not

1144
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,480
about if you

1145
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,240
i think talk to any of these athletes

1146
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,680
it's not about winning

1147
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,000
it's not about getting to the end it's

1148
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,520
just like this pure

1149
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,960
joy about being in the moment

1150
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,319
um and and letting your body be

1151
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,359
right um and

1152
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,240
a lot of this uh really might have to do

1153
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,640
with

1154
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,599
inhibiting this higher level of our

1155
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,200
neural hierarchy

1156
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,520
so we can get this hyper accuracy of

1157
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,680
proprioception so we can create these

1158
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,640
fast feedback loops between our body and

1159
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,720
the environment

1160
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,480
to get to this like higher level of

1161
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,000
performance

1162
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,480
um and this takes us to more of like

1163
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,440
improv dance

1164
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,920
and play that are really non-goal

1165
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,119
oriented

1166
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,800
right this is sort of the definition and

1167
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,160
how i see you know there's a big

1168
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,200
difference between

1169
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,400
games and play games there's always like

1170
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
you're winning you're going towards a

1171
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,240
thing or you're losing

1172
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,599
um but in play there's none of that

1173
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,400
there's just exploration um the same

1174
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,480
goes really with improv dance compared

1175
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:08,800
to

1176
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,040
i don't know ballet or choreographed

1177
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,319
dance you're just

1178
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,520
exploring um the possibility space of

1179
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,040
what you can do

1180
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,960
um and that at least for me and i think

1181
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,839
well not only for me this is quite

1182
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,079
widespread anybody that is into these

1183
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,960
things i think

1184
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,079
finds them the most joyous um and you

1185
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,240
know kids find them the most joyous

1186
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,800
and it's a very very healthy part for

1187
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,680
our brain

1188
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,880
to not be in a goal-oriented

1189
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,560
um movement pattern and to just

1190
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,400
let go and explore without having

1191
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,760
um a high level active inference

1192
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,400
happening active inference is it's still

1193
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,079
happening but it's being sort of

1194
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,040
driven more by the bottom up signals and

1195
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,640
really the moment to movement

1196
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,680
possibilities without having this like

1197
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,880
okay

1198
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,040
let's gonna do let's do like a pretty

1199
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,599
move let's do a pirouette let's do

1200
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,839
something um

1201
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,920
yeah so i'm i don't think i actually

1202
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,599
want to show this video right now but

1203
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,680
it's more about focused on vr but

1204
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,920
if you want to look at it it's a cool

1205
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,599
video that's called this is your brain

1206
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,640
on vr that

1207
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,920
uh we made um just

1208
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,599
predicting the sound and stuff won't

1209
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,560
work uh but it sums up a bit about these

1210
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
what we've been talking about uh how

1211
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,000
different modalities

1212
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,480
get expressed uh activated in your brain

1213
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,440
on we are

1214
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,680
reprogramming your predictions and how

1215
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,040
we can play with these things

1216
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,440
okay so yep this this one this was

1217
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,480
it that's awesome

1218
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,000
wow i wrote down um a ton of stuff

1219
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,160
so shall i ask uh some questions and

1220
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,480
we'll head into another part

1221
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,160
many places to jump in i really just

1222
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,560
caught on to this weaker now like a

1223
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,640
weaker current moment in order to get

1224
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,440
further so that the way you connected

1225
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,560
that to

1226
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,480
accessible experiences like the play and

1227
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,920
the martial arts really awesome

1228
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,839
so when you talked about active

1229
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,160
inference kicking in

1230
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,240
what what is happening there and what

1231
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,280
what did you mean by

1232
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,680
active inference as far as um the way

1233
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,599
that an individual person might relate

1234
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,920
to it

1235
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,680
uh i'm in what like domain all right

1236
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,400
give me more

1237
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,079
you talked about how you talked about

1238
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,520
predictive coding and how active

1239
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,720
inference would kick in

1240
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,359
um or would go into a different mode

1241
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,040
depending on whether a task

1242
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
is being selected at a high level or a

1243
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,240
low level or lower level

1244
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,440
yeah exactly like we're always gonna be

1245
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,359
i mean there's always prediction error

1246
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,640
in our brain right

1247
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,640
uh depending on what's happening now

1248
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,160
are we gonna minimize it with with what

1249
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,520
there's again these three different

1250
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,680
tactics that your brain can implore

1251
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,440
one um reducing the sensations

1252
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,640
two updating your prediction three doing

1253
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:10,880
an

1254
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,079
action um so when you're just

1255
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,200
in this free play

1256
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,359
there's still a need to create a

1257
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,839
prediction of your movement pattern for

1258
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,200
it to actually happen

1259
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,920
right but it's happening at a much lower

1260
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,800
level of your

1261
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,760
neural hierarchy it's not happening

1262
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,880
because

1263
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,280
there's a high level part that's saying

1264
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,119
oh i want to look pretty

1265
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,280
i want to get my teacher to like me so

1266
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,800
i'll do something

1267
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,240
um it's happening at a level of

1268
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,280
the sensation uh at the level of what

1269
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,160
feels good from the proprioception the

1270
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,280
haptic

1271
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,440
um the the pure like your body

1272
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,240
knows what's joyous to your body or

1273
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,520
these lower level

1274
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,720
um predictions and biases that your body

1275
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,680
has about

1276
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,119
what is joyous healthy for your body the

1277
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:05,839
knowledge

1278
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,880
is there there are these lower level

1279
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,000
biases

1280
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,720
so we're allowing our system to collapse

1281
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,000
into a state that's being

1282
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,160
led by these lower level biases

1283
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,480
um and this goes i think like in both

1284
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,880
ways this can go very much into like

1285
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,599
your body knows and has biases around

1286
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,200
what's healthy and fun

1287
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,160
and feels good but there's also that's

1288
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,400
where trauma is stored too

1289
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,319
there's an amazing book i think it's

1290
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,880
called the your your the body remembers

1291
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,720
and both emotional and physical trauma

1292
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,000
really

1293
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,680
are stored in our low-level biases

1294
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,200
of our prediction around our movements

1295
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,839
and our body

1296
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,880
um that too can be you know a big

1297
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,200
issue for many many people that need to

1298
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,240
deal with this

1299
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,680
and and being able to

1300
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,920
go from a state where your brain's

1301
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,680
triggered right and in the mental health

1302
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,359
spaces it's called like when you're

1303
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,119
when you've been triggered um and these

1304
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,839
by these negative biases appear that are

1305
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:14,720
predicting oh

1306
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,920
pains how gonna happen even though

1307
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,960
there's no objective reason for that

1308
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,440
except

1309
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,480
your history something's

1310
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,680
triggered that prediction so being able

1311
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,119
to switch

1312
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,400
into that place

1313
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,000
in your brain that knows what feels good

1314
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,880
for your body

1315
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,559
and what's healthy for your body is

1316
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,800
super important and we don't really know

1317
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,079
how to do that

1318
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,079
in a very reliable way yet you know

1319
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,400
there's mindfulness practices

1320
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,599
breathing and stretching and massage

1321
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,559
um but i think like my biggest fear is

1322
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,599
that we're

1323
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,280
with technology we're actually being

1324
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,040
pulled away from our body

1325
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,680
and that's generally what i'm trying to

1326
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,880
close that gap um wow

1327
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,119
that makes any sense thanks for this

1328
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,800
answer and it's actually related to this

1329
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,000
next question

1330
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,920
you talked about how when the avatar was

1331
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,520
getting almost like

1332
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,400
false perfect feedback it didn't improve

1333
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,680
the actual performance

1334
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,200
so it really highlighted how the

1335
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,800
technology can't just

1336
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,440
um just simply mechanically demonstrate

1337
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,359
like a scaffold it has to give

1338
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,480
somehow accurate feedback yet it's

1339
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,920
often fantastical scenarios or abstract

1340
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,200
scenarios so

1341
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,200
i wondered what were your thoughts for

1342
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,319
technology

1343
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,200
design how could technology be used to

1344
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,760
actually

1345
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,800
enable and enable these kinds of states

1346
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,599
that you're

1347
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,960
getting towards um yeah

1348
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,920
without constraining us in that way yeah

1349
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,000
so i think this was a very big learning

1350
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,640
for me right

1351
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,760
you need to give a person accurate

1352
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,880
feedback of

1353
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,520
where they are to and what they are

1354
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,880
actually doing

1355
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,559
um and there again there might be an

1356
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,400
ability to

1357
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,200
uh impose two such uh uh predict

1358
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,119
things like you might be able to still

1359
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,280
be in a first person perspective

1360
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,640
of somebody doing the movements but also

1361
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,480
either feel with vibrations like if you

1362
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,960
try new that's what happens i just

1363
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,119
use the haptic feedback to tell you if

1364
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,040
you're are in the right place

1365
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,119
you'll get a vibration so i'm

1366
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,280
strengthening your ability to know where

1367
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,880
you actually are so there's

1368
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,160
sort of ways to hack our other sense

1369
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,119
modalities

1370
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,480
with you know music uh really it's a bit

1371
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,640
of like gamification when you're on the

1372
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,680
path

1373
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,040
um of of doing the things that were

1374
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,160
you're trying to learn uh activate the

1375
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,599
this the even like the dopamine um

1376
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,520
you know dopamine at least within the

1377
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,040
predictive coding framework it's really

1378
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,520
like a

1379
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,319
precision signal for a for prediction

1380
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,520
error so like

1381
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,240
uh give some more bling bling bling with

1382
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,040
a little bit

1383
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,280
randomness when you are doing the things

1384
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,960
that you're trying to learn

1385
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,280
correctly but you need to get that

1386
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,000
feedback

1387
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,599
of when you're doing things correctly

1388
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,720
um yeah and i think that that's what was

1389
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,559
missing from sorry from this experiment

1390
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,079
was uh giving and the faster and tighter

1391
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,640
these feedback loops are the more your

1392
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,440
brain will

1393
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,599
perceive them and actually activate them

1394
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,240
so there's some really great you know

1395
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,440
meditation tools that you'll meditate

1396
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,200
and afterwards you'll see your heart

1397
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,520
rate um

1398
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,079
there's some more professional like

1399
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,160
biofeedback rhythms that you can see

1400
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,119
what's happening

1401
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,160
either with uh eeg or

1402
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,359
um heart rate in real time

1403
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:58,960
um and that's also actually i talked to

1404
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,480
you before we started like i'm

1405
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,559
build i'm starting my first hardware

1406
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:03,520
project

1407
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,440
um to do that and give a real-time bio

1408
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,880
feedback of heart rate

1409
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,359
with leds if you want to go it's called

1410
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,640
the wisdom truffle

1411
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,000
go to wisdomtruffle.com uh you'll see a

1412
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,280
trippy truffle

1413
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,160
and basically that's the idea of helping

1414
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,119
people

1415
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,960
reach some of these um tighter feedback

1416
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,040
loops on a lower level

1417
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,920
by hacking their their visual modalities

1418
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,760
like let's use it we figured out okay

1419
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,319
the visual modality is super strong

1420
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,280
can we connect it to other sensations

1421
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,480
that we don't have

1422
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,119
as much insight to like could i connect

1423
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,040
the visual modality to heart rate yeah

1424
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,040
pretty easy could i connect the visual

1425
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,480
mentality to perception

1426
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,119
yeah if you go to mu when you dance and

1427
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:49,839
move

1428
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,319
your actual your avatar changes color

1429
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,359
and the sparkles

1430
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,880
change color so um by hacking

1431
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,960
uh the the visual modality that really

1432
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,880
is like our

1433
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,920
brains graphic computer it's like super

1434
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,480
strong

1435
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,079
it's dominant can we use it in different

1436
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,280
ways to connect

1437
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,359
sensations that we don't have as strong

1438
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,520
and are not as dominant in us that's

1439
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,000
that's one of the things

1440
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,640
awesome and that point you made really

1441
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,359
um

1442
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,839
about the high level priors like both my

1443
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,400
eyes

1444
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,559
are looking at the same thing and you

1445
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,000
can kind of play with that by pushing

1446
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
on one lightly and you know it just does

1447
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,680
distort the image and it's sort of

1448
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,920
it just demonstrates uh it's one of

1449
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,160
those examples like the high acuity in

1450
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,839
the periphery or color vision the

1451
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,520
periphery or the blind spot

1452
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,400
one of those examples that help bridge

1453
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,520
between

1454
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,000
for example input output information

1455
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,040
processing

1456
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,640
understandings of cognitive sciences

1457
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,160
versus this really

1458
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,160
extended and predictive way that you're

1459
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,760
talking about things so it's really

1460
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,680
awesome and thanks for making it really

1461
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,280
accessible with this presentation

1462
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,680
so you want to go to the second part and

1463
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,040
then if anyone has questions

1464
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,960
live otherwise i'll just keep on writing

1465
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,280
cool things down thank you

1466
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,240
so okay

1467
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,040
context

1468
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,079
there's a counting switch um but we're

1469
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,599
still staying within the predictive

1470
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,000
coding framework and active inference

1471
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,040
but um yeah i'm gonna just give you know

1472
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,040
i really like this idea of giving visual

1473
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,079
metaphors

1474
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,760
based on all the things that i talked

1475
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,319
about i think it's a great way to learn

1476
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,240
and and have this intuitive

1477
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,440
understanding

1478
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,280
uh both of math i don't know if you

1479
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,599
follow the three blue one brown videos

1480
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:35,920
but

1481
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,319
they're just phenomenal and and

1482
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,000
mathematical understanding because it's

1483
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,240
all

1484
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,760
visual coded math but i'm going to give

1485
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,960
a

1486
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,400
visual metaphor you can either look at

1487
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,880
the images or even close your eyes

1488
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,400
and just imagine that when your brain is

1489
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,839
creating reality it's very similar to

1490
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,799
playing in a sand with some buckets and

1491
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,720
making sand castles

1492
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,440
and the sand is just this constant

1493
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,240
incoming

1494
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,480
bottom-up signal there's just so much of

1495
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,119
it constant sand is just flooding

1496
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,000
into your room into your space and you

1497
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,440
have these buckets

1498
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,440
and you're trying to take all the sand

1499
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,839
and like fit them into the bucket

1500
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,359
constantly to create

1501
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,200
this um reality really and this is

1502
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,720
pretty much what your brain is doing

1503
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,559
with with uh

1504
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,799
at least in the predictive coding

1505
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,799
framework with the buckets being these

1506
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:33,440
top top-down

1507
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,839
priors and the sand being the bottom-up

1508
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,440
and incoming signals

1509
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,359
so there's a constant buckets trying to

1510
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,480
predict and put the incoming signals

1511
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,720
into a specific bucket that then turns

1512
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,520
off

1513
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,119
the sand basically now let's talk a bit

1514
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,119
about the classical psychedelics

1515
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,920
psychedelics they're starting to expand

1516
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,480
to be

1517
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,760
you know like basically everything but

1518
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,040
um classical psychedelics are whatever

1519
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,559
activates the 5-ht2a receptor

1520
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,319
agonist just means activating um

1521
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,760
so um what really happens when

1522
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,000
we take a classical psychedelic is that

1523
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,280
these your brains

1524
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,319
buckets are getting broken down

1525
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,799
into smaller and differently shaped

1526
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:23,680
buckets

1527
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,480
so your priors are getting broken down

1528
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,319
they're getting diffused

1529
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,440
into uh sort of

1530
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,960
weaker but more accurate um

1531
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,160
or more detailed um uh buckets

1532
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,520
that let your brain create an actual

1533
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,960
different reality for itself now

1534
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,680
uh where is this coming from uh when we

1535
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,880
look at the actual

1536
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,000
micro circuit of the brain um and this

1537
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,440
is of the cortical

1538
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,760
uh you have you know seven layers of

1539
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,040
your cortex

1540
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,440
and how the neurons are actually laid

1541
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,280
out there this is a very amazing

1542
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,119
paper by pasta we can see

1543
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,839
exactly the feedback loops that are

1544
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,200
correlated to

1545
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,040
uh predictive coding where are the um

1546
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,160
where's the data going upwards of which

1547
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:16,480
we

1548
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,799
see in these forward connections in

1549
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,799
purple it's coming in from layer four

1550
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,079
it's going up to layer

1551
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,000
two and then looping to layer five and

1552
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,880
then where are the backwards connections

1553
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,559
that are coming from these higher level

1554
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,559
brain areas that are correlated to our

1555
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,000
predictions

1556
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,119
um and we see that in green um

1557
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,280
coming from layer five going down to

1558
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,319
layer four

1559
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,680
doing these these feedback loops um

1560
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,079
so when we look at where the 5ht2a

1561
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,280
receptor is

1562
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,319
we see that they they're situated very

1563
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:51,359
specifically

1564
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,480
on these layer five um

1565
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,280
on the backwards connections basically

1566
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,599
so we're seeing that they're activating

1567
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,160
uh hyperactivating and making the

1568
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,599
sensitivity

1569
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,839
of these neurons uh much more sensitive

1570
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:08,319
so

1571
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,920
that's that's why um the theory is that

1572
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,200
it's causing these predictions to fire

1573
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,920
at a much lower threshold if beforehand

1574
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,680
let's imagine a whole neuronal

1575
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,720
population

1576
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,680
you'd need to get you know x amount of

1577
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,000
neurons resonating together

1578
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,640
um to create a prediction now you need

1579
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,680
much less of them

1580
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,079
just a few neurons are like throwing out

1581
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,359
their own prediction

1582
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,119
and a few other neurons are throwing out

1583
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,720
their prediction and you're getting

1584
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,319
many more competing predictions so

1585
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,280
very simple uh metaphor if you're

1586
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,720
walking down a forest

1587
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,520
in a usual state you might have a

1588
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,559
probability of 0.4 percent oh i'm gonna

1589
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:51,920
see some animals

1590
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,319
and a 0.6 percent prediction of i'm

1591
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,079
gonna see some plants

1592
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,400
but after you've taken psychedelics and

1593
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,599
these predictions have

1594
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,359
decomposed um your you might get a

1595
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,480
much more detailed uh uh

1596
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,520
prediction possibility space you know

1597
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,559
maybe you're gonna see a dog a cat hey

1598
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,480
maybe you're gonna see an elf that's you

1599
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,319
know a low probability but it's

1600
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,680
suddenly there so things that were uh

1601
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,319
below the threshold of probability are

1602
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,520
now becoming

1603
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,160
a higher threshold uh and part of your

1604
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:26,880
predictive

1605
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,079
probability space now

1606
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,720
what really happens here right um and

1607
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,160
and what's really uh

1608
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,520
sort of important is how this correlates

1609
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,160
with

1610
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,440
the rest of your bottom up sensations

1611
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,880
um if you are in a very uh

1612
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,599
getting very clean bottom up signal

1613
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:48,640
which

1614
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,880
almost never happens but let's imagine a

1615
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,079
very clear

1616
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,920
auditory signal um at least for a moment

1617
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,960
or very clear

1618
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,359
visual perception that you're getting

1619
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,799
suddenly you can have

1620
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,319
much higher accurate predictions

1621
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,240
uh and this is uh you know people on

1622
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,359
psychedelics

1623
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,359
including myself will report this quite

1624
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,960
often like oh wow

1625
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,839
i can see footprints in the forest the

1626
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,920
way i've never seen them before

1627
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,960
or this perception of uh hearing music

1628
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,440
and like the audio is just so crisp and

1629
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,880
so detailed

1630
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,200
in ways that i don't perceive them when

1631
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,119
i'm not on psychedelics

1632
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,160
um but if you are uh

1633
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,200
in a bottom-up environment where you're

1634
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,559
getting noisy signals

1635
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,520
it's dark things are constantly changing

1636
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:37,920
there's

1637
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,240
various sounds um suddenly the the

1638
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,920
possibilities and the predictions that

1639
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,440
you might be getting

1640
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,040
are might not be as correlated to

1641
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,839
you know quote-unquote objective reality

1642
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,000
suddenly your predictions

1643
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,200
can become much stronger uh um

1644
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,480
and just or much less you know

1645
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,280
accurate but still a type of overfitting

1646
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,000
might happen

1647
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,960
that's i think a good word to use here

1648
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,400
where you know oh

1649
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,559
i'm in this forest it's dark and gloomy

1650
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:11,680
there's something moving

1651
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,040
oh it's an elf right because that was

1652
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,880
part of the probability space of your

1653
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,079
prediction

1654
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,160
and with the noisy bottom up incoming

1655
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,920
sensation that was enough

1656
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,119
to reduce prediction error um but what's

1657
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,960
important to note and you can see sort

1658
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,200
of

1659
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,400
in in this very uh simple image

1660
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,839
that the decomposed predictions are all

1661
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,640
uh less strong so they're not going to

1662
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,079
turn off as much

1663
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,880
prediction error so your your brain is

1664
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,400
going to constantly be while you're on

1665
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,280
psychedelics

1666
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,440
in a state that has higher prediction

1667
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,640
error which

1668
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,480
as we saw before and we've been talking

1669
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,319
about when you have a higher prediction

1670
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:51,440
area your brain

1671
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,440
has a few different tactics that it can

1672
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,880
use to deal with it

1673
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,920
one modulating the senses two

1674
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,160
updating predictions three active

1675
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,520
inference right

1676
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,280
so this is why uh psychedelics offer a

1677
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,520
very very unique opportunity of

1678
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,599
updating your model because there's a

1679
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,760
much higher level of prediction error

1680
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,880
and then um under some situations your

1681
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,720
brain might decide to actually

1682
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,640
update the model and if people are

1683
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,039
suffering um from trauma and depression

1684
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:21,680
we're seeing

1685
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,640
absolutely amazing results in research

1686
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,039
uh around using psychedelics to update

1687
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:29,599
people's biases around these things

1688
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,559
um again very much depending on the

1689
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:33,039
setting

1690
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,079
don't expect to take psychedelics and go

1691
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:38,079
to a place where you don't feel safe in

1692
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,000
and you don't have a support structure

1693
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,160
and to get these benefits

1694
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,920
in order to update your model you need

1695
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,720
to be getting bottom up sensory inputs

1696
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,599
that are

1697
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:50,079
very strong and accurate around what's

1698
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:50,720
happening

1699
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,760
to you right now but if you do that

1700
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,640
and you are able to feel safe in your

1701
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,559
body like we've talked before be in

1702
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,640
place situations or improv or flow

1703
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,680
that might allow your brain um to really

1704
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,880
really heal

1705
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,599
deep traumas to really reprogram deep

1706
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,520
biases from childhood

1707
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,640
when your brain was more uh had this

1708
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,440
extra neural plasticity

1709
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,280
so um now let's get to active inference

1710
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,079
so the interesting part about these five

1711
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,520
ht2a receptors

1712
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,319
it is that we don't have so many of them

1713
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,480
in our motor cortex there's a lot less

1714
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,440
of them

1715
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,000
so we can actually uh say that active

1716
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,559
infra

1717
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,559
inference modulates psychedelic

1718
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:38,640
experiences and makes them

1719
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,839
uh weaker and we see this both in the

1720
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:42,799
instructions

1721
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,359
that people are given when they're doing

1722
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,200
psychedelic therapy

1723
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,039
uh right now in um at maps for instance

1724
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,839
or other

1725
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,799
um universities and hospitals that are

1726
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:55,760
researching this

1727
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,240
they really tell people lie down don't

1728
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,520
move

1729
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,160
and when i talk to therapists about this

1730
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,280
they could really say

1731
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,200
we know when something's bubbling up

1732
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,720
with the person we see this

1733
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,319
in their body when it's becoming too

1734
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,160
much they start really

1735
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,319
moving and we try to encourage them to

1736
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,640
actually stay still

1737
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,440
because they they when we start moving

1738
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:17,760
we're

1739
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,880
actually weakening the prediction error

1740
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,920
right our brain is creating a prediction

1741
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,480
that's

1742
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,480
still pretty stable because we don't

1743
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,000
have as many

1744
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,240
5-hc2a receptors that have been

1745
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,079
activated

1746
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:34,400
hyper-activated um because we took

1747
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,559
psychedelics in the motor cortex

1748
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:39,760
so our motor predictions are able

1749
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,480
to modulate this psychedelic experience

1750
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,119
and

1751
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,200
you know that the benefit of this is

1752
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,640
that oh wow if you're

1753
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,920
are doing psychedelics and you're

1754
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,760
feeling really overwhelmed move

1755
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,799
do a bunch of jumping jacks push-ups

1756
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:56,400
move around space um that's gonna really

1757
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,039
help

1758
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,280
lower uh the prediction error in your

1759
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,240
brain and

1760
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,280
uh help you be more uh

1761
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,440
back to i guess the reality you're used

1762
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,960
to

1763
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,000
so yeah this this was a uh

1764
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,720
a short uh connection between

1765
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,920
psychedelics

1766
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,960
and and active in france um

1767
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,839
that i just wanted to bring to the space

1768
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:22,480
too

1769
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,760
thank you yeah

1770
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,480
there was so much um even in that that i

1771
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:28,799
could

1772
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:33,200
uh yeah you can unsure then i will just

1773
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:36,720
um

1774
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,720
yep that's perfect i'll just then i'll

1775
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,160
just re-crop it

1776
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,920
um i guess i'll crop it while i ask this

1777
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,440
first question which is

1778
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,480
um you pointed out

1779
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,559
that a lot of even the clinical work on

1780
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,319
psychedelics is done in a way where they

1781
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,520
actually prevent movement and also like

1782
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,319
education

1783
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:57,039
stay at the desk but don't encourage it

1784
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:57,599
yeah

1785
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,760
yeah okay totally yeah like putting

1786
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,200
people in not restraint

1787
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,720
but it's it's it's only you know

1788
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,880
continue with a um authority as a

1789
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,160
restraint so just

1790
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,440
um yeah what is maybe the role of the

1791
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,079
body

1792
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,280
in uh remote work or in now that we're

1793
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,319
all so

1794
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:17,039
in um again not physically restrained to

1795
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,240
our chairs yet but

1796
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,799
it feels like that some days it's a

1797
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,079
disaster it's

1798
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,319
it's um yeah i think we're

1799
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:30,240
uh and i'm a total motor chauvinist

1800
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,680
when it comes to our brain i don't know

1801
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,520
if you've heard that term before but

1802
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,920
no i'm going to explain that yeah so

1803
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,559
basically

1804
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,359
we have a brain in cognitive functions

1805
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:40,880
because we move

1806
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,359
you know when you look at the animal at

1807
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,359
the designation between

1808
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:48,880
tree to algae to creatures and the

1809
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,920
crazy ocean to animals that move when do

1810
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,520
you start getting brains is when they

1811
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,000
move

1812
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,640
and there's a great example of some

1813
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,599
really insane

1814
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,480
sea creature that moves around and has a

1815
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,319
brain then it finds a place to plop

1816
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:03,200
itself down

1817
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,200
and digest its own brain so once

1818
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,839
um yeah it doesn't need it our our brain

1819
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:10,799
is needed

1820
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,119
to create predictions with the

1821
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:15,119
environment right this is the whole

1822
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:18,319
uh predictive coding and andy clark has

1823
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:18,559
a

1824
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:21,680
beautiful book and papers about about

1825
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,359
the feedback groups that we create and

1826
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:23,839
within

1827
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,119
with the environment and if our

1828
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,359
environment is relatively

1829
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,200
highly predictable because we're staying

1830
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,640
in the same place

1831
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,839
then guess what we don't we

1832
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,200
we don't need this uh and we and us

1833
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,280
as humans and andy clark ursula goes

1834
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,599
into that quite a lot we've sort of

1835
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,440
because we want to minimize prediction

1836
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,039
error that's that's

1837
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,760
part of this whole free energy thing in

1838
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,799
our brain

1839
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,079
um but we've done it a bit too well

1840
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,799
you know we've created these uh large

1841
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,200
scale active inferences with

1842
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,839
our environment shaping uh our

1843
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,000
supermarkets looking the same

1844
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,920
as the roads the our house um

1845
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,559
and uh i think that's a really a big

1846
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:09,119
cause

1847
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,160
of generally the mental health crisis

1848
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:12,880
that we're

1849
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,440
seeing and especially when it comes to

1850
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,198
then not even moving your body

1851
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,799
being in the same state uh physiological

1852
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,679
state that's just

1853
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:26,399
true low entropy um

1854
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,439
and that's uh really really i think i'm

1855
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,238
gonna even

1856
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,158
go to the extent of saying like my main

1857
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,080
goal and my in my

1858
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,319
work um is that one metric

1859
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,520
improve the amount of

1860
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,960
uh states your body is in for humans

1861
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,040
if i can do that then um

1862
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,719
for mo you know modern uh citizens that

1863
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,238
have a total lack of this

1864
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,799
i am absolutely certain that we're gonna

1865
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:57,920
see improvement on

1866
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,439
many metrics um that we're lacking

1867
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:06,000
so when it comes uh there and there's

1868
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,960
as much as i can to like uh not fall

1869
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,520
into

1870
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,198
this like i've been working remotely for

1871
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,759
uh even before this crazy covert thing

1872
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:16,560
happened

1873
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,600
but um you know do calls while you're

1874
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,080
walking

1875
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,560
outside or stretching outside anything

1876
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,640
that doesn't require you to be in front

1877
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,319
of a 2d screen

1878
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,439
yeah bring toys yeah create

1879
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,080
like we do have the ability to uh gamify

1880
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,319
and bring toys into our environment

1881
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,359
like i have rings outside and punching

1882
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,640
bags and

1883
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,920
um any anything that will create

1884
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,238
constraints around your movements

1885
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:47,198
you'll move your desk change your table

1886
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,000
don't work from the

1887
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,198
same space if you possibly can just keep

1888
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:52,880
bringing in that prediction

1889
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,000
or goes into your body and

1890
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,800
um and i think that's a very like

1891
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,760
incorrect way

1892
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,480
that ergonomics is looked at you know

1893
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,840
ergonomics is all about like

1894
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,920
let's find the perfect position for you

1895
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,880
to be in

1896
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,120
for many hours that doesn't exist we're

1897
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,640
not supposed to be

1898
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,640
in a perfect position just going like

1899
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,480
this um

1900
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,719
well it's it's really it's like a modern

1901
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,800
mental ergonomics and it's the

1902
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,840
um ergo the work the dynamics of a

1903
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,040
dynamical system

1904
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,360
that's us and so the ergonomics is now

1905
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,480
the back angle

1906
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,080
for the chair but then there's actually

1907
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,000
a ratio of the chair and the exercise

1908
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,920
ball or whatever that's not my specialty

1909
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,040
but it's all about

1910
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,000
changing those ratios um because

1911
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,199
whatever there is no such thing as

1912
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:42,480
the the perfect sitting state or not

1913
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,719
moving state for your body you know

1914
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,080
lying down too much

1915
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,120
gives us pressure problems

1916
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,440
and people in hospital need to be turned

1917
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,640
around

1918
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,120
to not get these things we are a dynamic

1919
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,120
physiological system

1920
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,239
and i think there's a very big gap

1921
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,280
between people that are studying

1922
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,520
these systems a lot of the times and

1923
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,719
like math people

1924
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,880
and computer science people that are

1925
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,679
just really not spending enough time

1926
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,000
connecting to their own bodies

1927
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,679
um so i think like i highly encourage

1928
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:20,800
everyone to like just find the time to

1929
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,159
figure out what you are

1930
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:25,280
as a full human being as like blood

1931
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,880
blood pressure bones tendons

1932
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,400
um and be in that space and let that

1933
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,280
those prediction take precedence at

1934
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:36,000
least

1935
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,440
a little bit of your day

1936
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,600
yeah one thing you mentioned is this

1937
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,679
like top down almost

1938
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,239
standardization and and synchronization

1939
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,400
and stabilization of the lower level

1940
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,280
states

1941
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,320
and then the the two affordances we have

1942
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,080
are kind of like our physical movement

1943
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,679
and our communication

1944
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,800
and we've seen how those are

1945
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,960
subject to top down as well as bottom up

1946
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,960
constraints but that is kind of what's

1947
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,159
being

1948
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:07,280
remapped is the constraints on our

1949
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,800
movement

1950
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,800
variously and our communications

1951
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,239
networks variously

1952
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,120
and so to have a multi-scale framework

1953
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,400
like active inference

1954
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,480
where we can talk about the remote team

1955
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,400
having input and output and then the

1956
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,199
body

1957
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,960
we can be like okay here's an algorithm

1958
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,800
that's awesome for this

1959
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,920
sector for this team but i want to be

1960
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,400
not reinforcement learning driven or not

1961
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,239
reward driven i want to have a framework

1962
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,080
that allows me to express

1963
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,760
these kinds of playful states or even

1964
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,440
have a rationale

1965
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,280
to construct these states and design for

1966
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,159
them

1967
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,560
yeah so i think there's a you that was a

1968
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,760
lot a lot of

1969
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,239
good points you brought up so maybe

1970
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,719
first the communication thing right

1971
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,880
um we're doing this this 2d

1972
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,880
sometimes only voice sometimes 2d

1973
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,480
screens that none of this is

1974
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,520
naturalistic

1975
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,920
for our brains right we're 3d creatures

1976
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,840
we pick up social cues from being able

1977
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,000
to gaze into each other's eyes predict

1978
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,679
where you're looking at

1979
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,199
um and they and it gets worse the number

1980
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,239
of people you

1981
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:15,920
bring in it's just i can't like group

1982
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,440
zooms for me are torture there's so much

1983
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,880
awkward silence so much inefficiency

1984
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,920
who's next who what is the level of even

1985
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,920
when we're in a normal social group

1986
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,080
you know i usually put little numbers

1987
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,760
around people how much i think they

1988
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,120
understood me okay this

1989
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,440
person understood seventy percent thirty

1990
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,560
percent

1991
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,880
zero and i do the same for myself and i

1992
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,560
try to be very honest with people i like

1993
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,080
i understood around thirty percent of

1994
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,520
what you just said

1995
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,600
um and that's how we are like we have

1996
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,239
different uh just data structures

1997
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:51,199
internally

1998
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,360
and managing to like minimize the

1999
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,040
differences in these data structures

2000
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,239
is a very difficult task um

2001
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:00,080
uh even when you're not working remote

2002
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,840
and remo remote work has definitely made

2003
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,480
that

2004
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,840
a lot more difficult um i've

2005
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,280
tried to use things like uh vr

2006
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,800
um and found it uh sometimes okay but

2007
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,840
also it's

2008
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,600
and i'm a superhero you know

2009
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,280
enthusiastic person

2010
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,000
and still spending more than 15 minutes

2011
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,560
in there

2012
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,120
at a period of time is just too much

2013
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,800
it's heavy it's clunky

2014
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,000
it's um a close point of view

2015
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,600
um so that's that's a difficult thing

2016
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,000
but we do try what we do try to do a lot

2017
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,040
of the times is create

2018
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,080
um mock-ups directly in vr and

2019
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,239
share this the mock-ups in vr so we

2020
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,360
understand

2021
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,080
what we're trying to build together um

2022
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,159
from this 3d perspective

2023
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,239
um generally i'm

2024
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,400
mew we have like an ar app where i'm

2025
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,560
trying to create interactive holograms

2026
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,280
so more on the social connection instead

2027
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,320
of just

2028
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:02,239
uh getting you on like a 2d

2029
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:05,040
uh screen or the facebook and instagram

2030
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,880
but getting something that moves

2031
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,040
in my space and actually interacts with

2032
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,000
me like you can

2033
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,679
blow kisses i don't know if you've ever

2034
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,679
seen the roger rabbit movie

2035
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,480
but i realized i think i got it like i

2036
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:16,880
started

2037
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,560
when i was a kid and then i built this

2038
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,920
thing i started the movie again and i

2039
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,800
was like oh wow

2040
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,679
i just built the roger rabbit thing

2041
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,120
kisses through the screen or something

2042
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,199
you you blow kisses and it goes into

2043
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:28,800
your 3d space

2044
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,120
in ar space so you can actually move

2045
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,520
around your space and catch the person's

2046
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,320
kisses so

2047
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,400
i'm really excited about the possibility

2048
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,000
of creating what's called joint

2049
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,040
action uh in cognitive neuroscience

2050
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,640
remotely and joint action is a

2051
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,880
physiological

2052
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,080
thing more than anything like if i even

2053
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,239
shake your hand or just passing you that

2054
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:53,520
pen is when i start predicting you

2055
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,600
and starting to predict you is starting

2056
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,719
to build empathy

2057
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,320
with you um so these empathy things

2058
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,199
really

2059
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,239
uh are naturalistically based on very

2060
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,320
low level of physiological data

2061
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,800
and without this because we're currently

2062
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,320
constantly on zoom

2063
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,800
and you know i i click here to send you

2064
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,679
a button

2065
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,920
to send you a chat or i raise my hand by

2066
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,679
clicking a thing and you see a thing

2067
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:18,560
over there

2068
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,320
it's much much weaker and not

2069
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,840
really creating these joint actions so i

2070
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,760
think there's a lot to explore

2071
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,040
with technology with just joint actions

2072
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,560
and um team building activities that are

2073
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,199
in vr

2074
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,840
even if for a short period of time and

2075
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,320
just

2076
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,280
simple things like let's build blocks

2077
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,400
together

2078
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,360
or things that you would do in in

2079
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,560
physical space

2080
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,880
if you could be together to just

2081
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,920
understand

2082
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,320
a bit more on this low-level prediction

2083
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,199
of

2084
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:56,239
who a person is how they move now vr is

2085
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,120
very strange

2086
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,719
because you can like mess things up i

2087
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,239
don't know if you've ever been in vr

2088
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:00,719
chat

2089
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,600
but you can interact with someone as

2090
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,880
like oh i'm now

2091
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,080
a three meter uh giant with

2092
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,640
fire wings and i'm a tiny pixie and

2093
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,199
you're just

2094
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:14,239
interacting this way um

2095
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:16,560
so i think that's really interesting and

2096
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,280
and

2097
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,679
i'm actually it can be a very

2098
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,280
interesting way of also de-biasing

2099
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:21,840
things like

2100
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,120
oh what happens if we conduct interviews

2101
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,040
that are not like we know we know

2102
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,560
there's a huge bias

2103
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,159
in um in in the whole hiring system

2104
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,719
and building teams to begin with that is

2105
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,320
not solved there's like

2106
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,440
okay you do uh um

2107
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,600
you know you don't even write sometimes

2108
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,679
hr doesn't look at the names and there's

2109
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,280
all these things to try to hide who the

2110
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,640
person is but the moment there's

2111
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,480
interviews you know who the person is

2112
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:48,960
and

2113
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,120
these racial biases come in these gender

2114
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,800
biases come in

2115
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,719
so there's a lot of really interesting

2116
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,239
ways that we could be

2117
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,520
de-biasing ourselves by just

2118
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,960
again this excessive prediction error

2119
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,159
and and the ability to really detach

2120
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,360
ourselves from

2121
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:11,520
the normal um perception that we have

2122
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,640
um that's really interesting about the

2123
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,920
physical components of

2124
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,480
remote whether it's a physical object

2125
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,760
that's going to be

2126
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,000
moving and i don't know like a you know

2127
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,360
little jellyfish that does

2128
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,159
a movement or just synchronizing and it

2129
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:28,000
made me wonder if there was like

2130
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,480
an exercise like could people just say

2131
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,080
okay beginning of this video

2132
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,960
meeting yeah maybe we all just switched

2133
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,080
over a context like

2134
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,159
let's do you know three claps and take a

2135
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,840
deep breath and just do something

2136
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,080
think of a you know purple cow and then

2137
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,840
just coordinate that way and then

2138
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,320
prepare

2139
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,600
or here's our narrative here's what

2140
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,440
we're here to do because that kind of

2141
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,800
stuff the mission

2142
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,960
which comes back to your earlier idea

2143
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,480
about like giving

2144
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,080
the information in the way that's

2145
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,320
naturalistic and what is the natural

2146
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,040
unit

2147
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,080
it's kind of the the goal the end and so

2148
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,679
having the group assemble with the

2149
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,760
synchronization and also

2150
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,360
a remembrance of the end is like really

2151
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,520
an interesting implication i think of

2152
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,480
active inference

2153
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,640
but not some of these other um sub

2154
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,920
component theories

2155
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,360
per se yeah and uh so that's also what

2156
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:15,679
i'm

2157
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:16,960
trying to do is this hardware is let

2158
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,960
people synchronize their heartbeats

2159
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,440
let me you're over there i'm over here

2160
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,840
let me send you my heartbeat as

2161
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,760
beautiful glowing pulses and you can

2162
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,520
send me your heartbeat

2163
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,040
and get this uh biophysical data that

2164
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,719
honestly if we were even

2165
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:34,080
in the same room together i wouldn't

2166
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,679
necessarily get unless i was like

2167
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,960
touching you right

2168
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,120
so i think we are and this is the

2169
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,400
exciting part of like

2170
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,640
immersive and embody technology like we

2171
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,960
are getting to the stage where we can

2172
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,440
start uh moving beyond 2d video

2173
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,400
into biophysical data that lets us get a

2174
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,400
deeper understanding a deeper connection

2175
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,080
and deeper synchronization with each

2176
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:56,960
other

2177
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,239
um well

2178
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,800
i'm happy to talk for a little bit

2179
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,320
longer if you want but i guess my

2180
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,800
closing thought or at least direction

2181
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,239
because maybe we'll see

2182
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,239
or hear from you again would be like

2183
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,159
what are the next steps for

2184
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,360
applied active inference or for um

2185
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,600
an individual who's curious about these

2186
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,360
kinds of topics is there

2187
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,520
like a website or is there a research

2188
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,960
direction where is

2189
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,719
active inference coming into play in the

2190
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,679
next months to years

2191
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,159
yeah so honestly before i heard about

2192
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,280
your

2193
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,239
podcast i've never heard about any uh

2194
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:35,280
such likes

2195
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,199
focus within the predictive coding

2196
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,120
framework i would be

2197
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,239
very excited about um

2198
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,159
connecting and this is something i've

2199
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,480
i've been trying to do is bring movers

2200
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,840
into the space it seems that there's

2201
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,600
these two different worlds

2202
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,719
there's movers that hate technology

2203
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,800
because they feel it's taking them away

2204
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,480
from their bodies

2205
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,760
um and there's there's technology and

2206
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,920
science and there's a very unfortunately

2207
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,960
very small

2208
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,360
overlap between them and that's what you

2209
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,800
know i was very lucky i found a

2210
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,920
co-founder who's

2211
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,280
in both these worlds um

2212
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,639
but if there was a way to

2213
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,639
bridge this gap and like you're saying

2214
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:17,840
these you know

2215
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,400
movement exercises it's a thing that

2216
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,199
they we do

2217
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,600
constantly and improv classes uh

2218
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,840
building physiological synchronization

2219
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,280
and the things you'll see there

2220
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,719
sometimes are just like

2221
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:31,360
this is one organism you know like

2222
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,120
people moving together

2223
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,560
not pre-decided um and there's

2224
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,239
a a beautiful research paper i think

2225
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,959
noi it's

2226
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,840
link to it afterwards um but what they

2227
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,560
did there

2228
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,679
is they tried to figure out what's going

2229
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:54,320
on

2230
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,320
uh in the brains of improvisers

2231
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,880
um and they have a beautiful like

2232
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,840
mathematical

2233
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,199
uh paper about the double feedback loop

2234
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,840
that's created so it's not and they

2235
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,679
tested two conditions leader versus

2236
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,360
follower that was more what i was

2237
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,400
testing

2238
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,520
versus um there is no

2239
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,440
leader and follower you're doing things

2240
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,560
together

2241
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,760
and they found a much higher degree of

2242
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,159
synchronization

2243
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:23,920
and a very they built a very cool

2244
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,920
paradigm of just like moving your hand

2245
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,639
on one up and down that's it very easy

2246
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:29,600
to measure

2247
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,600
but it was there the data was there they

2248
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,880
managed to find

2249
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,239
um a much higher degree of

2250
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:36,800
synchronization when there was no leader

2251
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,600
and follower

2252
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,920
between um improvisers that were either

2253
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,159
musical improvisers or dancers and

2254
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,679
trained their brain

2255
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:49,040
to tune in to the other person because

2256
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,480
when you're doing this and this is a

2257
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,159
very um

2258
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:53,840
you know when you're talking about teams

2259
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,600
and synchronizing and

2260
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,880
and play i think we really need

2261
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,560
a shift in the hierarchical structure of

2262
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,440
teams

2263
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,719
like i don't see and this is something

2264
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:07,280
that i'm

2265
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,080
you know really exploring as a ceo of a

2266
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:10,880
startup

2267
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,440
how do i get these ideas that i want out

2268
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:13,920
there

2269
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,880
but how do i bring in people's ideas so

2270
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,880
they feel that they're part of this

2271
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,400
and how do we then get a cohesive

2272
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,920
um product at the end of it

2273
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,679
not none of these are like easy

2274
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:29,120
questions uh

2275
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,040
but having um this ability to

2276
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,280
double feedback so it's not just a

2277
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,120
top-down manager

2278
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,199
right that's saying oh listen this and

2279
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,159
this you guys

2280
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:42,239
understand this and this and this this

2281
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:43,199
is my vision

2282
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,840
don't expect people to be excited about

2283
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,040
your vision

2284
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,280
right that's not how these things work

2285
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,960
if you want them to be excited

2286
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,440
and attuned you need as a you know

2287
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,159
manager

2288
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,080
in this hierarchical structure be

2289
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,159
attuned to their visions what they're

2290
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,040
seeing

2291
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,280
their perspective why did they join this

2292
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,320
project

2293
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,480
and try to get that coordinated

2294
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,400
um into a global vision that is

2295
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,120
um you know doesn't break apart because

2296
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,840
there's too many voices

2297
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,960
so none of this is easy but i think

2298
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,280
that a lot of the times yes going to the

2299
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,080
low-level

2300
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,639
physiology first and building this

2301
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:25,840
low-level physical

2302
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,320
trust with each other and understanding

2303
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,480
with each other um

2304
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,920
is really unique like me and my

2305
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,400
co-founder we dance together we climb on

2306
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,440
trees together

2307
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,000
before he moved to hawaii now we try to

2308
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,920
hang out in vr and do things together

2309
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,800
but it's really

2310
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,480
not the same um so

2311
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,880
um figuring out how to do these joint

2312
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,880
physical actions together i think will

2313
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:49,840
really

2314
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,960
get us into the future somehow

2315
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,280
or a future i want to be part of yeah

2316
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,000
nice or

2317
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,040
a likely future or one that i expect

2318
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,080
myself in um yeah but on that um

2319
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,960
tech and movers and sort of the

2320
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,280
transdisciplinary

2321
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,760
nature and the potentially productive

2322
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,360
conversation

2323
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,360
uh we we kind of think about these guest

2324
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,280
streams like it's too directional

2325
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,679
because maybe for those with a physics

2326
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:18,080
background or a philosophy background

2327
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,840
you've inspired them to think about how

2328
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,600
they're doing their physical

2329
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,360
activities or wanting to go deeper into

2330
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,960
a knowledge or movement tradition they

2331
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,239
were already a part of

2332
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:28,159
and then there's people who that's their

2333
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:29,840
daily life and then maybe this is the

2334
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,280
first time they're hearing about active

2335
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,159
inference

2336
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:35,920
so we can always do like event series or

2337
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,280
discussions or working groups or

2338
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,679
events like that or projects like that

2339
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:42,560
to help

2340
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,679
make that two-lane freeway

2341
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:47,360
like accessible for everybody and

2342
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,360
respect both directions of the

2343
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,480
interchange

2344
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,840
and it's a really important part like

2345
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,280
you said with the moving away from the

2346
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,199
hierarchy like of disciplines

2347
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,960
you know is physics the top dog

2348
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,199
discipline physics is awesome

2349
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:00,800
but it's actually a relationship i

2350
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,199
survived

2351
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,520
in physics it was dramatic

2352
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,199
it's great and then different people

2353
01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:10,239
will be drawn to different parts and

2354
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:11,840
that will be sort of like the colony

2355
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,120
phenotype

2356
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:16,320
and um when we uh when we

2357
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,000
constrain what the lower level looks

2358
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,600
like we

2359
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,440
increasingly infringe on what the higher

2360
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,880
level can be as well

2361
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,639
so it's about that balance and so that's

2362
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,239
a common theme with these active

2363
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:27,199
inference

2364
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:30,560
discussions well

2365
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,120
yeah this is awesome i really appreciate

2366
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,360
this conversation and it was uh

2367
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,360
i'm sure something that a lot of us will

2368
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,280
we listen to and think about so we hope

2369
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,000
to maybe

2370
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,360
interact with you or other communities

2371
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,440
in the future but this was really fun so

2372
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,040
thanks a lot sarah

2373
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,800
peace bye
