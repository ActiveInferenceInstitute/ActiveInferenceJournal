00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:01,870
Alexis Rozanski: Good luck!

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,446
Daniel Friedman: Hello. >>> Avel Guénin-Carlut: I'm ready. 

3
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,974
Yes, we are in. It is January 23,

4
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,586
2023. We're here in Active

5
00:00:16,618 --> 00:00:19,470
Inference Gueststream number 34.1

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,446
with Avel Guénin-Carlut. We're going to

7
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:25,686
have a 1 hour presentation, "Physics of

8
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,394
Creation: Can the free energy principle

9
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:29,042
ground the construction of physical

10
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:32,438
statespaces?" followed by about an hour

11
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:34,710
discussion. So if you're watching live,

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,078
please feel free to add questions in the

13
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:38,902
live chat and we'll also have some

14
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,810
guests. So thank you Avel for joining! And

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,490
off to you for the presentation.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,494
Avel: Hello. So this is a complete

17
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:54,378
presentation. I will first introduce

18
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:57,150
myself and the work I am I have

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,066
employment physics. I'm working creative

20
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:01,710
science under version of And Clark.

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,166
This work is instantly speaking the

22
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,834
product of Kyros research which is

23
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:10,286
laboratory which myself, Alex Rozanski,

24
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:12,434
who is present here today and other

25
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,490
people are funded to investigate issues

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,366
of relevance to political political

27
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:20,770
evolution and community science.

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,514
And the the topic will be on the physics

29
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:28,182
of creation. So creation is an Attial

30
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:30,826
term, let us say it will be

31
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:32,714
contextualized in the presentation. But

32
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:36,246
let us first define that it corresponds

33
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:38,342
to the construction of physical

34
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:41,066
possibilities, physical test basis to

35
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:43,614
talk in a more technical language. And

36
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:45,514
the original question that motivated

37
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:48,206
this research is whether or not the

38
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:49,978
federal principle a piece of math that's

39
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,726
emergence cognitive evidence which we

40
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:55,986
will get to very sooner is

41
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:59,506
capable of representing this process of

42
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:03,266
creation. So first,

43
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:05,826
I have tried the first run of this

44
00:02:05,928 --> 00:02:08,326
without getting into the technicals, it

45
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,934
did not work. So I will address the

46
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:13,894
technicals. First we will see some

47
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:16,054
concepts in physics, what they do, how

48
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:20,922
they work, how they relate to what

49
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:23,274
people typically do in physics. And

50
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,434
first I'd like to take a look at how

51
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,514
physics explain. So, physics explain

52
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:31,166
with laws. They think that in

53
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:34,254
nature you have laws and those laws are

54
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,934
basically formal statements that

55
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:37,518
constrain the possible states of a

56
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,878
system. And typically those are

57
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:43,746
entailing laws that from which you can

58
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:46,754
derive logically what the system will

59
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,918
do. An example of natural entertaining

60
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,978
law is Maxwell's equation of

61
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:54,866
electromagnetics. It is a different

62
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:57,526
Maxwell than the one that is here.

63
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,998
So what you see is four bits of

64
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:04,520
vectorial calculus that will tell you

65
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,354
how two Fields that

66
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,414
are collectively the electromagnetic

67
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:15,450
field evolve with regard

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,726
to another. So this is a formal

69
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:22,014
constraint on what ENB can do, like the

70
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,526
quality express constraint by

71
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:27,294
definition. And those can be used to

72
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,478
derive basically fully E and B given

73
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,442
boundary conditions, which is how you do

74
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,730
things in electromagnetism.

75
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,674
But what is of relevance here is that

76
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,946
any of the slope presposes basically

77
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,846
that I can define E as a virtual field.

78
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:49,334
So it presupposes what is called set

79
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:52,006
space, which is mathematical space that

80
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,006
represents a set of possible states.

81
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:57,398
Before I state delta E and delta B is

82
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,122
equal to this and this I have to state

83
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:03,402
that E exists and e can

84
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,474
take such and such states. In that case,

85
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,546
it is a vectoral space in three

86
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:12,970
dimensions and this

87
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,042
space basically it does by construction

88
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:18,766
to capture any difference that make a

89
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:22,046
difference about the system that is

90
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:25,650
targeted for any change in e.

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,222
To be basically computable by my theory,

92
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:30,194
it has to be represented in the set

93
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:33,154
space. So by construction I ant the

94
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:36,674
space to categorify every variable

95
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:39,846
of interests in my system. Given the

96
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:43,766
scope and measurement capabilities of

97
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:44,710
my theory,

98
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,066
you have underlying notion that

99
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:54,774
is basically implicitly underlying

100
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:57,706
the notion of flows and space, that is

101
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:00,654
the notion of symmetry. I cannot get

102
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,894
into the Brea detail here, but I will

103
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:04,560
try to be as complete as possible.

104
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,362
We typically understand physical

105
00:05:08,426 --> 00:05:11,594
theories outside specifically relativity

106
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:15,826
theory and some weird quantum stuff to

107
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,706
Deneve from symmetries. Symmetries are,

108
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:21,438
I will say it out loud algebraic Ronen

109
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,306
of transformation of other space that do

110
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:26,482
not affect the system's dynamics as

111
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:29,826
blunted as it's laplacene. You don't

112
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:31,334
have to understand what I just said.

113
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,982
What you have to understand is that

114
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:35,186
there are ways in which I can transform

115
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,766
the system which does not change what it

116
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:40,658
is. An example in symmetries the sailing

117
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,802
of the Jorge force arm of skin is field

118
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,906
you see that you have physically the

119
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,386
same pattern that is repeated again and

120
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:50,586
again and again readily. So if I make

121
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:53,782
a small rotation in either direction,

122
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:56,606
it will not change a thing and if I

123
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:58,286
repeat it and repeat it and repeat it

124
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,898
and repeat it and repeat it and repeat

125
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:03,230
it, I will still change my system. Like

126
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,226
formally I will apply consummation but

127
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:09,458
it does not change basically what

128
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:12,660
observable properties the system have.

129
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,166
And this is what a symmetry is.

130
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:20,806
It is a set of transformation that is

131
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:22,706
generated by a subset of smaller

132
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:25,286
transformation and that does not change

133
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:28,438
what the system observably is. And

134
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:30,502
because of this asymmetry of a system

135
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,826
that basically constrain what difference

136
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:35,180
can make a difference about the system.

137
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,714
So implication, when I formulate law

138
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:42,350
or state space I make a statement about

139
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,446
the underlying symmetries. I make the

140
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:48,238
statement that basically everything

141
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,394
that is not in the system that is not

142
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:56,130
represented as part of the system is

143
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,266
something that is symmetric, that the

144
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,780
system is symmetric with regard to that

145
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,258
on which any transformation will not

146
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:06,790
affect the system trajectory. At least

147
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,406
not in a way that is relevant to my

148
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,110
theory.

149
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,582
It works for physics because it looks

150
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:17,042
like in physics we have few symmetries

151
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:20,074
that are everywhere verified that are

152
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:22,854
fundamental in some sense it doesn't

153
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:24,906
work so well in life and mind because we

154
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:28,154
don't have that. To be specific, living

155
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:31,114
system have a structure, I do not think

156
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:34,346
it should be controversial and they have

157
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,734
considered asymmetry they have changes

158
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:38,746
that will not affect them. If I switch

159
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:41,390
all of the carbon atoms by body, I

160
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,314
scramble them between each other while

161
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,314
keeping the relation to rest. It did not

162
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:48,386
change a thing. So it is very trivial in

163
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:50,754
sense of symmetry. But basically every

164
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:54,334
structure that is me entails

165
00:07:54,382 --> 00:07:56,498
symmetries entails information that are

166
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:57,826
possible that do not affect the

167
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:00,280
structure and other tools affect it.

168
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,990
And the structure it is not a given

169
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,518
like symmetries are considered to be in

170
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:08,918
physics. It is active reconstructed by

171
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:11,386
the activity of me. If I cut myself, if

172
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,974
I fall, if my bone break, I will regrow.

173
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:16,086
Basically, we'll have circumficial

174
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:18,970
tissue that will occur and that will

175
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,786
make it okay again and it will change

176
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:24,400
what software is my body.

177
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,046
Most importantly, I was

178
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:30,926
not born that way. Like big and with a

179
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:33,966
bird and with 80 kilo of meat. I grew

180
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,514
and I grew from one single cell. And

181
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:39,694
this single cell just created an atomia

182
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:43,666
structure apparently ex nelo from

183
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,890
basically a genetic code in the context.

184
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,558
And not only that, but life in and of

185
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,506
itself evolves in a way that builds

186
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:54,326
structures that build asymmetry. And all

187
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:56,946
of this means that you can't set a stack

188
00:08:56,978 --> 00:09:00,298
space that is the set space of life in

189
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:02,666
general of any living system. The

190
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,762
symmetries that in the life system they

191
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:07,962
change to time and they change by the

192
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:11,550
own activity of this system. So any

193
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,526
living system construct set spaces and

194
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:16,446
to account for it we need a theory of

195
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:19,694
set space construction. This is the

196
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:22,910
motivation of the physics of creation

197
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,226
line of work. And this is basically I

198
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:29,778
did not permit as a question. It is the

199
00:09:29,784 --> 00:09:32,706
question that we need to keep in mind in

200
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:36,086
this discussion. So Daniel, do we have

201
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,880
any question yet?

202
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,206
Anyone? Okay, no technical issue that I

203
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:46,040
should know about?

204
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,954
Okay, so what we'll do is first look at

205
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,466
basically what we say of creation in

206
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,162
life in mind, at a conceptual level,

207
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:59,450
what is the history of the concept and

208
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,798
what I ant to do then we'll look into

209
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:06,400
the formal specifics of how we

210
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,934
try to represent physical recognition as

211
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:12,678
coherence and what limits these attempts

212
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:15,140
have. And finally,

213
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,074
we will take the reflection further and

214
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:21,714
see whether we can and how far we can

215
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:24,546
represent physical creation. The

216
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:27,526
construction of physical reality with

217
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:31,058
the tentative formalism we have framed

218
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:34,406
here. So let us

219
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:36,200
look at creation in life in mind.

220
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,706
Historically, the term of creation, it

221
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:43,114
refers to autopoieces. That means

222
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:44,746
literally self creation. And that is

223
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:47,946
attempt by an activist what became an

224
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:51,974
activist so mainly matureana

225
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:54,206
and varietal to ground the study of

226
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:55,998
cognition, the study of biology and the

227
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:58,000
way, well, the living system work.

228
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,406
They framed Autophagic theory as

229
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:05,714
basically the idea that cognition is

230
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:08,050
grounded in a way that link system

231
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,634
constructs itself, like their

232
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:11,406
metabolism, allow them to reconstruct

233
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,826
the structure. And the structure does

234
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:16,302
not have to be conserved by metabolism.

235
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,454
So you have self creation. And this is

236
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:19,846
basically the concept that try to

237
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:23,074
articulate to ground cognitive science

238
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:26,950
and later Variety and colleagues

239
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,242
tried to basically concretize this by

240
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:34,010
working on how the cognition was

241
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,706
enacted, which is it is implemented in

242
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:40,294
the body and in the concrete. Activity

243
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:43,660
of living systems. And this basically

244
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,094
was very determined to the cognitive

245
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:50,222
evidence and it framed the four E

246
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,202
approach. So the attention of cognition

247
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:54,320
beyond the brain let us say very

248
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,450
tentatively, the idea

249
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,586
that they frame is that you

250
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:05,826
can see the diagram that is taken from

251
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:10,870
the Paulo's work. And I tried to explain

252
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,694
the correlation between self

253
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,254
constitution. So let us say it is a

254
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,298
weaker, lighter, more specified notion

255
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:20,246
of the paraesis and agency. The idea is

256
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:22,326
that you have self constitution. That is

257
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:23,514
the fact that the system build

258
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:26,326
themselves and it is basically afforded

259
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:28,554
by the way during system couple with

260
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:32,558
environments. An agency is later higher

261
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,050
order of regulation of this. Disability

262
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,418
to define basically the terms of field

263
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:40,110
coupling with the environment.

264
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,670
And the idea generates

265
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,566
is that living systems there are systems

266
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:51,198
that have structural identity

267
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:53,630
that they actively generate and sustain

268
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,974
under precarious circumstances. There is

269
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:59,480
no benevolent universe that helps life,

270
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,046
that help life be life. Life has

271
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,966
basically to generate environment where

272
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:08,534
it is life and in doing so, it generates

273
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:11,274
and it sustains what it is,

274
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:14,074
its identity. And all of this is

275
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:16,666
necessary for sense making so let us say

276
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:21,520
cognition to be something to occur and

277
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,574
this is, in my opinion and to

278
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:31,354
some extent in dePolo's own opinion

279
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:34,446
somewhat wordy it is a lot of concepts,

280
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:38,194
a lot of Greek words and people have

281
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:39,906
tried to frame this in a way that is

282
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:44,434
more mathematical and formal. And the

283
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:47,954
question it generates is how to

284
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:51,074
formalize this selfcreative property of

285
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:53,170
biological colonialization and cognition

286
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,914
and in a way that is basically grounded

287
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:59,610
in material informational flow, in

288
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,638
things that are concrete physical

289
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:07,834
structure. We have a

290
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:10,150
pretty good answer to that, actually.

291
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,086
We have pretty good work that made a

292
00:14:13,108 --> 00:14:16,318
point that you had related this

293
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:18,106
somewhat high level concept to basic

294
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:21,326
physical processes. This work is the

295
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:24,126
work of Moreno Monsieur and Monteville

296
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,980
mainly, who work in forgot the name but

297
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,782
institute of and study in the Paybasque

298
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,394
in Spain. And the idea is that living

299
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,918
systems axel Costa by a closure of

300
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:38,182
constraints. So the constraint is

301
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:41,126
physical thing that shape how other

302
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:44,278
physical thing work? Very simple. If I

303
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,566
have air in a box that is closed, the

304
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:48,218
air can't live a box. It is a

305
00:14:48,224 --> 00:14:51,980
constraint. Okay. And the property that

306
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,010
integrates living things is the fact

307
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,846
that they are constituted

308
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:02,722
by a set of constraints that can lie

309
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:05,930
metabolism in a way that reconstructs

310
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,894
the same way, the same system of

311
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:11,950
constraints. And so

312
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,894
from there you have selfconstitution.

313
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:17,938
You have also structural, let us say,

314
00:15:18,104 --> 00:15:20,050
notion of biology that does not depend

315
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,106
on the matter it is made of, but on the

316
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:26,242
way it is sustained. That is, I think,

317
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:28,006
pretty good if you ant to have a

318
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,560
physicalist notion of life.

319
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,406
And we have

320
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:36,390
a very basic ontology in which

321
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,398
constraints may shape metabolism and

322
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:42,920
shape information flow as in the way

323
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,074
Livingston react to things and that

324
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,346
grounds the autonomy of living things,

325
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,274
the fact that they can recreate

326
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:55,102
themselves basically. But nothing gives

327
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:58,154
a clear link between this and cognitive

328
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:00,650
meaning or anything we could recognize

329
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,854
as cognition. So this is what we will

330
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:07,526
try to articulate next. So how driving

331
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:10,274
systems as we just defined can create

332
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:13,826
meaning. The notion I would like to

333
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,098
import is the notion of active in France

334
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:18,710
which I will not get into the

335
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,854
mathematical detail here. But the idea

336
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:24,146
is that the way the dynamics flow

337
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:26,950
literally that is entailed by an agent

338
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,622
and its environment it individuals

339
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:31,626
states that are meaningful basically an

340
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:34,246
agent will predict in a relatively

341
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:37,626
formal sense sensations that it

342
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:41,626
will not perceive perceive

343
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:44,378
but undergo and actions that we'll

344
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:47,502
undertake. And these predictions are

345
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,434
basically what's underlying meaningful

346
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:52,640
the agent it underlies what states will

347
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,630
just so happen to shape its own action

348
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,586
and be meaningful to them. This can

349
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:02,914
be framed by in a pretty simple

350
00:17:03,112 --> 00:17:06,986
poetic move by saying that biological

351
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:08,674
generative systems they do not simply

352
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:12,966
infer what is they bring about their

353
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:16,086
own reality by actively inferring what

354
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:17,586
is meaningful to them, by actively

355
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:20,310
looking for states that they think are

356
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,662
really don't fault their own structure.

357
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:25,222
And then you start to have a stronger

358
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:29,130
relation between what a physical system

359
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,346
of constraint is and how it individuates

360
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:36,286
states that are meaningful. But you

361
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:38,094
still don't have a formal theory of

362
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:41,550
basically how this metabolic flow builds

363
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,014
learning or creation like builds

364
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:49,090
a new state of possible, a new space

365
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,146
sorry of possible states that is not the

366
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,180
one it began with.

367
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,926
I have a description of a structure that

368
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,878
is the set of constraints and this

369
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:03,846
produces basically an activity of the

370
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:06,294
system, a flow of a destructure. And

371
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:09,654
this flow, it somehow constrains or

372
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:12,898
shape the structure. The system takes a

373
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:16,122
time t plus one which itself produce new

374
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:18,150
function, a new flow, et cetera, et

375
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,874
cetera, et cetera. So it is this dynamic

376
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:23,822
of I don't know what to call that self

377
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:27,214
differentiate, unfolding, whatever the

378
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:31,338
way a system of constraint

379
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:33,966
produce a flow that triple the system of

380
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,670
constraint that we want to formalize.

381
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,994
And the question we could

382
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:44,162
reframe as such we could reframe as how

383
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:46,038
does cognition, the ability to

384
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,406
understand, integrates information about

385
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:51,106
the world it enacts within biological

386
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:54,294
organization? Because cognition is

387
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:55,922
basically the flow of biological

388
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,814
organization. At least you can tell by

389
00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:01,610
it. Everything that I see is something

390
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,866
that I ant to say, bring about, that I

391
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,974
look at because of the biological

392
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:09,766
constraints I am. And therefore

393
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:12,326
the question of creation can be reframed

394
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:14,766
as how the meaning of projections to the

395
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:18,254
world is brought back to shape my own

396
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:22,014
structure. And this is

397
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:25,170
what we will try to frame mathematically

398
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,370
in the framework active Inference Lab

399
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,420
Daniel, any questions.

400
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,866
So the attempt

401
00:19:43,898 --> 00:19:46,830
that we make here is to see if we can

402
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,050
how basically we can represent creation

403
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,586
as a process of inference, which is

404
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:55,246
likely the most minimal, highly

405
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,166
recognizable way I could frame cognition

406
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:59,106
as something that is distinct from

407
00:19:59,208 --> 00:19:59,970
simply.

408
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,246
Let us look at a piece of math that is

409
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:08,182
called the Fancy principle and that is

410
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:10,710
the formal motivation or grounding for

411
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,774
active in France. It will

412
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:16,826
be the hard part for people who do not

413
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,602
do math or people who are not already

414
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:21,994
familiar with principle I will work with

415
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:25,670
slowly it is a piece of math that frames

416
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,226
statistical coherence from the

417
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:29,094
mechanical system theory. Chemical

418
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:31,294
system theory is basically the idea that

419
00:20:31,332 --> 00:20:33,518
you have states and they move as a

420
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,874
function of each other. And what the FEP

421
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:39,406
does is to prove that. If I have

422
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:41,502
something that is called Markov blanket

423
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:46,020
so boundary that

424
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,722
any information must travel through for

425
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:53,730
two subsystem to communicate radically

426
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,774
then you have a synchronization that

427
00:20:56,812 --> 00:20:59,622
emerged between states that are outside

428
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:02,422
this boundary and states that are inside

429
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:05,914
this boundary. And not

430
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:09,180
only this, but if I measure basically

431
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,786
every state that is on the inside of the

432
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:17,058
boundary entails belief, entails equal

433
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:20,320
distribution over the external states

434
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,950
and the flow of internal states is such

435
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,362
that it minimizes the international

436
00:21:26,426 --> 00:21:29,520
distance between the

437
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,260
actual external states. Well,

438
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,618
what I can observe and what I believe to

439
00:21:35,624 --> 00:21:38,866
be the case where I of course is the

440
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:42,610
external states so that was abstract.

441
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,920
The basic and formal meaning of this

442
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,438
is that if I have a chemical system and

443
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:54,034
I have a boundary that acts to mediate

444
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:55,606
information exchange between two

445
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:59,178
subparts then both subparts can

446
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:02,570
basically represent each other and hold

447
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,914
belief in each other in a way that

448
00:22:05,952 --> 00:22:08,394
is constructed by the systematic

449
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:11,534
synchronization across the boundary. It

450
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:14,954
is quite abstract and quite minimal.

451
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,398
But it is a foul proof that we can have

452
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,062
representation, we can have cognitive

453
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:23,986
meaning from a very very minimal set

454
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:26,098
of hypothesis, which is basically a

455
00:22:26,104 --> 00:22:30,018
consistent causal structure. And it is a

456
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:33,982
pretty good case that basic technical

457
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:36,318
system, for example constraints,

458
00:22:36,414 --> 00:22:38,614
constraint will be motoring robots this

459
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:40,742
kind of very basic noncommittee things

460
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:44,658
can entail cognitive niche

461
00:22:44,684 --> 00:22:47,910
has been argued that it does underly

462
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,050
agency and creativity and similar

463
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,186
concepts that would entail, in my

464
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,374
opinion, creation as a prerequisite. So

465
00:22:57,412 --> 00:23:00,554
we'll try to see whether the FEP

466
00:23:00,602 --> 00:23:04,560
actually can represent creation as the

467
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,450
ability for agent to individuate states

468
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,060
that are spinning to them.

469
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,434
The thing is that the existence of Mark

470
00:23:18,472 --> 00:23:20,482
of Blancate is monitoring for any

471
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:22,834
complex stochastic chemical system so

472
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:25,794
chemical system that are random and this

473
00:23:25,832 --> 00:23:27,286
transmission realized as basically

474
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:30,662
something that moves in function of

475
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:34,566
itself plus random noise it is

476
00:23:34,588 --> 00:23:37,370
a very generative formulation arguably

477
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,054
anything that exists can be framed

478
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:46,570
as such. So we should be optimistic

479
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,726
for the ability of this to

480
00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:56,698
represent the cognitive introduction

481
00:23:56,714 --> 00:23:58,874
of cognitive meaning by basic biological

482
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:02,066
system and therefore creation it is not

483
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:06,706
the case because when I frame something

484
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:10,946
as x of te equal something when

485
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:13,350
I have to preface x we have to define

486
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,160
space of states that is x.

487
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,206
And I have defined creation as the

488
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:23,762
ability to construct basically physical

489
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:27,282
possibilities. So by construction

490
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:29,126
if you frame something within the

491
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:30,882
Microsoft theory you have to interview

492
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:33,046
states a priority. What you have written

493
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:35,386
down is not creation. It can be a ant of

494
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:37,226
creation. It can be interesting in the

495
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:39,786
study of creation. It is not creation,

496
00:24:39,818 --> 00:24:41,610
it is not the construction of physical

497
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,294
spaces and it is likely not the

498
00:24:45,332 --> 00:24:47,566
construction of cognitive meaning at

499
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:50,560
least in the sense that an activist and

500
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,180
autopoietic theory people mean it.

501
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,786
It just underwrites what become

502
00:24:56,888 --> 00:24:59,330
measurable for a given subsystem within

503
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,098
the stochastic chemical system which is

504
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:05,190
a lot but is not again creation.

505
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,750
Let us think about how we

506
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,390
should go. We should think of creation.

507
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,158
There will be more math here, I'm

508
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:20,618
afraid. But if a system is

509
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:23,866
to observe another system it

510
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:25,706
will have to lose information about its

511
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:29,100
broader environment. It is pretty

512
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,854
easy. It is something can derive from

513
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:37,360
first principle because basically

514
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,980
if you frame it as a quantum system

515
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,306
observation will entail entanglement by

516
00:25:44,328 --> 00:25:47,554
definition I observe a system and it

517
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:50,786
becomes something that has in the states

518
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:54,114
because I become entangled with it.

519
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:56,782
So its states become physically

520
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,618
synchronized with my state. But I cannot

521
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:01,206
synchronize with everything all the

522
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:05,014
time. So if I act so

523
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:07,194
as to have more knowledge about the

524
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:10,794
object, I act so as to have

525
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:13,754
less knowledge about my environment. So

526
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:15,274
there is no basically Costa less

527
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:17,326
observation. It is something that can be

528
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:19,406
derived in the quantum setting that can

529
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:21,642
be reframed in other way in classical

530
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:25,562
settings. Because of the way observation

531
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,550
will either induce heating information

532
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,314
loss or cause myself to

533
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:34,706
forget information. You can pretty much

534
00:26:34,888 --> 00:26:36,946
derive it in a variety of case. It is

535
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:40,290
likely true in all cases. And it means

536
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,934
that observation as

537
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:47,638
it is constrained by my own flow and the

538
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:49,814
way I culture with the environment it

539
00:26:49,852 --> 00:26:53,602
does not simply entail the observation

540
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,894
of preexisting well integrated physical

541
00:26:55,942 --> 00:26:59,626
states. It brings about well

542
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:02,650
defined observables for me to observe

543
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,862
the way how to say given

544
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:14,862
this it is hard maybe not possible to

545
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:18,158
frame a theory of conversation from a

546
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:20,814
mathematical theory that entails a very

547
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,554
well and ejected physical states. If I

548
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:25,586
frame such a theory of observation or

549
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:28,002
measurement of cognitive meaning it will

550
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:32,326
not be general. And I

551
00:27:32,348 --> 00:27:36,806
pretty much have to work creation on the

552
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:40,566
very fundamental scales ant which my

553
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:44,482
theory operates. And this is something

554
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:48,966
that is arguably done by reframing

555
00:27:48,998 --> 00:27:51,318
of the engineer principle for generic

556
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:54,250
quantum systems by mainly crease Fields.

557
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,162
The idea is to use category

558
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:02,858
theoretic equivalence between lots

559
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:04,830
of things. I will definitely not get

560
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,078
into that. To will frame the

561
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:10,400
synchronization dynamic that's in view

562
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,866
that builds cognitive meaning.

563
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:16,338
According to the French principle as a

564
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:19,474
series of binary measurements are

565
00:28:19,512 --> 00:28:22,842
equivalently asymmetry brain operators.

566
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:25,622
So the way a chemical system

567
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:28,230
synchronized with its environment under

568
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,814
the FEP is reframed here as

569
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:33,782
basically a series of binary questions

570
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:38,282
that I ask my environment and that

571
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:41,706
enforce my interaction with it in such a

572
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:44,186
way that the answers to my questions

573
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:48,954
become physical facts which

574
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:52,160
you can derive from water, general

575
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,790
quantum information theory background.

576
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,046
But that gives basically no structure

577
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:02,610
whatsoever to the measurement. Nothing

578
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,274
in this theory says what kind

579
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:08,466
of system can ask what kind of

580
00:29:08,488 --> 00:29:11,966
questions. And this means that okay,

581
00:29:12,088 --> 00:29:15,666
this drives correlation, maybe drives

582
00:29:15,698 --> 00:29:18,242
individuation of physical possibilities,

583
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:21,222
physical observables. But it does not

584
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:23,206
constrain at all what this creation is.

585
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,426
So it does not explain much and doesn't

586
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,342
help much to understand how living

587
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:32,074
system recreates itself. So we still

588
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:36,422
have somehow to recruit the cognitive

589
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:38,074
and immigrant formulation of the FEP

590
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:41,850
that I discussed very tentatively

591
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:42,750
earlier.

592
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,920
So let us take things from there.

593
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,606
I have turned during this formal

594
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:54,978
discussion from the notion that we have

595
00:29:54,984 --> 00:29:57,234
to represent creation in the living and

596
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:59,522
cognitive world to the notion that

597
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:01,774
somehow it is necessary present creation

598
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:05,986
of physical reality like the underlying

599
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:07,670
states of physics.

600
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,806
This third part with this third part

601
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:15,942
will serve mainly to discuss this claim

602
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:19,914
and what it means and what

603
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:21,420
we should do with it. Basically.

604
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,506
First, I want to show basically

605
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:29,738
that the claim that there is no a

606
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,382
priority physical validity is a pretty

607
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:34,334
basic claim. It should not be treated as

608
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:36,126
exceptional. It is necessary property of

609
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:39,734
a coherent physics. It is necessary

610
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:43,538
property actually of the formulation or

611
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,870
description of a world that is beyond

612
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,834
what we call metaphysics. Let us be more

613
00:30:48,872 --> 00:30:53,620
specific in the argumentation. I call

614
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,774
this argument that agent from

615
00:30:56,812 --> 00:31:00,326
ontological consistency an ontology that

616
00:31:00,348 --> 00:31:02,902
is naturalistic, that serves to present

617
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:06,454
nature, if it is consistent, cannot call

618
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:09,146
on to external objects that will not be

619
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:12,426
natural to explain the properties of its

620
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:15,180
own objects. For example, if I tell you

621
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,550
this thing is black because it reflects

622
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,134
the light in such and such way and I can

623
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,406
also explain the properties of light,

624
00:31:25,588 --> 00:31:28,254
it is self consistent. If I tell you

625
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,066
this thing is black because God will

626
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,114
need and I cannot explain you what God

627
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,714
is physically, it is not self

628
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:37,300
consistent. There is no property that is

629
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,342
framed by Alexey Rozanski who is present

630
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:44,034
here as the property of self function.

631
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:46,338
Consistency that is that dentology

632
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:49,846
should basically include itself. The

633
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:53,830
discourse we have on physics is unless

634
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,906
we have very radical position about the

635
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,042
correlation between human and the other

636
00:32:00,096 --> 00:32:02,026
world, it is something that exists in

637
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,946
nature and that is something that we

638
00:32:03,968 --> 00:32:07,306
need to account as an

639
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:10,554
element of nature. This entails two

640
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:13,866
things. One thing actually it entails

641
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,926
that scientific presentations, the

642
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:19,166
models and theory we have and the

643
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,680
property those models and theory have,

644
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,646
they must be accounted for as natural

645
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:28,594
entities in their own rights and they

646
00:32:28,632 --> 00:32:30,350
must be, at least in principle,

647
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,762
explanators by the tools of physics

648
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,742
and science. And this entails in turn

649
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:40,118
that I cannot have such a thing as

650
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:42,630
a law asymmetry or a set space that

651
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,834
preexist physics. Any statement I make

652
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:48,646
about physics must itself be explained

653
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:51,770
by physical processes. I will elaborate

654
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,094
on what it means. The view of physicist

655
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:58,654
is typically that we are theories and

656
00:32:58,692 --> 00:33:01,118
those theories are representation of the

657
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:04,350
world that just so happen to account for

658
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,686
fundamental structure of the world. For

659
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:09,886
example, we have the Maxwell law of

660
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:13,562
electromagnetics electromagnetism

661
00:33:13,706 --> 00:33:17,010
and those laws are representations

662
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,946
of a force that exists and

663
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:24,802
that is generative by su

664
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:29,062
one I think by asymmetry in

665
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:31,160
the Hamiltonian, sorry,

666
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,914
asymmetry in the quantum property of

667
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:39,286
systems. But this symmetry

668
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:41,786
preexists basically any attempt to

669
00:33:41,808 --> 00:33:44,698
represent any physical process. It is a

670
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,294
fundamental property. What I say is that

671
00:33:47,332 --> 00:33:49,342
you cannot have fundamental property,

672
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,450
you cannot have something that predates

673
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,290
physics and that cannot

674
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,126
ultimately be explained. And if you

675
00:33:58,148 --> 00:34:01,186
admit such a thing, your ontology is not

676
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:03,326
consistent because you have to admit

677
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:05,934
some things that are beyond that predate

678
00:34:05,982 --> 00:34:08,158
nature to exploration things in nature

679
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,394
which is the opposite of

680
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:13,560
what selfconsistency is.

681
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,622
So if I want to frame a world where

682
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,494
you do not have explanation that Conor

683
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,430
on two things that are beyond physics,

684
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,534
you have to have lots of entries in

685
00:34:24,572 --> 00:34:27,142
spaces that are constructed by physical

686
00:34:27,206 --> 00:34:30,758
processes. And it is not a problematic

687
00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:33,398
view to have at least epistemologically,

688
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:37,146
it is necessary. Let us

689
00:34:37,328 --> 00:34:40,010
discuss what it means concretely.

690
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,602
We have cognitive systems, not

691
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,654
coincidence systems they perceive. And

692
00:34:46,692 --> 00:34:48,586
this perception brings about cognitively

693
00:34:48,618 --> 00:34:51,054
relevant states which the cognitive

694
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:53,906
agent experience as real. We have

695
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,014
physical observers. These physical

696
00:34:56,062 --> 00:34:58,306
observers bring about what we call

697
00:34:58,328 --> 00:35:01,330
ponter states that are wellinvigorated

698
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,302
states that are measurable. And those

699
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:07,478
states constitute physical reality at

700
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:09,622
least as any given observer can

701
00:35:09,676 --> 00:35:12,854
experience it. What I say here is

702
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:16,626
that this is not epistemic

703
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,894
notions. The ponting states and the

704
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:21,434
cognitively relevant states that

705
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:25,462
perception, the cognitive

706
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:27,486
relevant state under perception by

707
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:30,958
agents. They are Riol and they are

708
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:33,950
invigorated as riol by their

709
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,406
observation. And if we frame it

710
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:40,738
properly, the Qfep at least

711
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:43,630
what we could do with the Qfep.

712
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,850
It represents how protomines, at least

713
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,422
particles, agents that have properties

714
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:51,106
that we classically understand as

715
00:35:51,128 --> 00:35:54,274
mindful, they individual physical

716
00:35:54,322 --> 00:35:56,678
observable, which means that they create

717
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:59,206
a spaces, which means that this is a

718
00:35:59,228 --> 00:36:01,634
theory of creation, not simply a theory

719
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:04,826
of how access reality, but a theory of

720
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:07,020
how we get reality in the first place.

721
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,114
And to do

722
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:13,962
anything like grounding properly this

723
00:36:14,016 --> 00:36:17,290
claim, it will take a lot more details

724
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,042
and I will try to work

725
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:25,806
by showing what such a

726
00:36:25,828 --> 00:36:27,806
theory would do because obviously I do

727
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:30,134
not have such a theory that is framed

728
00:36:30,202 --> 00:36:32,594
formally from start to finish as of now.

729
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:34,034
And if I did, I would not present it.

730
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:37,774
Now let us look at the way constraint

731
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:40,462
basically creates the relative

732
00:36:40,526 --> 00:36:45,626
experience this is Lagrange

733
00:36:45,678 --> 00:36:48,360
of how, as humans on the world,

734
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,280
the social world,

735
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,280
basically, we understand things like

736
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,214
constraints over what we do and

737
00:36:58,252 --> 00:37:00,554
can do and what entails. I understand

738
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:02,614
that if I talk to you in proper English,

739
00:37:02,662 --> 00:37:05,066
you will understand if I talk to you in

740
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:06,506
French Australia, you will not

741
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:08,758
understand. Understand that if I

742
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:11,086
address, it will be inappropriate. And

743
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:14,334
if I hold myself in a certain way. It

744
00:37:14,372 --> 00:37:17,486
will lead you to believe me more or less

745
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:19,774
understand that if I start speaking very

746
00:37:19,812 --> 00:37:21,666
loud, it will disturb people and they

747
00:37:21,688 --> 00:37:23,826
will act for me to stop talking very

748
00:37:23,848 --> 00:37:26,046
loud. I understand very basic facts

749
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:29,922
about how this world work and I

750
00:37:29,976 --> 00:37:31,906
understand how this constrained the

751
00:37:31,928 --> 00:37:34,222
action I can take and the consequences

752
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,386
of that action. What experience is

753
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:39,094
basically a sociocultural escape which

754
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:42,934
exists independently from me and that I

755
00:37:42,972 --> 00:37:47,734
act within. And what

756
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:51,438
I claim is that this sociocultural

757
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:53,914
landscape evolves in a way that is

758
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:56,074
creative, that is basically abuse. New

759
00:37:56,112 --> 00:37:58,334
norms exist that did not exist ten years

760
00:37:58,372 --> 00:38:00,766
ago. And that is even more true for 1

761
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:03,166
million ago or before human were a

762
00:38:03,188 --> 00:38:06,782
thing. And the way I can represent how

763
00:38:06,836 --> 00:38:09,450
Agent tried to understand this social

764
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,586
landscape and possibly fail our

765
00:38:13,688 --> 00:38:16,434
errors, norms and the landscape in such

766
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:19,554
way it is equivalent representation of

767
00:38:19,752 --> 00:38:22,670
the landscape itself and the constraints

768
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,506
that constitute this landscape and the

769
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:27,970
way the flow of the landscape

770
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,286
reconfigures the landscape. So what I

771
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:35,282
did here is to basically frame

772
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:39,290
a theory of creative evolution. These of

773
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,166
sets of constraints well of a structural

774
00:38:42,198 --> 00:38:45,562
landscape on the way

775
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:48,394
individual agents ant understand and

776
00:38:48,432 --> 00:38:51,674
act. Within this landscape, I have

777
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:55,006
sensed in which Costa observation and

778
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:58,990
cognition about physical. Here a social

779
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,246
reality, but still physical in the sense

780
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:03,060
that it exists in the physical world.

781
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,458
How this landscape can be created by

782
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:09,794
something that is cognitive and this

783
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:12,882
basic ontology, if I am correct, here is

784
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:15,334
something we can mathematize I hope so.

785
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:17,682
And that we can frame as a basic theory

786
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:20,802
of the individual, of new physical

787
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:24,354
possibilities, creation ie.

788
00:39:24,482 --> 00:39:28,546
Note to this graph

789
00:39:28,578 --> 00:39:32,700
is given to in a brilliant and

790
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,066
what is of importance here is the

791
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:40,302
duality between two representation, two

792
00:39:40,356 --> 00:39:42,686
perspective the perspective of agents

793
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:46,394
that basically enact social culture

794
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:49,040
constraints that they experience as a

795
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,450
physical fact as a reality they cannot

796
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:57,486
go beyond or escape or maybe affect

797
00:39:57,598 --> 00:39:59,246
in brute force. That's a possibility,

798
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,646
but not escape. And the perspective of a

799
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:05,634
set of constraints that endlessly

800
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:09,286
unfolds in a way that is creative and

801
00:40:09,308 --> 00:40:11,926
that is a formal intuition I plan to

802
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:16,202
build on. And I can say

803
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:17,978
something a bit more specific about how

804
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:19,766
it works by analogy to the boundary

805
00:40:19,798 --> 00:40:23,690
principle and the autographic principle.

806
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,510
Basically creation operator,

807
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,454
in my opinion, I could argue for that.

808
00:40:31,492 --> 00:40:33,422
I will not do this in detail. Right now

809
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,198
is something that goes for space

810
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:39,966
of it's not actually a space. Of

811
00:40:39,988 --> 00:40:42,354
physical possibilities. It's a space of

812
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:43,906
potentialities. It does not have

813
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,242
possible states and impossible states.

814
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:48,962
It is just the statement that something

815
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:51,154
is possible. It's very close to what

816
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:54,646
Greeks called chaos. So you have such a

817
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:59,186
space of unintivitted

818
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:01,094
possibilities and from this space

819
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:03,942
unfolds a pair of an individual

820
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:06,422
observable which is called e for

821
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:09,862
environment and an agent that is capable

822
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:13,786
to observe this observable. And the

823
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:17,050
agent is also capable to maintain

824
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,250
boundary between itself and the

825
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,354
observable. Or basically it's observable

826
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:25,486
to stay existing as observable to be

827
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:26,270
observed.

828
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,842
And from this, I think that

829
00:41:33,896 --> 00:41:36,690
some mathematical operator that has this

830
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,142
basic flow is capable to describe

831
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,240
the construction of physical spaces as

832
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,742
the unfolding strictly strictly no

833
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,880
metaphorically a physical structure as

834
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,310
basically the

835
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,106
emergence, the coconstruction, the

836
00:41:56,128 --> 00:41:58,986
integration, as you will, of well

837
00:41:59,008 --> 00:42:00,826
integrated observable states. An

838
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:02,666
observer that is capable to see the

839
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,058
state and Bijan in active states

840
00:42:04,144 --> 00:42:07,850
maintaining whatever worked as and

841
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,202
integrated space of possibilities before

842
00:42:10,336 --> 00:42:12,494
as well integrated boundary between

843
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,766
itself and the system. Let us think,

844
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:17,822
for example, of a piece of paper. I,

845
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:20,398
an agent, can basically write things on

846
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,746
it. And by writing things on it I create

847
00:42:23,928 --> 00:42:25,794
new physical observable which is the

848
00:42:25,832 --> 00:42:28,354
content of what I've written. And the

849
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:31,458
fact I write on it and I read it makes

850
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:35,046
the piece of paper not a piece of

851
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:38,694
paper but a boundary between myself and

852
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:41,362
a semiotic space where the writing

853
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:44,766
occurs. This is the basic dynamic

854
00:42:44,818 --> 00:42:48,090
that must be framed for us to understand

855
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,702
cognitive meaning and that if we framed

856
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:55,222
in such way could work to describe

857
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:58,582
the construction of the spaces x nilo

858
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:01,006
because literally you do not need

859
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:03,294
physical possibilities to be a thing for

860
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:05,566
B to exist. It is the point of this

861
00:43:05,588 --> 00:43:07,406
presentation. You don't need a space of

862
00:43:07,428 --> 00:43:10,670
possibilities to preexist the

863
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,206
function of the agent and the

864
00:43:12,228 --> 00:43:14,926
government. This is why it is relevant

865
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:16,542
and this is why it is hard to formulate.

866
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:18,850
And given an operator with this property

867
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,506
we can pretty much work it back at the

868
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:22,774
function of physics and see what

869
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:25,286
happens. So how about physics of

870
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:30,002
creation? Let us tie

871
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:33,880
the threads of this presentation. I will

872
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,210
formulate three take on messages.

873
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,746
First, we have something that is called

874
00:43:40,768 --> 00:43:43,498
the FEP that is not framed, that is

875
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:45,494
mainly framed as barriers and mechanics

876
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:49,830
as informational enrichment

877
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,302
of demeacosystem theory but that can

878
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:55,578
also be framed as something in quantum

879
00:43:55,594 --> 00:43:59,040
information theory. It says that agents

880
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,802
actively infer states of bidding through

881
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:06,706
their engagement with the environment in

882
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,690
a way that maintains their structure.

883
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,610
This gives us a formal background.

884
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:17,166
The quantum frame it of the sorry,

885
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:20,470
quantum framing of it gives us very,

886
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,200
very generative and hard to say.

887
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,278
I would not say ill specified, but very

888
00:44:28,364 --> 00:44:31,786
few specified doesn't have

889
00:44:31,808 --> 00:44:34,394
a lot of detail. So it gives us a very

890
00:44:34,432 --> 00:44:36,874
not detailed round for a study of how

891
00:44:36,912 --> 00:44:40,314
committee meaning underwrites the

892
00:44:40,352 --> 00:44:42,590
construction of physical set spaces.

893
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,430
But because it is very abstract and not

894
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,834
very specified. We have related in

895
00:44:50,872 --> 00:44:53,134
a much stronger way to the classical

896
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:55,634
formulation of the FEP where the

897
00:44:55,752 --> 00:44:58,050
internal flow of the agent and the

898
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,446
synchronization manifolds that emerge

899
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:03,462
from the interaction have a very

900
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:05,782
specific topology, have a very specific

901
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:09,158
geometry and can be equipped with

902
00:45:09,244 --> 00:45:10,754
meaning about the underlying physical

903
00:45:10,802 --> 00:45:13,880
structure. Second,

904
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,102
we have to admit that passport realism

905
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:21,354
is a thing. We have to admit that

906
00:45:21,392 --> 00:45:23,114
there is something wrong in how we view

907
00:45:23,152 --> 00:45:26,934
science. Let us quote

908
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:29,306
Einstein if without in any way

909
00:45:29,328 --> 00:45:30,846
determining system we can predict with

910
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:32,522
certainty the value of a physical

911
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:34,446
quantity, then there exists and the

912
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:35,966
amount of reality corresponding to that

913
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:39,134
quantity. By this account, nothing is

914
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:42,580
real, which is a very big problem,

915
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,620
a very bad position to hold.

916
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,700
And we have in some sense to account

917
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,054
for the role of observation in creating,

918
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:57,234
well integrating physical states not

919
00:45:57,272 --> 00:45:59,586
only for quantum physics, not only for

920
00:45:59,608 --> 00:46:01,718
cognitive science, but for everything in

921
00:46:01,724 --> 00:46:04,866
between, which is in some sense entailed

922
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:07,574
by quantum physics, in some sense

923
00:46:07,612 --> 00:46:09,158
entailed by cognitive science. So I

924
00:46:09,164 --> 00:46:10,506
don't think it is a very big deal to say

925
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:12,826
that, but I think it will be taken as

926
00:46:12,848 --> 00:46:16,618
such. And the statement I

927
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:19,710
want to make is that not only doing away

928
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,538
with this brand of realism is compatible

929
00:46:22,634 --> 00:46:24,910
with naturalistic Dean with science,

930
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,390
but it's also necessary because for

931
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,986
naturalistic science to be a thing, I

932
00:46:32,008 --> 00:46:35,700
have to represent myself representing as

933
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,986
there is something metaphysical that

934
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:41,298
comes to play either as taking myself

935
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:45,026
as a detached, nonphysical describer of

936
00:46:45,048 --> 00:46:48,694
the world or by postulating some kind of

937
00:46:48,812 --> 00:46:51,734
godlike preexisting structure that I

938
00:46:51,772 --> 00:46:53,654
just swapped to stumble upon. You will

939
00:46:53,692 --> 00:46:55,254
have something that is in physics in

940
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:58,438
some sense if you don't do away with

941
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,340
this brand of evidence. People ism and

942
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,634
it has been said to me that it is not a

943
00:47:04,672 --> 00:47:08,026
new view. No, it is not. It has

944
00:47:08,048 --> 00:47:10,646
been framed as a criticism of the notion

945
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:13,262
of fat man thinking itself by early

946
00:47:13,316 --> 00:47:15,006
Buddhist philosopher about 3 million

947
00:47:15,028 --> 00:47:18,894
years ago. And the fact it is not

948
00:47:18,932 --> 00:47:21,746
new is not really a problem in my

949
00:47:21,768 --> 00:47:24,722
opinion. We should go with things that

950
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:28,018
seem true, whether or not they are

951
00:47:28,104 --> 00:47:31,346
exciting and novel and the fact

952
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,040
that we can have a cosmology without

953
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,198
practicing nature and other people

954
00:47:38,284 --> 00:47:41,542
do not find any problem with it should

955
00:47:41,596 --> 00:47:43,894
be a sign that maybe our insistence that

956
00:47:43,932 --> 00:47:46,234
no, there are things in themselves is

957
00:47:46,272 --> 00:47:47,610
not well motivated.

958
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:54,214
And finally, what I propose

959
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:57,642
here, beyond physical

960
00:47:57,706 --> 00:48:00,910
considerations and dimension of what

961
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,782
some piece of math do is very

962
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:08,922
very very basic. Not draft, but drawing

963
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:12,318
of physical creation that holds

964
00:48:12,414 --> 00:48:14,580
in two movements. The first is

965
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,250
abstractly the inclination of something

966
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,818
from nothing, of order ant cows given

967
00:48:22,904 --> 00:48:26,100
a space of undefined possibilities b

968
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,394
you are the inclination of an observable

969
00:48:29,442 --> 00:48:33,030
that is well defined and of an agent

970
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,130
whose observation of e also individuals

971
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:41,420
boundary. So we have this kind of

972
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,178
framing that could

973
00:48:47,264 --> 00:48:50,858
work as a handle on how to write

974
00:48:51,024 --> 00:48:53,998
suspense construction. It does have a

975
00:48:54,004 --> 00:48:56,730
very strong category 30 called Filler

976
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,882
from the way basically the content of B

977
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:03,458
is not what's at stake. This diagram is

978
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:06,514
pretty much agnostic concerning what B

979
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:08,626
is and is not. And it must be because it

980
00:49:08,648 --> 00:49:13,090
underwrites the becoming of B and

981
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,838
there is a lot of work if I want the

982
00:49:16,844 --> 00:49:18,774
physics of function to be a thing in

983
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:20,646
framing properly. What kind of

984
00:49:20,668 --> 00:49:23,622
mathematical operator basically follow

985
00:49:23,676 --> 00:49:26,362
the flow of this diagram and what those

986
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:29,946
mathematical operators do and the

987
00:49:29,968 --> 00:49:32,586
kind of physics they comma to life. But

988
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:36,618
for this I have concerning case I have

989
00:49:36,704 --> 00:49:38,986
the case of how humans collaborate to

990
00:49:39,008 --> 00:49:41,582
build and recreate social norms because

991
00:49:41,636 --> 00:49:43,966
it is a case of creation. Like it is

992
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:45,754
pretty much the single case of creation

993
00:49:45,802 --> 00:49:49,406
I could convince anyone is a thing there

994
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:51,086
is money because we believe there is

995
00:49:51,108 --> 00:49:52,706
money and it works as we believe it

996
00:49:52,728 --> 00:49:54,386
works because we believe it works this

997
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,706
way. It is very true statement to say

998
00:49:56,728 --> 00:49:59,986
that norms constrain us because

999
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:03,890
we believe in norms and the

1000
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,454
duality it affords between

1001
00:50:05,512 --> 00:50:07,766
representation of single agent trying to

1002
00:50:07,788 --> 00:50:09,958
understand and act within a social world

1003
00:50:10,124 --> 00:50:12,886
and the flow, the interesting flow that

1004
00:50:12,908 --> 00:50:16,854
is created by social constraints and

1005
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:20,234
that recreates social constraints it is

1006
00:50:20,272 --> 00:50:21,546
pretty specific. It is much more

1007
00:50:21,568 --> 00:50:25,146
specific than the vague operator and

1008
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:27,786
on the left and I know this operator

1009
00:50:27,898 --> 00:50:31,774
must represent that. So it gives

1010
00:50:31,972 --> 00:50:34,458
basically some level of grip ant distant

1011
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:37,134
level on how the physics operation would

1012
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:40,706
work. And they would work by

1013
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:42,334
describing the unfolding of physical

1014
00:50:42,382 --> 00:50:45,170
structure as the construction within

1015
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,262
physics of meaning and or constraints

1016
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:52,090
over what is observable by viva Nigeria

1017
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:55,654
observers. And pretty

1018
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:57,558
much we have to work from there,

1019
00:50:57,644 --> 00:51:01,894
because I do not think there

1020
00:51:01,932 --> 00:51:05,222
is no Axel Costa in the sense I

1021
00:51:05,356 --> 00:51:07,334
introduced earlier. There is no self

1022
00:51:07,372 --> 00:51:09,226
consistent therapistics if we don't do

1023
00:51:09,248 --> 00:51:10,940
that, so let's do that.

1024
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,090
This work, again, is to some extent

1025
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,274
my work is to some extent the collective

1026
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:25,406
work of Keros, which is basically a

1027
00:51:25,428 --> 00:51:28,586
battery that works towards an active

1028
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:31,710
sense and active naturalism, a sense

1029
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,474
that is naturalist in the sense that it

1030
00:51:33,512 --> 00:51:35,842
plays the observer within the world and

1031
00:51:35,976 --> 00:51:38,814
works within well defined causal

1032
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:42,930
ontology rather than less well defined

1033
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,670
laws and abstract principles.

1034
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,326
And it tries to do so in a way that

1035
00:51:48,428 --> 00:51:51,926
examples people, as in humans, to

1036
00:51:51,948 --> 00:51:53,846
understand their reality to basically

1037
00:51:53,948 --> 00:51:55,834
use this knowledge about how the world

1038
00:51:55,872 --> 00:51:57,670
works to constrain their own behavior

1039
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,540
and navigate the world. Especially given

1040
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,820
the recommendation of constraints that

1041
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,122
we expect and be explained in the coming

1042
00:52:08,176 --> 00:52:10,366
decades. So I strongly suggest you take

1043
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:12,910
a look to our website and our general

1044
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,326
line of work and consider if you want to

1045
00:52:15,348 --> 00:52:18,734
talk to us or join us. The QR code is,

1046
00:52:18,852 --> 00:52:20,980
I believe a link to our website.

1047
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:25,326
So thanks to Maxwell, thanks to Daniel,

1048
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:27,794
thanks to Blei thanks to Yona, thanks to

1049
00:52:27,832 --> 00:52:29,394
pretty much everyone who helped me write

1050
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:32,534
this and think it through. It was big

1051
00:52:32,572 --> 00:52:36,246
work. So I will run through the

1052
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:38,006
slide if someone wants to read them in

1053
00:52:38,028 --> 00:52:41,206
the video. And now we can go toward the

1054
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:42,070
discussion.

1055
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:50,620
Excellent. Thank you.

1056
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:55,254
Thank you, Alexey and Maxwell.

1057
00:52:55,382 --> 00:52:58,030
Welcome back. If you want to join and

1058
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,110
please, either of you provide

1059
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,038
a first statement or any set of

1060
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:06,430
questions, however you want to continue,

1061
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,450
just go for it. You know what, give me

1062
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,850
five minutes. I will try

1063
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,380
to destroy my head.

1064
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,060
So chaos, but don't expect me to.

1065
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,712
Okay, well, do you want to share

1066
00:53:25,766 --> 00:53:27,504
your perspective on the project? Things

1067
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:28,976
that Apple would be familiar with while

1068
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:32,290
you're here? Yeah,

1069
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,290
I can begin, I guess.

1070
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,812
So I worked on the metaphysical or

1071
00:53:39,866 --> 00:53:42,724
ontological ants. And yeah, to me,

1072
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:47,408
Avel gave it a good presentation.

1073
00:53:47,504 --> 00:53:50,744
Yeah, it was really nice to see it

1074
00:53:50,862 --> 00:53:55,064
framed into the whole way

1075
00:53:55,102 --> 00:53:57,770
of talking about everything,

1076
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,980
like linking it to SAP and then to

1077
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:03,950
other stuff.

1078
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,190
If I can share a bit more about the

1079
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,480
metaphysics of the ontology.

1080
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,708
The idea was to create an ontology

1081
00:54:19,804 --> 00:54:23,212
that is naturalist. And as FEP

1082
00:54:23,356 --> 00:54:25,984
seems to be really naturalist, then I

1083
00:54:26,022 --> 00:54:29,396
wanted to make it work together. At

1084
00:54:29,418 --> 00:54:33,364
first it was only in my own

1085
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:35,280
field that I developed this. Anthony

1086
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,004
Chen avel said to me that it was really

1087
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:42,056
linked together. So that's what we

1088
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,290
tried to do here.

1089
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,456
What does that look like? How are you

1090
00:54:48,478 --> 00:54:51,756
evolution what a metaphysic is or how

1091
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:53,276
you know when you found the right one or

1092
00:54:53,298 --> 00:54:56,124
an incompatible one. Yeah,

1093
00:54:56,242 --> 00:55:00,380
so the basic question was

1094
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,756
about the question of what exists more

1095
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:07,470
generally. So that was my anger of

1096
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,920
if it's a thing in English.

1097
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,264
There are many discussions about what

1098
00:55:15,302 --> 00:55:18,864
there is in philosophy, mainly in

1099
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:22,084
the 20th century due to choir. I think

1100
00:55:22,122 --> 00:55:24,784
it is popular in general in the culture

1101
00:55:24,832 --> 00:55:28,656
of science. So I followed

1102
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:32,410
these debates on what there is and

1103
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,188
pretty much there are a lot of views

1104
00:55:35,204 --> 00:55:36,856
about what there is and what there is

1105
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:40,376
not. So I was a bit hard to

1106
00:55:40,398 --> 00:55:42,636
say that disturbed by the fact that

1107
00:55:42,658 --> 00:55:44,670
there are things that are not.

1108
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,964
And I wanted to give it a try to talk

1109
00:55:50,002 --> 00:55:53,196
about what seems not to be and to make

1110
00:55:53,218 --> 00:55:54,770
it exist in some way.

1111
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,980
Generally, what doesn't exist is linked

1112
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,850
to consistent like Pegasus or

1113
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:11,636
let's say, stupid sentences such as the

1114
00:56:11,658 --> 00:56:17,332
round square copy of the college or

1115
00:56:17,466 --> 00:56:19,368
something else, such as, I don't know,

1116
00:56:19,454 --> 00:56:21,876
some weird, non really mathematical

1117
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:26,216
entities. And I was like, okay, so I

1118
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:28,584
admit that they do not work, but at

1119
00:56:28,622 --> 00:56:31,740
least we are talking about them, so

1120
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,236
can't we just say they exist in some

1121
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:37,292
way? And then I went into social

1122
00:56:37,346 --> 00:56:40,990
ontology and I found that

1123
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,620
we can call them social artifacts.

1124
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,624
And then I was a bit relieved with this

1125
00:56:48,662 --> 00:56:52,832
view. So I tried to make it work

1126
00:56:52,886 --> 00:56:56,428
with also phenomenality or cognitive or

1127
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,404
personal experience, human experience,

1128
00:56:58,602 --> 00:57:01,168
because being a social artifact doesn't

1129
00:57:01,344 --> 00:57:02,470
make it all.

1130
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,364
Then I just tried to make it work

1131
00:57:07,402 --> 00:57:10,564
between ontology, social ontology and

1132
00:57:10,602 --> 00:57:11,700
cognitive ontology.

1133
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,232
And also something else.

1134
00:57:18,366 --> 00:57:20,516
Aval talked about the self referential

1135
00:57:20,628 --> 00:57:25,244
inconsistency. So it's a debate I

1136
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:28,444
found. By.

1137
00:57:28,482 --> 00:57:30,908
Working on ontology and I was really

1138
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:34,764
into it the fact that the theory is

1139
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:37,392
inconsistent if it doesn't applies to

1140
00:57:37,446 --> 00:57:40,864
itself. And I found some

1141
00:57:40,902 --> 00:57:44,128
articles about it which were

1142
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:46,836
against naturalism, but one kind of

1143
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:49,220
naturalism only, so it was mostly

1144
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,764
naturalism. And I saw that the

1145
00:57:53,802 --> 00:57:55,924
people who were working on that, they

1146
00:57:55,962 --> 00:57:58,944
didn't know about a lot of naturalism.

1147
00:57:59,072 --> 00:58:02,760
And as I worked with Cairo and

1148
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:06,472
in my study, I found that there are many

1149
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:09,496
kinds of meteorologies. So I saw that

1150
00:58:09,598 --> 00:58:12,280
the argument doesn't work with other

1151
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:15,564
kinds of materialisms such as the one

1152
00:58:15,602 --> 00:58:19,608
that is developed here. I hope it's

1153
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:20,190
clear.

1154
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,264
Yes. I'll ask one question on this

1155
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:28,304
topic from the Chat and then feel free

1156
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:30,844
to take it in any direction or Maxwell.

1157
00:58:30,972 --> 00:58:34,050
So Adam Rostowski in the chat asked.

1158
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,296
Thanks. Avil question. Maybe for Blei.

1159
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:39,840
What if state space is considered

1160
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,552
theoretical biology rather than causal

1161
00:58:43,616 --> 00:58:46,724
ontology? Its presupposition would then

1162
00:58:46,762 --> 00:58:48,732
not be a threat to biological

1163
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:52,344
consistency. So what if state space is

1164
00:58:52,382 --> 00:58:55,272
considered theoretical ideology rather

1165
00:58:55,326 --> 00:58:58,724
than causal ontology? Maybe just unpack

1166
00:58:58,772 --> 00:59:00,970
the question and then give it a thought.

1167
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,860
Yeah, I will write it now in order to

1168
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,030
reflect on it.

1169
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,592
Perhaps Abel just goal directed

1170
00:59:14,646 --> 00:59:16,496
question. What are the state spaces that

1171
00:59:16,518 --> 00:59:18,944
you're concerned with? How would you

1172
00:59:18,982 --> 00:59:20,530
characterize what they are.

1173
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,880
By construction state spaces? There are

1174
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,312
spaces of postulated physical

1175
00:59:29,376 --> 00:59:32,804
possibilities. You have a pretty clear

1176
00:59:32,842 --> 00:59:35,796
I do not understand what the notion of

1177
00:59:35,818 --> 00:59:38,070
ideology, how it works here,

1178
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,712
it's pretty trivial that what we call

1179
00:59:44,766 --> 00:59:48,504
ideology will define what a person or

1180
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:50,888
political system or inclination is

1181
00:59:50,974 --> 00:59:54,460
capable interested in

1182
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:55,150
seeing.

1183
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,550
It is the topic of Scott Singh states

1184
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,876
computational, let's say, work of

1185
01:00:04,898 --> 01:00:06,848
federal case and biology that looks at

1186
01:00:06,934 --> 01:00:11,008
basically how whenever states

1187
01:00:11,094 --> 01:00:14,272
try to do things overtly, usually for

1188
01:00:14,326 --> 01:00:17,824
the population, their main concern in

1189
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:19,764
effect is to build the capability of

1190
01:00:19,802 --> 01:00:22,630
control. And usually they do so by

1191
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,260
cutting through complexity aggressively.

1192
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,476
Very basic instance of that is

1193
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:33,128
scientific forestry. That is, I can say

1194
01:00:33,134 --> 01:00:34,680
it is indeed forestry.

1195
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:39,370
The idea was that Russia needed

1196
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:42,664
Warboats, loads of them. They also

1197
01:00:42,702 --> 01:00:44,732
needed to be able to predict how many

1198
01:00:44,786 --> 01:00:48,284
Warboats they would build on

1199
01:00:48,322 --> 01:00:52,056
a given time frame.

1200
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:56,264
So they need to know how many warbot

1201
01:00:56,312 --> 01:00:59,576
compatible trees they had. But you don't

1202
01:00:59,608 --> 01:01:02,432
have warboat compatible trees and not

1203
01:01:02,486 --> 01:01:04,300
warbot compatible trees. You have trees

1204
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,552
from sites, from ages, different

1205
01:01:07,686 --> 01:01:11,360
aspects. So if you just counted trees,

1206
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:14,836
even with well defined measure, you

1207
01:01:14,858 --> 01:01:16,516
would not really know how many trees you

1208
01:01:16,538 --> 01:01:19,156
have. So they just raised forest and

1209
01:01:19,178 --> 01:01:22,132
planted homogeneous patch of a given

1210
01:01:22,186 --> 01:01:24,404
species ant a given time with a given

1211
01:01:24,442 --> 01:01:27,576
soil. So they knew that when they knew

1212
01:01:27,598 --> 01:01:30,424
they had 64.

1213
01:01:30,622 --> 01:01:32,696
I don't know what trees there are. I

1214
01:01:32,718 --> 01:01:34,028
actually know what trees they are. I

1215
01:01:34,034 --> 01:01:36,510
don't know it's totally in English. So

1216
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,636
it's not oak, but they will say oak to

1217
01:01:40,658 --> 01:01:44,396
say something when they knew they had 64

1218
01:01:44,578 --> 01:01:47,630
30 years oak. Well, that's 64,

1219
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,788
30 years oak.

1220
01:01:52,904 --> 01:01:55,180
And that's it. They can cut the trees

1221
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,848
and they know exactly what they can do

1222
01:01:56,854 --> 01:02:00,196
with it. So this is a way

1223
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:03,540
in which something we could account as

1224
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,164
ideology. So the notion that we should

1225
01:02:06,202 --> 01:02:08,304
be able to control blah blah, blah blah,

1226
01:02:08,432 --> 01:02:11,664
it basically constructs physical

1227
01:02:11,712 --> 01:02:13,144
reality in very concrete sense because

1228
01:02:13,182 --> 01:02:15,028
they cut free that plant other trees

1229
01:02:15,124 --> 01:02:17,864
that fit their expectation. It is a form

1230
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:21,450
of niche construction. It is a form of

1231
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,232
how do you call that cognitive

1232
01:02:24,296 --> 01:02:26,152
attention, in the sense that the loads

1233
01:02:26,216 --> 01:02:29,164
they would need to account for our

1234
01:02:29,202 --> 01:02:32,990
Atreides are they just

1235
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,750
offloaded onto the environment by making

1236
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,056
trees actually the same? And it is a

1237
01:02:41,078 --> 01:02:44,256
form of meaning projection. They are the

1238
01:02:44,278 --> 01:02:47,536
stamp mining, which is that they need to

1239
01:02:47,558 --> 01:02:51,196
count trees that are barboats compatible

1240
01:02:51,308 --> 01:02:54,820
and they project it onto like how actual

1241
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:56,340
forests are organized.

1242
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,884
Those are physical possibilities as

1243
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:06,884
Dutch by the state. Those are set

1244
01:03:06,922 --> 01:03:08,984
spaces. We have a set space that was

1245
01:03:09,022 --> 01:03:10,680
very complex with a lot of possible

1246
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,532
trees, possible species, possible size.

1247
01:03:13,586 --> 01:03:16,812
That is brought down to

1248
01:03:16,866 --> 01:03:25,676
how many trees I have. And could

1249
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:27,360
you repeat the question word for word,

1250
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,216
please? Because it was not clear to me

1251
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,840
how national biology intervened.

1252
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,844
What if state space is considered

1253
01:03:34,892 --> 01:03:37,644
theoretical ideology rather than causal

1254
01:03:37,692 --> 01:03:41,476
ontology its presupposition would then

1255
01:03:41,498 --> 01:03:42,944
not be a threat to biological

1256
01:03:42,992 --> 01:03:43,860
consistency.

1257
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,908
Yes. Okay. Because of ontology precedes

1258
01:03:51,924 --> 01:03:54,024
a set space, it is the ontology of

1259
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:56,650
creation constraints that they have

1260
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,996
waived. Ant somewhat impressively

1261
01:04:01,028 --> 01:04:03,690
at the moment, set space,

1262
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,908
I think I will be able to demonstrate

1263
01:04:07,924 --> 01:04:09,772
it, but I can't at the moment. They

1264
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:11,916
express the point of view of an agent.

1265
01:04:12,018 --> 01:04:15,784
So I imagine that this is what is meant

1266
01:04:15,832 --> 01:04:19,724
to be produced by biological

1267
01:04:19,852 --> 01:04:22,000
theory, theoretical ideology.

1268
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:26,656
And I do not think Ramstead space

1269
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:28,592
are a threat to ontology. I think

1270
01:04:28,646 --> 01:04:32,304
ontologies that consider Ramstead spaces

1271
01:04:32,352 --> 01:04:34,948
as fundamental are flow ontology is

1272
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:35,510
fine.

1273
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,356
Thank you, AVO Blei, feel free to chime

1274
01:04:42,388 --> 01:04:43,976
in and then Maxwell, if you want to add

1275
01:04:43,998 --> 01:04:48,056
anything. Yeah, so I

1276
01:04:48,078 --> 01:04:52,280
think I will join the commentary.

1277
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,404
Also, I would like to say that if

1278
01:04:57,442 --> 01:05:00,540
we take clients definition of ideology,

1279
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,316
I will not explain this now that well.

1280
01:05:04,418 --> 01:05:06,976
Yes. So the idea, I think, is that the

1281
01:05:06,998 --> 01:05:09,916
concepts are tool and not fundamental

1282
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,636
stuff. That's what I think it is implied

1283
01:05:12,668 --> 01:05:14,050
by ideology here.

1284
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,330
So what I say is that.

1285
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:22,660
You. Give the value of being an ideology

1286
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,916
or consolentology, depending on your

1287
01:05:26,938 --> 01:05:27,910
goal and. Your.

1288
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,916
But at least minimally, the stuff you're

1289
01:05:32,948 --> 01:05:36,084
talking about, that's the fundamental

1290
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:39,610
stuff that I would say.

1291
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,936
So even though it is ideological, even

1292
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:44,828
though it is instrumental, let's say

1293
01:05:44,994 --> 01:05:47,084
minimally, it is something and it has

1294
01:05:47,122 --> 01:05:48,904
consequences on the world. And that's

1295
01:05:48,952 --> 01:05:52,616
what I think Avil said with the niche

1296
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:56,744
construction of social time. It didn't

1297
01:05:56,792 --> 01:06:00,384
really say that in these words. But even

1298
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:02,604
though your IDs are, let's say, stupid

1299
01:06:02,652 --> 01:06:05,584
or absurd and people appear to hear you,

1300
01:06:05,702 --> 01:06:09,136
then your IDs, they are in the world and

1301
01:06:09,238 --> 01:06:13,136
they do something. So I

1302
01:06:13,158 --> 01:06:15,876
hope I answered well. If not,

1303
01:06:15,978 --> 01:06:18,470
then I can take questions.

1304
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,330
Thank you.

1305
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,496
Maxwell, do you want to add something?

1306
01:06:27,678 --> 01:06:29,652
Maxwell Ramstead: I don't currently have anything burning

1307
01:06:29,716 --> 01:06:33,356
to say. Avel, I think this is

1308
01:06:33,378 --> 01:06:35,864
the end iteration of our discussions

1309
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:39,436
around this. As always, I think you did

1310
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:43,116
a great job presenting what I think is a

1311
01:06:43,138 --> 01:06:44,910
genuine issue.

1312
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,970
And I've just been rehearsing the same

1313
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,560
appeals to multi scalarity.

1314
01:06:55,940 --> 01:07:00,116
I find it interesting that you would

1315
01:07:00,298 --> 01:07:04,308
speak an answer to these issues

1316
01:07:04,474 --> 01:07:09,060
in Quantum FEP precisely because

1317
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:12,356
of its scale free nature. So you can't

1318
01:07:12,388 --> 01:07:14,616
appeal to a spacetime background when

1319
01:07:14,718 --> 01:07:17,924
speaking in the Quantum FEP formulation.

1320
01:07:17,972 --> 01:07:21,416
So I think in my mind that makes things

1321
01:07:21,598 --> 01:07:23,676
potentially more difficult. I see why

1322
01:07:23,698 --> 01:07:24,876
you would want to do that. Because of

1323
01:07:24,898 --> 01:07:28,284
the focus on the

1324
01:07:28,322 --> 01:07:30,396
definition of an observation as a

1325
01:07:30,418 --> 01:07:35,276
physical interaction. I guess my

1326
01:07:35,298 --> 01:07:39,200
kind of overarching question

1327
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:41,984
is whether the multi scalarity of

1328
01:07:42,022 --> 01:07:45,568
classical FEP helps at all in the

1329
01:07:45,574 --> 01:07:47,776
sense that we've described before. So

1330
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:49,936
you have a set of observables, some of

1331
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:54,272
them chance too fast to really disclose

1332
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:56,724
or allow us to track, reliably some

1333
01:07:56,762 --> 01:07:58,820
phenomenon behind the blanket, others

1334
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:02,104
do. In the latter case we talk

1335
01:08:02,142 --> 01:08:04,216
about states, in the former we talk

1336
01:08:04,238 --> 01:08:08,116
about random fluctuations. So I suspect

1337
01:08:08,228 --> 01:08:11,800
that the kind of definitional

1338
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:16,856
discussions by which I mean definitions

1339
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:18,156
of states like these kind of

1340
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:21,804
foundational issues that arise in

1341
01:08:21,842 --> 01:08:24,600
classical FEP might be helpful

1342
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,276
hereabouts. I also suspect that you'll

1343
01:08:27,308 --> 01:08:29,680
disagree with me, so I'm looking forward

1344
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,200
to hearing your thoughts.

1345
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:38,256
Basically the

1346
01:08:38,358 --> 01:08:41,670
distinction is clear between us

1347
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,164
at least as your friendly problem. You

1348
01:08:44,202 --> 01:08:46,144
seem to be a realist about the physical

1349
01:08:46,192 --> 01:08:48,084
possibilities about state spaces which

1350
01:08:48,122 --> 01:08:51,456
are not. I have an agreement for non

1351
01:08:51,488 --> 01:08:53,670
realism, which is self control

1352
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,384
ontological consistency and determinants

1353
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,240
of self consistency and self

1354
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:01,320
consistency. That brings us to say that

1355
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:04,664
you can have preemptive set spaces in

1356
01:09:04,702 --> 01:09:08,328
which to frame, in which to classify,

1357
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:10,984
have physical observables that somehow

1358
01:09:11,032 --> 01:09:13,912
preexist physics, nature,

1359
01:09:14,056 --> 01:09:16,496
the process that are within it. So that

1360
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:19,328
is one physical argument. The question

1361
01:09:19,414 --> 01:09:21,964
is then can I demonstrate conclusively

1362
01:09:22,012 --> 01:09:23,164
that you do not have physical

1363
01:09:23,212 --> 01:09:26,128
observables before observation, but

1364
01:09:26,214 --> 01:09:29,396
state spaces do in fact reduce the

1365
01:09:29,418 --> 01:09:32,260
perspective and observer. And basically,

1366
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,820
if I can demonstrate it, the debate is

1367
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:38,790
over. Until then,

1368
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,424
you can hold structural values, but you

1369
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:50,056
have to account of how thing exists if

1370
01:09:50,078 --> 01:09:53,508
they are not fundamental. I think multi

1371
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:55,228
scale FTP can do that. So it's not a

1372
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:58,588
critical problem for you. Everything

1373
01:09:58,674 --> 01:10:01,132
holds on the formal demonstration that

1374
01:10:01,186 --> 01:10:04,860
we do not in fact have sex basis

1375
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,820
as prompted physical affect.

1376
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,544
Well, I would push a little bit back

1377
01:10:12,582 --> 01:10:15,900
against your realism versus antirealism

1378
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,250
distinction here.

1379
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,196
I'm really just talking about like at

1380
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,164
the level of the formalism. You start

1381
01:10:24,202 --> 01:10:26,724
with some observables, which seems to be

1382
01:10:26,762 --> 01:10:30,276
what you are also saying,

1383
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:33,976
and then you can talk about the way that

1384
01:10:33,998 --> 01:10:37,064
those observables are related to some

1385
01:10:37,102 --> 01:10:40,056
other things which may be latent. All of

1386
01:10:40,078 --> 01:10:42,436
that is a formal statement as far as I'm

1387
01:10:42,468 --> 01:10:45,768
concerned. And it is useful

1388
01:10:45,864 --> 01:10:48,156
whether or not it maps in some kind of

1389
01:10:48,178 --> 01:10:51,916
fundamental realist ontology sense. I

1390
01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:54,364
guess if there is a kind of

1391
01:10:54,402 --> 01:10:56,556
transcendental overtone to what I'm

1392
01:10:56,588 --> 01:10:59,868
saying in the sense that we've argued

1393
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:02,492
in print, on the map territory, fallacy

1394
01:11:02,556 --> 01:11:05,884
fallacy paper, that the FEP theoretic

1395
01:11:05,932 --> 01:11:08,656
maths and the related cluster of

1396
01:11:08,678 --> 01:11:11,056
principles, unitarian, maximum entropy

1397
01:11:11,088 --> 01:11:12,832
and so forth provide ultimate

1398
01:11:12,896 --> 01:11:14,548
constraints on any model building

1399
01:11:14,634 --> 01:11:18,836
exercise, just full stop. So again,

1400
01:11:19,018 --> 01:11:21,860
that doesn't presuppose any realism

1401
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,632
about what maps map onto. It's really

1402
01:11:24,686 --> 01:11:26,964
just a statement about the construction

1403
01:11:27,012 --> 01:11:29,400
and maybe the process of constructing.

1404
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,690
You're correct. It says I was

1405
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,436
attributing, I don't know to say

1406
01:11:38,478 --> 01:11:41,128
English, it was not accurate to frame

1407
01:11:41,144 --> 01:11:43,596
you as a realist about its basis. It was

1408
01:11:43,618 --> 01:11:45,228
correct, however, to frame you as an

1409
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,050
instrumentalist, which I refuse to be

1410
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,504
because of naturalism, basically I

1411
01:11:51,622 --> 01:11:54,124
consider it necessary to frame causal

1412
01:11:54,172 --> 01:11:56,188
ontologies that map, onto reality

1413
01:11:56,284 --> 01:11:59,732
properly, as fine grandly as we can.

1414
01:11:59,866 --> 01:12:01,776
And to do that we have to include

1415
01:12:01,808 --> 01:12:04,676
basically the translation relation. And

1416
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,528
this is when everything becomes

1417
01:12:06,624 --> 01:12:09,588
complicated because you can't say if

1418
01:12:09,674 --> 01:12:11,556
there are such physical possibilities,

1419
01:12:11,668 --> 01:12:14,504
then this occurs. You can't use that

1420
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:17,704
language because by doing that you

1421
01:12:17,742 --> 01:12:19,704
frame physical possibilities as

1422
01:12:19,742 --> 01:12:21,848
something that is abstracted from the

1423
01:12:21,854 --> 01:12:24,670
underlying physical reality. You

1424
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,390
decouple the formal from the actual.

1425
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,260
And I think whatever ontology we use

1426
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:34,904
must be what reality is, must correspond

1427
01:12:34,952 --> 01:12:37,420
structurally to what drives reality.

1428
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,236
So it is the contrary. It is who

1429
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:45,136
is the realist. But the constraint I was

1430
01:12:45,158 --> 01:12:49,440
going to. Suggest maybe

1431
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:50,130
actually.

1432
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,876
I go for ontology that is consistent in

1433
01:12:57,898 --> 01:13:00,244
the sense I friend and the constraint of

1434
01:13:00,282 --> 01:13:03,336
that are much stronger than the

1435
01:13:03,358 --> 01:13:05,508
constraint of our instrumentalist

1436
01:13:05,604 --> 01:13:07,768
anthology that just we say interesting

1437
01:13:07,854 --> 01:13:10,840
things, which is not actually easy,

1438
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:15,004
it's just much more easy. But suppose we

1439
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:16,716
started from the assumption that we

1440
01:13:16,738 --> 01:13:19,724
don't have to have a strong position on

1441
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:22,380
the reality of state spaces.

1442
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:28,350
Does that affect your agreement at all?

1443
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,176
If I were to say I just as a

1444
01:13:32,198 --> 01:13:34,384
practitioner of science start from my

1445
01:13:34,422 --> 01:13:36,204
observables, you can be a radical

1446
01:13:36,252 --> 01:13:37,776
phenomenologist from this point of view

1447
01:13:37,798 --> 01:13:39,156
if you want. You're just starting from

1448
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:40,996
your observables and then working out

1449
01:13:41,098 --> 01:13:44,084
like what resists your manipulations or

1450
01:13:44,122 --> 01:13:47,444
interactions. Does that,

1451
01:13:47,482 --> 01:13:51,144
in your view, kind of allow us to move

1452
01:13:51,182 --> 01:13:54,570
around asking the questions about.

1453
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,488
You can move around with oh, about the

1454
01:13:58,494 --> 01:14:01,944
fix upgradion? No. Move around. Yes.

1455
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:03,376
Understand some things with cognitive

1456
01:14:03,428 --> 01:14:05,960
meaning. Yes. You have FEP grounds

1457
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,008
cognitive meaning in Demiko sampiri.

1458
01:14:08,024 --> 01:14:15,676
It's huge. Did what

1459
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:18,060
it does not is afford the ontological

1460
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:21,776
consistent theory of physics and the

1461
01:14:21,798 --> 01:14:24,384
difference between us is not what we

1462
01:14:24,422 --> 01:14:27,424
hold the FEP to do. I think we're both

1463
01:14:27,462 --> 01:14:31,844
instrumentalists from

1464
01:14:31,882 --> 01:14:36,916
you as a realist but the

1465
01:14:36,938 --> 01:14:38,944
difference is that I see an affordance

1466
01:14:38,992 --> 01:14:42,840
to build a much stronger self consistent

1467
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:47,128
physical theory that draws element and a

1468
01:14:47,134 --> 01:14:49,064
general philosophy from the FEP, the

1469
01:14:49,102 --> 01:14:50,324
philosophy of activity in France.

1470
01:14:50,372 --> 01:14:56,260
Basically I

1471
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:57,852
push in this direction because I think

1472
01:14:57,906 --> 01:15:00,792
the goal is variable. It is ultimately

1473
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:03,692
an ethical call. If you do not agree

1474
01:15:03,746 --> 01:15:05,528
that the goal is variable you should not

1475
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,336
agree that it is useful to push it. I do

1476
01:15:08,358 --> 01:15:10,850
not have ultimately any show of that.

1477
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:16,560
Maybe there is a kind of Conor intake

1478
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:20,388
here because I think at least in the

1479
01:15:20,394 --> 01:15:22,836
history of philosophy this split between

1480
01:15:22,938 --> 01:15:24,996
realism and antirealism or

1481
01:15:25,018 --> 01:15:28,144
instrumentalism I think it's perhaps

1482
01:15:28,192 --> 01:15:30,768
overly simplistic as a description of

1483
01:15:30,794 --> 01:15:32,410
the potential options.

1484
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,136
There is a whole contein line of

1485
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:41,240
thinking that talks about something

1486
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,790
intermediate in some sense.

1487
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,710
I don't know, just a thought.

1488
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,976
Is a dam in the room? If you're in the

1489
01:15:56,998 --> 01:15:59,440
room, use the chat.

1490
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:03,010
But in a sense I agree that.

1491
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,792
Not in the room. But I can read another

1492
01:16:05,846 --> 01:16:07,536
question whenever you're done. I'll read

1493
01:16:07,558 --> 01:16:10,444
another question from the Chat. Yes,

1494
01:16:10,502 --> 01:16:12,724
but I was going to say something which

1495
01:16:12,762 --> 01:16:15,652
is that I agree that basically is a

1496
01:16:15,706 --> 01:16:19,190
distinction between instrumentalism and

1497
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:25,008
annualism must be dissolved because none

1498
01:16:25,024 --> 01:16:27,416
of them are ecological consistent. Both

1499
01:16:27,518 --> 01:16:29,496
suppose representation relation that is

1500
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,144
outside the world and the question is

1501
01:16:31,262 --> 01:16:34,596
whether the words as a formal construct

1502
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,568
correspond to the reality as a

1503
01:16:36,574 --> 01:16:39,384
structural thing. It's not a constant

1504
01:16:39,432 --> 01:16:41,740
question to ask the all of the things

1505
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:43,308
are in the world. We have to have a

1506
01:16:43,314 --> 01:16:46,512
theory of our things are true or not.

1507
01:16:46,566 --> 01:16:49,216
That affords for the statements we have

1508
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:50,944
about the world to be in the world

1509
01:16:51,062 --> 01:16:52,210
because they are.

1510
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:59,076
And so from the moment once

1511
01:16:59,098 --> 01:17:02,516
you free that biological consistency is

1512
01:17:02,538 --> 01:17:05,124
something to have a lot of the

1513
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,104
distinction we have in western

1514
01:17:07,152 --> 01:17:10,004
philosophy will be dissolved. Which

1515
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,276
makes communication complicated. Of

1516
01:17:12,298 --> 01:17:12,870
course.

1517
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,328
Maxwell, you want a closing thought on

1518
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:19,930
that or I'll ask the next question?

1519
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,556
You can ask the next question. I think

1520
01:17:24,578 --> 01:17:28,110
that brings us nicely to.

1521
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,776
This is from Alex Kiefer. So Alex wrote

1522
01:17:32,888 --> 01:17:35,480
I love the positive story in this paper

1523
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:37,868
insofar as I understand it, which I'm

1524
01:17:37,884 --> 01:17:40,432
still working on and the idea of

1525
01:17:40,566 --> 01:17:42,624
treating even such things as state

1526
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:45,932
spaces and scientific reps as amenable

1527
01:17:45,996 --> 01:17:49,264
to physical descriptions. But to bounce

1528
01:17:49,312 --> 01:17:52,708
off what Maxwell is saying I am not sure

1529
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:55,156
I see the deep critique of thing in

1530
01:17:55,178 --> 01:17:58,672
itself realism here probably depends

1531
01:17:58,736 --> 01:18:01,672
what one means by that. I tend to think

1532
01:18:01,726 --> 01:18:04,456
of the strictly incoherent concept idea

1533
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:06,520
of something unknowable behind

1534
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:10,004
phenomena. So why is treating statespace

1535
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:13,268
correlation as part of phenomena at odds

1536
01:18:13,284 --> 01:18:15,868
with that? And it's also Ramstead in the

1537
01:18:15,874 --> 01:18:18,910
chat. Just to pick up on that, I think

1538
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,700
you don't need to be a strong realist.

1539
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,056
You can just believe that you are more

1540
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:29,344
or less getting it right. And the

1541
01:18:29,382 --> 01:18:32,876
semantics that we've proposed that uses

1542
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:34,352
active coherence and the free free

1543
01:18:34,406 --> 01:18:36,556
energy principle, the kind of formal

1544
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:39,788
basis precisely uses the fact that you

1545
01:18:39,814 --> 01:18:41,716
have a certain perspective, you have

1546
01:18:41,738 --> 01:18:44,308
certain beliefs, and your beliefs are

1547
01:18:44,314 --> 01:18:47,284
going to be more or less wrong and that

1548
01:18:47,482 --> 01:18:49,940
the prediction error or the free energy

1549
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:54,216
is precisely the

1550
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:56,024
kind of minimal ingredient that you need

1551
01:18:56,062 --> 01:18:59,370
to hook you into a situation enough to

1552
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:03,448
be doing something pragmatic that you

1553
01:19:03,454 --> 01:19:04,860
might call truth telling.

1554
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,176
That's really all you need from a formal

1555
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:11,116
point of view is just the ability to be

1556
01:19:11,138 --> 01:19:13,964
wrong and to change your mind in light

1557
01:19:14,002 --> 01:19:17,680
of new evidence. So my claim is not that

1558
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:21,170
everything in physics is false and

1559
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:24,892
formal statements about postulated

1560
01:19:24,956 --> 01:19:27,552
possibilities of no epistemic value or

1561
01:19:27,606 --> 01:19:31,156
trivial epistemic value. My claim is

1562
01:19:31,178 --> 01:19:34,272
that those representation,

1563
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:40,336
as any representation are rational.

1564
01:19:40,448 --> 01:19:44,484
They relate to objects and the

1565
01:19:44,522 --> 01:19:47,224
true value or value in a sense that we

1566
01:19:47,262 --> 01:19:48,936
have to give the meaning we have to give

1567
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:51,848
to that if we are to give anything at

1568
01:19:51,854 --> 01:19:54,056
all must be grounded in the study of

1569
01:19:54,078 --> 01:19:55,644
physical dynamics that's underlying our

1570
01:19:55,682 --> 01:19:58,828
emergence. If we are to have

1571
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:01,320
again an ontologic consistent theory.

1572
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,276
We could just say that evidence is

1573
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:06,332
discourse that is not entirely false and

1574
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:09,288
say things that are not entirely false.

1575
01:20:09,384 --> 01:20:10,530
We could do that.

1576
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,956
Again, the notion that physical

1577
01:20:16,988 --> 01:20:20,256
discourse must be legally consistent is

1578
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,916
ultimately ethical like it is a

1579
01:20:22,938 --> 01:20:24,756
statement on what you should and should

1580
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:26,740
not do. I can say that it is better

1581
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:30,420
because XYZ you can say that XYZ are not

1582
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:33,352
meaningful targets to have and that

1583
01:20:33,406 --> 01:20:35,992
whatever we do is okay essentially, or

1584
01:20:36,046 --> 01:20:38,410
maybe it's better than X-Y-Z.

1585
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,696
But the notion that I do

1586
01:20:42,718 --> 01:20:45,096
not critique the spaces but at least

1587
01:20:45,118 --> 01:20:46,716
it's Ronen point, I have to frame it as

1588
01:20:46,738 --> 01:20:50,136
a critique for it to resonate.

1589
01:20:50,328 --> 01:20:53,596
But the point is that the spaces are

1590
01:20:53,618 --> 01:20:56,928
rational property and that to study

1591
01:20:57,014 --> 01:21:00,528
this rationality, it reframes the

1592
01:21:00,534 --> 01:21:03,452
entirety of physics, it's epistemology

1593
01:21:03,516 --> 01:21:07,136
it's ontology, it's cosmology. And if

1594
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:09,964
you look ant the flow of this theory,

1595
01:21:10,012 --> 01:21:13,280
it's not least action, it analyzes

1596
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,612
social evolution. Revolution is agent

1597
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:19,636
producing meaning as norms and then the

1598
01:21:19,658 --> 01:21:22,600
norms when they think it is something

1599
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:26,824
that is very basic for

1600
01:21:26,862 --> 01:21:28,872
us to understand how solar system

1601
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:31,992
evolves. And yet there is no

1602
01:21:32,046 --> 01:21:34,756
such theory, there is no theory of such

1603
01:21:34,798 --> 01:21:37,032
revolution that do not presupposes

1604
01:21:37,096 --> 01:21:40,268
variation and obstruct away any form of

1605
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:44,040
structure and metabolism. It simply

1606
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,452
does not exist. So the nonexistence

1607
01:21:47,516 --> 01:21:49,932
of a materialistic theory of revolution

1608
01:21:49,996 --> 01:21:51,808
is maybe a pretty big problem for a

1609
01:21:51,814 --> 01:21:54,656
purely predictive pragmatic value

1610
01:21:54,838 --> 01:21:57,404
standpoint. From a more abstract

1611
01:21:57,452 --> 01:22:00,104
standpoint, we don't have a Korean

1612
01:22:00,172 --> 01:22:03,104
cosmology, we don't have an explanation

1613
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:05,716
for why there are things and why the

1614
01:22:05,738 --> 01:22:07,956
things that are look like what they are

1615
01:22:08,138 --> 01:22:09,904
physically. We just have to postulate

1616
01:22:09,952 --> 01:22:13,144
that space time is such and such

1617
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:15,768
for physics to make sense. Which is a

1618
01:22:15,774 --> 01:22:19,736
problem. We can't have a

1619
01:22:19,758 --> 01:22:24,184
physical theory that stands only on the

1620
01:22:24,222 --> 01:22:26,844
fact that its statement does not give

1621
01:22:26,882 --> 01:22:29,788
rise to obvious problems. We have to

1622
01:22:29,794 --> 01:22:31,196
have something beyond the statement. We

1623
01:22:31,218 --> 01:22:34,556
have to have some way to account for how

1624
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:38,032
this statement became true. And it is a

1625
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:41,264
pretty basic point to make in

1626
01:22:41,382 --> 01:22:43,916
psychology, biology, sociology. We can't

1627
01:22:43,948 --> 01:22:46,096
just say things are such and such. We

1628
01:22:46,118 --> 01:22:48,656
have to say how they become such and

1629
01:22:48,678 --> 01:22:51,430
such and why they become such and such.

1630
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,132
It is nothing in evolution, nothing

1631
01:22:54,186 --> 01:22:57,604
biology makes like nothing

1632
01:22:57,802 --> 01:23:00,212
in biology makes sense except in light

1633
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:03,924
evolution. And it is because those

1634
01:23:03,962 --> 01:23:06,656
are systems that are I don't like Telegy

1635
01:23:06,688 --> 01:23:09,316
call, let's say teleonomical. Those are

1636
01:23:09,338 --> 01:23:10,744
things that are organized, that are

1637
01:23:10,782 --> 01:23:13,332
coherent, that work in a specific way.

1638
01:23:13,486 --> 01:23:17,070
And so we have to

1639
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,836
cannot just say they do x, we have to

1640
01:23:19,858 --> 01:23:22,412
say how and why they do x. And this

1641
01:23:22,466 --> 01:23:26,064
epistemology has

1642
01:23:26,102 --> 01:23:28,112
not permeated physics basically because

1643
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:30,300
of the belief of physicist in Platonic

1644
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:33,472
truth of symmetries or formalism or

1645
01:23:33,526 --> 01:23:37,010
symmetry. I have a question force you.

1646
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,316
So I'm thinking about this in terms of

1647
01:23:41,338 --> 01:23:43,188
the direction of travel, of our research

1648
01:23:43,274 --> 01:23:46,228
on the free energy principle which I

1649
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:48,484
mean, there are two main components too

1650
01:23:48,682 --> 01:23:50,416
that we could discuss that are relevant

1651
01:23:50,448 --> 01:23:52,952
here. The first is the move from state

1652
01:23:53,006 --> 01:23:56,644
based to path based or path integral

1653
01:23:56,692 --> 01:24:00,276
formulations where what's

1654
01:24:00,308 --> 01:24:03,392
at stake is precisely probability

1655
01:24:03,476 --> 01:24:05,950
density function is not over individual

1656
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,620
but over trajectories, entire

1657
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:12,300
trajectories of a system where what your

1658
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:14,924
generative model Lagrangian is

1659
01:24:14,962 --> 01:24:17,264
describing is the probability of some

1660
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:20,496
specific history. So this kind

1661
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:23,116
of intrinsically historical

1662
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:26,690
formalization and on the other hand,

1663
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:30,196
as a kind of second main direction of

1664
01:24:30,218 --> 01:24:33,124
travel really formalizing these kind of

1665
01:24:33,162 --> 01:24:36,132
three nested scales of inference where

1666
01:24:36,186 --> 01:24:39,392
you have inference over state factors

1667
01:24:39,456 --> 01:24:42,904
and individual states like color and

1668
01:24:42,942 --> 01:24:45,796
red, green, Bleu and so on coherence

1669
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:48,890
over the parameters of the model.

1670
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:51,930
The characterized the relations between

1671
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:55,564
states and configurations of states and

1672
01:24:55,602 --> 01:24:58,044
finally the structure of the model which

1673
01:24:58,082 --> 01:25:02,316
is really like the actual relations

1674
01:25:02,418 --> 01:25:04,664
and functionality of what is connected

1675
01:25:04,712 --> 01:25:08,316
to what. So one of the things that we're

1676
01:25:08,508 --> 01:25:11,136
working on is getting to the

1677
01:25:11,158 --> 01:25:13,504
mathematical foundations of these

1678
01:25:13,702 --> 01:25:16,636
basically mutually constraining scales

1679
01:25:16,668 --> 01:25:20,148
of inference. So suppose you had access

1680
01:25:20,234 --> 01:25:23,396
to a path based description of the free

1681
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:27,856
energy formalism supplemented

1682
01:25:27,888 --> 01:25:32,216
by a clear formulation of

1683
01:25:32,398 --> 01:25:36,600
inference nested within parameter

1684
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,956
optimization, nested within structure

1685
01:25:40,148 --> 01:25:43,780
optimization. In other

1686
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:45,976
words, assuming that we solve structure

1687
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:48,584
learning, which is a big assuming,

1688
01:25:48,712 --> 01:25:51,692
but if you granted those two things,

1689
01:25:51,826 --> 01:25:54,972
would there be still much of a problem?

1690
01:25:55,026 --> 01:25:56,976
You think, from a formal point of view,

1691
01:25:57,078 --> 01:25:59,056
if you could just move in the space of

1692
01:25:59,078 --> 01:26:03,276
all possible model structures and paths

1693
01:26:03,468 --> 01:26:06,240
through such spaces,

1694
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:09,636
would you not basically address what you

1695
01:26:09,658 --> 01:26:10,870
have in mind here?

1696
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,704
Three things. First, bath integral.

1697
01:26:18,752 --> 01:26:22,768
It solves the issue of preset meaning

1698
01:26:22,864 --> 01:26:27,336
for vertical assistance and the issue of

1699
01:26:27,358 --> 01:26:29,912
that already. But it is not something I

1700
01:26:29,966 --> 01:26:32,216
called on here so it would not help with

1701
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:34,888
the issue I've discussed. Secondly is

1702
01:26:34,894 --> 01:26:37,116
structured learning. The question is how

1703
01:26:37,218 --> 01:26:38,892
basically living things project

1704
01:26:38,946 --> 01:26:42,844
structure. If we have that we would

1705
01:26:42,882 --> 01:26:46,684
progress in a big way for a theory

1706
01:26:46,732 --> 01:26:49,360
of cognitive meaning and agency.

1707
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:54,240
But you will still operate within

1708
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,656
a given space of possibilities. You will

1709
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:59,940
have attraction conversation of

1710
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:03,844
the state of possibles by

1711
01:27:03,882 --> 01:27:06,576
virtue of what the FEP is it builds

1712
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:09,796
manifold. So the manifold the thing will

1713
01:27:09,818 --> 01:27:11,796
evolve on the manifold where it will

1714
01:27:11,818 --> 01:27:14,472
evolve. So some of active states space

1715
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:15,608
would become trivial, some of the

1716
01:27:15,614 --> 01:27:21,512
dimension will become trivial and

1717
01:27:21,566 --> 01:27:24,980
some things that do not really appear

1718
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:26,652
per se in the set space will become

1719
01:27:26,706 --> 01:27:29,276
relevant. So they will become part of

1720
01:27:29,298 --> 01:27:31,196
this data space as experienced by the

1721
01:27:31,218 --> 01:27:34,140
agent. But the hard part is to account

1722
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:38,032
for how this test space as

1723
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,016
experienced by the agent becomes this

1724
01:27:40,038 --> 01:27:45,692
test space per C. How you have matrix

1725
01:27:45,836 --> 01:27:49,356
of six or six that serves

1726
01:27:49,388 --> 01:27:51,760
as a boundary, let us say. And how

1727
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:53,516
agents will basically collaboratively

1728
01:27:53,548 --> 01:27:55,396
build tissemoso meaning where they have

1729
01:27:55,498 --> 01:27:57,332
alphabet and can communicate long

1730
01:27:57,386 --> 01:28:00,020
sentences using this grid.

1731
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:04,088
And this is not in and of itself

1732
01:28:04,174 --> 01:28:06,584
a question of structure learning.

1733
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:10,072
Although solving structure learning

1734
01:28:10,126 --> 01:28:13,724
wasn't able to

1735
01:28:13,762 --> 01:28:15,448
have a lot of computational experiments

1736
01:28:15,464 --> 01:28:18,476
that would help greatly with looking at

1737
01:28:18,498 --> 01:28:20,812
the fine brain structure. The question

1738
01:28:20,866 --> 01:28:24,156
is how

1739
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:28,476
you use mathematics in a way well,

1740
01:28:28,578 --> 01:28:30,430
in a way that describes creation. That

1741
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,408
the concept of the spaces. That's what

1742
01:28:33,414 --> 01:28:36,316
I'm suggesting within the space. That's

1743
01:28:36,348 --> 01:28:40,096
what I'm suggesting when so the what I'm

1744
01:28:40,128 --> 01:28:42,996
talking about is if you could figure out

1745
01:28:43,178 --> 01:28:46,528
when to add a new node

1746
01:28:46,704 --> 01:28:49,872
or edge to your generative

1747
01:28:49,936 --> 01:28:52,448
model like precisely when is it

1748
01:28:52,474 --> 01:28:54,276
appropriate to add a new parameter?

1749
01:28:54,388 --> 01:28:56,184
When is it appropriate to say oh, these

1750
01:28:56,222 --> 01:28:58,184
two parameters are connected to that

1751
01:28:58,222 --> 01:29:00,904
state in these proportions. If you have

1752
01:29:00,942 --> 01:29:03,916
that worked out I could see a kind of

1753
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:06,808
straightforward resolution to what we're

1754
01:29:06,824 --> 01:29:10,524
just talking about. The system just

1755
01:29:10,562 --> 01:29:14,972
unfolds dynamically and occasionally it

1756
01:29:15,026 --> 01:29:18,144
learns new structure or parameters which

1757
01:29:18,182 --> 01:29:20,688
basically means like new degrees of

1758
01:29:20,694 --> 01:29:22,370
freedom are added to the system.

1759
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:26,348
You are again talking at the epistemic

1760
01:29:26,364 --> 01:29:28,450
level. You can describe a lot of things

1761
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,908
by basically looking at the dynamics and

1762
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:34,484
being smart about it. You don't even

1763
01:29:34,522 --> 01:29:37,510
need advanced mathematics to do that.

1764
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,116
The statement we make is different. Let

1765
01:29:40,138 --> 01:29:43,380
us say that you have people that agree

1766
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:46,056
that shells are an appropriate means of

1767
01:29:46,078 --> 01:29:48,810
exchange for x, y and z.

1768
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:52,808
Then money becomes a thing. It is a

1769
01:29:52,814 --> 01:29:54,890
thing that exists individually because

1770
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,640
it has structural properties and these

1771
01:29:57,710 --> 01:29:59,516
properties drive observables through

1772
01:29:59,538 --> 01:30:03,592
dynamics and equally inevitably

1773
01:30:03,656 --> 01:30:06,512
did not exist Ronen before. The question

1774
01:30:06,566 --> 01:30:09,776
we ask is how we account for an

1775
01:30:09,798 --> 01:30:12,156
evolution within a space that builds

1776
01:30:12,188 --> 01:30:15,916
another space and we cannot

1777
01:30:15,948 --> 01:30:18,724
just look at the space and declare how

1778
01:30:18,762 --> 01:30:22,100
it has changed. It is not the problem

1779
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:24,768
we are posing. Problem is how it's

1780
01:30:24,784 --> 01:30:26,836
present mathematically something that

1781
01:30:26,858 --> 01:30:29,092
occurs within space, that proves another

1782
01:30:29,146 --> 01:30:32,596
space that is the same but not the same,

1783
01:30:32,778 --> 01:30:36,090
that is structurally similar,

1784
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:38,744
that inherits from what existed before,

1785
01:30:38,862 --> 01:30:40,612
but is different in quality of aspects

1786
01:30:40,676 --> 01:30:43,988
because this one thing became. So what

1787
01:30:44,014 --> 01:30:46,424
we have to have is a theory of becoming,

1788
01:30:46,472 --> 01:30:50,252
basically. And we can be

1789
01:30:50,306 --> 01:30:53,244
very smart about modeling things without

1790
01:30:53,362 --> 01:30:55,196
having a theory of becoming. We can be

1791
01:30:55,218 --> 01:30:59,170
very precise nimco interference and very

1792
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:03,804
efficient at seeing regime

1793
01:31:03,852 --> 01:31:05,968
changes. That does not mean we have a

1794
01:31:05,974 --> 01:31:09,388
self consistent theory of becoming.

1795
01:31:09,484 --> 01:31:11,276
Creation, test based construction,

1796
01:31:11,308 --> 01:31:13,396
connectivity like those are two

1797
01:31:13,418 --> 01:31:16,564
different problems, although 1 may help

1798
01:31:16,602 --> 01:31:18,708
the other. regretly, both may help the

1799
01:31:18,714 --> 01:31:22,276
other greatly because the thing we are

1800
01:31:22,298 --> 01:31:24,584
looking at is the same way, looking at

1801
01:31:24,622 --> 01:31:26,570
two very different aspect of the thing.

1802
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,400
Maxwell, want to add something or Alexa

1803
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:36,604
on that? No, I'm going to think about

1804
01:31:36,642 --> 01:31:40,300
that. Thank you. Avel awesome.

1805
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:43,164
Yeah. From the chat on that topic, Tom

1806
01:31:43,202 --> 01:31:45,468
wrote a similar question. Avel, could

1807
01:31:45,474 --> 01:31:47,516
you elaborate more on how active could

1808
01:31:47,538 --> 01:31:49,336
be expanded to accommodate state space

1809
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:51,724
creation? Assuming active is normative

1810
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:54,064
about free energy minimization, when

1811
01:31:54,102 --> 01:31:56,192
should an agent expand the state space?

1812
01:31:56,326 --> 01:31:59,588
And Alex Kiefer also kind of added a

1813
01:31:59,594 --> 01:32:02,036
note it's appropriate to add a new

1814
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:03,920
parameter when the model complexity

1815
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,484
accuracy trade off says so. More

1816
01:32:06,522 --> 01:32:08,992
seriously, isn't free energy measurable

1817
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:11,524
across models or different state spaces?

1818
01:32:11,652 --> 01:32:14,184
So it's almost like there's the

1819
01:32:14,222 --> 01:32:18,580
structure learning metacognition

1820
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:22,216
layer and it almost is like can the

1821
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:25,484
box be wrapped within the box? Can it be

1822
01:32:25,522 --> 01:32:27,276
possible to have a state space that

1823
01:32:27,298 --> 01:32:28,616
within its state space represents

1824
01:32:28,648 --> 01:32:32,220
itself? And or to what extent do

1825
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:35,004
these physical intermediates and their

1826
01:32:35,042 --> 01:32:37,904
associated physics and metaphysics need

1827
01:32:37,942 --> 01:32:41,276
to come into play for different systems

1828
01:32:41,308 --> 01:32:43,120
and at what level of generality?

1829
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:48,208
Basically, about this, I subscribe to a

1830
01:32:48,214 --> 01:32:50,260
variant of consistent history

1831
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:53,156
interpretation of quantum physics. But

1832
01:32:53,178 --> 01:32:54,404
it's not quantum physics. It's just

1833
01:32:54,442 --> 01:32:56,304
something that has the kind of optical

1834
01:32:56,352 --> 01:32:58,070
properties quantum physics has.

1835
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,528
Well, I did commit to quantum

1836
01:33:02,544 --> 01:33:03,936
indoctrination theory earlier, so okay,

1837
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:06,612
let us say it is in nature quantum,

1838
01:33:06,676 --> 01:33:08,376
which is a bit trivial because, yes, it

1839
01:33:08,398 --> 01:33:10,936
has pieces in it, which is what being

1840
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:12,330
quantum is. But whatever.

1841
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:21,420
This is the most specific mathematically

1842
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,196
consistent white presented that I found.

1843
01:33:25,298 --> 01:33:27,424
Do you still see those slides? Yes,

1844
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:31,840
EBA. EBA Bay.

1845
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:37,308
And this is basically category theory

1846
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:41,824
because this diagram

1847
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:45,840
as a property, which is that following

1848
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,220
the arrows basically change what spaces

1849
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:52,648
b begins as ancestral interface. So a

1850
01:33:52,654 --> 01:33:55,572
space of possibilities that in principle

1851
01:33:55,636 --> 01:33:57,096
a fault interaction, but it is not

1852
01:33:57,118 --> 01:33:59,656
semantically loaded. And the fact that

1853
01:33:59,678 --> 01:34:01,576
you have the Nigeria of E, the

1854
01:34:01,598 --> 01:34:04,476
Observables and A, I framed it as an

1855
01:34:04,498 --> 01:34:07,144
agent, but it would rather be adaptive

1856
01:34:07,192 --> 01:34:09,608
capabilities or constraints that enabled

1857
01:34:09,624 --> 01:34:10,990
observation of E.

1858
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,240
So this

1859
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:18,800
does not conserve the property of B

1860
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:21,248
because B becomes equipped with

1861
01:34:21,334 --> 01:34:24,620
semantics. So we have theories

1862
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:28,356
that look at spaces without looking

1863
01:34:28,378 --> 01:34:30,992
at what is in spaces. Those are category

1864
01:34:31,056 --> 01:34:34,372
theories. And those are the most

1865
01:34:34,426 --> 01:34:37,188
abstract field of mathematics as far as

1866
01:34:37,194 --> 01:34:41,220
I know. And they do not afford

1867
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,408
semantically loaded things like free

1868
01:34:43,434 --> 01:34:46,584
energy. Energy is a measure of not only

1869
01:34:46,622 --> 01:34:48,984
it entails of states, but it also

1870
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:53,516
entails measure of states. I think the

1871
01:34:53,538 --> 01:34:55,676
basic mathematical structure we need to

1872
01:34:55,698 --> 01:34:59,244
work on that is much more

1873
01:34:59,282 --> 01:35:01,820
basic than any other things. And any

1874
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:03,932
energy measure will break down much

1875
01:35:03,986 --> 01:35:09,116
before we get there. But what

1876
01:35:09,138 --> 01:35:11,304
we have that is more semantically loaded

1877
01:35:11,432 --> 01:35:13,856
is this the duality between the

1878
01:35:13,878 --> 01:35:16,448
experience of struggle to landscape by

1879
01:35:16,454 --> 01:35:20,784
agents and the entrance flow

1880
01:35:20,912 --> 01:35:22,596
that is created by the landscape and

1881
01:35:22,618 --> 01:35:28,036
reconsider the landscape. So the

1882
01:35:28,058 --> 01:35:30,710
question was what was the question?

1883
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,724
Could you repeat it? Word force word

1884
01:35:34,762 --> 01:35:38,152
Daniel. It was

1885
01:35:38,206 --> 01:35:42,244
just about the normativity

1886
01:35:42,292 --> 01:35:45,150
around model selection and whether

1887
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,452
modeling states spaces could or

1888
01:35:49,506 --> 01:35:52,830
would require the

1889
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,660
artifact. The activity

1890
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:01,776
is there it is in

1891
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:04,384
this representation of the problem, I

1892
01:36:04,422 --> 01:36:07,360
have a small agents that represent

1893
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:09,844
circuit landscape and act within it.

1894
01:36:09,882 --> 01:36:12,788
And I can just claim, okay, there is a

1895
01:36:12,794 --> 01:36:14,288
set space, there is a flung destined

1896
01:36:14,304 --> 01:36:16,564
space. I can defend energy. These agents

1897
01:36:16,682 --> 01:36:20,644
minimize strategy. And then this

1898
01:36:20,682 --> 01:36:22,656
is where structural learning intervenes,

1899
01:36:22,688 --> 01:36:24,820
basically, because those agents will try

1900
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:26,744
to understand the world. They do not

1901
01:36:26,782 --> 01:36:28,856
experience the world directly. They will

1902
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:31,124
infer the world in a way that is robust

1903
01:36:31,172 --> 01:36:35,004
and competent, but they can make

1904
01:36:35,042 --> 01:36:37,628
up new things they can fail to

1905
01:36:37,634 --> 01:36:40,172
understand. They can cheat, they can

1906
01:36:40,226 --> 01:36:43,016
erode the structure of the landscape

1907
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:44,364
that is collectively enacted in many

1908
01:36:44,402 --> 01:36:47,884
ways. And this, again is

1909
01:36:47,922 --> 01:36:52,084
duel to something that is dynamics.

1910
01:36:52,152 --> 01:36:54,272
Actually, I do not know what it is. It

1911
01:36:54,326 --> 01:36:57,920
doesn't have a word. The unfolding of

1912
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:00,324
the structure of the landscape under its

1913
01:37:00,362 --> 01:37:03,748
own flow. That, again, is not

1914
01:37:03,834 --> 01:37:05,588
dynamics because it's not what the

1915
01:37:05,594 --> 01:37:08,756
sensory says. We described what

1916
01:37:08,778 --> 01:37:10,288
you're talking about in terms of niche

1917
01:37:10,304 --> 01:37:14,980
construction in human systems.

1918
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:18,596
Karl and I had an interesting discussion

1919
01:37:18,628 --> 01:37:20,936
about this a few weeks ago. And yeah, I

1920
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:23,080
think what really distinguishes human

1921
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:26,316
systems from non human systems is the

1922
01:37:26,338 --> 01:37:28,968
degree to which active inference lab

1923
01:37:29,064 --> 01:37:32,344
loop is mediated by what would otherwise

1924
01:37:32,392 --> 01:37:34,940
be internal states, but end up having

1925
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:37,184
this kind of ambiguous function. Of

1926
01:37:37,302 --> 01:37:39,424
yeah, they're environmental, but they

1927
01:37:39,462 --> 01:37:42,144
encoding the material aspects of some

1928
01:37:42,182 --> 01:37:46,304
normative practice or some store some

1929
01:37:46,342 --> 01:37:48,480
information about what you're doing,

1930
01:37:48,550 --> 01:37:51,540
like a blackboard, for instance, or

1931
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:53,750
these slides that we're all looking at

1932
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,524
in some sense, encode the thought or

1933
01:37:57,562 --> 01:37:58,768
aspects of the thought that you're

1934
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,020
trying to communicate.

1935
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:04,744
Maybe a lot of the problem here can be

1936
01:38:04,782 --> 01:38:06,744
finessed by noting that it's not just

1937
01:38:06,782 --> 01:38:09,144
about agents interacting with each

1938
01:38:09,182 --> 01:38:12,488
other. There is a kind of common store

1939
01:38:12,574 --> 01:38:15,500
of traces,

1940
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,116
like a kind of material thing that we

1941
01:38:19,138 --> 01:38:21,870
all have in common. Yes.

1942
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,616
You have a common collective action of

1943
01:38:28,658 --> 01:38:30,672
given structural landscape because

1944
01:38:30,726 --> 01:38:32,384
humans are such that then they

1945
01:38:32,422 --> 01:38:34,716
synchronize in a robust and smooth sky

1946
01:38:34,748 --> 01:38:37,148
loaded way. And that structural

1947
01:38:37,164 --> 01:38:39,600
landscape, it does not exist.

1948
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:42,392
It is not something that pre exists.

1949
01:38:42,476 --> 01:38:45,108
The fact that agents do that agents

1950
01:38:45,194 --> 01:38:47,430
infer properties and then enact them.

1951
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:51,148
And this makes it an open landscape.

1952
01:38:51,344 --> 01:38:55,240
And the normativity of the FEP affords

1953
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:59,240
probably a computational experiment

1954
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:03,144
design that help us see how such

1955
01:39:03,262 --> 01:39:06,852
landscape unfolds and look at material

1956
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:09,404
theory where the agent is absent, where

1957
01:39:09,442 --> 01:39:11,516
it is landscape that produce the

1958
01:39:11,538 --> 01:39:13,436
landscape. And once we have that, we

1959
01:39:13,458 --> 01:39:14,908
have a theory of creation. It is what

1960
01:39:14,914 --> 01:39:17,856
the theory of creation is. So what

1961
01:39:17,878 --> 01:39:19,804
you're saying is if we had a theory

1962
01:39:19,852 --> 01:39:23,552
where the agent was able to expand its

1963
01:39:23,686 --> 01:39:26,272
state space through structure and

1964
01:39:26,326 --> 01:39:29,284
parameter learning in particular, then

1965
01:39:29,402 --> 01:39:30,996
we would have what you're looking for.

1966
01:39:31,098 --> 01:39:32,740
Am I misunderstanding?

1967
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:38,276
Yes. But I'm not sure that we agree that

1968
01:39:38,298 --> 01:39:40,244
we're relying on the constraints that

1969
01:39:40,282 --> 01:39:41,720
this segment entails.

1970
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:48,136
Not sure I see what you do. Because the

1971
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:51,160
goal is not to understand how the agent

1972
01:39:51,230 --> 01:39:54,424
engage with personnel environment, it is

1973
01:39:54,542 --> 01:39:58,184
to obstruct. If we get to

1974
01:39:58,222 --> 01:39:59,916
the target, we can obstruct entirely the

1975
01:39:59,938 --> 01:40:02,572
agent in what they think and just look

1976
01:40:02,626 --> 01:40:05,612
at constraints and how they informed. I

1977
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,708
went light on Axel Costa because we do

1978
01:40:07,714 --> 01:40:10,256
not have it was not the place for that.

1979
01:40:10,358 --> 01:40:13,516
But we need to look at specifically

1980
01:40:13,548 --> 01:40:16,000
constraint over what is observable and

1981
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:18,880
how they are invigorated and how they

1982
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:21,156
produce other constraints, etc, etc. We

1983
01:40:21,178 --> 01:40:29,030
have to get back at this.

1984
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:35,204
Constraints are dual to priors.

1985
01:40:35,332 --> 01:40:36,824
I mean, you're talking about the same

1986
01:40:36,862 --> 01:40:40,424
thing. But the formulation that

1987
01:40:40,462 --> 01:40:44,380
is taken in physics often by belief is

1988
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:47,692
DST. It entails primitive space.

1989
01:40:47,746 --> 01:40:50,684
And this is what needs to be to address

1990
01:40:50,722 --> 01:40:52,348
the problem I want to address. This is

1991
01:40:52,354 --> 01:40:55,500
why to have to be overcome

1992
01:40:56,420 --> 01:41:00,444
and this is likely

1993
01:41:00,492 --> 01:41:03,068
possible given constraints and trick

1994
01:41:03,084 --> 01:41:05,216
ontology. So biology where do not have

1995
01:41:05,318 --> 01:41:07,696
possibilities, then constraints of other

1996
01:41:07,718 --> 01:41:09,712
possibilities, but constraints, then

1997
01:41:09,766 --> 01:41:11,788
possibilities afforded by constraints.

1998
01:41:11,964 --> 01:41:13,844
And I do know what I'm saying. Is that

1999
01:41:13,962 --> 01:41:16,230
those two stories are the same story.

2000
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,190
That's what Bayesian Mechanics says.

2001
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:25,784
Within DST. But they're both from

2002
01:41:25,822 --> 01:41:29,610
DST. So a

2003
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:33,096
free energy principle theoretic model of

2004
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:36,216
the belief updating of a particle in a

2005
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:40,024
system is in the strong sense of like

2006
01:41:40,062 --> 01:41:41,676
is dual to you. If I have one, I have

2007
01:41:41,698 --> 01:41:45,604
the other. Right? Is a maximum entropy

2008
01:41:45,672 --> 01:41:49,312
dynamical systems model of the whole

2009
01:41:49,366 --> 01:41:51,744
system, as in the whole system of

2010
01:41:51,782 --> 01:41:53,628
particles and environment to which it's

2011
01:41:53,644 --> 01:41:55,760
coupled and all of that sensory Conor.

2012
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:00,980
That's the cool thing. The FEP is

2013
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:04,304
the canonical optimal dynamical systems

2014
01:42:04,352 --> 01:42:07,204
model. It's maximum entropy in the sense

2015
01:42:07,242 --> 01:42:10,292
that it

2016
01:42:10,346 --> 01:42:13,672
makes the least assumptions given your

2017
01:42:13,726 --> 01:42:15,704
current state of knowledge about the

2018
01:42:15,742 --> 01:42:20,612
system. It's James.

2019
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:23,960
As in J-A-Y-N-E-S.

2020
01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:26,516
It's James. Optimal in the Parliament.

2021
01:42:26,548 --> 01:42:29,980
So belton shock mebodyville. Yes.

2022
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:32,124
If you have a constraints model, you

2023
01:42:32,162 --> 01:42:34,728
also have an FEP model and vice versa.

2024
01:42:34,824 --> 01:42:36,504
If you work it out from the perspective

2025
01:42:36,552 --> 01:42:39,280
of the FEP, you can map back onto

2026
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,480
constraints. But definitionally,

2027
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:45,600
if you can frame a. Constraint model

2028
01:42:45,670 --> 01:42:47,296
with no reference whatsoever to the

2029
01:42:47,318 --> 01:42:50,224
ecosystem theory or preexisting spaces.

2030
01:42:50,352 --> 01:42:51,668
Yes, I agree, you have solved the

2031
01:42:51,674 --> 01:42:55,508
problem but the paper

2032
01:42:55,594 --> 01:42:57,860
which we refer to frames it within DST

2033
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:02,760
so it has those

2034
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:05,336
that we need to get beyond to solve this

2035
01:43:05,358 --> 01:43:07,176
specific problem. Again, I do not mean

2036
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:10,184
to say basically you have framed this

2037
01:43:10,222 --> 01:43:13,656
equivalence, I think up

2038
01:43:13,678 --> 01:43:16,216
to details, let us say up to details I

2039
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:17,630
would need to think about it actually,

2040
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,468
but with the potentials that are

2041
01:43:21,554 --> 01:43:24,476
precisely those that I want to use the

2042
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:28,528
equivalents to the Conor. So it is not I

2043
01:43:28,534 --> 01:43:30,924
guess I'm. Just saying that constraints

2044
01:43:30,972 --> 01:43:32,448
don't get you out of the problem that

2045
01:43:32,454 --> 01:43:34,832
you were posing originally either like

2046
01:43:34,886 --> 01:43:38,304
both you have another kind

2047
01:43:38,342 --> 01:43:41,780
of layer of pregiving static.

2048
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:43,744
Is not we have to characterize

2049
01:43:43,792 --> 01:43:46,196
constraints, it is that we have to have

2050
01:43:46,218 --> 01:43:48,036
an ontology of constraints. So

2051
01:43:48,058 --> 01:43:50,672
mathematical controls that Axel Costa

2052
01:43:50,736 --> 01:43:52,464
with no reference to anything else,

2053
01:43:52,522 --> 01:43:55,188
just constraints. What means? I don't

2054
01:43:55,204 --> 01:43:57,736
know. But if we have that in the sense

2055
01:43:57,838 --> 01:43:59,672
while considering the sense that is

2056
01:43:59,726 --> 01:44:02,120
given by Monsieur Moreno and while

2057
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:03,404
leveraging the equivalence between

2058
01:44:03,442 --> 01:44:05,704
constraints and belief that meaning

2059
01:44:05,752 --> 01:44:08,652
belief, whatever that is derived we have

2060
01:44:08,706 --> 01:44:10,796
one, but it is not something that has

2061
01:44:10,818 --> 01:44:13,790
been done because FEP is friend within

2062
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,304
vanillafep, vfep is friend

2063
01:44:18,342 --> 01:44:20,496
within DST, which basically states and

2064
01:44:20,518 --> 01:44:23,856
Qfeps does

2065
01:44:23,878 --> 01:44:26,592
not specify what build observable is,

2066
01:44:26,646 --> 01:44:28,572
just specify that there are observables

2067
01:44:28,636 --> 01:44:30,560
that we can make obeyed.

2068
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:36,724
But we can't solve this within DST or

2069
01:44:36,762 --> 01:44:39,248
within pure abstract quantum

2070
01:44:39,264 --> 01:44:41,156
indoctrination. So it is not afforded by

2071
01:44:41,178 --> 01:44:42,644
the structure of this series one

2072
01:44:42,682 --> 01:44:44,084
prospective states, the other

2073
01:44:44,122 --> 01:44:46,360
prospective observers we have to show

2074
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:49,908
how those are becoming

2075
01:44:49,924 --> 01:44:53,064
integrated and the only

2076
01:44:53,262 --> 01:44:55,556
way forward that I see is a constraint

2077
01:44:55,588 --> 01:44:59,596
biology. Right, but what I'm saying is

2078
01:44:59,778 --> 01:45:02,168
mathematically speaking, if you're

2079
01:45:02,184 --> 01:45:04,812
talking about constraints then there is

2080
01:45:04,866 --> 01:45:08,088
a in the end it's probably function.

2081
01:45:08,184 --> 01:45:11,564
I mean, you know, there is a rigorous

2082
01:45:11,692 --> 01:45:14,556
and systematic mapping from what you're

2083
01:45:14,588 --> 01:45:17,712
talking about to what the FEP is already

2084
01:45:17,766 --> 01:45:18,370
saying.

2085
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,710
That's really what the duality is saying

2086
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,516
maximizing your entropy with respect to

2087
01:45:28,538 --> 01:45:31,508
some set of constraints is cue to

2088
01:45:31,594 --> 01:45:34,276
minimizing your free energy with respect

2089
01:45:34,308 --> 01:45:36,776
to some model. It's the same thing if

2090
01:45:36,798 --> 01:45:39,050
you have one, you always have the other.

2091
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:42,536
How would you frame the notion of a

2092
01:45:42,558 --> 01:45:44,388
constraint in the sense of control

2093
01:45:44,404 --> 01:45:46,964
Monteville and Moreno with no reference

2094
01:45:47,012 --> 01:45:49,884
to either DST or in the United States?

2095
01:45:50,082 --> 01:45:52,808
Well, I mean in these reaction networks

2096
01:45:52,824 --> 01:45:54,204
that they're mapping, they are

2097
01:45:54,242 --> 01:45:57,988
implicitly using. Some kind of reaction

2098
01:45:58,024 --> 01:46:01,090
networks. It is another line of work.

2099
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:04,960
Right, but I'm just saying that there is

2100
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:09,092
a similar kind of individuation of

2101
01:46:09,146 --> 01:46:12,996
things that's going on when you map out

2102
01:46:13,098 --> 01:46:16,740
some kind of constraint schematic.

2103
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,028
In that sense, the point that you're

2104
01:46:21,044 --> 01:46:24,472
making sort of like grandfathers both

2105
01:46:24,526 --> 01:46:26,650
here, which is okay, but how do you

2106
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:30,776
write down a state space model at all?

2107
01:46:30,958 --> 01:46:35,070
And how do you grow them in particular?

2108
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,540
But I guess I'm just saying, yeah,

2109
01:46:38,610 --> 01:46:40,764
constraints are just as subject to this

2110
01:46:40,882 --> 01:46:44,072
as to the extent that the FEP is subject

2111
01:46:44,136 --> 01:46:47,052
to your criticism. The constraint stuff

2112
01:46:47,106 --> 01:46:50,124
is also for the same or dual reasons.

2113
01:46:50,252 --> 01:46:52,316
If you just inverted all of the arrows

2114
01:46:52,348 --> 01:46:54,624
in your reasoning, you would also be

2115
01:46:54,662 --> 01:46:56,604
able to apply this to the constraint

2116
01:46:56,652 --> 01:46:59,876
stuff equally. That's not an exit to

2117
01:46:59,898 --> 01:47:02,676
what you're pointing out. But I guess my

2118
01:47:02,698 --> 01:47:06,196
complimentary point is if you

2119
01:47:06,218 --> 01:47:08,656
think moving to Axel constant ontology

2120
01:47:08,768 --> 01:47:10,952
helps us, then that's interesting

2121
01:47:11,006 --> 01:47:14,472
because any constraint mapping is also

2122
01:47:14,526 --> 01:47:18,312
cue to an FEP theoretic model. So maybe

2123
01:47:18,366 --> 01:47:21,204
the FEP can be used like very directly,

2124
01:47:21,252 --> 01:47:23,880
just based on the way that you're like

2125
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:25,916
if you solve the problem in terms of

2126
01:47:25,938 --> 01:47:27,950
constraints, you could flip it back.

2127
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:31,836
I don't know. If you're stuck along the

2128
01:47:31,858 --> 01:47:33,996
way, then you can flip it at that point

2129
01:47:34,178 --> 01:47:37,676
and think, okay, well, looking at

2130
01:47:37,698 --> 01:47:40,464
it from this, do I want to look at self

2131
01:47:40,502 --> 01:47:42,784
organization from the perspective of the

2132
01:47:42,822 --> 01:47:45,456
cells that are self organizing or from

2133
01:47:45,478 --> 01:47:48,416
the perspective of organization and the

2134
01:47:48,438 --> 01:47:50,704
maximization of entropy and all that

2135
01:47:50,742 --> 01:47:54,212
stuff? I guess so if you're doing that,

2136
01:47:54,346 --> 01:47:57,604
the FTP treats a naturally different

2137
01:47:57,642 --> 01:48:00,068
problem. This is not a view. This is a

2138
01:48:00,074 --> 01:48:03,480
view opposed. Specifically. I do agree

2139
01:48:03,550 --> 01:48:06,580
that physics of and by belief derives

2140
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:09,528
within the st rigorous relation between

2141
01:48:09,614 --> 01:48:11,592
basically what are the two sides of this

2142
01:48:11,646 --> 01:48:15,292
up to details. What I am saying

2143
01:48:15,426 --> 01:48:17,564
is framing as a goal the fact to

2144
01:48:17,602 --> 01:48:22,604
leverage that as a way to build

2145
01:48:22,642 --> 01:48:25,372
a mathematical theory of state space

2146
01:48:25,426 --> 01:48:28,848
construction. And I also claim that this

2147
01:48:29,014 --> 01:48:32,450
would be essentially equivalent to build

2148
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:38,496
self consistent constraint

2149
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:41,764
biology for that,

2150
01:48:41,802 --> 01:48:45,188
for this diagram. I'm not sure what you

2151
01:48:45,194 --> 01:48:47,476
are going against, because it is an

2152
01:48:47,498 --> 01:48:50,244
ambiguous that your research as of now

2153
01:48:50,282 --> 01:48:53,056
is framed within DST, which presupposes

2154
01:48:53,088 --> 01:48:54,752
states, which the constraint biology

2155
01:48:54,816 --> 01:48:56,856
would not. And it is ambiguous that is

2156
01:48:56,878 --> 01:48:59,544
very relevant because it, as you said,

2157
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:03,000
entails one duality, at least in one

2158
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:05,008
specific case, which is this of DST.

2159
01:49:05,124 --> 01:49:08,204
That is the key problem to address.

2160
01:49:08,402 --> 01:49:11,980
So I think you may be combining two

2161
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:13,660
issues in this worry.

2162
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,128
There's the worry of like new states

2163
01:49:18,214 --> 01:49:22,130
arising and there's the worry of using

2164
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:24,050
states at all.

2165
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:28,790
Okay,

2166
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:34,864
the problem is not really that dynamical

2167
01:49:34,912 --> 01:49:38,676
systems theory assumes states,

2168
01:49:38,778 --> 01:49:42,250
it's just the static nest of

2169
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:47,220
the predeterminedness

2170
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:50,356
or the prespecified nest.

2171
01:49:50,468 --> 01:49:53,976
Okay, if that's specifically your

2172
01:49:53,998 --> 01:49:56,812
worries, there is a very fruitful way

2173
01:49:56,866 --> 01:49:58,828
forward, I think, to address a lot of

2174
01:49:58,834 --> 01:50:03,032
them. My proposal

2175
01:50:03,176 --> 01:50:04,860
is a state space construction, not

2176
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:09,056
states based negotiationism. To get A,

2177
01:50:09,158 --> 01:50:12,140
I need B to begin with, I need physical

2178
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:15,600
things to be there. Well, to have

2179
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:17,504
actually selfconstitute, you would need

2180
01:50:17,542 --> 01:50:20,870
this to work from ex nilo to get

2181
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:24,644
something from nothing. But it is not

2182
01:50:24,682 --> 01:50:26,836
the issue at hand here. The issue at

2183
01:50:26,858 --> 01:50:29,828
hand here is how existing things can

2184
01:50:29,914 --> 01:50:32,612
unfold create whatever meaning states.

2185
01:50:32,746 --> 01:50:34,936
So it is not the notion of states that

2186
01:50:34,958 --> 01:50:37,944
is the problem. The problem is the fact

2187
01:50:37,982 --> 01:50:40,536
that we do not have a theory of how

2188
01:50:40,638 --> 01:50:43,316
states are created and we cannot frame

2189
01:50:43,348 --> 01:50:46,856
it exclusively from mathematical

2190
01:50:46,888 --> 01:50:49,400
theory that by construction presupposes

2191
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:51,324
a space of possibilities. We can,

2192
01:50:51,362 --> 01:50:54,844
however, from this theory to

2193
01:50:55,042 --> 01:50:57,484
generalize it to the space construction,

2194
01:50:57,532 --> 01:51:00,576
which is what I'm proposing. But what

2195
01:51:00,598 --> 01:51:02,576
about the renormalization group? So if

2196
01:51:02,598 --> 01:51:04,656
you start really from the idea that you

2197
01:51:04,678 --> 01:51:08,290
just have observations and they

2198
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,944
have a scale of noise associated

2199
01:51:12,992 --> 01:51:13,750
with them,

2200
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:21,544
there are principled physics kind of

2201
01:51:21,582 --> 01:51:23,688
ways of bootstrapping. Something kind of

2202
01:51:23,694 --> 01:51:26,696
saying, well, some stuff changes.

2203
01:51:26,878 --> 01:51:29,780
So fast relative to my reference scale

2204
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:32,824
that it basically averages out and just

2205
01:51:32,862 --> 01:51:34,904
contributes kind of random fluctuations

2206
01:51:34,952 --> 01:51:36,220
to what. I'm observing,

2207
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,956
whereas possibilities and you

2208
01:51:40,978 --> 01:51:43,612
look at basically a way to analyze it,

2209
01:51:43,666 --> 01:51:46,430
to look brain evolution scales. But

2210
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,180
maybe it would be afforded to other

2211
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:51,296
pastoralism, but it does not intend, it

2212
01:51:51,318 --> 01:51:53,490
does not model past realism. It is a

2213
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:56,156
model of how complex things, complex,

2214
01:51:56,188 --> 01:51:57,360
dynamic, unfold.

2215
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:02,768
So it is relevant. It is not what I'm

2216
01:52:02,944 --> 01:52:04,070
pointing at.

2217
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:11,056
Right. As we

2218
01:52:11,178 --> 01:52:13,768
come near the end. For each of us,

2219
01:52:13,934 --> 01:52:15,876
maybe you can spend the most time avil,

2220
01:52:15,908 --> 01:52:18,440
but for each of us, what are our next

2221
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:23,124
steps? What cognitive counterfactuals

2222
01:52:23,252 --> 01:52:26,684
and physical embodiments are going to be

2223
01:52:26,722 --> 01:52:28,780
shaped by this work and discussion?

2224
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:33,276
Maybe we can have nonaval go first and

2225
01:52:33,298 --> 01:52:35,484
then you can have the last word. Sound

2226
01:52:35,522 --> 01:52:38,064
good? Okay.

2227
01:52:38,262 --> 01:52:40,736
Well, personally, I'm very excited to

2228
01:52:40,838 --> 01:52:43,440
work on the category theory this year,

2229
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:47,212
learning about the recent dissertation

2230
01:52:47,276 --> 01:52:49,540
of Toby Smith.

2231
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:53,284
Also, I think it's interesting to bring

2232
01:52:53,322 --> 01:52:56,256
in that niche modification active

2233
01:52:56,288 --> 01:53:00,036
infrast variational ecology. A lot

2234
01:53:00,058 --> 01:53:01,976
of the work that, as Maxwell brought up

2235
01:53:01,998 --> 01:53:04,568
earlier, had been framed within a

2236
01:53:04,654 --> 01:53:07,816
multiscale setting, bringing some of

2237
01:53:07,838 --> 01:53:09,976
these new developments over the last one

2238
01:53:09,998 --> 01:53:11,672
or two years, like the path based

2239
01:53:11,726 --> 01:53:14,588
formalization renormalization group,

2240
01:53:14,754 --> 01:53:17,064
environmental process, generative,

2241
01:53:17,112 --> 01:53:19,448
process, generative, model, Symmetries,

2242
01:53:19,624 --> 01:53:22,076
Weak, Markov, Blanket. There's just many

2243
01:53:22,258 --> 01:53:25,688
new concepts and toolkits on the table

2244
01:53:25,864 --> 01:53:29,184
today in 2023 than I think there were

2245
01:53:29,222 --> 01:53:32,124
one or two or three years ago. So it's

2246
01:53:32,172 --> 01:53:34,816
been a super interesting discussion and

2247
01:53:34,838 --> 01:53:38,916
it brings a lot of topics to our

2248
01:53:38,938 --> 01:53:42,836
attention that I expect will be

2249
01:53:42,858 --> 01:53:45,556
able to reduce our uncertainty about a

2250
01:53:45,578 --> 01:53:48,484
lot in the coming year. I'll pass to

2251
01:53:48,522 --> 01:53:50,820
Blei, then Maxwell, and. Then Apple,

2252
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:53,140
the opposite. It would be more

2253
01:53:53,210 --> 01:53:54,616
consistent because Blei and I goal

2254
01:53:54,638 --> 01:53:56,520
directed together in controls. Okay,

2255
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:57,720
maxwell?

2256
01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:04,722
Well, I mean, Daniel, I would echo your

2257
01:54:04,776 --> 01:54:08,274
overall assessment. I share your

2258
01:54:08,312 --> 01:54:12,274
enthusiasm for where everything is

2259
01:54:12,312 --> 01:54:15,154
at right now. I think we're poised for

2260
01:54:15,192 --> 01:54:17,414
some very exciting work and a lot of

2261
01:54:17,452 --> 01:54:20,422
very interesting stuff has happened over

2262
01:54:20,476 --> 01:54:24,338
the short term in terms of what Aval

2263
01:54:24,434 --> 01:54:29,174
presented. I think in

2264
01:54:29,212 --> 01:54:30,694
addition to what you were describing,

2265
01:54:30,742 --> 01:54:34,314
one of the things I want to work out

2266
01:54:34,352 --> 01:54:38,314
this year is really the loss of the free

2267
01:54:38,352 --> 01:54:40,902
free energy principle Bayesian

2268
01:54:40,966 --> 01:54:44,874
mechanics. I think up until recently,

2269
01:54:44,922 --> 01:54:47,502
what most everyone has been doing,

2270
01:54:47,556 --> 01:54:50,062
myself included, was just coming at this

2271
01:54:50,116 --> 01:54:52,762
thing from whatever disciplinary

2272
01:54:52,826 --> 01:54:55,822
background we had access to and trying

2273
01:54:55,876 --> 01:54:58,914
to just make sense of it. But I think

2274
01:54:58,952 --> 01:55:02,626
that has made us kind of blind to some

2275
01:55:02,648 --> 01:55:04,754
of the and everyone has kind of their

2276
01:55:04,792 --> 01:55:07,042
blind spots. All of these so called

2277
01:55:07,096 --> 01:55:10,386
interpretations of the FEP signal to

2278
01:55:10,408 --> 01:55:14,406
me that there's philosophical work

2279
01:55:14,428 --> 01:55:17,186
to be done to kind of understand. Jules

2280
01:55:17,218 --> 01:55:18,918
had just put it nicely on Twitter. I

2281
01:55:18,924 --> 01:55:21,346
think he said that he'd become convinced

2282
01:55:21,378 --> 01:55:24,006
of two things. First, the FEP is true in

2283
01:55:24,028 --> 01:55:25,446
the sense that it's quote unquote, the

2284
01:55:25,468 --> 01:55:27,158
right way to do it. And second, that

2285
01:55:27,164 --> 01:55:30,278
it's a lot more like boring than all the

2286
01:55:30,284 --> 01:55:33,102
hype suggest in the sense that it just

2287
01:55:33,156 --> 01:55:35,118
follows from the way that a bunch of

2288
01:55:35,124 --> 01:55:37,386
physics hooks up. It's very fundamental

2289
01:55:37,418 --> 01:55:39,200
and important. But yeah,

2290
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:44,614
it's part of the kind of core package

2291
01:55:44,682 --> 01:55:47,742
now and there are new exciting horizons

2292
01:55:47,806 --> 01:55:51,762
of unknown. But more

2293
01:55:51,816 --> 01:55:55,458
to the point is there's like a

2294
01:55:55,544 --> 01:55:58,774
kind of core philosophy to the Sat that

2295
01:55:58,812 --> 01:56:02,422
d Maisto be developed? So for example,

2296
01:56:02,476 --> 01:56:04,726
the duality between the principle of

2297
01:56:04,748 --> 01:56:08,642
maximum entropy which implements

2298
01:56:08,706 --> 01:56:10,534
a form of like Akama's razor in some

2299
01:56:10,572 --> 01:56:12,218
sense and the free energy principle I

2300
01:56:12,224 --> 01:56:14,922
think is kind of deep. But we've only

2301
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:17,942
started to think about the implication

2302
01:56:18,006 --> 01:56:19,834
that have and Chris Fields group has

2303
01:56:19,872 --> 01:56:21,750
been suggesting that there's a similar

2304
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,466
duality between the FEP and unitarity

2305
01:56:25,578 --> 01:56:27,162
or the conservation of classical

2306
01:56:27,226 --> 01:56:30,734
information in quantum information

2307
01:56:30,852 --> 01:56:34,106
theory. So that's

2308
01:56:34,138 --> 01:56:35,986
very exciting. Sorry for talking so

2309
01:56:36,008 --> 01:56:39,410
long. Awesome exciting times

2310
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:42,398
indeed. All right, Alexey, and avoid

2311
01:56:42,414 --> 01:56:43,620
with the final words.

2312
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:50,038
Yes, I will be short.

2313
01:56:50,124 --> 01:56:52,854
So I'm really excited about how these

2314
01:56:52,972 --> 01:56:54,982
debates will move the lines in

2315
01:56:55,036 --> 01:56:56,882
theoretical but also practical

2316
01:56:57,026 --> 01:57:00,330
philosophy and on goal directed

2317
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:03,194
perception of stuff in life in general

2318
01:57:03,312 --> 01:57:06,666
to be a bit broad. Also, I hope

2319
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:13,374
that all of this

2320
01:57:13,412 --> 01:57:15,514
will make the difference in metaphysics

2321
01:57:15,562 --> 01:57:19,066
and ontology in philosophy and meta

2322
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:22,080
biology and naturalism, of course,

2323
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:24,542
as it seems to do in active insurance

2324
01:57:24,596 --> 01:57:26,270
lab and chaos.

2325
01:57:36,970 --> 01:57:40,518
We need to do to set all the dust on the

2326
01:57:40,524 --> 01:57:42,534
agreement I generated there. The first

2327
01:57:42,572 --> 01:57:45,026
is to formalize much better segmental.

2328
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:46,934
Biological consistency and

2329
01:57:46,972 --> 01:57:50,234
phosphorialism both need to be very

2330
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:53,514
clear in their reach and

2331
01:57:53,632 --> 01:57:55,834
entailments. This is something we'll do

2332
01:57:55,872 --> 01:57:58,966
with Alexey Menlee and possibly

2333
01:57:58,998 --> 01:58:00,060
autograph members.

2334
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:05,214
Something that we need to do too is to

2335
01:58:05,412 --> 01:58:08,670
put a lot of work in working out what

2336
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:12,190
these Bay things mean. I do not know.

2337
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:14,250
I can tell you that it is essentially

2338
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:16,254
correct. I'm pretty confident that

2339
01:58:16,292 --> 01:58:17,554
essentially correct, but I have no idea

2340
01:58:17,592 --> 01:58:20,338
whatsoever what it means, but which is

2341
01:58:20,504 --> 01:58:22,146
pretty big problem as far as I'm

2342
01:58:22,168 --> 01:58:24,034
concerned. So there will be a lot of

2343
01:58:24,072 --> 01:58:27,106
work for me and other members,

2344
01:58:27,288 --> 01:58:31,078
namely Yanabrinak and Maxine Chimole to

2345
01:58:31,164 --> 01:58:36,534
work out the specifics of this

2346
01:58:36,572 --> 01:58:40,378
mathematical thing that

2347
01:58:40,464 --> 01:58:44,730
allows order to unfold from chaos.

2348
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:50,454
And most pressingly in my opinion

2349
01:58:50,502 --> 01:58:52,766
at least, it's what I'm supposed to

2350
01:58:52,788 --> 01:58:56,446
focus on in terms of flow. It is to

2351
01:58:56,468 --> 01:58:59,390
work out what this means, how social

2352
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:01,646
constraints are enacted and how they

2353
01:59:01,668 --> 01:59:04,094
evolve, because ultimately the rest is

2354
01:59:04,132 --> 01:59:06,546
abstraction. This is what has content.

2355
01:59:06,728 --> 01:59:08,530
This is what allows us to say, okay,

2356
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,802
these are what exists. These are the

2357
01:59:10,856 --> 01:59:12,706
constraints that shape things, and this

2358
01:59:12,728 --> 01:59:15,250
is what is their flow.

2359
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:20,466
It is critical from centric

2360
01:59:20,498 --> 01:59:22,566
perspective because it is what gives me

2361
01:59:22,668 --> 01:59:24,566
to listen to our accounts. It is

2362
01:59:24,588 --> 01:59:27,186
critical from pragmatic perspective

2363
01:59:27,218 --> 01:59:31,402
because it is what tells us what

2364
01:59:31,456 --> 01:59:33,654
world we are in and what is its flow,

2365
01:59:33,702 --> 01:59:36,410
which is the goal of Cairos, something

2366
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,642
we'll do with mainly my own job

2367
01:59:39,696 --> 01:59:43,558
and Venus Gonzalez. And so,

2368
01:59:43,584 --> 01:59:45,406
basically, we will work around the
