00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,226
Daniel Friedman: Hello and welcome. This is Active

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,506
Inference Livestream number 35.1. It's

3
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:14,440
January 24, 2023.

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,254
Today we're here with Jordan Hall and

5
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:19,766
Matthew Prakowski. We're going to have a

6
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:21,686
very interesting discussion. So thank

7
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,382
you both for joining. We will begin with

8
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:28,410
a hello and introduction from Jordan.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,646
Matthew will then set some context that

10
00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:35,342
will launch us into a dialogue that will

11
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:38,686
take us on through. So thanks again.

12
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,468
And Jordan, please.

13
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:44,146
Jordan Hall: Turns out I lied in the preamble, so a little

14
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,586
bit of introduction. I'm noticing and

15
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:46,546
this is, I think, part of the real

16
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:47,826
interest of having a conversation with

17
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,698
Matthew is something like it would

18
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:53,894
be nice, I think, and implausible for us

19
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:56,566
to actually produce something new and

20
00:00:56,588 --> 00:01:00,098
useful in this 90 minutes time span.

21
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:02,550
And I expect that we'll want to be using

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,874
something like a transparentigmatic

23
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:07,462
method. So we should be grabbing

24
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,580
concepts from a variety of different

25
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,810
disciplines and frames and applying them

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,606
in the area of inquiry and endeavoring

27
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:17,658
to use that to actually identify

28
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:20,794
something that is specific and perhaps

29
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:24,122
hasn't been as articulated or deeply

30
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:26,634
investigated, at least to my awareness,

31
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:29,466
of course, before. And so the end

32
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:31,650
result, hopefully will actually be worth

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,826
actually having been done and to have

34
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:35,700
been participated in.

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,194
Definitely. I hope that at least this

36
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:45,778
recording, in and of itself as an

37
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:48,038
artifact, will be something useful for a

38
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:50,086
number of people who might have been

39
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:52,338
paying attention to the initial context

40
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:54,726
and that we can bring together as we

41
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,874
typically do the many types of frames

42
00:01:57,922 --> 00:01:59,766
that we've been exploring in between our

43
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:04,446
conversations that are quite hurtful

44
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:06,234
and oftentimes bear fruit in

45
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:08,826
conversation. So I always look forward

46
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,186
to our conversation specifically for

47
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:13,486
that reason why we

48
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,534
are here this morning. Or I guess what

49
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:18,314
did catalyze this initially was a tweet

50
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:20,558
that I kind of randomly sent out the

51
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:23,646
other day as I had a network of concepts

52
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:25,780
floating around in my head around

53
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,930
emergence, governance, the tendencies

54
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,290
toward which that pattern flows.

55
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,326
And so the tweet may be best to just

56
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,974
read it because

57
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,794
that all forms of governance trend

58
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:43,606
toward parasitic corruption should be

59
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,366
the first quote unquote law of

60
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:48,054
political, quote unquote science. The

61
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:50,794
only questions are how long before this

62
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:52,714
becomes unsustainable? Does it also

63
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:55,658
generate valuable byproducts and will it

64
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:57,526
fail catastrophically or adaptively?

65
00:02:57,638 --> 00:02:59,946
And so just a general frame for the

66
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,262
conversation is to go on the lines of as

67
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,134
we move through the world together and

68
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:09,326
attempt to identify points of tension in

69
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:11,406
terms of the relationship between our

70
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:14,738
communities and the embedding context in

71
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,054
which they exist and attempt to navigate

72
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,102
the world such that they can retain

73
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,238
their ability to function, to cohere,

74
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:26,070
to generate new solutions that

75
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,478
help them mediate the tensions in the

76
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:31,542
world that are constantly attempting to

77
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:34,422
or constantly acting as a force against

78
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:36,086
those structures as we come together to

79
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:39,698
try to network

80
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:40,742
ourselves such that we can function

81
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:43,850
adaptive to create systems for doing so.

82
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,458
And that's evolved quite a bit over time

83
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:49,286
from informal systems at the tribal

84
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:51,946
level, at smaller social scales with

85
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:54,878
respect to structures that had much

86
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:56,638
greater coherence. Just as a function of

87
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:57,934
the fact that everyone knew each other,

88
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,398
everyone was around one another in a

89
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:03,486
daily context, had a deep history in

90
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,550
terms of their relational contextual

91
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,726
knowledge of those interpersonal

92
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:10,066
relations, these lineages. And so you

93
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:11,982
didn't need a great deal of abstraction

94
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:14,766
in the quote unquote political domain.

95
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:17,198
You didn't need to conceptualize an

96
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,446
abstract structure and then attempt to

97
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,078
convince people that this was the

98
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:23,286
legitimate structure to buy into as a

99
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:25,000
stewardship mechanism for themselves.

100
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,246
But as we scaled up, we started to

101
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,066
introduce these sorts least action. And

102
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:33,260
we are certainly in a time now where

103
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,074
it's worth asking this question as we

104
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:38,906
create abstractions that are into which

105
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:41,054
we pour our political energies. For

106
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:42,778
example, the idea of a democratic

107
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:46,542
governance or the sort of republic that

108
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:48,240
we live in in the United States.

109
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,586
To what extent is there a tendency of

110
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:55,922
those who are given stewardship over

111
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:59,170
that, given their placement, given their

112
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,994
necessity, necessary placement within

113
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,378
this mechanism, but also in the

114
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:05,074
necessity of the mechanism, but also

115
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:08,050
just the structure of that mechanism

116
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,038
being responsible as a small subset of

117
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:11,846
the population for stewarding this large

118
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:13,846
abstraction and this large degree of

119
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:14,998
attention and this large degree of

120
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:18,374
responsibility, is it possible for that

121
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:20,602
to be resistant to corruption across

122
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:23,382
long periods of time? Is it inevitable

123
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:26,074
that that corruption will exist? And

124
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,090
this was the claim in the Tweet that

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,182
people will fundamentally begin to make

126
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:34,046
choices that direct all of that

127
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,226
attention, energy toward their own ends,

128
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:39,098
as opposed to the ends, ostensible ends

129
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:42,382
of the collective. And then if that is a

130
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:46,046
given, what frames

131
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:48,146
can we hold? Despite the fact that this

132
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:50,866
is a given, that can still act as

133
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:53,966
evaluative criteria and so a useful

134
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:55,586
evaluated criteria? Which is what sort

135
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:58,402
of those three. Ideas that I provided

136
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:00,918
related to in terms of the degree to

137
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:02,950
which that can be an unsustainable or

138
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,210
sustainable structure, to the extent

139
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,774
that it still generates valuable

140
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:10,838
byproducts, even though that corruption

141
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:12,566
is necessary or inherently emergent

142
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:15,910
within. It or whether it will fail

143
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,850
catastrophically or adaptively?

144
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,278
Will it undermine itself entirely or

145
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:23,662
will it actually, within itself,

146
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,934
despite that corruption, be able to

147
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:28,190
surface new patterns into which itself

148
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,022
can fail as a kind of lifeboat that

149
00:06:31,156 --> 00:06:33,178
increasingly expands its own capacity?

150
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:36,238
So I'll kind of step away now and just

151
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:39,566
give time for reflection and analysis on

152
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:41,538
yelp's part. But that was just sort of

153
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:44,318
the initial frame that I think catalyzed

154
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:48,238
some conversation here. All right,

155
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:49,862
well, there's a whole bunch of different

156
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,714
things that are, I think, implicated.

157
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:58,106
And I noticed that put

158
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,898
a variety of different plates on the

159
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:03,562
table without having to understand

160
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,260
exactly what meal we're eating just yet,

161
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,306
in no particular order. One thing that

162
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,846
comma up is I feel like there's an

163
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:14,718
invocation of a frame that I've used a

164
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:17,086
lot, and that is something along the

165
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:21,070
lines of, like, major eras or apocs in

166
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,778
the arc of evolution, specifically in

167
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:26,482
the context of humans. And so the first

168
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:29,826
era, which I refer to

169
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:32,402
often as unconscious evolution or

170
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,298
ordinary evolution is the period that I

171
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:36,534
think you were referring to be something

172
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:39,750
like lineage, where there's the binding

173
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,846
constraints, the various kinds of

174
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:46,274
characteristics. Of behavior that steer

175
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:48,570
the collective choice making of a group

176
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,278
of indigenous humans

177
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:55,180
was largely a consequence of a very long

178
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,286
time and iterations under the ordinary

179
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:00,598
constraints of what I'll just call

180
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:03,498
ordinary biological evolution. So lots

181
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:05,646
of trial and error and conservation of

182
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:08,154
relatively fit behavior, very tightly

183
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:10,794
knit and with all the various advantages

184
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:14,286
that are associated with that modality

185
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:17,954
of exploring possibility space. The

186
00:08:17,992 --> 00:08:21,330
second era, the second APOC, would be

187
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,346
conscious design. And I think this is

188
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:25,378
the domain where we see most of the

189
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:28,834
problematics. And I'll invoke people

190
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:32,326
like Tainter, Ari, Kahn as other

191
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,870
individuals who have pointed to the

192
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,330
problematics that seem to be intrinsic

193
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,014
to the APOC or the modality of conscious

194
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,378
design. And of course, one of the sort

195
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,266
of most fundamental challenges is that

196
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:49,622
it exits us from the equilibrium

197
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:51,518
or the homeostatic feedback loops that

198
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:54,186
are characteristic of unconscious

199
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:57,066
evolution. So humans are able to operate

200
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:59,374
in the mode of conscious design. We

201
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,358
begin to create novelty in the

202
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:03,694
environment that produces asymmetry in

203
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:06,874
relationship with all the other feedback

204
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,146
loops that we happen to have been

205
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:10,158
embedded in contextually, but we don't

206
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,506
actually fully understand the

207
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:13,058
consequences of the asymmetries that

208
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:14,626
we're producing. And this creates a

209
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:16,430
whole series of cascade effects. So

210
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,742
Tainter explores that in the context of

211
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:21,910
how a designed social infrastructure

212
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,966
produces an arc that has a built in

213
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:27,414
enclosure. Because as we sort of play

214
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:29,386
out the entropy that was built into the

215
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:32,038
inception of that social infrastructure,

216
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:34,170
which may take generations or even many

217
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,206
generative, we find ourselves collapsing

218
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:40,266
back into the complex domain of the

219
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,266
unconscious evolutionary basis. And then

220
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:44,958
we have a reset. I think Kun more or

221
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:46,906
less explores the same basic dynamic

222
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:49,274
within the particular domain of science.

223
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,246
And I think they're largely, if you look

224
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:53,650
at them as being examples of a more

225
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,150
generalized problematic or even dynamic,

226
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,358
you can then use that to create a meta

227
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:00,050
theory.

228
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,986
Similarly, I'm not sure exactly who

229
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:05,454
studied this most carefully. Perhaps

230
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:08,230
Hayek looking at it in the context of

231
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,910
businesses, which have a very similar

232
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,294
and very well studied dynamic. The S

233
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:14,726
curve of a business structure where an

234
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,606
entrepreneurial group,

235
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,438
usually one or two or five founders like

236
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:22,186
a very small group operating in many

237
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,214
ways principally from the unconscious

238
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:26,298
evolutionary stage like operating in

239
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:28,406
very much a human. Indigenous modality

240
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:30,822
using a lot of the basic human dynamics

241
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,846
to be in deep relationship with each

242
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:34,702
other and form a very fluid, open,

243
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,722
coherent governance. Highly generative

244
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:40,142
produces a large gradient or a large

245
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:42,254
well of potential. But then as it

246
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,934
structures itself into the conscious

247
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:45,906
design mode and starts creating an

248
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:48,226
organizational structure, it plays the

249
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,210
various tools and in many ways, kind of

250
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,374
replicates the arc of social structures

251
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:56,226
in general, recreating the rise and fall

252
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:59,174
of civilizations and then forms some

253
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:00,482
form of closure and that eventually

254
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:02,054
dies. I think been studied pretty

255
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:03,094
thoroughly in a number of different

256
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:03,830
locations.

257
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,906
And given that language and I haven't

258
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:09,958
actually brought in parasite, which is a

259
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:11,846
very good so it's just bring in parasite

260
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:14,682
and the notion of niche. So a general

261
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:16,682
principle of evolution is that every

262
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:19,466
niche will be ultimately explored. And

263
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:21,646
there's something about both the

264
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:24,842
presence of entropy in designed

265
00:11:24,906 --> 00:11:26,960
constructs or actually any kind of

266
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,726
gradient, any kind of gradient has a

267
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:31,358
dynamic of entropy, but it also has the

268
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:34,862
dynamic of once a gradient is produced,

269
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:37,234
that gradient represents a niche. And

270
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:39,074
the exploration and exploitation of that

271
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:42,434
niche, of which parasitism is one

272
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:44,786
fundamental strategy, seems to be

273
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:47,158
something that needs to be we need to be

274
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,474
aware of and think about how that's

275
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:53,270
addressed across different apocs.

276
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,858
And then the last piece I would throw

277
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:57,560
out is something like, okay,

278
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,806
if we're endeavoring to move, Hinton a

279
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:02,506
third mode, which would be something

280
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:05,222
like the APOC of conscious evolutionary

281
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:07,226
approach, which is able to sort of

282
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:08,886
combine the best of the both and perhaps

283
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:11,342
avoid the negatives of both, by the way,

284
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:14,846
entirely by hypothesis. I have no

285
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:16,286
compelling reason to believe this is

286
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:17,550
actually plausible.

287
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,398
One of the things that might be

288
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:22,426
interesting is to look at the phenotype

289
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,998
genotype dynamics, ie.

290
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:27,954
Evolution seems to have woven at a very

291
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:31,362
deep level what I'll call a Coda, a very

292
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,162
profound modal shift, which is that all

293
00:12:34,216 --> 00:12:38,434
phenotypes die, but there's continuity

294
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:40,950
in the fact that the phenotype produces

295
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,606
an embodied version of the genotype. So

296
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:48,646
the genotype has continuity exclusively,

297
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:51,226
however, mediated by the phenotype and

298
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:53,590
the phenotype has a kind of continuum,

299
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,306
but exclusively mediated by the

300
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:58,714
genotype. And the two are very,

301
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:02,470
very distinct in terms of their physical

302
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,458
characteristics. Right. The things that

303
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,610
are associated with energetic gradients

304
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,982
are qualitatively distinct and the

305
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:12,222
shifting back and forth between the two

306
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:15,266
seems to be a solution to the kind of

307
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:16,610
problem that we're actually talking

308
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,162
about. Okay, so that's what I'm putting

309
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,530
into the mix, into the stew.

310
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,080
Number of ingredients to work with.

311
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,626
Yes. So beginning at

312
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:34,434
the beginning of your statement with

313
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:38,690
respect to the introduction of Conor,

314
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,330
hike and tainter,

315
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,726
this is going to be some grammatic work.

316
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:49,942
I think we have to do as well here.

317
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,098
Because you use the word closure a

318
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:56,154
couple of times and the manner in which

319
00:13:56,272 --> 00:14:00,058
you used it was sort of the

320
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:04,154
epoch ending book end context in a way.

321
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:06,298
Is that a fair characterization of how

322
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:08,526
you felt you were using it in a way that

323
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,966
sort of the closing of an

324
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:13,822
era, the end of an era the end of a

325
00:14:13,876 --> 00:14:15,998
phase, I. Think even more pointedly to

326
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:19,150
the notion of a thermodynamically

327
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,820
closed system. Okay,

328
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,854
these kinds of systems, the proposition

329
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:28,414
I'm making is that they are closed

330
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:31,734
systems and so therefore they have a

331
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,826
finite time until they active.

332
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,474
Something like an entropic equilibrium.

333
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:39,110
And that arc of the

334
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,066
playing out of that time is the story of

335
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:44,778
their particular escrow, I would

336
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,242
propose. Okay, interesting.

337
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:51,254
Yeah, there's a fascinating

338
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:53,594
tension along the lines of sort of

339
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,714
stable or unstable equilibriums or if

340
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:58,686
you want to layer in another. I'm not

341
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,206
sure how familiar you are with the work

342
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:02,862
of Terrence Deacon, but he's quite

343
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,034
interesting insofar as he provides

344
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:06,846
thermodynamic frameworks around the

345
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:11,006
ideas of different emergent behaviors

346
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:13,554
that flow from sort of this first

347
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:16,660
homeostatic level which is systems that

348
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,018
tend to essentially equilibrium. So he

349
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,266
introduced a little bit of language

350
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,106
called orthograde as a sort of abstract,

351
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:27,314
general term of like a number of systems

352
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:31,074
that tend toward a more homogeneous

353
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:32,694
state, let's say, or a more stable

354
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,506
state, and then contragrade. Which is

355
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,810
essentially the capacity of any system

356
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,142
to give it an ambient orthograde context

357
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,740
to sort of act against that in some way

358
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,526
continuously or with some degree of

359
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:48,640
stability. And he builds a framework of

360
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,840
actually showing that certain types of

361
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,966
structure itself. And this kind of

362
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:55,902
resonates with a lot of Kaufman's work

363
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,562
in terms of the origins of order,

364
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:02,020
looking for non evolutionary, just

365
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,426
physical constraints that give rise in

366
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,026
processes that interact with those

367
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:08,498
physical constraints that themselves

368
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:11,318
give rise to certain forms of order in

369
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:14,246
the world. So Deacon's claim is

370
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:16,578
something along the lines of two types

371
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:18,594
of systems that might themselves tend

372
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:22,578
toward stable dissipative structure

373
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,390
if put in relationship in a particular

374
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,382
way with one another, can then give rise

375
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,830
to that sort of frustration boundary

376
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,414
flow through that frustration boundary

377
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:32,874
give rise to some sort of actual

378
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,906
structure in the world or pattern in the

379
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,666
world. And the archetype of example he

380
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:38,218
uses there is something called like a

381
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:40,294
Rayleigh Benard cell which is heat

382
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:43,120
trying to energy trying to flow through

383
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,550
water or oil with a particular

384
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,366
viscosity. And the first thing you get

385
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:50,126
is the Attial bubbling of the heat

386
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:52,018
rising. But at a particular point the

387
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:54,082
energy can't escape efficiently enough

388
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:57,246
so it actually takes on this structure

389
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:59,586
hexagonal lattice. So you get these

390
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:02,034
little cells, right? And if you've ever

391
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,678
been to Pacific Northwest or other areas

392
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:06,694
with like basalt rock with these

393
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:08,694
hexagonal columns, you can actually see

394
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:10,898
this exact thing embodied when lava

395
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:13,174
cools and then cools and tries to cool

396
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:14,618
release that energy in the same way and

397
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,726
forms these giant hexagonal rock

398
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:19,466
structures. In any case, my whole point

399
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:21,226
of introducing that line of thought is

400
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,214
that I think that there are with respect

401
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:28,030
to homeostatic systems,

402
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,086
this idea of closure is an interesting

403
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:35,134
one because people are researchers such

404
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:37,006
as like Monteville. Marco Kaufman as

405
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:38,974
well, with his work Cycles and

406
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,706
Monteville omasio. They have this idea

407
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,866
of constraint closures, which is why I

408
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:45,134
went in this direction, which is deeply

409
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:48,274
tied into the function of in their idea

410
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:52,066
of their concept. They use the concept

411
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:55,122
of a constraint as sort of a symmetry

412
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:58,598
across time. And so that symmetry across

413
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:01,394
time, think of something like an enzyme,

414
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:03,234
right? The enzyme has its own structure

415
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,446
that is maintained across time, but in

416
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:07,738
its interaction with some other process,

417
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:10,262
it sort of locally breaks that symmetry

418
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:12,618
to produce a transformation. And it sort

419
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,138
of acts as a sort of you COVID look at

420
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:17,290
it as like a functional or dynamical

421
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,282
boundary that also changes what bounces

422
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:22,334
off of it. And then if you order these

423
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:25,470
boundaries in a particular way and

424
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,278
close that loop, which is where you get

425
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:29,198
this closure, which is in many ways the

426
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:31,146
way that I tend to use the word closure

427
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,650
these days, the reason I'm laying the

428
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,738
groundwork is just because this idea of

429
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:36,434
closure is very fundamental. The kind of

430
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:37,954
ways I've been thinking about this

431
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,838
particular topic of emergence and

432
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:43,570
governance, once that becomes

433
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,710
closed, then you can start talking about

434
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,090
these patterns of autocatalysis,

435
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,458
whether that's a self reinforcing loop

436
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:53,906
and what it actually self reinforces.

437
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:55,882
And to the extent that we're talking

438
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,662
about governance, I think it's relevant

439
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:01,258
because of the fact that at each one of

440
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:04,346
those points there are aspects, there

441
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:08,158
are side affect of that function that

442
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:10,014
are the inputs of one of these other

443
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:11,374
functions. But then there are also side

444
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:15,114
effects that can have other functions

445
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:17,274
in the context in which this closure

446
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,278
might exist. And I think when we're

447
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:20,850
talking about governance and the

448
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,154
lifecycle of governance, we might be

449
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:24,914
talking about something like that

450
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:26,834
initial closure coming into being

451
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:29,042
functionally such that its overall net

452
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:32,514
byproducts might be adaptive. But to the

453
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:34,658
extent we become reflexive in

454
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:36,226
understanding and this is that conscious

455
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,166
evolution is conscious management to the

456
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:39,698
extent that we can identify the closure

457
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:41,254
and Clark mapping it and actually

458
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,382
analyzing the points and the flows

459
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,706
within our own minds as individuals we

460
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:48,026
can start playing games with it. To the

461
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:50,954
extent that that closure and its side

462
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:55,214
effects shift to a point where it

463
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:57,166
actually shunts perhaps some of that

464
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:58,686
energy that should be going to the

465
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,870
adaptive capacity of the overall closure

466
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,354
into sort of sub games of people's

467
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:08,558
individual political dynamics, personal

468
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:11,098
lives, wealth building endeavors that

469
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:12,862
are within their own frame of reference

470
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:15,026
but not represented in that closure that

471
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,346
they are now able to see and take

472
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:19,026
advantage of. Which you might also

473
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:20,338
introduce later in things like the

474
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,598
action effect, where it's like if you're

475
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:23,314
close to the money spigot and you see

476
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:25,206
the game that's being played, you are

477
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:26,966
more capable of taking literally that

478
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,278
energy that's being released into the

479
00:20:28,284 --> 00:20:30,822
market and directing it into places that

480
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:32,470
might be more to your own interest.

481
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,186
Even if you are saying and claiming that

482
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,074
they're in the general interest of that

483
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,638
broader collective closure that we've

484
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:40,394
created supposedly in the economic sense

485
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:42,986
by the Fed to maintain homeostatic or

486
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,542
homeodynamic stability at this financial

487
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:48,622
level. So when you kind of bring in

488
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:50,666
those concepts, they're very resonant

489
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:52,014
with the way I've been thinking about

490
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,222
it. But I just wanted to sort of

491
00:20:54,356 --> 00:20:56,286
establish that context for grammar with

492
00:20:56,308 --> 00:20:57,886
respect to closure, because I think it's

493
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:59,346
quite critical to the way I've also been

494
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:01,634
thinking about these tendencies. Yeah,

495
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:02,980
that was great. Thank you.

496
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,826
With regard to that last point, when

497
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:11,240
we're looking at the particular

498
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,182
phenomenon or human endeavor of

499
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:19,158
governance, we have a special case. I

500
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:20,518
think this is very interesting to be

501
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:22,566
able to focus. So the general case we

502
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:24,146
could talk about in the context of folks

503
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:27,838
like Tainter and Coon and Hayek,

504
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,706
which is just things that happen in

505
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,606
human built kinds of organizational

506
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,286
systems that have these various dynamics

507
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:35,158
built in governance is particularly

508
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,466
because it's of that sort. However, the

509
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:39,294
whole point of governance, it is in fact

510
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:42,282
designed to be the thing that address

511
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:43,486
the problematic you were just

512
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:45,566
discussing. Right? And so the whole

513
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:47,438
point is actually the recursion or the

514
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:50,754
microcosmic boundary where governance is

515
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:52,740
itself subject to its own,

516
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,634
we'll call right now, I guess we'll use

517
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:58,754
closure. I'm not quite sure if I'm even

518
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,066
using it right, because that was a lot

519
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:01,938
you just put in there. But sort of the

520
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:03,202
failure conditions that we're talking

521
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:04,886
about. And of course, you can then

522
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,514
imagine this kind of an infinite regress

523
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:07,766
of, okay, we'll do the governance on

524
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:08,886
governance, and then the governance on

525
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:11,320
the governance on governance. Is there

526
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,754
reason to believe that there's actually

527
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:18,234
a way to find a loop back whereby that

528
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,570
whole meta system actually has something

529
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,890
like a higher level of stability?

530
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,194
And you raise a lot of different points

531
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:26,826
in the very beginning in terms of the

532
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:28,526
three previous questions of what the

533
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,654
word stability might even mean. It might

534
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:32,206
not mean that it lasts forever, in fact,

535
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:33,966
it rarely wouldn't, but it might mean

536
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:36,058
that it failed. Really interestingly.

537
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:39,154
So that like the biological organism, I

538
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,338
die. I don't live forever, but my life

539
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:45,314
might be part of a larger arc that has a

540
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,938
completely different continuity process.

541
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:50,078
And that's actually the thing that we're

542
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:52,026
thinking about. So I might die.

543
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:53,974
Interestingly. And so that's a very

544
00:22:54,012 --> 00:22:55,590
different solution to the basic problem.

545
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,238
Right. What else was in

546
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,150
there? There was something really

547
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,494
interesting where I kind of tried to put

548
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:05,420
okay, so I noticed also that

549
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,946
I'll call it geometry. So almost like

550
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:13,210
the third mode. So you discussed

551
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,474
a characteristic anticipative systems

552
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,702
where relationships between two

553
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:21,550
different structured possibility spaces

554
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,018
produces a new architecture.

555
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:27,206
It actually produces order at a purely

556
00:23:27,258 --> 00:23:30,706
physical level. And I would say this is

557
00:23:30,728 --> 00:23:33,154
something like there's principle of

558
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:35,426
least action, principles of nature that

559
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:38,850
are as fundamental as thermodynamics and

560
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,866
because they're as fundamental, they

561
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:42,982
constrain the playing out of

562
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:44,230
thermodynamics.

563
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,038
And. It'S important to recognize we

564
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:48,998
actually have that, that's in the

565
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:51,638
toolkit, we can use this. And one of the

566
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:53,706
things I was thinking about is that one

567
00:23:53,728 --> 00:23:55,434
of the things that oftentimes shows

568
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:57,450
failure conditions in human design

569
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,078
systems is vertical or horizontal

570
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:03,340
asymmetry. So, for example,

571
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,186
if I have one person endeavoring to

572
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,106
govern, those issues are actually in

573
00:24:10,128 --> 00:24:11,546
business. That should be the ordinary

574
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:13,006
sort of business organization. The

575
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:15,130
notion of span of control in military

576
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,046
and for all bureaucracies is pretty well

577
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:20,098
understood. But if I have a manager or a

578
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:23,266
business governance function, they

579
00:24:23,288 --> 00:24:25,474
generally can't actually govern more

580
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,586
than a small number of other people. So

581
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:29,954
if I have a single manager, one

582
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:30,890
governance function, and they're

583
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,710
endeavoring to govern, say, 500,000

584
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,286
people, that asymmetry in terms of

585
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,486
information, like, I think in terms of

586
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,062
information theory, perception, sense

587
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:42,326
making and effective choice making that

588
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:45,094
can be actuated down, will create a wide

589
00:24:45,142 --> 00:24:47,114
variety of gaps and niches for

590
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,394
parasitism. But maybe there's something

591
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,362
to be found in the context of a proper

592
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:55,638
geometry where the information asymmetry

593
00:24:55,734 --> 00:24:58,086
is inside of some sort of conscious

594
00:24:58,118 --> 00:24:59,278
boundary. We can even think about in

595
00:24:59,284 --> 00:25:01,006
terms of what's actually possible in

596
00:25:01,028 --> 00:25:02,554
terms of the space of consciousness,

597
00:25:02,682 --> 00:25:04,926
how we can produce larger spaces of

598
00:25:04,948 --> 00:25:06,366
consciousness, and then how we can

599
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:08,158
actually design information flows that

600
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:10,420
are within that space. So that energy

601
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,258
flow is actually held within a

602
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,222
governance envelope that doesn't produce

603
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:20,050
these niches for parasitism.

604
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,694
Yeah, I mean, 100%. That's very

605
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:28,086
resonant. I think that in

606
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:31,222
that context, to pick apart this

607
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:34,280
symmetry asymmetry question a bit more,

608
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,906
this relates to this sort of a

609
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:42,106
long line of undercurrent of

610
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:44,134
political science that's not as popular,

611
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:47,146
that sort of flows through machiavelli.

612
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,702
Moscow. Burnham that vein of just

613
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:54,474
pointing out the side effects

614
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:56,666
of this kind of asymmetry with respect

615
00:25:56,698 --> 00:26:00,098
to the idea of leadership, or sort of

616
00:26:00,104 --> 00:26:03,794
the raification of any system in so

617
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:06,274
far as it must take place within a

618
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:09,330
subset of the population. It can't be

619
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,374
even the idea of democratic governance

620
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:14,166
itself has to be acted out on the day to

621
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:18,054
day by a fraction of the entire group

622
00:26:18,252 --> 00:26:20,630
on behalf of which is being played out

623
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,514
in theory. And so that subset of people

624
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:27,306
who are identified then

625
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:29,626
become responsible for enacting that

626
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:31,562
game with a particular degree of

627
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:34,646
integrity. And I think that that concept

628
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:37,258
of integrity, this kind of relates to

629
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:39,002
maybe the quality of those governance

630
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,526
envelopes you're talking about in the

631
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:43,162
structure, but also the scope and scale

632
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,886
over which perhaps responsibility is one

633
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:47,454
way of thinking about it but then also

634
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,874
accountability because I think to some

635
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:50,990
extent that accountability,

636
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,266
transparency, game to the extent more

637
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:54,994
and more people are playing out their

638
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:57,922
lives while trusting you to do the right

639
00:26:57,976 --> 00:27:00,818
thing. Especially part of that is going

640
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:02,998
to mean that more of their resources are

641
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:05,670
pulling into you with that trust, which

642
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,406
increases the incentives for you to

643
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:11,046
potentially do something that they will

644
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:12,978
not see while their eyes are directed

645
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:14,278
elsewhere. It's kind of like I like to

646
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:17,546
use the game of the more money that's in

647
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:19,466
the pot on the table, right? The more

648
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:20,906
you have to be careful going to the

649
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:24,330
bathroom. If everyone leaves the room

650
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,140
and you just leave one guy in there,

651
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,426
you got to be a little bit careful,

652
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,454
because even if that's a very

653
00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:31,790
trustworthy person at that table,

654
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,814
the larger that pod gets, you start

655
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:37,486
beginning to test that degree of

656
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:39,406
integrity. And that's kind of that same

657
00:27:39,508 --> 00:27:42,066
asymmetry is like, the better system of

658
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:43,346
governing. The best systems of

659
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:44,786
coherence, they create the more of the

660
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:47,634
systems we create to generate value. If

661
00:27:47,672 --> 00:27:49,394
they are actually successful, it is

662
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:51,206
exactly that value that's created by

663
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:53,286
them that becomes the temptation for

664
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:56,374
defection. And so this is very

665
00:27:56,412 --> 00:27:57,526
interesting with respect to this

666
00:27:57,548 --> 00:28:00,178
envelope question because it transforms

667
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:01,446
into this accountability and

668
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:03,766
representation question, I think. And to

669
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:05,286
the extent that we are forced to

670
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,902
represent these systems or to have

671
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:08,986
accountability with these systems, I

672
00:28:09,008 --> 00:28:10,666
think we live in a very interesting time

673
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:13,578
because we are beginning to be able to

674
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:16,826
have representative granularity and

675
00:28:16,848 --> 00:28:18,474
transparency in ways that were never

676
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:21,854
before possible and using those

677
00:28:21,892 --> 00:28:24,206
to sort of act as proxies for

678
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:25,914
maintaining integrity and binding

679
00:28:25,962 --> 00:28:28,814
constraints on people's behavior. And

680
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:30,138
it's an interesting balance because we

681
00:28:30,164 --> 00:28:32,478
obviously if someone is a representative

682
00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:35,858
we want those people to enact the

683
00:28:35,944 --> 00:28:38,434
highest ideal in theory of their

684
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:41,014
representative position. That being

685
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,470
said, we also need to have that position

686
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,334
be somewhat attractive. And to the

687
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:51,014
extent that anyone is looking to act

688
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:52,626
out that position if it is fully

689
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:55,434
constrained and surveilled they might no

690
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:58,794
longer be interested in taking on that

691
00:28:58,832 --> 00:29:02,346
position. One solution to that might be

692
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:03,718
something along the lines of like we'll

693
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:06,598
automate the whole thing but humans

694
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:09,322
don't as embodied beings, humans don't

695
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:11,806
tend to respond well to the idea of an

696
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:13,502
abstract entity that they don't really

697
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:15,582
fully understand the internals and that

698
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:17,726
kind of aren't actually hitting our

699
00:29:17,748 --> 00:29:19,230
mirror neurons in the right way either.

700
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,446
We're not getting that reflexive

701
00:29:20,478 --> 00:29:21,726
property of like yes, I intuitively

702
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:23,506
understand this thing. I think we get

703
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,266
also innately suspicious whenever the

704
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:27,940
idea of some sort of abstract system

705
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,606
acting as our representative or acting

706
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:31,986
as our governance. Even if that were

707
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:34,054
Bull transparent and less likely to

708
00:29:34,092 --> 00:29:36,662
defect against us or probably would not

709
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:39,186
defect against us, we might just rebel

710
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:41,238
against it anyway. So there's sort of

711
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:43,802
this possible Catch 22 there. Those are

712
00:29:43,936 --> 00:29:45,878
some thoughts there. Yeah, that's

713
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:49,610
interesting. That last

714
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,426
piece let me see this,

715
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:54,906
right? The last piece, which was just

716
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:58,954
called the AI governance Piece is

717
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:01,946
kind of worthy. It's tremendously worthy

718
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:04,302
of a really serious deep dive and maybe

719
00:30:04,356 --> 00:30:06,670
sooner rather than later. We're actually

720
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,942
accelerating in the direction where that

721
00:30:08,996 --> 00:30:11,140
kind of science fiction narrative is

722
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,938
plausibly and let's not say like we

723
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:15,234
don't know these things happen in step

724
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,722
functions they don't tend to go on a

725
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:19,906
straight curve, but plausibly is on the

726
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:22,006
event horizon, so we may actually have

727
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,610
to wrestle with that. I would propose,

728
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,946
though I cannot prove it with adequate

729
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:30,758
rigor, so it would require a

730
00:30:30,764 --> 00:30:32,722
collaborative effort. But I propose that

731
00:30:32,796 --> 00:30:36,490
in fact, that idea can't work.

732
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,314
And there's actually, I believe, and

733
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,300
actual rigorous proof that is available

734
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,278
that the notion of a fully automated

735
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:46,934
governance system is intrinsically

736
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:50,078
unstable. But that doesn't mean that we

737
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,754
won't try to do it and trap ourselves

738
00:30:51,802 --> 00:30:55,278
thereby. So let me back up a

739
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:56,494
little bit before we get there because

740
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:57,778
we can talk about the stuff that's sort

741
00:30:57,784 --> 00:31:00,914
of in between. And this is very

742
00:31:00,952 --> 00:31:03,778
much the Tainter story, more or less,

743
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:07,698
we get the idea of the

744
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:09,298
first movement is the relationship

745
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:11,046
between contextualization and

746
00:31:11,068 --> 00:31:14,326
decontextualization, which may be the

747
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:15,814
thing that humans specifically most

748
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:17,286
fundamentally do, is the ability to

749
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,794
decontextualize. We can pull the salient

750
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:21,586
elements of some particular landscape

751
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:25,226
out as we see fit, right? Not just by

752
00:31:25,248 --> 00:31:27,178
virtue of evolutionary fitness. We can

753
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:28,934
actually fluidly identify

754
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:30,394
characteristics that we'd like to pop

755
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:33,062
into the foreground and sort of reify

756
00:31:33,126 --> 00:31:34,714
down into principles and then most

757
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:36,426
specifically endeavor to govern, to

758
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,762
optimize for or against or modulate

759
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:41,726
according to our own preferences. And of

760
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:43,006
course, one of the things that we can do

761
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,194
with that power of decontextualization

762
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:48,578
is we can then brain architectures on

763
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:50,062
the basis of that decontextualization,

764
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:51,758
which is the term technology. That's

765
00:31:51,774 --> 00:31:54,020
what that means, right? Technology is

766
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,086
the ability to use decontextualization

767
00:31:57,198 --> 00:32:01,618
to design in nature phenomena

768
00:32:01,714 --> 00:32:04,534
that are specifically optimizing for

769
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:07,638
particular principles that we've been

770
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:09,718
able to pull out of what is otherwise a

771
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:13,386
larger million. And I

772
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:14,774
would propose that this is at the basis

773
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:16,442
of both the strength and the weakness of

774
00:32:16,496 --> 00:32:19,450
the design, like the epoch of design.

775
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,634
And the limitations of

776
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:25,974
decontextualization are very deeply

777
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,126
woven into the fragility or the

778
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:30,026
problematic of, say, Taintroid style

779
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:31,738
curves, all the things that we're

780
00:32:31,754 --> 00:32:34,878
talking about. So of course, in the

781
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:36,686
process of decontextualization, on the

782
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,778
one hand we're able to identify what's

783
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:40,738
called the most the most relevant or the

784
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:42,674
most salient characteristics of some

785
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,402
system and then we can begin to control

786
00:32:44,456 --> 00:32:46,322
for them, say, okay, I want more

787
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:49,090
calories per unit yield of wheat.

788
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,362
But of course, the the inverse is also

789
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,394
true. By virtue of decontextualization,

790
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:55,894
we move away from an ability to have

791
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:58,694
high quality perception of all of the

792
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:00,486
other things that are going on in that

793
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:02,534
embedded system. So we lose track of

794
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:04,178
them and by virtue of losing track of

795
00:33:04,204 --> 00:33:05,882
them to the degree to which they matter.

796
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:07,146
And of course, now we're getting into

797
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:10,342
kind of like something around heisenberg

798
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:13,046
and deep chaos there, meaning tiny,

799
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:14,726
tiny differences, microcosmic

800
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:16,086
differences, possibly at the Planck

801
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:18,702
limit, tend to build up into large

802
00:33:18,756 --> 00:33:20,654
consequences. So that as we

803
00:33:20,692 --> 00:33:23,054
decontextualize, we render into the

804
00:33:23,092 --> 00:33:25,470
invisible. We render out of the realm of

805
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,846
design, out of the. Realm of the

806
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:29,586
conscious, a whole bunch of things that

807
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,838
were in fact, by definition calculated

808
00:33:31,934 --> 00:33:34,226
via relevance, realization at the

809
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:36,434
unconscious evolutionary level just by

810
00:33:36,552 --> 00:33:39,026
sheer actual having causal effect on the

811
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:40,958
system. And then of course, we're

812
00:33:40,974 --> 00:33:42,238
setting ourselves up. We're setting

813
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,174
ourselves up to have unintended

814
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,566
consequences, cascade out into our

815
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:48,246
larger environment. And then what we

816
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:50,178
tend to do then and this is the Taintrid

817
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,158
move and the thing that I want to kind

818
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:54,154
of bring into the foreground is that we

819
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:56,378
tend to double down. So what we do is we

820
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:59,210
will bricolage or we will collude new

821
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,540
technologies at the edge. Oh, okay,

822
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,746
this particular problem is showing up

823
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:06,266
great. I'm going to do the same move.

824
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:07,462
I'm going to look at that problem.

825
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:09,086
Foreground or decontextualize the

826
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:10,366
elements that I can identify in the

827
00:34:10,388 --> 00:34:13,422
problem, put together a new technology,

828
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:15,358
connect it to the previous technology.

829
00:34:15,524 --> 00:34:17,582
We kind of get one of these. Remember

830
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:19,166
building mobiles when you were a kid and

831
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:21,034
kind of add something at the balance

832
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:23,220
point. It can come layers, layers down.

833
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,970
And of course the point that somebody

834
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,986
like Tainter very specifically makes and

835
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:29,826
I think Conor also maybe not quite as

836
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,122
clearly makes is that we then get lost

837
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:35,286
in our own creation. The machine that we

838
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:37,746
have built has so much complicatedness

839
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:40,774
to it. It has so many different things

840
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,934
going on that we're no longer actually

841
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:45,158
able to be mastered of our own machine.

842
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,594
And this moves us back into an

843
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:49,910
unconscious design phase. So now we're

844
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,546
effectively maintaining something that

845
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:54,026
we don't understand in many cases our

846
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:57,486
generations past its origin story. So we

847
00:34:57,508 --> 00:34:59,166
have a tiny window of awareness in a

848
00:34:59,188 --> 00:35:01,150
much larger field. But that larger field

849
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,762
doesn't have the advantage of a tightly

850
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:07,514
coupled, deeply nuanced, complex, fully

851
00:35:07,562 --> 00:35:10,242
contextualized characteristic. Instead,

852
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:12,418
it actually has lots of these little

853
00:35:12,504 --> 00:35:14,766
decontextualization gaps, foregrounds

854
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:17,106
and backgrounds, but we're super not

855
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:18,914
aware of them. We've lost track of it a

856
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:21,246
lot. And now this is part of the niche

857
00:35:21,278 --> 00:35:22,914
environment. Every one of those gaps

858
00:35:22,962 --> 00:35:25,078
becomes a niche for various forms of

859
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:27,670
parasitism or become places where local

860
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,326
entropy is collected and ant be

861
00:35:30,348 --> 00:35:32,006
addressed because they're effectively in

862
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:34,598
various kinds of blind spots or in what

863
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:36,774
the Santa Fe people would call frozen

864
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:38,294
accidents of our own complicated

865
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:40,810
machinery. I. E. It's just a gap that

866
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,794
arose because of the way that we built

867
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:45,386
the control system. And for us to

868
00:35:45,408 --> 00:35:47,018
actually this address the gap, we have

869
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:49,146
to deconstruct the control system. But

870
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:50,654
the game theory doesn't work. The cost

871
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:52,398
of deconstructing the control system is

872
00:35:52,404 --> 00:35:53,966
something that we're not willing to do.

873
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,838
So the local entropy just gathers and

874
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:57,826
gathers and gathers until it festers and

875
00:35:57,848 --> 00:35:59,986
it eventually creates a breakage that we

876
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,858
sort of unconsciously just accepted is

877
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:03,220
what's going to happen.

878
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,666
Okay, I think that sort of played out

879
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:10,758
what I had there. I can hear you, by the

880
00:36:10,764 --> 00:36:11,526
way. I'm just going to get some more

881
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:14,006
water. Okay? Yeah. No problem. No

882
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:16,920
problem. Yeah. And so,

883
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,598
I mean, that obviously ties into the

884
00:36:20,604 --> 00:36:23,546
dynamic of sort of at the more

885
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:26,726
colloquial level, the fact that humans

886
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:29,126
don't act, in general, creatures,

887
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:31,354
biological organisms, but especially

888
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:33,834
humans that are, in theory, through one

889
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:36,986
lens, known. To be the kind of creature

890
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:39,038
that attempts to look into the future,

891
00:36:39,124 --> 00:36:41,514
the horizon of possibility, and attempt

892
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:44,654
to act in line with a manner in which

893
00:36:44,692 --> 00:36:47,578
that feature remains habitable. Let's

894
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:49,426
say. But then there's always this long

895
00:36:49,448 --> 00:36:52,018
term, short term tension with respect to

896
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:55,406
at what point do the possible threats

897
00:36:55,438 --> 00:36:57,954
do the potential threats start to

898
00:36:58,152 --> 00:36:59,978
realize themselves or actualize

899
00:37:00,014 --> 00:37:02,290
themselves at levels that generate

900
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,254
sufficient sufficient you COVID call.

901
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:08,166
Entropy or suffering or something that

902
00:37:08,188 --> 00:37:11,366
sort of shakes you strongly enough or

903
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:13,674
deeply enough to change behavior or your

904
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:16,410
frame of reference at the appropriate

905
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,522
scale to produce transformation that can

906
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:23,178
respond to whatever that blind spot that

907
00:37:23,184 --> 00:37:24,826
you're mentioning by the process of

908
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:27,910
decontextualization whatever has been

909
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,246
manifesting in that blind spot that is

910
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:31,166
then threatening the integrity of the

911
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:33,470
process or the capacity of that process

912
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,398
to maintain its continuity across time.

913
00:37:36,564 --> 00:37:38,026
One thing that really struck me that's

914
00:37:38,058 --> 00:37:40,386
interesting as well, and I think I guess

915
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:41,826
I've been playing around with a lot of

916
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:44,498
these types of ideas lately in terms of

917
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:47,394
with respect to words and the sort of

918
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,706
inversion capacities or cyclic

919
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:52,166
capacities of taking a concept and

920
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:53,846
flipping it and seeing what happens.

921
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:56,774
This idea of decontextualization is

922
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:59,554
fascinating to me because when you're

923
00:37:59,602 --> 00:38:02,294
discussing it in my mind, something

924
00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:04,666
that's popping up is another way of

925
00:38:04,688 --> 00:38:06,374
looking at this very phenomenologically

926
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:09,146
is that if we look at ourselves as

927
00:38:09,168 --> 00:38:12,566
categorizing beings attention.

928
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:15,174
To. And to me, what categorizing beings

929
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:17,606
tends to mean is having a functional

930
00:38:17,638 --> 00:38:18,858
attractor of some sort that we're

931
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:20,974
binding representations to with this

932
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:22,846
sort of agglomerative tendency of more

933
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,634
and more things that have that likeness

934
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,366
or sameness or are associated with that

935
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:30,290
network building over time. One of

936
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,146
the essential characteristics is that we

937
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:33,874
can't focus on everything at a given

938
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,754
point in time and therefore we have to

939
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,850
live inside a given framework that

940
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,606
mediates, facilitates and hones our

941
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:44,594
attention capacity to actually navigate

942
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:47,394
that process of using this category

943
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:51,126
structure to relate to actualities and

944
00:38:51,148 --> 00:38:53,370
possibilities continuously across time.

945
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,140
And so, interestingly enough,

946
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:59,866
the concept of that ambience. One way of

947
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:01,514
looking at decontextualization might

948
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:03,494
also be a process of hyper

949
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,826
contextualization in the sense where we

950
00:39:06,848 --> 00:39:08,522
are taking a very small representative

951
00:39:08,586 --> 00:39:11,278
subspace, we're identifying a particular

952
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:13,918
set of concepts. I think abstraction is

953
00:39:13,924 --> 00:39:15,598
a way of looking at this right. Like you

954
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,006
were saying, there's a set of

955
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:19,194
similarities here and they're graspable

956
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:21,554
enough within my mind at the moment. So

957
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,602
I'm going to take those and then begin

958
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:26,994
to act as if I'm living inside those as

959
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,842
the full context. And so through that

960
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:32,950
zooming in to the abstraction or to that

961
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,006
subset of the possible pattern space, I

962
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:38,006
begin to act as if that subset is the

963
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:40,870
entire ambience and therefore become

964
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,026
blind to everything that is not inside

965
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,586
that subspace. And so you're sort of

966
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:48,234
living inside the micro niche, this

967
00:39:48,272 --> 00:39:49,946
micro gradient, because you identified a

968
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:52,054
useful gradient inside that abstraction

969
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:56,160
for some perhaps instrumental or even

970
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,830
something that was truly convincing.

971
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,866
The idea of calculus is extremely

972
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:04,734
compelling and we got a great deal of

973
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:08,010
adaptive utility out of that concept.

974
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,446
But does it hit a limit at some level in

975
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:12,786
terms of the metaphors and the way of

976
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:14,626
seeing the world through the lens of

977
00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:17,474
calculus? Does it start to break down?

978
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:19,186
I mean, I would argue yes. I think there

979
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,058
are boundaries when you start to see the

980
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:23,698
world as a set of instance. With respect

981
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,766
to my studies in consciousness and like

982
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:26,758
the emergence of consciousness and

983
00:40:26,764 --> 00:40:28,646
topology of consciousness. I think one

984
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:30,806
of the things that actually has done

985
00:40:30,988 --> 00:40:32,758
inhibits us quite a bit is trying to

986
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,394
think of it as an instantaneous property

987
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:36,346
of a system, something that could in

988
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:39,098
theory be pointed out as a point on a

989
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:42,538
tangent curve somewhere. Right? So in

990
00:40:42,544 --> 00:40:45,302
any case, like this decontextualization

991
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:47,558
frame, I think is a very deep frame.

992
00:40:47,734 --> 00:40:49,546
Andy Clark of this phenomenological

993
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:51,598
tendency. We have to see patterns and

994
00:40:51,604 --> 00:40:52,926
then start living within side those

995
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:55,486
patterns as an adaptive framework and

996
00:40:55,508 --> 00:40:57,198
then just to close us off, I guess,

997
00:40:57,284 --> 00:40:59,842
with respect to the Julian take on that

998
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:02,558
as well, he's well known for structure

999
00:41:02,574 --> 00:41:04,638
of scientific evolution. But my favorite

1000
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:07,666
essay, essay by Kun is an essay called

1001
00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:10,034
The Essential Tension, which is like the

1002
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:11,986
essay in which he kind of responds to

1003
00:41:12,008 --> 00:41:14,358
the public response to his structure of

1004
00:41:14,364 --> 00:41:16,326
scientific revolution. Speaking in front

1005
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,782
of, I think it was the APA or something

1006
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:20,520
like that at the time, and saying

1007
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,786
essentially I've been largely

1008
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:25,434
misinterpreted by people who want to use

1009
00:41:25,472 --> 00:41:27,226
that work as a justification for

1010
00:41:27,248 --> 00:41:29,114
throwing off all constraints. But in

1011
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:30,346
reality, what he was saying, this

1012
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,338
essential detention was like, there's a

1013
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:35,366
frame that's established a very formal,

1014
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:37,086
rigid frame. And the point of that

1015
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:39,534
formal, rigid frame and discipline is to

1016
00:41:39,572 --> 00:41:41,662
move to a point of convergence. Not

1017
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:43,646
because the convergence point is the

1018
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,918
transcendental ideal that we absolutely

1019
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:49,554
must get to, but because by acting as

1020
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:53,314
if that convergence process is worth

1021
00:41:53,352 --> 00:41:56,354
moving toward, as we converge, we will

1022
00:41:56,392 --> 00:41:59,666
realize what is outside of that cone of

1023
00:41:59,688 --> 00:42:00,994
convergence, so to speak. It'll start

1024
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:03,334
showing up as aberrations. And then by

1025
00:42:03,372 --> 00:42:05,654
collecting those aberrant pieces of

1026
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:07,954
information, we can begin to realize.

1027
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:11,158
Oh, okay. This is how we can print, in a

1028
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:13,382
principled and structured and continuum

1029
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:16,602
manner, once again. Open that frame back

1030
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:17,260
up,

1031
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,398
recontextualize the decontextualization,

1032
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:23,654
or, like, zoom back out of that hyper

1033
00:42:23,702 --> 00:42:27,582
focus contextualization and

1034
00:42:27,636 --> 00:42:30,174
synthesize a new frame that doesn't just

1035
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:31,834
jettison the value of the previous

1036
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,770
frame. Arbitrarily but that also isn't

1037
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,580
myopically focused beyond a point of

1038
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,722
critical collapse, let's say, on

1039
00:42:42,776 --> 00:42:44,914
pursuing that singular interpretation of

1040
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:47,186
the old framing. And so I think to some

1041
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:50,086
extent, this is the set of patterns that

1042
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:52,214
we're trying to work with. When we talk

1043
00:42:52,252 --> 00:42:52,840
about,

1044
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,526
I think, instead of the structure of

1045
00:42:57,548 --> 00:43:00,440
scientific revolutions, we're like,

1046
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,186
we're beginning to see the traces of the

1047
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,026
necessity of that analogous process

1048
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:08,426
occurring at the structural level of

1049
00:43:08,448 --> 00:43:11,066
governance. And this is sort of the

1050
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,082
zeitgeist of our era, with many people

1051
00:43:13,136 --> 00:43:15,614
attempting to place ideas, place new

1052
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:17,966
frame possibilities. How should we

1053
00:43:17,988 --> 00:43:21,118
direct our attention into the space of

1054
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:23,514
public discussion and hopefully

1055
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,806
experimentation and try to figure out,

1056
00:43:25,988 --> 00:43:27,986
can we get some positive signals so that

1057
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:30,386
as this prior frame begins to

1058
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:33,346
disintegrate, are there lifeboats that

1059
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:35,426
are actually capable of carrying more

1060
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:37,380
than one to five people at a time?

1061
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:41,300
Yeah. So it's notable that

1062
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,922
Tainter referred to it as the collapse

1063
00:43:43,986 --> 00:43:47,606
of complex societies. And I think the

1064
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:49,266
proper way of describing what what Coon

1065
00:43:49,298 --> 00:43:50,598
was describing was not so much a

1066
00:43:50,604 --> 00:43:51,986
paradigm shift as a paradigm

1067
00:43:52,018 --> 00:43:55,446
catastrophe. And I

1068
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:56,694
think there's a very specific point

1069
00:43:56,732 --> 00:43:58,342
there. We're we're actually looking for

1070
00:43:58,396 --> 00:44:01,386
paradigm shift. You know, it's okay, I

1071
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,194
got a paradigm. Okay, now it's time to

1072
00:44:03,232 --> 00:44:06,206
shift in that movement. And I would like

1073
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:09,754
to very much invoke here the cognitive

1074
00:44:09,802 --> 00:44:12,842
science notions of opponent processing

1075
00:44:12,906 --> 00:44:15,710
and how the brain, very specifically,

1076
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,506
all the way down to the most basic

1077
00:44:18,538 --> 00:44:21,306
animals, uses modal distinctions.

1078
00:44:21,338 --> 00:44:22,434
Specifically, the one I was thinking

1079
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:23,906
about is very much the dynamic where,

1080
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:25,266
okay, it's time to focus on a very

1081
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,282
localized task, but there's something

1082
00:44:27,336 --> 00:44:30,270
happening at a meta level that allows

1083
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,826
and requires in fact, they're shifting

1084
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:34,086
back to diffuse and then moving back and

1085
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:36,306
forth, right? And that action of modal

1086
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:37,826
distinction, right brain, left brain

1087
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:40,134
distinction, are qualitatively different

1088
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:43,270
in how they go about orienting towards

1089
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,178
where to allocate attention and even how

1090
00:44:45,184 --> 00:44:47,466
to do sense making in the relationship

1091
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:49,158
to perception. And then there's a meta

1092
00:44:49,174 --> 00:44:50,646
dynamic that moves back and forth

1093
00:44:50,678 --> 00:44:52,394
between them. So that kind of a

1094
00:44:52,512 --> 00:44:56,054
tricameral structure at a very deep

1095
00:44:56,102 --> 00:44:57,786
modal distinction or qualitatively

1096
00:44:57,818 --> 00:44:59,806
distinct level seems like it's the

1097
00:44:59,828 --> 00:45:01,438
proper design for any kind of new kind

1098
00:45:01,444 --> 00:45:04,814
of collective intelligence. And I was

1099
00:45:04,852 --> 00:45:06,318
brought to mind of the of the

1100
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:07,518
distinction between thinking and

1101
00:45:07,524 --> 00:45:09,006
simulated thinking that I was trying to

1102
00:45:09,028 --> 00:45:11,998
make, gosh, about five years ago. And I

1103
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:13,906
think that was that was oftentimes also

1104
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:16,078
not fully grasp. So if you wouldn't

1105
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:17,458
mind, I'll just recapitulate because the

1106
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:22,546
point is very specifically the point we

1107
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:24,486
have two modes, at least definitely two

1108
00:45:24,508 --> 00:45:27,094
modes of thinking. One mode that I

1109
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:28,486
called habit mode and one mode that I

1110
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:30,646
called Explore mode. And I'm not

1111
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:31,718
necessarily trying to say that I

1112
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:33,350
invented any of this. And there are many

1113
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,406
people I'm sure you've done a much

1114
00:45:34,428 --> 00:45:36,370
better job as trying to point out. The

1115
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,466
thing I'm trying to point out is not

1116
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:40,074
that, but the idea that habit mode like

1117
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,066
paradigm is able to take advantage of a

1118
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:44,858
variety of different frameworks that are

1119
00:45:44,864 --> 00:45:46,398
relatively well designed for a

1120
00:45:46,404 --> 00:45:49,134
particular domain and therefore quickly

1121
00:45:49,252 --> 00:45:51,806
and accurately and predictably be able

1122
00:45:51,828 --> 00:45:53,978
to make sense and select appropriate

1123
00:45:53,994 --> 00:45:55,326
choices in the context of a certain

1124
00:45:55,348 --> 00:45:57,626
domain. That's a very functional thing

1125
00:45:57,668 --> 00:46:01,074
to have. Explore mode is a mode that is

1126
00:46:01,112 --> 00:46:03,118
modally distinct, has a more diffuse

1127
00:46:03,134 --> 00:46:05,166
awareness, much more contextually aware,

1128
00:46:05,278 --> 00:46:07,390
is oriented towards things like insight,

1129
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:11,218
I. E. Breaking existing assumptions and

1130
00:46:11,304 --> 00:46:13,794
very oriented towards the subtle things

1131
00:46:13,832 --> 00:46:15,634
that may not ordinarily be noticed in

1132
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,662
habit mode but may actually be relevant.

1133
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:19,026
And that's why we have to have this

1134
00:46:19,048 --> 00:46:21,710
different Explore mode. So the meta

1135
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:23,338
processes is okay, which mode should I

1136
00:46:23,344 --> 00:46:24,934
be in right now? Am I am in a concept

1137
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,886
where Explorer mode is the most adaptive

1138
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,598
mode or am I in a context where habit

1139
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:29,898
mode is the most adaptive mode? And can

1140
00:46:29,904 --> 00:46:32,118
I fluidly move back and forth so that's

1141
00:46:32,214 --> 00:46:34,746
that third. So I've got one, two, three

1142
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:36,778
and the premise of this notion of

1143
00:46:36,784 --> 00:46:38,906
simulated thinking is that there's

1144
00:46:38,938 --> 00:46:41,086
something about habit mode where we can

1145
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:43,146
get stuck in it. So it somehow habit

1146
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:45,866
mode breaks this third governance layer

1147
00:46:45,898 --> 00:46:47,726
that allows us to fluidly move back and

1148
00:46:47,748 --> 00:46:50,594
force and then gets us more and more

1149
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:52,866
stuck in habit mode in particular where

1150
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:55,966
we begin to build a habit that simulates

1151
00:46:56,078 --> 00:46:58,750
governance. And then we're in trouble

1152
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,898
because at that point we can't actually

1153
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,762
make proper use of explore mode because

1154
00:47:03,816 --> 00:47:05,362
we actually haven't got the capacity.

1155
00:47:05,426 --> 00:47:06,834
All we can do is when the governance

1156
00:47:06,882 --> 00:47:08,646
system is saying hey, it's time to move

1157
00:47:08,668 --> 00:47:10,934
to Explore mode, habit mode says oh,

1158
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:13,158
I've got it. And then produces something

1159
00:47:13,324 --> 00:47:15,286
vaguely like Explore mode but still

1160
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:17,074
within the fundamentals of habitat mode.

1161
00:47:17,122 --> 00:47:20,298
And you can sort of extend that to all

1162
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,306
the different examples we've used,

1163
00:47:21,328 --> 00:47:23,350
right? This operates in any dynamics.

1164
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,054
So in coon's model it would be anomalies

1165
00:47:26,102 --> 00:47:28,734
are being thrown and the largest system

1166
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:30,094
is saying hey, there's something wrong

1167
00:47:30,132 --> 00:47:33,434
with our paradigm. But the paradigmatic

1168
00:47:33,482 --> 00:47:35,934
mind says well, I'll just produce a more

1169
00:47:35,972 --> 00:47:37,962
complex version of my existing paradigm

1170
00:47:38,026 --> 00:47:40,094
to absorb those anomalies into it. Or

1171
00:47:40,132 --> 00:47:41,618
I'll use the function of ignoring. In

1172
00:47:41,624 --> 00:47:43,506
other words, I'll put them into an area

1173
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,106
of local entropy and just kind of let

1174
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,754
them sit for however long, maybe

1175
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:49,986
forever, ideally, right? And the

1176
00:47:50,008 --> 00:47:52,854
metaphors is that's the problem that is

1177
00:47:52,892 --> 00:47:55,942
the problem of conscious design is that

1178
00:47:55,996 --> 00:47:58,054
getting stuck and not actually having

1179
00:47:58,092 --> 00:48:00,066
the opponent processing built robustly

1180
00:48:00,098 --> 00:48:03,362
enough that we can move from habit

1181
00:48:03,426 --> 00:48:05,654
into Explore without having to go

1182
00:48:05,692 --> 00:48:08,266
through a crisis. The problem is not

1183
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:09,974
that sometimes our habits aren't

1184
00:48:10,022 --> 00:48:11,258
functional, we have to move to a

1185
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:13,338
different mode. The problem is sometimes

1186
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,626
we get addicted to our habits and the

1187
00:48:15,648 --> 00:48:17,054
only way we can get out of them is

1188
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:18,346
actually to go through hitting rock

1189
00:48:18,378 --> 00:48:21,486
bottom. And that's a very adaptive way

1190
00:48:21,508 --> 00:48:22,960
of solving that kind of problem.

1191
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,858
Just sort of like to test the language a

1192
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:32,210
bit and make sure that I'm with you here

1193
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,818
and also use it potentially to

1194
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:36,798
synthesize some of the topics that we've

1195
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:40,766
been talking about. It's fascinating

1196
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:43,474
to consider this in light of this

1197
00:48:43,512 --> 00:48:45,446
question in terms of parasitism that

1198
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:47,926
we've been talking about and also the

1199
00:48:47,948 --> 00:48:50,578
question of the benefits of parasitism,

1200
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:52,214
possibly right, because you're talking

1201
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:54,426
about this catastrophic or this

1202
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:56,422
catastrophe, which is in dynamics

1203
00:48:56,486 --> 00:48:58,586
systems in many ways analogous to

1204
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:01,466
falling off a cliff in the map that is

1205
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:04,300
actually exactly like that in many ways.

1206
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:09,934
And so it

1207
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:12,366
could be the case, right. That one way

1208
00:49:12,388 --> 00:49:14,702
of looking at parasitism. If you can

1209
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:16,094
endogenize it or if you can actually

1210
00:49:16,132 --> 00:49:18,238
internalize some amount of it or look at

1211
00:49:18,244 --> 00:49:19,874
it as a property of systems is

1212
00:49:19,992 --> 00:49:21,746
potentially the smoothing function for

1213
00:49:21,768 --> 00:49:24,606
that cliff. Insofar as this gradient

1214
00:49:24,638 --> 00:49:27,266
that we were talking about before in

1215
00:49:27,288 --> 00:49:28,402
light of the language you're talking

1216
00:49:28,456 --> 00:49:31,938
about in terms of this habit mode,

1217
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:34,786
right, and exploration mode with respect

1218
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:36,578
to collective governance or collective

1219
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,094
systems used for simulating this

1220
00:49:39,132 --> 00:49:41,350
adaptive process as a collective,

1221
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:44,582
that collective process of governance

1222
00:49:44,726 --> 00:49:48,086
can at times be in that exploration

1223
00:49:48,198 --> 00:49:51,034
mode, potentially discovering some new

1224
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:53,706
form. So if you look at the inception of

1225
00:49:53,808 --> 00:49:55,210
the nation of the United States,

1226
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,646
there's a lot of synthesis happening, a

1227
00:49:57,668 --> 00:50:00,186
lot of different ideas from a lineage

1228
00:50:00,378 --> 00:50:02,622
extending thousands of years into

1229
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:05,054
history drawing from all of that to try

1230
00:50:05,092 --> 00:50:07,142
to synthesize a particular novel

1231
00:50:07,226 --> 00:50:10,254
framework. It was very conscious, hyper

1232
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,514
conscious, hyper synthetic, very

1233
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:16,210
exploration. But it created something

1234
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,550
that in its stability and efficacy

1235
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:23,190
became so functionally stable that

1236
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,782
more and more people were able to move

1237
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:29,094
into habit mode with respect to that as

1238
00:50:29,132 --> 00:50:31,640
a foundation. And as that happens,

1239
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:35,466
interestingly enough, it opens up little

1240
00:50:35,568 --> 00:50:38,714
exploratory niches for actors to go in

1241
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:41,066
and say, are there micro gradients in

1242
00:50:41,088 --> 00:50:43,338
that system? Because of the fact that

1243
00:50:43,424 --> 00:50:45,226
all these people are in habit mode no

1244
00:50:45,248 --> 00:50:46,634
longer their attention is focused

1245
00:50:46,682 --> 00:50:49,514
outwards, it's no longer attending

1246
00:50:49,562 --> 00:50:52,238
inwards. And so they actually go in and

1247
00:50:52,324 --> 00:50:54,926
start siphoning energy perhaps in their

1248
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:58,138
own explorer modes as perhaps parasitic

1249
00:50:58,154 --> 00:51:01,774
behavior from this governance loop. But

1250
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,202
interestingly enough, that can function

1251
00:51:05,256 --> 00:51:08,626
as a way of testing the stability of

1252
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,080
that loop to some extent. Like they are

1253
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,186
forcing that fundamental functional

1254
00:51:15,218 --> 00:51:17,158
closure of governance that people have

1255
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,670
stopped attending to on Moss generally.

1256
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,302
They're forcing it to operate under

1257
00:51:23,356 --> 00:51:25,042
additional constraints, under additional

1258
00:51:25,106 --> 00:51:27,706
load. Even though that load, that's an

1259
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:28,906
internal load that it might not have

1260
00:51:28,928 --> 00:51:30,666
necessarily been formally designed to

1261
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:33,898
bear, but that parasitism, like a

1262
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:36,154
parasite load on any animal, is forcing

1263
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:39,338
that animal to operate over and above

1264
00:51:39,434 --> 00:51:41,178
what they would have to do otherwise

1265
00:51:41,274 --> 00:51:43,706
without that parasitic load. And so it's

1266
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:45,438
actually building some slack into the

1267
00:51:45,444 --> 00:51:49,278
system, perhaps, such that when we

1268
00:51:49,284 --> 00:51:50,606
start, when things start getting shaky

1269
00:51:50,638 --> 00:51:52,082
and people turn their attention back,

1270
00:51:52,136 --> 00:51:54,782
Hinton that system, see the parasites

1271
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:56,370
and potentially get rid of them,

1272
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,306
there's still enough slack left in that

1273
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:01,410
mechanism, hopefully to navigate the

1274
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,194
cliff or to smooth the cliff. So that's

1275
00:52:04,242 --> 00:52:07,094
like, a possibility. I'm not sure how

1276
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:08,934
coherent that was. If that made sense,

1277
00:52:09,052 --> 00:52:12,518
let me know. It maps to, I believe,

1278
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:14,086
pretty almost exactly to Brett

1279
00:52:14,118 --> 00:52:17,446
Weinstein's story about peacock

1280
00:52:17,478 --> 00:52:20,234
tails of pyramids. His argument is

1281
00:52:20,272 --> 00:52:21,718
effectively, peacock tails and pyramids

1282
00:52:21,734 --> 00:52:23,194
are exactly what you're talking about.

1283
00:52:23,312 --> 00:52:25,094
It effectively the peacock tail is not

1284
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:28,298
just a pure sort of sexual display,

1285
00:52:28,394 --> 00:52:29,726
but it's actually effectively a

1286
00:52:29,748 --> 00:52:33,790
parasitic reservoir that provides a

1287
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,838
fail safe to the degree to which the

1288
00:52:35,844 --> 00:52:37,566
context no longer supports it. You can

1289
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:40,306
lose a lot of fucking tail, get back a

1290
00:52:40,328 --> 00:52:42,034
huge amount of adaptive capacity without

1291
00:52:42,072 --> 00:52:45,854
losing any real heuristic total fitness,

1292
00:52:45,982 --> 00:52:47,906
and respond to what's happening. Same

1293
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:49,186
thing with pyramids. Like, if you put a

1294
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:52,594
lot of social excess,

1295
00:52:52,642 --> 00:52:55,158
would that be called surplus into

1296
00:52:55,244 --> 00:52:56,758
pyramids, as opposed to, say, for

1297
00:52:56,764 --> 00:52:59,986
example, more people? Your carrying

1298
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:02,086
capacity is actually buffered so that if

1299
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:05,090
there's actually a significant drought

1300
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:06,746
where food production is not as high as

1301
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:08,394
it was, you just stop building as many

1302
00:53:08,432 --> 00:53:10,538
pyramids and you don't actually have a

1303
00:53:10,544 --> 00:53:12,614
Castro collapse of the underlying deep

1304
00:53:12,662 --> 00:53:15,818
structure. Was that in his thesis or I

1305
00:53:15,824 --> 00:53:16,950
haven't heard him talk about that.

1306
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,398
Surprisingly, I've heard him talk about

1307
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:19,486
a number. He did have shared this

1308
00:53:19,508 --> 00:53:21,006
public, so I may have just outed him. I

1309
00:53:21,028 --> 00:53:22,478
apologize. Force some reason, I thought

1310
00:53:22,484 --> 00:53:24,080
it was. Like I was like, yeah, because

1311
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,718
in the Hunter Gatherers Guide, that one

1312
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:30,706
or maybe I haven't read it once,

1313
00:53:30,888 --> 00:53:33,586
I need to reflect back on it. It might

1314
00:53:33,608 --> 00:53:35,700
be there, but yeah,

1315
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,218
precisely. Certainly not surprising to

1316
00:53:39,224 --> 00:53:41,526
be the Brett and the mind that Brett has

1317
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:44,166
in the way that he thinks. I think you

1318
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:46,198
and I tend to dovetail and converge to a

1319
00:53:46,204 --> 00:53:47,734
lot of similar frames of reference so

1320
00:53:47,772 --> 00:53:50,374
that's, yeah, I think precisely these

1321
00:53:50,412 --> 00:53:53,666
abilities to maintain higher carrying

1322
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:55,690
capacities within any given system

1323
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,354
fundamentally provide slack in that

1324
00:53:57,392 --> 00:54:00,426
system. And if we look at it just at the

1325
00:54:00,448 --> 00:54:03,766
object level through almost entirely

1326
00:54:03,798 --> 00:54:07,710
moral framework, then it can

1327
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,454
lead us to believe that there's no

1328
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:12,878
benefit here and to perhaps be a

1329
00:54:12,884 --> 00:54:14,446
little bit overly acerbic in our

1330
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:16,750
language toward what's going on.

1331
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,386
Interestingly enough, it might have been

1332
00:54:18,408 --> 00:54:20,686
selected for we might be selected

1333
00:54:20,718 --> 00:54:24,082
precisely in the same way that we have

1334
00:54:24,216 --> 00:54:25,666
some interesting side effects of

1335
00:54:25,688 --> 00:54:28,206
psychopathy that might have overall

1336
00:54:28,238 --> 00:54:30,854
adaptive side effects at small levels in

1337
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:33,878
society. Some element of sort of

1338
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:36,742
corruption and parasitism at a base

1339
00:54:36,796 --> 00:54:39,654
level within even healthy systems might

1340
00:54:39,692 --> 00:54:42,826
be optimal to the extent we can talk

1341
00:54:42,848 --> 00:54:44,540
about optimality in such a system,

1342
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:49,450
knowing that might brace us against

1343
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,234
becoming overly cynical. Right. Because

1344
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:55,514
I think that at some level, the greatest

1345
00:54:55,562 --> 00:54:57,566
threat to our current capacity for

1346
00:54:57,588 --> 00:55:01,210
adaptation is an abundance of cynicism,

1347
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:03,962
and an abundance and the innervating

1348
00:55:04,026 --> 00:55:06,206
quality of that cynicism with respect to

1349
00:55:06,308 --> 00:55:08,162
sapping us of the necessary will,

1350
00:55:08,216 --> 00:55:10,850
energy, and belief that we can actually

1351
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,620
do anything that is worth doing.

1352
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,060
Daniel, how much time do we have left?

1353
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:23,594
25 minutes. But I'm happy to stay on

1354
00:55:23,712 --> 00:55:25,294
anytime you want to. Feel free to

1355
00:55:25,332 --> 00:55:27,486
continue this section and then we can go

1356
00:55:27,508 --> 00:55:29,918
into Q and. A. I have another piece that

1357
00:55:29,924 --> 00:55:33,066
I'd love to drop in right here. So let's

1358
00:55:33,098 --> 00:55:34,240
see. Yeah,

1359
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:39,746
the psychological consequences of being

1360
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:44,834
stuck and almost

1361
00:55:44,872 --> 00:55:46,126
like the psychosocial consequences,

1362
00:55:46,158 --> 00:55:47,506
like the feedback loop. So on the one

1363
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:49,206
hand you have the interior psychology of

1364
00:55:49,228 --> 00:55:50,914
being in something like simulated

1365
00:55:50,962 --> 00:55:53,686
thinking where you can't get out of your

1366
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:57,426
own habits of thought and you can't

1367
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:58,866
escape into a higher level of insight.

1368
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:01,458
You can't escape back into Explore mode,

1369
00:56:01,554 --> 00:56:03,254
but also the feedback loops of being

1370
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:06,102
stuck in a collapsing complex society

1371
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:09,318
where Explorer mode is in fact inhibited

1372
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:11,290
because it doesn't have any place to get

1373
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,242
energy or resource, for example, or

1374
00:56:13,296 --> 00:56:14,806
positive feedback, the energy resource

1375
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,174
and all the different human needs

1376
00:56:16,212 --> 00:56:18,686
modalities. And so what happens when

1377
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,758
you're in there? And what happens there

1378
00:56:19,764 --> 00:56:21,054
is you start getting things like you get

1379
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:24,126
depressed, you get cynical, you get

1380
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:27,460
nihilistic, you get anomia. Right?

1381
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:32,162
Okay, so let me think. Okay, I'll do it.

1382
00:56:32,216 --> 00:56:33,938
Free things first. That notion of

1383
00:56:33,944 --> 00:56:37,326
parasitism as a reservoir of potential

1384
00:56:37,438 --> 00:56:39,666
is very interesting and I can think

1385
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:41,686
about that immediately in two ways. Two

1386
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:45,014
examples that pop up. One is that

1387
00:56:45,052 --> 00:56:47,654
the notion of like 80% and 85% of people

1388
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:49,078
are in so called bullshit jobs, or at

1389
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:52,134
least self reported, which I think is

1390
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:53,718
very reasonable, particularly if you

1391
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:55,530
sort of think about the cascade effects.

1392
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,474
Meaning if you were to remove a whole

1393
00:56:58,512 --> 00:56:59,946
category of bullshit jobs, you would

1394
00:56:59,968 --> 00:57:01,098
realize there's a whole other set of

1395
00:57:01,104 --> 00:57:02,662
jobs that are actually bullshit jobs

1396
00:57:02,726 --> 00:57:04,374
produced entirely by the first category.

1397
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:06,494
So if you start unwinding them, well,

1398
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:08,398
on the one hand, that's terrible. It

1399
00:57:08,404 --> 00:57:10,366
means that people are wasting their

1400
00:57:10,388 --> 00:57:12,126
lives and their energy and just

1401
00:57:12,148 --> 00:57:14,318
spinning. On the other hand, oh, well,

1402
00:57:14,324 --> 00:57:15,662
that's really good because that actually

1403
00:57:15,716 --> 00:57:17,806
means that I've got sort of 80% of the

1404
00:57:17,828 --> 00:57:19,138
human population is sitting on the

1405
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,214
sideline waiting to be deployed

1406
00:57:21,262 --> 00:57:22,834
generatively as soon as we can get our

1407
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,166
head out of our ass. That's nice. Catch

1408
00:57:25,198 --> 00:57:28,562
both ways. I also recall during

1409
00:57:28,616 --> 00:57:32,774
the 2008 2010 financial crisis saying,

1410
00:57:32,812 --> 00:57:35,126
okay, well, how far down does this

1411
00:57:35,148 --> 00:57:36,982
system actually call? It need to fall

1412
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,894
for a truly robust reset, ie. If the too

1413
00:57:39,932 --> 00:57:41,766
big to fail system had been allowed to

1414
00:57:41,788 --> 00:57:43,226
fail properly, which is what should have

1415
00:57:43,248 --> 00:57:44,506
happened, what would that have looked

1416
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:47,050
like? It's like, well, we're probably

1417
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,458
not going to drop below like a 1972

1418
00:57:50,624 --> 00:57:53,098
level of standard of living. That's a

1419
00:57:53,104 --> 00:57:54,846
pretty big fall from where we are right

1420
00:57:54,868 --> 00:57:58,366
now. And I recall the 1972 was

1421
00:57:58,388 --> 00:58:00,606
actually pretty nice and it wasn't a

1422
00:58:00,628 --> 00:58:02,334
terrible style of life. And the point

1423
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:03,982
being that there's almost something like

1424
00:58:04,036 --> 00:58:07,022
the what do they call the like the F 350

1425
00:58:07,156 --> 00:58:09,674
Hypertruck. Well, it turns out that if,

1426
00:58:09,732 --> 00:58:11,286
if we have to actually give up our F 350

1427
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:13,940
and just scale back down to an F 150,

1428
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,126
that's actually not that bad. We'll

1429
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:18,862
survive. That's not a catastrophe.

1430
00:58:18,926 --> 00:58:20,850
That's actually a pretty decent amount

1431
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,206
of fat built into the system that we can

1432
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:26,306
allow to cut back and not lose our shit.

1433
00:58:26,418 --> 00:58:27,878
The challenge, of course, is, can we do

1434
00:58:27,884 --> 00:58:29,158
that elegantly? So then I'll get to the

1435
00:58:29,164 --> 00:58:31,974
third piece. Everything what I'm about

1436
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:33,706
to say, from my point of view, is

1437
00:58:33,728 --> 00:58:36,234
entirely hypothetical. I am making up

1438
00:58:36,272 --> 00:58:37,962
this story on the basis of some

1439
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:40,922
heuristics, but the notion is something

1440
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:45,390
like this kind of dynamic of modal

1441
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,726
opponent processing and some kind of

1442
00:58:49,748 --> 00:58:51,966
system that catalyzes the movement back

1443
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:54,402
and forth between them is very, very

1444
00:58:54,456 --> 00:58:56,274
old, like, deeply fundamental. It's too

1445
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:58,178
important not to be woven in.

1446
00:58:58,264 --> 00:59:00,206
Obviously, the sympathetic, sympathetic

1447
00:59:00,238 --> 00:59:03,934
nervous system go way back so that basic

1448
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:06,754
structure is super fundamental and shows

1449
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:08,462
up all over the place. All right,

1450
00:59:08,616 --> 00:59:11,654
second, humans at the kind of the first

1451
00:59:11,692 --> 00:59:14,310
APOC, indigenous humans almost

1452
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,022
certainly, therefore, would have used

1453
00:59:16,076 --> 00:59:18,246
that at the social level. We would not

1454
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:20,178
have been able to achieve something like

1455
00:59:20,204 --> 00:59:22,086
a social cultural style of collective

1456
00:59:22,118 --> 00:59:24,346
intelligence that didn't also have this

1457
00:59:24,368 --> 00:59:26,042
kind of structure woven in deeply, but

1458
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:28,938
it would have been woven in deeply using

1459
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:32,330
embodied cognition, obviously not design

1460
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,806
cognition, because we weren't at the

1461
00:59:33,828 --> 00:59:35,566
design cognition APOC. So what does that

1462
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:37,294
mean? What does it look like? The

1463
00:59:37,332 --> 00:59:40,622
proposition is something like when the

1464
00:59:40,676 --> 00:59:42,586
external context when the conditions

1465
00:59:42,618 --> 00:59:46,034
that we're in are signaling a

1466
00:59:46,072 --> 00:59:50,062
need to move to a group explore mode

1467
00:59:50,206 --> 00:59:52,686
exiting paradigmatic obligate

1468
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:55,502
paradigmatic mind or stuckness exiting

1469
00:59:55,646 --> 00:59:58,830
habit mode into a more liminal

1470
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:01,010
form of collective intelligence.

1471
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,674
Every distinct human at an embodied

1472
01:00:04,722 --> 01:00:07,826
level will sense that differentially.

1473
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:10,086
And they will suddenly begin to signal

1474
01:00:10,118 --> 01:00:13,306
that differentially back into the

1475
01:00:13,328 --> 01:00:14,794
collective environment. I'll give that

1476
01:00:14,832 --> 01:00:15,770
concrete.

1477
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,026
It's been raining less and less. We

1478
01:00:22,048 --> 01:00:24,726
don't have concepts of rainfall.

1479
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:26,398
We don't have meteorology. Like, this is

1480
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:29,130
a long fucking time ago. But we notice

1481
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,986
in a very fundamental sense, our bodies

1482
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:32,766
are a little bit more dehydrated or the

1483
01:00:32,788 --> 01:00:34,226
energy necessary to get water is a

1484
01:00:34,228 --> 01:00:35,886
little bit higher. We're noticing the

1485
01:00:35,908 --> 01:00:37,906
prey animals are reduced are not as

1486
01:00:37,928 --> 01:00:40,418
common. We're noticing that yield of

1487
01:00:40,424 --> 01:00:42,546
food is decreasing. Noticing at the

1488
01:00:42,568 --> 01:00:44,274
physical level, deep, deep stuff like

1489
01:00:44,312 --> 01:00:46,610
biological. And then there's different

1490
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,114
types of humans. We have a different

1491
01:00:48,152 --> 01:00:50,486
typology. We have old women. We have

1492
01:00:50,508 --> 01:00:52,326
young women. We have young men. We have

1493
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,182
children. We have older men. And

1494
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:56,118
probably, I'm guessing, something on the

1495
01:00:56,124 --> 01:00:59,442
order of, like, seven to 40 cognitive

1496
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:02,266
typologies that cover the different kind

1497
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:04,506
of modes of reality that it's useful to

1498
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:06,938
have strengths and weaknesses in it. So

1499
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:08,506
the collective intelligence at the

1500
01:01:08,528 --> 01:01:09,974
indigenous level is constructive

1501
01:01:10,022 --> 01:01:12,106
typological differences. Each of those

1502
01:01:12,128 --> 01:01:13,594
typological differences will have

1503
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:15,510
differentiate and sensitivity to the

1504
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,886
subtle signals of is it time for us to

1505
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:20,286
actually move to a new niche? Do we need

1506
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:22,766
to leave the valley and go into the

1507
01:01:22,788 --> 01:01:24,606
mountains? Because the rain and fall is

1508
01:01:24,628 --> 01:01:26,158
telling us the flow time is about to

1509
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:28,114
come. That kind of thing, right? And

1510
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:29,758
that will show up in behavior. That's

1511
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:31,214
the key thing like actual physical

1512
01:01:31,262 --> 01:01:34,706
behavior. Physical behavior will

1513
01:01:34,728 --> 01:01:37,814
produce a second order feedback loop as

1514
01:01:37,852 --> 01:01:40,886
I notice the older women behaving in a

1515
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:42,918
different way. It signals me in an

1516
01:01:42,924 --> 01:01:45,794
embodied level to begin that adds

1517
01:01:45,922 --> 01:01:48,214
additional differential signal to my own

1518
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:50,634
perception and that will change my

1519
01:01:50,672 --> 01:01:52,906
behavior. So when I'm noticing for

1520
01:01:52,928 --> 01:01:55,354
example that the young women are giving

1521
01:01:55,472 --> 01:01:58,666
attention and perhaps sexual access to a

1522
01:01:58,688 --> 01:02:01,642
different kind of behavior in men, very

1523
01:02:01,696 --> 01:02:03,226
clearly this will change the behavior in

1524
01:02:03,248 --> 01:02:05,086
young men but that also will cause to

1525
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,858
tend to cascade throughout the larger

1526
01:02:06,874 --> 01:02:07,978
environment. The idea is there's

1527
01:02:07,994 --> 01:02:10,702
something like a very very complex set

1528
01:02:10,756 --> 01:02:13,530
of multi typological feedback loops

1529
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,586
pulling in subtle information from the

1530
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:18,882
context that will eventually catalyze a

1531
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:22,574
pivot from tribal paradigmatics

1532
01:02:22,622 --> 01:02:24,606
locked in very functional and effective

1533
01:02:24,638 --> 01:02:27,726
adaptive habit mode into. Okay, let's

1534
01:02:27,758 --> 01:02:29,698
all sit around the fire hand off the

1535
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,426
Conor from the chief to the shaman.

1536
01:02:31,538 --> 01:02:33,186
Let's talk about the oldest deepest

1537
01:02:33,218 --> 01:02:35,558
mythological stories. Hey elders, are

1538
01:02:35,564 --> 01:02:36,854
you aware of anything like very

1539
01:02:36,892 --> 01:02:40,270
different mode? Right. The premise I'm

1540
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,330
making is that that's actually the case.

1541
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,378
I'm going to argue that we have that

1542
01:02:44,544 --> 01:02:46,842
that a large part of what's actually

1543
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,618
going on. Like characteristics like

1544
01:02:48,704 --> 01:02:53,402
depression and cynicism are like

1545
01:02:53,456 --> 01:02:54,854
frustration. You know how frustration

1546
01:02:54,902 --> 01:02:55,966
works, right? Frustration is when

1547
01:02:55,988 --> 01:02:58,174
there's a deeply felt sense that there

1548
01:02:58,212 --> 01:02:59,534
needs to be some change in the world

1549
01:02:59,572 --> 01:03:01,806
that is building up energy to make the

1550
01:03:01,828 --> 01:03:04,906
change but the path to the change can't

1551
01:03:04,938 --> 01:03:06,670
actually be produced and the energy

1552
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,250
effectively feeds back on itself. And

1553
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,506
that's the energy of frustration which

1554
01:03:09,528 --> 01:03:12,178
eventually will either build to a

1555
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:15,806
release this way or it'll

1556
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:17,522
cut itself ant certain stores and then

1557
01:03:17,576 --> 01:03:18,894
will lead to more like depression.

1558
01:03:18,942 --> 01:03:22,166
Right? So that's a proposed like to put

1559
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:23,894
out there that we're in a moment a big

1560
01:03:23,932 --> 01:03:25,746
part of what's going on is that we're

1561
01:03:25,778 --> 01:03:28,534
all receiving the signal that we need to

1562
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:32,854
shift into this collective consciousness

1563
01:03:32,902 --> 01:03:34,970
mode, this liminality mode, this group

1564
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,866
explore mode. We don't know how and

1565
01:03:37,888 --> 01:03:40,170
we're largely stuck. And so we're trying

1566
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,026
to figure out how to make that move at

1567
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:43,626
very macro level. Like there's lots and

1568
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:45,918
lots of adaptive stuff going on, not the

1569
01:03:45,924 --> 01:03:47,326
least of which is the brokenness of our

1570
01:03:47,348 --> 01:03:49,646
body mind, our bodies and our mind in

1571
01:03:49,668 --> 01:03:52,170
relationship to just reality. Ideology

1572
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:53,982
overriding our signals, like and body

1573
01:03:54,036 --> 01:03:57,310
cognition is way out of whack. And a big

1574
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,518
chunk, maybe even like 90% of the chunk

1575
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:00,482
of the problem that we're actually

1576
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,606
dealing with is the journey of simply

1577
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,894
restoring ourselves to that basic

1578
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:07,614
capacity. Once we get back to that basic

1579
01:04:07,662 --> 01:04:10,678
capacity unlocking the 80% of people who

1580
01:04:10,684 --> 01:04:13,366
are sitting in bullshit jobs back into a

1581
01:04:13,388 --> 01:04:14,978
coherent collective intelligence that's

1582
01:04:14,994 --> 01:04:17,414
operating in a group explorer mode has

1583
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:19,846
enough capacity to actually navigate us

1584
01:04:19,868 --> 01:04:21,622
to the niche we want to get to. So

1585
01:04:21,756 --> 01:04:24,694
that's taking the problem.

1586
01:04:24,732 --> 01:04:27,386
Of governance and say, okay, we can take

1587
01:04:27,408 --> 01:04:29,178
a series of steps and think about how do

1588
01:04:29,184 --> 01:04:31,638
we maybe find a way to work our path?

1589
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,526
How do we find the path to get us back

1590
01:04:33,568 --> 01:04:36,622
to the location where we regenerate our

1591
01:04:36,676 --> 01:04:38,618
ambient indigenous capacity to operate

1592
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:40,906
in this mode from which we should unlock

1593
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:43,166
a vastly larger capacity to think about

1594
01:04:43,188 --> 01:04:44,240
these bigger problems.

1595
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,818
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot there. I

1596
01:04:50,824 --> 01:04:55,106
think I could go on quite

1597
01:04:55,128 --> 01:04:57,346
the response, I think, in terms of time,

1598
01:04:57,448 --> 01:05:00,562
though, I think, Daniel, you did want to

1599
01:05:00,616 --> 01:05:02,486
bring in some live chat questions as

1600
01:05:02,508 --> 01:05:05,318
well, or in terms of where do we want to

1601
01:05:05,324 --> 01:05:06,998
go here? Because I could respond to

1602
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:07,846
that. There's a lot of really

1603
01:05:07,868 --> 01:05:10,474
interesting points there. Or we could

1604
01:05:10,592 --> 01:05:13,894
weave questions into that context,

1605
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:16,460
that frame. Where do you want to go,

1606
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:20,300
Matthew? With a direct response. Then

1607
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:24,202
we'll have a rapid question and answer

1608
01:05:24,336 --> 01:05:26,414
that will take us just around the time

1609
01:05:26,452 --> 01:05:28,750
that we agreed upon and feel free to

1610
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:31,022
depart as well. And then at the very

1611
01:05:31,076 --> 01:05:33,886
end, I'll just make some reflections and

1612
01:05:33,908 --> 01:05:35,982
connect it to active inference. So first

1613
01:05:36,036 --> 01:05:38,386
Matthew, then question, and then feel

1614
01:05:38,408 --> 01:05:39,698
free to stay or leave and there'll be a

1615
01:05:39,704 --> 01:05:41,674
little Act-Inf reflection. 

1616
01:05:41,674 --> 01:05:45,058
Matthew Pirkowski: Cool. Yeah. And in light of that, I was also really

1617
01:05:45,224 --> 01:05:48,146
wanting to raise some of the active

1618
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,206
inference semantics and context in

1619
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:54,866
response to in response to Jordan's

1620
01:05:54,898 --> 01:05:58,534
points. One interesting frame that I

1621
01:05:58,572 --> 01:06:00,678
feel is interesting to observe that it

1622
01:06:00,684 --> 01:06:03,266
hasn't saturated the culture, perhaps

1623
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:05,338
just given the memetics of when and

1624
01:06:05,344 --> 01:06:07,642
where is introduced, but sort of like

1625
01:06:07,696 --> 01:06:11,666
EO. Wilson and Edward Lumsden introduced

1626
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,030
something called dual inheritance theory

1627
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,120
20 to 30 years ago. I'm not sure if you

1628
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,294
encountered that. They had this book

1629
01:06:19,332 --> 01:06:22,800
called Gene's, Mind and Culture and

1630
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,894
there's a lot of resonance with respect

1631
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:29,266
to the mechanisms. They did a lot of

1632
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:31,922
work with respect to the manner in which

1633
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:35,646
the kind of diversity of behavioral

1634
01:06:35,678 --> 01:06:39,118
sensitivities, psychological psycho,

1635
01:06:39,134 --> 01:06:42,354
memetic and cultural level sensitivities

1636
01:06:42,402 --> 01:06:45,382
and behavior patterns have these kind of

1637
01:06:45,436 --> 01:06:48,726
emergent feedback loops that

1638
01:06:48,828 --> 01:06:51,618
essentially end up creating an emergent

1639
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:53,178
form radial parameterisation at the

1640
01:06:53,184 --> 01:06:54,326
cultural level and the cultural

1641
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:56,714
dynamics. These changes you're talking

1642
01:06:56,752 --> 01:06:58,474
about at deeper levels of reality as

1643
01:06:58,512 --> 01:07:00,710
they bubble up through and restructure

1644
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,926
the cultural manifestations and the

1645
01:07:02,948 --> 01:07:06,254
sensitivities and behavior tendencies of

1646
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:09,694
this diversity of psychotypes. I guess

1647
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:13,038
you were saying how that actually, as a

1648
01:07:13,044 --> 01:07:15,954
mechanism feeds back into and back down

1649
01:07:15,992 --> 01:07:18,222
through all those other different layers

1650
01:07:18,286 --> 01:07:21,790
of adaptive implication, selection

1651
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:24,626
transformation and sort of like this

1652
01:07:24,728 --> 01:07:26,580
emergent cascade and then this

1653
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:30,018
essentially radial parameterisation

1654
01:07:30,114 --> 01:07:32,646
which many people have struggled with in

1655
01:07:32,668 --> 01:07:34,854
the past under the offices of the

1656
01:07:34,892 --> 01:07:36,594
argument around downward causation.

1657
01:07:36,722 --> 01:07:38,694
That's a whole slightly different

1658
01:07:38,892 --> 01:07:41,046
conversation. But I do think active

1659
01:07:41,078 --> 01:07:44,298
inference is very interesting from the

1660
01:07:44,304 --> 01:07:45,226
perspective, at least from my

1661
01:07:45,248 --> 01:07:46,378
perspective. Some of the work I've been

1662
01:07:46,384 --> 01:07:49,434
doing recently showing that in many

1663
01:07:49,472 --> 01:07:53,862
ways, active coherence offers

1664
01:07:53,926 --> 01:07:57,214
a one function in the category, the

1665
01:07:57,252 --> 01:07:59,450
necessary category of transformational

1666
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:02,106
mappings between perception and action

1667
01:08:02,218 --> 01:08:05,374
that do exist at this deeply fundamental

1668
01:08:05,422 --> 01:08:08,466
level. In terms of the sort of

1669
01:08:08,568 --> 01:08:11,150
establishment of any causal closures,

1670
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:14,770
either of any non trivially, complex

1671
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:17,414
process, any cycle that's capable of

1672
01:08:17,452 --> 01:08:20,166
observation and action based on

1673
01:08:20,188 --> 01:08:22,790
perception, in relation to perception.

1674
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:25,974
And interestingly, I think that that

1675
01:08:26,092 --> 01:08:28,038
does, by its very nature, in the way

1676
01:08:28,044 --> 01:08:30,838
that it connects to itself, give rise to

1677
01:08:31,004 --> 01:08:33,846
this bimodal topology, like through a

1678
01:08:33,868 --> 01:08:35,790
particular kind of non orientability.

1679
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:38,154
And so the reflexivity, when something

1680
01:08:38,192 --> 01:08:39,434
comes back to you, has a different

1681
01:08:39,472 --> 01:08:41,306
orientation. So you actually have an

1682
01:08:41,328 --> 01:08:43,798
understanding of the relationship

1683
01:08:43,904 --> 01:08:46,238
between past and present via the lens of

1684
01:08:46,244 --> 01:08:48,826
duration because of the need to proceed,

1685
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,278
even then impose some transformation on

1686
01:08:51,284 --> 01:08:53,486
the environment. Through that. I think

1687
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:57,154
we're just beginning to develop the

1688
01:08:57,192 --> 01:09:00,926
capacity to work with those tools

1689
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:03,970
in a way that doesn't impose.

1690
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,446
That's more like surfing these adaptive

1691
01:09:06,478 --> 01:09:09,346
waves. That allows us to observe the way

1692
01:09:09,368 --> 01:09:10,590
in which these transformations and

1693
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,614
perceptions are mapping onto actions and

1694
01:09:12,652 --> 01:09:16,774
using that as a tool in a toolkit of

1695
01:09:16,892 --> 01:09:18,910
explicitly and consciously designing

1696
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:21,114
network connections between these many

1697
01:09:21,152 --> 01:09:22,746
different perceivers and actors. And

1698
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:25,158
their perceptual and action capacities

1699
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:28,538
in a way that can I don't want

1700
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:32,018
to say provably, but in a principled

1701
01:09:32,054 --> 01:09:34,266
manner give rise to emergent systems

1702
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:37,326
that do have these properties built in

1703
01:09:37,348 --> 01:09:39,546
endogenously and perhaps these signaling

1704
01:09:39,578 --> 01:09:42,014
mechanisms. Built in endogenously in

1705
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,186
ways that can resonate with what you're

1706
01:09:44,218 --> 01:09:45,806
talking about, which is the embodied

1707
01:09:45,918 --> 01:09:48,306
sense that we have, intuitively or

1708
01:09:48,328 --> 01:09:51,506
unconsciously that arises, but we don't

1709
01:09:51,528 --> 01:09:53,666
necessarily have the language or the

1710
01:09:53,688 --> 01:09:55,714
framework to explicitly talk about it.

1711
01:09:55,752 --> 01:09:59,234
So sort of that emergent welling up

1712
01:09:59,272 --> 01:10:01,598
of emotion or frustration or depression

1713
01:10:01,694 --> 01:10:03,460
or enemy as you said,

1714
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:07,086
gets shunted into language and cultural

1715
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:09,494
symbols and representations that don't

1716
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:13,014
Bull close back on the sort of actuation

1717
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:16,234
capacities that we need to actuate or

1718
01:10:16,272 --> 01:10:18,426
that we need to upregulate in this

1719
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:20,086
particular moment. And I think active

1720
01:10:20,118 --> 01:10:23,398
inference and other frameworks like it

1721
01:10:23,504 --> 01:10:25,840
precisely because they take this

1722
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:28,606
perspective, epistemic perspective that

1723
01:10:28,628 --> 01:10:30,746
says actually you don't get to directly

1724
01:10:30,778 --> 01:10:32,926
observe the world. All you can do and

1725
01:10:32,948 --> 01:10:35,290
the best you can do is take this humble

1726
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:38,546
process of trying the best you can to

1727
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,574
connect signals of perception to signals

1728
01:10:40,622 --> 01:10:42,702
of action in relationship to preferences

1729
01:10:42,766 --> 01:10:44,706
at a given time and the context in which

1730
01:10:44,728 --> 01:10:48,034
they exist and build from there ground

1731
01:10:48,082 --> 01:10:51,250
up. I think it's a leading candidate

1732
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:54,194
in the modes of phenomenologically

1733
01:10:54,242 --> 01:10:57,846
shifting our perspective through

1734
01:10:57,868 --> 01:10:59,798
new ways of operating and seeing the

1735
01:10:59,804 --> 01:11:01,814
world through new paradigms, through new

1736
01:11:01,852 --> 01:11:04,038
toolkits. So that's why I think I've

1737
01:11:04,054 --> 01:11:05,686
been really interested in the active

1738
01:11:05,718 --> 01:11:07,802
inference space and see it as something

1739
01:11:07,856 --> 01:11:09,562
that's quite relevant to this entire

1740
01:11:09,616 --> 01:11:12,414
conversation and in particular to your

1741
01:11:12,612 --> 01:11:14,080
final remarks there.

1742
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:18,430
All right, excellent,

1743
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:23,946
awesome. Thanks both for the dialogue.

1744
01:11:23,978 --> 01:11:27,666
This is really great. So I

1745
01:11:27,688 --> 01:11:31,890
will try to bring in many of

1746
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,338
the questions that were asked in the

1747
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:38,070
very active and energetic live chat

1748
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:42,886
we'll get pretty quick thoughts that

1749
01:11:42,908 --> 01:11:45,606
will conclude the primary section of the

1750
01:11:45,628 --> 01:11:48,006
stream and then if you want to stay or

1751
01:11:48,028 --> 01:11:49,754
leave. But I'll just add a few more

1752
01:11:49,792 --> 01:11:51,926
points because indeed the connection

1753
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:54,198
with active inference is very salient.

1754
01:11:54,294 --> 01:11:57,562
Okay, so into the questions we go first

1755
01:11:57,616 --> 01:12:00,874
from Charles Bloss. Hello, what are the

1756
01:12:00,912 --> 01:12:03,982
primary patterns including values of

1757
01:12:04,036 --> 01:12:05,390
wise exploration?

1758
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:20,210
One was the one that you just noticed

1759
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:24,838
which is moving at the pace of

1760
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:27,974
wise collaboration. Meaning in this case

1761
01:12:28,012 --> 01:12:29,842
I noticed that's a very complex

1762
01:12:29,906 --> 01:12:32,566
question. I'll have to take a lot of

1763
01:12:32,588 --> 01:12:34,680
time to think about it. Yeah,

1764
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:39,126
questions raised, we raised the

1765
01:12:39,148 --> 01:12:41,334
questions. Here and explore it in the

1766
01:12:41,372 --> 01:12:42,678
coming time. But feel free to give a

1767
01:12:42,684 --> 01:12:45,306
short response while you can. For sure,

1768
01:12:45,408 --> 01:12:46,698
I Dean, it's just interesting, I think

1769
01:12:46,704 --> 01:12:47,818
there's a confidence there because one

1770
01:12:47,824 --> 01:12:48,906
of the things that was coming to mind as

1771
01:12:48,928 --> 01:12:50,266
I was taking the time to try to reflect

1772
01:12:50,298 --> 01:12:52,270
on that was patience.

1773
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:55,566
Especially in light of all of the

1774
01:12:55,588 --> 01:12:58,814
tendencies that shift us away from the

1775
01:12:58,852 --> 01:13:01,510
capacity to take in sufficient

1776
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:05,074
information relation to

1777
01:13:05,112 --> 01:13:10,478
cycle. On that there's

1778
01:13:10,494 --> 01:13:12,002
a tendency to always want to,

1779
01:13:12,056 --> 01:13:13,918
especially under pressure, under stress,

1780
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:15,710
to always want to take perception and

1781
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,846
immediately map to action. Like for

1782
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:19,926
every cycle of perception, some sort of

1783
01:13:19,948 --> 01:13:22,934
symmetric action because it field like

1784
01:13:22,972 --> 01:13:25,106
you're at least doing something feels

1785
01:13:25,138 --> 01:13:27,626
better than doing nothing. But there

1786
01:13:27,648 --> 01:13:30,026
might be some minimal necessary amount

1787
01:13:30,128 --> 01:13:32,746
of reflection you might need to cycle a

1788
01:13:32,768 --> 01:13:35,590
number of times at a number of scales

1789
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:39,574
with a diversity of opinions before the

1790
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:43,230
capacity is built up in that collective

1791
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:46,490
intelligence or collective coherent

1792
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:49,886
structure, before any action that it

1793
01:13:49,908 --> 01:13:51,886
takes externally can do anything other

1794
01:13:51,908 --> 01:13:53,826
than make things worse. And I think that

1795
01:13:53,848 --> 01:13:56,286
that's a massive problem that we're

1796
01:13:56,318 --> 01:13:57,986
confronting right now, because most of

1797
01:13:58,008 --> 01:14:00,958
our tools are designed to map perception

1798
01:14:01,054 --> 01:14:03,202
to some sort of extrinsic action almost

1799
01:14:03,256 --> 01:14:06,626
instantaneously. And we haven't created

1800
01:14:06,658 --> 01:14:09,014
the infrastructure that allows us to

1801
01:14:09,052 --> 01:14:12,514
more deeply allow for complex emergent

1802
01:14:12,562 --> 01:14:15,586
perception and mediated in the context

1803
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:19,130
of action at the sort of duration and

1804
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,340
depth required to meet the moment.

1805
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:26,458
Great, so then a follow up comment and

1806
01:14:26,464 --> 01:14:28,422
then a question. So Charles followed.

1807
01:14:28,486 --> 01:14:31,406
Speaking of time, flagging an inquiry in

1808
01:14:31,428 --> 01:14:33,326
regard to timekeeping and calendars and

1809
01:14:33,348 --> 01:14:35,662
their specific numerics effects on

1810
01:14:35,716 --> 01:14:37,786
humanity's psyche and cultures related

1811
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:40,350
to this patience. And Conor and Cairos

1812
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:44,114
next question from Nathan Curtis at

1813
01:14:44,152 --> 01:14:47,262
what point in time, from instantiation

1814
01:14:47,406 --> 01:14:49,954
does the established government lose its

1815
01:14:49,992 --> 01:14:53,442
ability to be self referential and able

1816
01:14:53,496 --> 01:14:56,550
to look in on itself to identify flaws?

1817
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,564
I've had a general thought about this

1818
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:09,888
question. What I would say of course is

1819
01:15:09,914 --> 01:15:12,808
that the answer is it depends the

1820
01:15:12,814 --> 01:15:15,396
particulars matter and I think it's

1821
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:18,724
going to be something like three primary

1822
01:15:18,772 --> 01:15:21,768
characteristics. One is going to

1823
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:23,596
actually have to do with what's called

1824
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:25,436
the shape or the topology of the

1825
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:27,724
underlying architecture. So and

1826
01:15:27,762 --> 01:15:31,244
architecture like say liberalism has a

1827
01:15:31,282 --> 01:15:35,500
decent number of designed failsafes

1828
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:38,768
very specifically consciously aware of

1829
01:15:38,774 --> 01:15:41,648
this problem. And so it's more like a

1830
01:15:41,654 --> 01:15:43,600
dissipative structure. It has a higher

1831
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:46,896
capacity to actually live longer given a

1832
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:49,028
particular call it gradient, using the

1833
01:15:49,034 --> 01:15:51,030
earliest language we were using.

1834
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,668
The second, it's funny, you can

1835
01:15:55,674 --> 01:15:56,676
basically identify three very

1836
01:15:56,698 --> 01:15:58,724
straightforward principles. One is the

1837
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:01,288
amount of energy, the amount of

1838
01:16:01,374 --> 01:16:03,896
information or potential that was

1839
01:16:03,918 --> 01:16:06,840
enclosed in the initial design.

1840
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:10,376
The second is the intelligence or

1841
01:16:10,398 --> 01:16:11,784
elegance of design in terms of its

1842
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:15,196
actual ability to produce structure that

1843
01:16:15,298 --> 01:16:19,676
most effectively navigates that

1844
01:16:19,778 --> 01:16:22,236
dissipation into entropy. The third,

1845
01:16:22,338 --> 01:16:23,688
and this is I think, a piece that we're

1846
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:26,976
running into a lot is something like a

1847
01:16:26,998 --> 01:16:31,116
characteristic of bandwidth distinct

1848
01:16:31,148 --> 01:16:34,544
from time. Meaning the proper measure is

1849
01:16:34,582 --> 01:16:37,372
not chronological time chronos,

1850
01:16:37,516 --> 01:16:39,280
but is something like relational

1851
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,440
interactions or loops of perception

1852
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,988
agency, something like that. And so if I

1853
01:16:45,994 --> 01:16:47,668
think of say, an UDR loop is a kind of a

1854
01:16:47,674 --> 01:16:48,340
clock,

1855
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,340
that is the right clock.

1856
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:59,256
Awesome. That maps directly onto kind

1857
01:16:59,278 --> 01:17:00,776
of what I was mentioning with respect to

1858
01:17:00,798 --> 01:17:03,224
the active inference idea of duration as

1859
01:17:03,262 --> 01:17:05,276
time, right? In the sense that that is

1860
01:17:05,298 --> 01:17:07,724
precisely that cyclic relation in terms

1861
01:17:07,762 --> 01:17:10,056
of perceiving the consequences of action

1862
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:14,104
as perception. And then internally,

1863
01:17:14,232 --> 01:17:16,204
inside of whatever mechanism is

1864
01:17:16,242 --> 01:17:17,736
perceiving and acting at whatever scale

1865
01:17:17,768 --> 01:17:21,592
we're talking about, that transformation

1866
01:17:21,736 --> 01:17:24,576
is sort of this era of time that we

1867
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,528
perceive as the linear structure, that

1868
01:17:26,534 --> 01:17:29,008
linear mapping. But the real time. In a

1869
01:17:29,014 --> 01:17:32,096
lot of ways, the systemic time is the

1870
01:17:32,198 --> 01:17:35,184
path link through this causal structure

1871
01:17:35,232 --> 01:17:37,876
that flows between the action of any

1872
01:17:37,898 --> 01:17:41,668
given entity and the capacity to

1873
01:17:41,674 --> 01:17:45,304
perceive feedback in terms of what

1874
01:17:45,342 --> 01:17:47,540
those actions caused and how that allows

1875
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,576
in light of the contextualized relations

1876
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:51,976
that give meaning to the action, in

1877
01:17:51,998 --> 01:17:54,164
light of the values that are ostensibly

1878
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:57,368
pursued. And so back to the question in

1879
01:17:57,374 --> 01:18:00,764
terms of when is the system capable of

1880
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:03,032
or when does it become no longer capable

1881
01:18:03,096 --> 01:18:05,484
of that kind of self reflection? Well,

1882
01:18:05,522 --> 01:18:09,228
I would say to the extent that cycle

1883
01:18:09,404 --> 01:18:12,192
time, that capacity, that closure for

1884
01:18:12,246 --> 01:18:14,156
being able to understand the causal

1885
01:18:14,188 --> 01:18:16,496
affect of one's own actions in a

1886
01:18:16,518 --> 01:18:21,248
contextualized meaning grounded frame

1887
01:18:21,424 --> 01:18:23,296
to the extent that that is intercepted

1888
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:24,790
or broken right?

1889
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,236
Or to the extent that it becomes no

1890
01:18:29,258 --> 01:18:32,336
longer concerned with its own or COVID

1891
01:18:32,368 --> 01:18:34,116
cystic is another way of putting it. So

1892
01:18:34,138 --> 01:18:36,116
those would be conditions to the extent

1893
01:18:36,148 --> 01:18:39,636
that it actually becomes so trapped

1894
01:18:39,668 --> 01:18:42,280
in its own existing frame or its own

1895
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,436
assumptions of causality. So this would

1896
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:47,500
be active inference lab.

1897
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,396
You have something along the lines of

1898
01:18:52,418 --> 01:18:53,310
like an over.

1899
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,896
The precision of its capacity to

1900
01:18:58,918 --> 01:19:01,264
represent the world becomes far too

1901
01:19:01,302 --> 01:19:04,640
precise with respect to the relationship

1902
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:07,200
between a very narrow subset of

1903
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:08,784
modalities and factors in the world

1904
01:19:08,822 --> 01:19:09,856
exteroception and actions in the world,

1905
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,172
which is exactly what we were talking

1906
01:19:11,226 --> 01:19:13,156
about earlier when we were talking about

1907
01:19:13,258 --> 01:19:14,228
in Jordan's language, the

1908
01:19:14,234 --> 01:19:16,464
decontextualization or like hyper

1909
01:19:16,512 --> 01:19:19,460
contextualization. And then that

1910
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:21,940
prevents you from being able to identify

1911
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,548
a very large percentage of the causal

1912
01:19:24,564 --> 01:19:26,392
structure that might be relevant to

1913
01:19:26,526 --> 01:19:30,040
whatever is threatening the coherence of

1914
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:33,112
your collective intelligence or your

1915
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:35,864
actual physically embodied metabolic

1916
01:19:35,912 --> 01:19:38,190
systems or whatever. That may be.

1917
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:44,204
Awesome. Nathan wrote if we want

1918
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:46,604
those representatives to embody a

1919
01:19:46,642 --> 01:19:48,464
certain aspect of being in that

1920
01:19:48,502 --> 01:19:50,304
position, how do we best select those

1921
01:19:50,342 --> 01:19:52,464
people? What modalities can we use to

1922
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:54,780
select the best AI recommendation

1923
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:57,244
systems? Temperament and Character

1924
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,530
Inventory Test.

1925
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:07,402
Personally, I'm fascinated by the

1926
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:10,970
possibilities of emergent identification

1927
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:16,118
of reputation like networks that

1928
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:19,710
take advantage of the information

1929
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,430
that exists in local relationships.

1930
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,582
We might notice that to the extent that

1931
01:20:25,716 --> 01:20:28,186
we have elections at larger and larger

1932
01:20:28,218 --> 01:20:30,466
scales, we lose that right. Like in your

1933
01:20:30,488 --> 01:20:32,366
local elections, in a democratic

1934
01:20:32,398 --> 01:20:35,506
election or a democratic electorate, if

1935
01:20:35,528 --> 01:20:39,426
you're voting for sort

1936
01:20:39,448 --> 01:20:43,346
of like a county chair or a governor

1937
01:20:43,378 --> 01:20:45,446
or whatnot, you're much more likely to

1938
01:20:45,468 --> 01:20:47,494
have relationships or at least some

1939
01:20:47,532 --> 01:20:49,490
sort. Of socially contextualized

1940
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:52,726
understanding of who that person is and

1941
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:53,958
what the words that are coming out of

1942
01:20:53,964 --> 01:20:55,594
their mouth actually mean in

1943
01:20:55,632 --> 01:20:58,620
relationship to your embodied life.

1944
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:01,562
But the further you get away from that,

1945
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,354
the more you're dealing with

1946
01:21:03,392 --> 01:21:05,226
abstractions and so the more energy has

1947
01:21:05,248 --> 01:21:07,834
to be put into making those abstractions

1948
01:21:07,882 --> 01:21:10,126
feel real to you. And then you enter the

1949
01:21:10,148 --> 01:21:13,066
world of television news and political

1950
01:21:13,258 --> 01:21:15,962
news Cycles very myopically focused,

1951
01:21:16,026 --> 01:21:18,542
hyper precise, a lot of energy and time

1952
01:21:18,596 --> 01:21:20,466
put into those particular issues that

1953
01:21:20,488 --> 01:21:22,386
get the most attention as opposed to

1954
01:21:22,488 --> 01:21:24,850
those issues that tend to actually have

1955
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:29,106
a more embodied affect on an

1956
01:21:29,128 --> 01:21:31,426
individual. So how do you actually take

1957
01:21:31,448 --> 01:21:34,066
advantage of surface that emergent

1958
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,614
pattern of contextualized wisdom not

1959
01:21:36,652 --> 01:21:39,286
just within democratic elections but at

1960
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:40,838
a much deeper level than we've ever

1961
01:21:40,924 --> 01:21:43,770
considered before? Because I think one

1962
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,466
requirement of meeting the level of

1963
01:21:45,488 --> 01:21:48,506
complexity of the problems before us is

1964
01:21:48,688 --> 01:21:51,354
representing a much greater degree of

1965
01:21:51,392 --> 01:21:54,060
information. Without that information,

1966
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:58,254
that information being at many scales of

1967
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:00,398
our net emergent organism being the

1968
01:22:00,404 --> 01:22:03,438
nation state, let's say for now without

1969
01:22:03,524 --> 01:22:04,846
that information flow through the

1970
01:22:04,868 --> 01:22:07,342
system, overwhelming the system. I think

1971
01:22:07,396 --> 01:22:09,598
liquid democracy perspectives as a

1972
01:22:09,604 --> 01:22:11,538
general category are quite interesting

1973
01:22:11,704 --> 01:22:13,538
in terms of looking at them as sort of

1974
01:22:13,544 --> 01:22:15,486
like graph finding or path finding

1975
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:17,986
algorithms of expertise that are

1976
01:22:18,008 --> 01:22:19,922
mediated by local expertise or local

1977
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:22,230
relationships, local trust networks.

1978
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:26,150
The trick with those is, I think,

1979
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:30,194
executing those in a way that is capture

1980
01:22:30,242 --> 01:22:32,854
resistant. That doesn't necessarily make

1981
01:22:32,972 --> 01:22:34,578
that doesn't turn the entire game of

1982
01:22:34,604 --> 01:22:38,140
life into a game of politics. Such that

1983
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:40,666
we are all campaigning all the time to

1984
01:22:40,688 --> 01:22:42,986
be perceived as the greatest expert in

1985
01:22:43,008 --> 01:22:44,874
whatever domain without actually

1986
01:22:44,912 --> 01:22:46,426
producing the action that would

1987
01:22:46,448 --> 01:22:48,014
naturally give rise to those

1988
01:22:48,052 --> 01:22:49,738
perceptions. It's a big problem. It's

1989
01:22:49,754 --> 01:22:53,114
like aping the behavior

1990
01:22:53,162 --> 01:22:54,938
that would lead to someone perceiving

1991
01:22:54,954 --> 01:22:56,206
you as successful. It's like the

1992
01:22:56,228 --> 01:22:58,522
instagram model or instagram personality

1993
01:22:58,586 --> 01:23:00,634
problem. It's like if you rent the jet

1994
01:23:00,682 --> 01:23:03,646
plane and put on the facade and you wear

1995
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,918
the skin suit and have the persona it's

1996
01:23:05,934 --> 01:23:07,314
increasingly difficult for a large

1997
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:09,682
percentage of people to divorce that

1998
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:11,698
from the real signal itself. So I think

1999
01:23:11,784 --> 01:23:15,126
within liquid democracy patterns of sort

2000
01:23:15,148 --> 01:23:16,678
of emergent stewardship or

2001
01:23:16,684 --> 01:23:19,046
identification of people who might be

2002
01:23:19,148 --> 01:23:21,138
able to solve problems with greater

2003
01:23:21,154 --> 01:23:22,678
competence, that emerges as a problem.

2004
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:24,486
And then there's also the problem of

2005
01:23:24,668 --> 01:23:26,906
response time. So it's like, to some

2006
01:23:26,928 --> 01:23:29,126
extent, the reason why we have central

2007
01:23:29,158 --> 01:23:30,394
executives or the reason why we have

2008
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,994
individual representatives and place

2009
01:23:32,032 --> 01:23:33,562
authority in the hands of single

2010
01:23:33,616 --> 01:23:36,042
individuals is because there are

2011
01:23:36,096 --> 01:23:38,346
particular kinds of events that require

2012
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:42,298
response that is at the scale of smaller

2013
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:44,202
time windows than is typically capable

2014
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:46,974
with processes that include large

2015
01:23:47,012 --> 01:23:48,270
numbers of people. So that's another

2016
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:50,506
attention in terms of needing to solve

2017
01:23:50,538 --> 01:23:53,118
that without falling back into sort of

2018
01:23:53,124 --> 01:23:55,074
the central executive idea. But those

2019
01:23:55,112 --> 01:23:56,318
are just sort of the cluster of thoughts

2020
01:23:56,334 --> 01:23:57,954
that come to my mind when that question

2021
01:23:57,992 --> 01:24:01,438
arises. The first thing that

2022
01:24:01,464 --> 01:24:02,726
come up for me is that I would

2023
01:24:02,748 --> 01:24:05,046
profoundly caution that principle of

2024
01:24:05,068 --> 01:24:09,826
asymmetry that I'm

2025
01:24:09,858 --> 01:24:11,526
reasonably confident that the right way

2026
01:24:11,548 --> 01:24:13,502
to do this is to almost perfectly invert

2027
01:24:13,586 --> 01:24:16,442
our current way of doing things in our

2028
01:24:16,496 --> 01:24:20,714
habits and intuitions meaning a

2029
01:24:20,752 --> 01:24:23,274
radical regeneration of actual real

2030
01:24:23,312 --> 01:24:25,594
relationality and orientation of

2031
01:24:25,632 --> 01:24:27,286
sovereignty ie. Choice making authority

2032
01:24:27,318 --> 01:24:29,854
and power to the lower level more

2033
01:24:29,892 --> 01:24:32,478
intimate locations is profoundly the

2034
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,686
right way of doing things. And so that

2035
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:37,198
most people for the most of the time,

2036
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:39,506
most of their choices are actually being

2037
01:24:39,528 --> 01:24:42,530
governed by high context dynamics.

2038
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:46,194
And then on top of that substrate you

2039
01:24:46,232 --> 01:24:48,462
then can actually relatively easily

2040
01:24:48,526 --> 01:24:50,306
build a construct that allows kind of a

2041
01:24:50,328 --> 01:24:52,854
distributed Cincinnati where when it is

2042
01:24:52,892 --> 01:24:54,994
in fact very important to identify

2043
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:58,194
individuals of extremely unique capacity

2044
01:24:58,322 --> 01:25:00,806
to deal with very specific problems that

2045
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:03,234
agent available within even a vaguely

2046
01:25:03,282 --> 01:25:05,906
large local environment. You can press

2047
01:25:05,948 --> 01:25:07,498
them into it. But the point is that

2048
01:25:07,504 --> 01:25:10,346
they're so deeply connected 80% of the

2049
01:25:10,368 --> 01:25:13,610
time into and Attial lived context with

2050
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:17,054
all the different strong bond, high

2051
01:25:17,092 --> 01:25:19,120
feedback loop, high context, high

2052
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:23,262
subtlety that the culture into

2053
01:25:23,316 --> 01:25:25,454
the instagram model thing doesn't really

2054
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:27,534
have. It's obvious that that's a really

2055
01:25:27,572 --> 01:25:29,726
bad idea. If you have people who are

2056
01:25:29,748 --> 01:25:32,894
living almost entirely in virtual lives

2057
01:25:33,012 --> 01:25:34,926
where there's really nothing real in

2058
01:25:34,948 --> 01:25:36,274
their lives, they don't actually have

2059
01:25:36,312 --> 01:25:37,426
real friends, they don't have real

2060
01:25:37,448 --> 01:25:38,514
territory, they don't have real

2061
01:25:38,552 --> 01:25:39,746
relationships with, even like their.

2062
01:25:39,768 --> 01:25:42,206
Parents or their siblings, then it's

2063
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:43,906
very difficult for them to notice that

2064
01:25:43,928 --> 01:25:45,682
the instagram influencer thing is

2065
01:25:45,736 --> 01:25:48,182
terrible because they don't really have

2066
01:25:48,316 --> 01:25:49,846
something other than that that is

2067
01:25:49,868 --> 01:25:51,458
qualitatively distinct. But if they're

2068
01:25:51,474 --> 01:25:53,062
actually living a truly healthy life

2069
01:25:53,116 --> 01:25:54,786
with all kinds of good positive things

2070
01:25:54,828 --> 01:25:57,834
happening then you can pop into this

2071
01:25:57,872 --> 01:25:59,766
other role, notice that you really don't

2072
01:25:59,798 --> 01:26:01,706
want to live there, do your job and get

2073
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,734
the hell back into a nurturing

2074
01:26:03,782 --> 01:26:06,586
environment. I should mention, by the

2075
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:08,446
way, it's not clear to me that we can

2076
01:26:08,468 --> 01:26:10,110
actually get from here to there outside

2077
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:12,174
of catastrophe. The navigation of that

2078
01:26:12,212 --> 01:26:15,246
particular path, at the very least is a

2079
01:26:15,268 --> 01:26:17,546
serious, serious, serious job, clearly

2080
01:26:17,578 --> 01:26:18,894
well beyond the capacities of anything

2081
01:26:18,932 --> 01:26:20,754
that we have right now. So it would be

2082
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:23,266
kind of a trophic cascade of a series of

2083
01:26:23,288 --> 01:26:25,058
upgraded capacities that get us to the

2084
01:26:25,064 --> 01:26:27,300
point where we have that capacity and

2085
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:31,394
that's reluctant. I think we've talked

2086
01:26:31,432 --> 01:26:33,058
a little bit about this or exchanged a

2087
01:26:33,064 --> 01:26:34,806
little bit about this on Twitter in

2088
01:26:34,828 --> 01:26:37,510
terms of one of those constraints. And

2089
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:38,678
when you're talking I just kind of

2090
01:26:38,684 --> 01:26:40,680
wanted to get your take on this,

2091
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:44,026
one of those issues with respect to

2092
01:26:44,048 --> 01:26:47,046
potentially walking that adaptive

2093
01:26:47,078 --> 01:26:49,366
valley, right, or trying to balance upon

2094
01:26:49,398 --> 01:26:51,594
that adaptive bridge line between our

2095
01:26:51,632 --> 01:26:53,386
current local maximum and perhaps some

2096
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:57,114
sort of foothold on a larger

2097
01:26:57,242 --> 01:27:00,478
fitness landscape. Or higher point on

2098
01:27:00,484 --> 01:27:04,238
that fitness landscape is this idea

2099
01:27:04,324 --> 01:27:07,118
of national capacity in relation to the

2100
01:27:07,124 --> 01:27:08,978
geopolitical structure of the rest of

2101
01:27:08,984 --> 01:27:10,914
the world because we're operating not

2102
01:27:10,952 --> 01:27:11,970
brain evolution.

2103
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:17,314
If we delegate responsibility, this

2104
01:27:17,352 --> 01:27:19,490
transformation that brings agency

2105
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:21,926
outside of that central locus of

2106
01:27:21,948 --> 01:27:24,326
coherence that is now, this behemoth the

2107
01:27:24,348 --> 01:27:28,242
leviathan of the state with its primary

2108
01:27:28,306 --> 01:27:29,858
focus, let's say, or at least it's

2109
01:27:29,874 --> 01:27:33,078
Ostensible reason for being. As the

2110
01:27:33,244 --> 01:27:35,738
maintenance of the integrity and the

2111
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:38,666
boundaries of the entity called the

2112
01:27:38,688 --> 01:27:40,534
United States or whatever the nation

2113
01:27:40,582 --> 01:27:42,250
might be at that scale.

2114
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:45,306
As soon as that sort of starts to

2115
01:27:45,328 --> 01:27:47,246
falter, it's also perceived by other

2116
01:27:47,268 --> 01:27:49,600
agents on the landscape as opportunity.

2117
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:53,086
And then, interestingly enough, is it

2118
01:27:53,108 --> 01:27:56,170
possible to maintain that transformative

2119
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,686
traversal in light of whatever pressures

2120
01:27:58,718 --> 01:28:02,578
are added on top of our already great

2121
01:28:02,664 --> 01:28:05,454
list of pressures by other geopolitical

2122
01:28:05,502 --> 01:28:07,922
actors. And I suspect that's at least

2123
01:28:07,976 --> 01:28:12,006
one possible reason why you think that a

2124
01:28:12,028 --> 01:28:14,278
transformation like this will have to be

2125
01:28:14,364 --> 01:28:17,874
forced out of sort of terrific cascade

2126
01:28:17,922 --> 01:28:20,710
collapse or cascading collapses.

2127
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:23,110
I'd be interested to hear your take on

2128
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:26,218
that. Yeah, that's great. Just popped in

2129
01:28:26,224 --> 01:28:28,166
my head with this notion of pyramids.

2130
01:28:28,278 --> 01:28:31,226
So by hypothesis, let's say that the

2131
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:33,734
American empire is one giant peacock

2132
01:28:33,782 --> 01:28:35,978
tail and so we're going to lose it. But

2133
01:28:35,984 --> 01:28:37,798
the good news is we can, we can afford

2134
01:28:37,814 --> 01:28:38,974
it. In fact, we're better off without

2135
01:28:39,012 --> 01:28:42,110
it. And so, yes, I think you're right.

2136
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,760
And it's funny, it's almost like

2137
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:47,214
expanding to fill a niche where we found

2138
01:28:47,252 --> 01:28:49,006
ourselves in this odd circumstance of

2139
01:28:49,028 --> 01:28:51,918
being first one of two superpowers and

2140
01:28:51,924 --> 01:28:53,538
then being an actual Global hegemon for

2141
01:28:53,544 --> 01:28:55,218
the very first time in human history.

2142
01:28:55,384 --> 01:28:57,598
And we expanded to fill that niche,

2143
01:28:57,614 --> 01:29:00,018
meaning we sort of depleted all of our

2144
01:29:00,104 --> 01:29:04,898
excess capacity until we unconsciously

2145
01:29:04,914 --> 01:29:06,774
and arbitrarily sort of deployed the

2146
01:29:06,812 --> 01:29:09,158
Global hegemon game all the way out to

2147
01:29:09,164 --> 01:29:10,246
the edge, right? And then we're sort of

2148
01:29:10,268 --> 01:29:11,766
pushing at the absolute limits of our

2149
01:29:11,788 --> 01:29:14,086
control capacity, by the way, in the

2150
01:29:14,108 --> 01:29:15,318
context of all these other things we've

2151
01:29:15,324 --> 01:29:16,726
been talking about, like local entropy

2152
01:29:16,758 --> 01:29:18,026
and parasitism, et cetera, and all the

2153
01:29:18,048 --> 01:29:19,718
niches that open up in that interior.

2154
01:29:19,894 --> 01:29:21,686
And I would simply propose that we're

2155
01:29:21,718 --> 01:29:24,954
already past that point. So one might

2156
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,578
argue that any kind of change in

2157
01:29:27,584 --> 01:29:29,274
behavior comes with the cost of having

2158
01:29:29,312 --> 01:29:31,338
to give up the benefit of being a Global

2159
01:29:31,354 --> 01:29:33,166
hedge fund. And maybe you don't want to

2160
01:29:33,188 --> 01:29:35,178
do that. That's kind of a Tainter pivot

2161
01:29:35,194 --> 01:29:36,254
point. If you're familiar with that

2162
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:37,950
point in the Marco,

2163
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:41,966
I think that dies in cats, that we're

2164
01:29:41,998 --> 01:29:44,286
right now in the process of a forced

2165
01:29:44,478 --> 01:29:47,570
catscade down from that position into

2166
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:51,426
some new multipolarity. And that can

2167
01:29:51,448 --> 01:29:53,358
be and I suspect we've probably gotten

2168
01:29:53,374 --> 01:29:56,182
the order of like three to five, maybe

2169
01:29:56,236 --> 01:29:58,326
seven more years for that to kind of

2170
01:29:58,348 --> 01:30:01,714
land all the way down. Very clearly

2171
01:30:01,762 --> 01:30:03,558
that that's where we are. But I would

2172
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:05,306
say we're past the top of that point.

2173
01:30:05,328 --> 01:30:08,058
So it's a downhill roll from there. And

2174
01:30:08,144 --> 01:30:10,934
much like this notion of bullshit jobs

2175
01:30:10,982 --> 01:30:13,834
or the demoralization cynicism of being

2176
01:30:13,872 --> 01:30:16,310
stuck, we might find ourselves

2177
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:19,242
demoralized by being unrooted from being

2178
01:30:19,296 --> 01:30:21,422
Global hedge fund. But we might also

2179
01:30:21,476 --> 01:30:23,086
recognize that that was actually never a

2180
01:30:23,108 --> 01:30:24,702
thing that ever that we really, really

2181
01:30:24,756 --> 01:30:26,766
aspired to be and could have been or

2182
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:28,394
should have been. More importantly,

2183
01:30:28,442 --> 01:30:30,178
could have been. It was doomed in from

2184
01:30:30,184 --> 01:30:32,914
the very beginning. And that we're right

2185
01:30:32,952 --> 01:30:35,026
now being forcibly liberated from a

2186
01:30:35,048 --> 01:30:37,794
highly dysfunctional exploration, which

2187
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:39,838
then, if you sort of shrink the scope

2188
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:43,014
back down to a much smaller scope may

2189
01:30:43,052 --> 01:30:45,160
actually produce. A large enough,

2190
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:48,982
large depth of time and control

2191
01:30:49,036 --> 01:30:51,366
capacity to afford us, called the

2192
01:30:51,388 --> 01:30:53,802
Generation and Generation and a Half to

2193
01:30:53,856 --> 01:30:57,046
reestablish a more generative governance

2194
01:30:57,078 --> 01:30:59,770
infrastructure. So that's an interesting

2195
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,660
possibility at least. It's a nice story.

2196
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:05,974
Wow, we're going to live a path

2197
01:31:06,022 --> 01:31:07,706
associated with that. At least it's not

2198
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:09,980
that path. Something interesting.

2199
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:13,630
Okay. To ask a few more questions, just

2200
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,246
feel free to make sure. I have to be

2201
01:31:15,268 --> 01:31:17,354
very careful with timing because my wife

2202
01:31:17,402 --> 01:31:18,654
can be coming back with my four year old

2203
01:31:18,692 --> 01:31:20,714
and I have an immediate responsibility.

2204
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,266
So we can we can go. But be mindful. I

2205
01:31:23,288 --> 01:31:24,578
may literally hit the red button to be

2206
01:31:24,584 --> 01:31:28,850
gone. Sounds good. Please depart as

2207
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,682
family demands. So just I'll read a few

2208
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:33,766
more questions and then again, I'll just

2209
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:35,154
stay after to give a few reflections.

2210
01:31:35,202 --> 01:31:37,718
So what is a good example of a major

2211
01:31:37,804 --> 01:31:40,326
expanded decontextualization that we

2212
01:31:40,348 --> 01:31:42,600
live in that exists in the culture now?

2213
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:50,186
Expanded? I didn't understand that. A

2214
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:52,810
major expanded decontextualization,

2215
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:58,186
maybe a broad scale. Okay. It might

2216
01:31:58,208 --> 01:31:59,998
be like a synthesis of the two ways that

2217
01:32:00,004 --> 01:32:01,566
we were talking about this and maybe in

2218
01:32:01,588 --> 01:32:04,398
terms of expanded decontextualization in

2219
01:32:04,404 --> 01:32:08,686
the sense of the

2220
01:32:08,708 --> 01:32:12,350
tendency to see the world maladaptively

2221
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:17,666
through a lens that has grown so

2222
01:32:17,688 --> 01:32:18,882
large that we can see nothing else.

2223
01:32:18,936 --> 01:32:22,638
Perhaps the COVID policy COVID

2224
01:32:22,654 --> 01:32:24,438
policy is a great example of exactly

2225
01:32:24,524 --> 01:32:29,240
that. We built a medical and

2226
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:31,382
health care what is it called, public

2227
01:32:31,436 --> 01:32:34,438
health infrastructure pulling forward

2228
01:32:34,524 --> 01:32:36,774
decontextualizing. A very large number

2229
01:32:36,812 --> 01:32:40,262
of aspects of embodied, embedded humans

2230
01:32:40,406 --> 01:32:42,394
and effective. What that did is that put

2231
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,726
a series of knobs in the cybernetic

2232
01:32:44,758 --> 01:32:46,762
control structure. That when a real

2233
01:32:46,816 --> 01:32:48,374
problem came up that has extreme

2234
01:32:48,422 --> 01:32:50,986
systemic complexity. The way we ended up

2235
01:32:51,008 --> 01:32:52,406
dealing with it is we started pulling

2236
01:32:52,438 --> 01:32:54,686
these knobs as opposed to address the

2237
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:57,054
underlying systemic complexity. We were

2238
01:32:57,092 --> 01:32:59,066
like, okay, lockdown. Why lockdown?

2239
01:32:59,098 --> 01:33:00,906
Well, lockdown may be an optimal

2240
01:33:00,938 --> 01:33:02,986
strategy if you think that you can shut

2241
01:33:03,018 --> 01:33:05,634
down the spreading of a virus and are

2242
01:33:05,672 --> 01:33:06,946
completely ignoring all the other

2243
01:33:06,968 --> 01:33:08,946
systemic consequences of lockdown. For

2244
01:33:08,968 --> 01:33:11,858
example, it was kind of like. You agent

2245
01:33:11,864 --> 01:33:13,438
over with the army. You have philosophy.

2246
01:33:13,454 --> 01:33:15,526
Except that the control board we had was

2247
01:33:15,628 --> 01:33:18,054
extremely low resolution and even

2248
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:20,130
contraindicated by our own past advice

2249
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:22,566
in many ways. But it was at hand and so

2250
01:33:22,668 --> 01:33:25,446
we pulled the levers, even though there

2251
01:33:25,468 --> 01:33:27,386
were plenty of us who were saying,

2252
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:29,674
perhaps treating this as a giant light

2253
01:33:29,712 --> 01:33:34,086
switch is not wise makeup

2254
01:33:34,118 --> 01:33:35,482
and to. Comma from orbit isn't always

2255
01:33:35,536 --> 01:33:38,474
the best play. Yeah. And I would also

2256
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:40,894
just extend that point into the fact

2257
01:33:40,932 --> 01:33:43,646
that beginning to reflect on that as a

2258
01:33:43,668 --> 01:33:46,174
society is also showing us that there

2259
01:33:46,212 --> 01:33:47,600
are a number of other

2260
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:50,478
decontextualization or sort of like

2261
01:33:50,564 --> 01:33:54,146
frame lock issues that we have that have

2262
01:33:54,168 --> 01:33:55,794
built quite a lot of inertia around

2263
01:33:55,832 --> 01:33:57,922
them, especially around the domain of

2264
01:33:57,976 --> 01:34:00,146
what we call science, or what is now

2265
01:34:00,168 --> 01:34:03,818
parodied as science or scientism,

2266
01:34:03,934 --> 01:34:06,630
which is like the more serious

2267
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:09,110
conversation that's been going on since

2268
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:11,960
the advent of essentially early

2269
01:34:13,130 --> 01:34:16,066
postmodern philosophy. And in the van

2270
01:34:16,098 --> 01:34:17,926
sort of phenomenology like usurl and

2271
01:34:17,948 --> 01:34:21,542
Husserl's questioning of sort of

2272
01:34:21,676 --> 01:34:25,366
the paradigmatic and nature of science

2273
01:34:25,478 --> 01:34:28,922
as a way of seeing the world

2274
01:34:28,976 --> 01:34:30,858
that can displace all other ways of

2275
01:34:30,864 --> 01:34:32,522
seeing the world if we're not careful.

2276
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:36,718
And the tendency of that to

2277
01:34:36,884 --> 01:34:39,166
because it has provided such again,

2278
01:34:39,188 --> 01:34:41,242
this is sort of this question of

2279
01:34:41,396 --> 01:34:44,786
exploration finding capacity and

2280
01:34:44,808 --> 01:34:46,574
then that capacity becoming so powerful

2281
01:34:46,622 --> 01:34:49,310
that it puts people into habitual mode

2282
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:51,218
and that habitual mode becomes a

2283
01:34:51,224 --> 01:34:54,326
fallback if other levels of social or

2284
01:34:54,348 --> 01:34:56,098
psychological or even mythopoetic

2285
01:34:56,114 --> 01:34:58,626
coherence break down. So to the extent

2286
01:34:58,658 --> 01:35:00,582
that people lose other frames for

2287
01:35:00,636 --> 01:35:04,966
perceiving reality, perhaps for

2288
01:35:04,988 --> 01:35:06,226
interpreting their phenomenological

2289
01:35:06,258 --> 01:35:08,146
meaning, which is what the mythopoetic

2290
01:35:08,178 --> 01:35:10,438
frame has provided for so long, to the

2291
01:35:10,444 --> 01:35:12,186
extent that breaks down, sometimes for

2292
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:14,058
good reason. I mean, again, there was a

2293
01:35:14,064 --> 01:35:15,866
lot of corruption in the church and in

2294
01:35:15,888 --> 01:35:17,706
religion and there was a lot of, I would

2295
01:35:17,728 --> 01:35:20,266
say, decay in the sort of interpretive

2296
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:25,194
frames presented to upcoming

2297
01:35:25,242 --> 01:35:26,654
generations. I mean, I was one of those

2298
01:35:26,692 --> 01:35:30,062
people raised Catholic, initially left

2299
01:35:30,116 --> 01:35:32,010
the church, became essentially

2300
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:33,874
antithesis for quite some period of time

2301
01:35:33,912 --> 01:35:36,066
before beginning to realize only through

2302
01:35:36,248 --> 01:35:39,586
evolutionary education and looking at

2303
01:35:39,688 --> 01:35:41,474
sort of the game theoretic lens in terms

2304
01:35:41,512 --> 01:35:44,066
of deep history, that there was

2305
01:35:44,088 --> 01:35:45,714
something there, there was a there

2306
01:35:45,752 --> 01:35:47,554
there, and that it wasn't necessarily

2307
01:35:47,602 --> 01:35:49,894
something we could jettison. But many

2308
01:35:49,932 --> 01:35:51,238
people have I think many people were in

2309
01:35:51,244 --> 01:35:53,014
that same position. And being in that

2310
01:35:53,052 --> 01:35:55,058
position have jettison in that frame,

2311
01:35:55,154 --> 01:35:58,182
falling back upon the purely scientific

2312
01:35:58,246 --> 01:36:00,262
frame, but not themselves doing science

2313
01:36:00,326 --> 01:36:01,770
being associated with the process.

2314
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:05,082
Therefore falling into a dogma and being

2315
01:36:05,136 --> 01:36:07,094
willing to trust the high priests,

2316
01:36:07,142 --> 01:36:09,434
therefore creating an incentive for high

2317
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,366
priests who are mouthing the words and

2318
01:36:12,388 --> 01:36:14,426
playing the game of politics as opposed

2319
01:36:14,458 --> 01:36:16,826
to really committed to the continued

2320
01:36:16,858 --> 01:36:18,714
process of discovery and transformation

2321
01:36:18,762 --> 01:36:20,366
and representation that we know of

2322
01:36:20,388 --> 01:36:23,566
science and getting ourselves into that

2323
01:36:23,588 --> 01:36:25,826
whole situation. And we're still a very

2324
01:36:25,848 --> 01:36:27,298
live conversation. We're still trying to

2325
01:36:27,304 --> 01:36:29,586
figure this out. And what is the

2326
01:36:29,608 --> 01:36:30,818
relationship between science? Can you

2327
01:36:30,824 --> 01:36:32,962
have a scientific exploration of

2328
01:36:33,096 --> 01:36:36,114
mythopoetic constructs? I think that's a

2329
01:36:36,152 --> 01:36:37,714
really fascinating possible field that

2330
01:36:37,752 --> 01:36:39,286
also active coherence would have a lot

2331
01:36:39,308 --> 01:36:40,674
to say in terms of the emergent

2332
01:36:40,722 --> 01:36:43,010
structure of collective behavior.

2333
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:44,918
That's sort of the same kind of

2334
01:36:45,004 --> 01:36:47,190
questions, like really digging into and

2335
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:48,518
beginning to examine the kind of

2336
01:36:48,524 --> 01:36:49,798
questions you were talking about earlier

2337
01:36:49,894 --> 01:36:51,994
with respect to what it means for

2338
01:36:52,032 --> 01:36:53,018
different people to have different

2339
01:36:53,104 --> 01:36:54,726
traits, tendencies, the perception,

2340
01:36:54,758 --> 01:36:57,558
personality traits, what that ontology

2341
01:36:57,654 --> 01:36:59,306
looks like you're saying maybe seven to

2342
01:36:59,328 --> 01:37:02,186
40 psychotypes or something like that.

2343
01:37:02,288 --> 01:37:03,738
What the dynamics of that as an

2344
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,246
emergence system actually look like in

2345
01:37:05,268 --> 01:37:06,238
terms of their feedback and

2346
01:37:06,244 --> 01:37:08,426
parameterization on the underlying

2347
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:09,898
structure and evolution of our society

2348
01:37:09,994 --> 01:37:12,462
and how mythopolitic structures and

2349
01:37:12,516 --> 01:37:14,574
scientific perspectives change those

2350
01:37:14,612 --> 01:37:16,098
perceptions and interaction with one

2351
01:37:16,104 --> 01:37:17,918
another and dynamic feedback mechanisms

2352
01:37:17,934 --> 01:37:19,326
with one another, or dynamics feedback

2353
01:37:19,358 --> 01:37:20,546
correlation with one another. I mean,

2354
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:21,954
these are all questions for the next 50

2355
01:37:21,992 --> 01:37:24,002
years, right? I mean, very important

2356
01:37:24,056 --> 01:37:26,706
ones, I would say. Yeah, so I'd like for

2357
01:37:26,728 --> 01:37:28,086
this. We're listening. I like the fact

2358
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:30,246
that you were actually, in describing a

2359
01:37:30,268 --> 01:37:33,334
decontextualized, can't remember

2360
01:37:33,372 --> 01:37:34,918
the structure, but describing the

2361
01:37:34,924 --> 01:37:36,754
structure, you also were articulating

2362
01:37:36,882 --> 01:37:38,258
where a lot of the failure conditions

2363
01:37:38,274 --> 01:37:40,090
emerge and how we find ourselves,

2364
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:43,158
like this systemic shift. But you don't

2365
01:37:43,174 --> 01:37:44,474
notice that you're actually moving from

2366
01:37:44,512 --> 01:37:46,026
science into politics or moving from

2367
01:37:46,048 --> 01:37:48,006
science into theology into politics.

2368
01:37:48,038 --> 01:37:49,318
And because you don't even notice it's,

2369
01:37:49,334 --> 01:37:51,578
a thing that could happen is not a risk

2370
01:37:51,594 --> 01:37:52,846
that you're even contemplating in your

2371
01:37:52,868 --> 01:37:54,958
behavior. So you're finding yourself on

2372
01:37:55,044 --> 01:37:57,886
that trajectory. Maybe the mother of all

2373
01:37:57,988 --> 01:38:00,590
actually metaphor being where we are,

2374
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,900
like, nearing the end of something,

2375
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:05,794
the short answer to the question is kind

2376
01:38:05,832 --> 01:38:09,234
of everything. So everywhere you look is

2377
01:38:09,272 --> 01:38:12,542
a hypertrophy example of extended

2378
01:38:12,606 --> 01:38:14,966
decontextualization. So the problem is

2379
01:38:14,988 --> 01:38:16,198
actually being aware of what the

2380
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:19,206
opposite might look like. But maybe the

2381
01:38:19,228 --> 01:38:21,126
mother of all is education, the

2382
01:38:21,148 --> 01:38:24,280
education system. I would say that

2383
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:27,340
the current education system

2384
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:31,686
decontextualizes humans, developing

2385
01:38:31,718 --> 01:38:33,914
humans so radically as to deprive them

2386
01:38:33,952 --> 01:38:36,490
of probably something between 70 and 90%

2387
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:39,654
of developmental needs, which produces

2388
01:38:39,702 --> 01:38:41,822
probably a net yield of probably a 99%

2389
01:38:41,876 --> 01:38:43,870
reduction in total human capacity.

2390
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:47,246
And many of the things that Matthew was

2391
01:38:47,268 --> 01:38:49,610
just bringing up, like the embodied

2392
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:51,778
facility, not just not just the

2393
01:38:51,784 --> 01:38:54,146
cognitive scientific awareness. Of the

2394
01:38:54,168 --> 01:38:55,586
particular psychotypes and the

2395
01:38:55,608 --> 01:38:57,650
relationships but actually building

2396
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,954
actual facility in navigating that

2397
01:38:59,992 --> 01:39:02,898
properly how you individual navigate the

2398
01:39:02,904 --> 01:39:04,114
world and how you can be in right

2399
01:39:04,152 --> 01:39:05,598
relationship with distinct other kinds

2400
01:39:05,614 --> 01:39:07,410
of humans in collaborative spaces.

2401
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:09,938
Like, that's actually really hard. And

2402
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,014
it's not the kind of thing that's easy

2403
01:39:11,052 --> 01:39:12,598
to learn when you're 50, right? It's the

2404
01:39:12,604 --> 01:39:13,638
proper thing to be learning between the

2405
01:39:13,644 --> 01:39:15,974
ages of like four and twelve and then

2406
01:39:16,012 --> 01:39:18,278
deployed effectively in particular kinds

2407
01:39:18,294 --> 01:39:20,940
of contexts between say twelve and 20.

2408
01:39:22,350 --> 01:39:24,838
Sorry, I'm doing the same thing. I'm

2409
01:39:24,854 --> 01:39:26,714
pointing out the things we don't even

2410
01:39:26,752 --> 01:39:29,006
notice that we have lost by virtue of

2411
01:39:29,028 --> 01:39:31,134
becoming hyper, hyper focused on a very

2412
01:39:31,172 --> 01:39:32,698
particular set of optimization

2413
01:39:32,794 --> 01:39:36,270
characteristics. And also education,

2414
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,838
as I think a very big example of the

2415
01:39:39,844 --> 01:39:42,766
basic problem. I think that form of

2416
01:39:42,788 --> 01:39:44,366
education, to the extent that we can do

2417
01:39:44,388 --> 01:39:45,986
that, we can also begin to see, in light

2418
01:39:46,008 --> 01:39:47,700
of what you're saying with respect to

2419
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:49,698
it's, almost everything at this point,

2420
01:39:49,784 --> 01:39:51,682
a key element of that almost everything

2421
01:39:51,816 --> 01:39:54,374
is the economic domain in which this

2422
01:39:54,412 --> 01:39:57,366
plays out. You could consider that sort

2423
01:39:57,388 --> 01:40:01,906
of like a hypertrophic exploitation

2424
01:40:02,018 --> 01:40:06,050
of supernormal stimuli,

2425
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:07,742
right? What is a supernormal stimuli?

2426
01:40:07,826 --> 01:40:09,578
These stimuli that we have that are

2427
01:40:09,664 --> 01:40:11,818
essentially we've discovered as part of

2428
01:40:11,824 --> 01:40:13,866
this reflective process of discovery in

2429
01:40:13,888 --> 01:40:15,542
the domain of science. We've discovered

2430
01:40:15,606 --> 01:40:20,978
particular ways of tapping into evolved

2431
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:22,494
perception action loops that are

2432
01:40:22,532 --> 01:40:24,190
unbounded in their sensitivity.

2433
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:28,314
It's very hard to identify upper bound

2434
01:40:28,362 --> 01:40:31,618
for how the extent to which you

2435
01:40:31,624 --> 01:40:35,394
can advertise self undermining food

2436
01:40:35,432 --> 01:40:38,290
products or ways of spending your time

2437
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:41,106
if in the moment those produce some sort

2438
01:40:41,128 --> 01:40:44,694
of extremely positive or extremely some

2439
01:40:44,732 --> 01:40:47,974
high salience positive affect experience

2440
01:40:48,092 --> 01:40:51,974
like eating sugar or getting that

2441
01:40:52,012 --> 01:40:54,802
dopamine release from the anticipation

2442
01:40:54,946 --> 01:40:57,766
of acknowledgement of one's perspective

2443
01:40:57,878 --> 01:41:01,430
online or these types of economic

2444
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:04,106
threads that we have created are

2445
01:41:04,208 --> 01:41:06,710
specifically the profit maximization

2446
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:09,258
thread. I think this is often put on the

2447
01:41:09,264 --> 01:41:11,978
shoulders of the word capitalism as a

2448
01:41:11,984 --> 01:41:14,078
pointer to some sort of hand wavy, like

2449
01:41:14,164 --> 01:41:15,866
there's something going on here and it's

2450
01:41:15,898 --> 01:41:18,106
capitalism. But I think at a deeper

2451
01:41:18,138 --> 01:41:19,806
level what we're pointing to here is the

2452
01:41:19,828 --> 01:41:23,138
fact that because of this very

2453
01:41:23,224 --> 01:41:26,702
long lineage of frames

2454
01:41:26,766 --> 01:41:29,842
that we have chosen and in many ways

2455
01:41:29,896 --> 01:41:32,994
like adapted to live within as a

2456
01:41:33,032 --> 01:41:36,006
function of past adaptive challenges we

2457
01:41:36,028 --> 01:41:37,986
now live inside this maximal

2458
01:41:38,018 --> 01:41:41,990
representation of those ideas

2459
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:44,306
in a way that is no longer sustainable.

2460
01:41:44,338 --> 01:41:46,726
So like profit maximization as a myopic

2461
01:41:46,758 --> 01:41:49,498
focus leading to identifying those

2462
01:41:49,584 --> 01:41:51,514
narrow set of dimensions that are most

2463
01:41:51,552 --> 01:41:55,018
in line with that narrow metric over the

2464
01:41:55,184 --> 01:41:58,220
sort of corporate function and then

2465
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:01,770
actually successfully tapping into

2466
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,402
evolved aspects of human psychology

2467
01:42:03,466 --> 01:42:06,558
perception that are unbounded. It was

2468
01:42:06,564 --> 01:42:08,238
a search function and eventually it was

2469
01:42:08,244 --> 01:42:09,914
going to come to rest on like probing

2470
01:42:09,962 --> 01:42:11,618
the human experience in mind until it

2471
01:42:11,624 --> 01:42:14,434
found those parts that literally would

2472
01:42:14,472 --> 01:42:17,154
not you got to go. I got to go guys.

2473
01:42:17,192 --> 01:42:20,674
Sorry. Indeed. Jordan, great talk.

2474
01:42:20,792 --> 01:42:21,620
Thank you.

2475
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:27,938
Yeah, that economic threat

2476
01:42:27,954 --> 01:42:29,894
is another threat to pull on. But that

2477
01:42:29,932 --> 01:42:32,886
was a great conversation in. This in the

2478
01:42:32,908 --> 01:42:34,966
active over time, I just want to run

2479
01:42:34,988 --> 01:42:37,986
through a few hits that I wrote down

2480
01:42:38,028 --> 01:42:40,726
from this great convo and just plant

2481
01:42:40,758 --> 01:42:43,418
some seeds for how maybe we can continue

2482
01:42:43,504 --> 01:42:46,618
35.2 or in the future. All right, so in

2483
01:42:46,624 --> 01:42:48,698
the very beginning, there was a

2484
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:50,726
discussion of something like a meta

2485
01:42:50,758 --> 01:42:54,306
theory among the three of coon

2486
01:42:54,358 --> 01:42:56,206
with respect to science, hayek with

2487
01:42:56,228 --> 01:42:57,918
respect to business, and Tainter with

2488
01:42:57,924 --> 01:43:01,326
respect to politics. And we can

2489
01:43:01,348 --> 01:43:03,006
even see that meta theory as the

2490
01:43:03,028 --> 01:43:06,058
prototypical perception, cognition,

2491
01:43:06,154 --> 01:43:09,634
action or ecoevo divo loop. So you

2492
01:43:09,672 --> 01:43:11,374
spoke to the transformational mapping

2493
01:43:11,422 --> 01:43:13,294
between perception and action, which is

2494
01:43:13,352 --> 01:43:15,366
basically what cognition is. We just say

2495
01:43:15,388 --> 01:43:19,030
it's everything between that map between

2496
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:21,746
perception and action and hence active

2497
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:24,386
inference as a prototypical framework

2498
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:27,318
for not solving but framing some of

2499
01:43:27,324 --> 01:43:30,006
these contexts. Then there's a

2500
01:43:30,028 --> 01:43:31,126
structured way of mapping those

2501
01:43:31,148 --> 01:43:33,498
exteroception onto available actions and

2502
01:43:33,504 --> 01:43:35,158
then identifying I mean, interestingly

2503
01:43:35,174 --> 01:43:37,254
enough, one of the most essential

2504
01:43:37,302 --> 01:43:38,906
aspects of the framework is that

2505
01:43:38,928 --> 01:43:40,826
capacity to switch between the

2506
01:43:40,848 --> 01:43:42,158
development or, like, reduction of

2507
01:43:42,164 --> 01:43:43,646
variational free energy in the moment.

2508
01:43:43,748 --> 01:43:45,434
Understanding whether my representation

2509
01:43:45,482 --> 01:43:47,326
of Parsing reality and action and what

2510
01:43:47,348 --> 01:43:50,046
I'm doing is actually in line with the

2511
01:43:50,068 --> 01:43:52,158
causal structure of my local environment

2512
01:43:52,254 --> 01:43:54,402
versus this explore exploit, future

2513
01:43:54,456 --> 01:43:57,618
oriented frame of reference in light of

2514
01:43:57,784 --> 01:44:00,850
when is it? Time to actually search out

2515
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:03,739
some disruption or some entropy so that

2516
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:07,058
that entropy injection into my locally

2517
01:44:07,234 --> 01:44:10,646
ossified frame can open me up again to

2518
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:12,742
navigating that adaptive landscape and

2519
01:44:12,796 --> 01:44:14,866
introducing new maps between perception

2520
01:44:14,898 --> 01:44:17,514
and action that can facilitate my

2521
01:44:17,552 --> 01:44:21,178
continued adaptation. Awesome. So I

2522
01:44:21,184 --> 01:44:23,066
wanted to actually go to the free energy

2523
01:44:23,168 --> 01:44:26,794
with we had the earliest epoch of human

2524
01:44:26,992 --> 01:44:29,398
collaboration, which Jordan

2525
01:44:29,414 --> 01:44:32,090
characterized as sort of an unconscious.

2526
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:34,734
And that is a lot like type one thinking

2527
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,478
in the type one, type two system. And

2528
01:44:36,484 --> 01:44:38,446
it's a lot like variational free energy.

2529
01:44:38,548 --> 01:44:41,998
It's just this real time unfolding Bull

2530
01:44:42,014 --> 01:44:44,914
goes downhill modality type two

2531
01:44:45,032 --> 01:44:48,034
thinking, second stage civilization, as

2532
01:44:48,072 --> 01:44:50,754
per Jordan. And expected free energy is

2533
01:44:50,792 --> 01:44:53,198
where we actually have the double edged

2534
01:44:53,214 --> 01:44:56,046
sword of the rollout and anticipation.

2535
01:44:56,158 --> 01:44:58,202
And we've seen simulations in Ant IMF

2536
01:44:58,286 --> 01:45:01,250
where a tiny proportion of hypothesized

2537
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:02,818
negative outcomes, even if they're

2538
01:45:02,834 --> 01:45:06,106
totally avoidable drive, rumination and

2539
01:45:06,128 --> 01:45:08,390
anxiety and high variance estimates.

2540
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:11,580
And then the question is,

2541
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:15,578
is there a third epoch, is there a third

2542
01:45:15,664 --> 01:45:19,802
mode that uses attention to modulate

2543
01:45:19,946 --> 01:45:22,126
the balance or the reliance between the

2544
01:45:22,148 --> 01:45:23,454
variational and the expected free

2545
01:45:23,492 --> 01:45:25,342
energy? And to what extent is that

2546
01:45:25,396 --> 01:45:28,762
attentional modulation implicit

2547
01:45:28,826 --> 01:45:31,822
tacit onboard, not automatable?

2548
01:45:31,966 --> 01:45:34,546
And to what extent could that kind of

2549
01:45:34,568 --> 01:45:37,790
wisdom be reflected in our externalized

2550
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:41,666
niche? And that connects to the question

2551
01:45:41,768 --> 01:45:44,758
of automation and transparency around

2552
01:45:44,844 --> 01:45:46,882
our information architectures,

2553
01:45:47,026 --> 01:45:49,110
Communications and our infrastructure.

2554
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:52,966
And I thought at first a sort of

2555
01:45:52,988 --> 01:45:54,774
infrastructural incompleteness or

2556
01:45:54,812 --> 01:45:56,986
instability theorem. Like, even if you

2557
01:45:57,008 --> 01:45:59,546
get all of layer one automated, then of

2558
01:45:59,568 --> 01:46:00,906
course, layer two has not been

2559
01:46:00,928 --> 01:46:02,134
automated. So there's always the hyper

2560
01:46:02,182 --> 01:46:05,850
prior and also that Min

2561
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:08,794
two opponent processing thinking with

2562
01:46:08,832 --> 01:46:10,390
ten segregated architecture,

2563
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:13,162
compression and tension. Could we have

2564
01:46:13,216 --> 01:46:15,278
systems where instead of just trying to,

2565
01:46:15,364 --> 01:46:17,326
oh, we want this object hanging here,

2566
01:46:17,428 --> 01:46:18,926
we'll just put a pillar underneath it,

2567
01:46:18,948 --> 01:46:20,026
and then we'll put a pillar underneath

2568
01:46:20,058 --> 01:46:21,506
that. Like, are we going to compress all

2569
01:46:21,528 --> 01:46:24,814
the way down or could we have a harmonic

2570
01:46:24,862 --> 01:46:27,394
mode that involved compression and

2571
01:46:27,432 --> 01:46:31,490
tension and that's how it stayed flying?

2572
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:35,106
Then just go ahead. And then I have two

2573
01:46:35,128 --> 01:46:38,306
last points. I'd go either way. But

2574
01:46:38,328 --> 01:46:40,758
yeah, there's a lot of resonance here

2575
01:46:40,764 --> 01:46:42,614
with some of the things I'm working on

2576
01:46:42,732 --> 01:46:44,550
literally right now in terms of

2577
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:48,394
attention to attempting to work

2578
01:46:48,432 --> 01:46:51,514
with active inference. Like I was saying

2579
01:46:51,552 --> 01:46:54,982
earlier, as that cognitive mapping,

2580
01:46:55,126 --> 01:46:56,858
that mapping, you can look at it also as

2581
01:46:56,864 --> 01:46:59,418
a category theoretic mapping within a

2582
01:46:59,424 --> 01:47:01,326
category a set of morphisms right

2583
01:47:01,348 --> 01:47:03,306
between this sort of space of perception

2584
01:47:03,338 --> 01:47:06,014
and the space of action. And you can

2585
01:47:06,052 --> 01:47:09,902
then also in that sense, integrate that

2586
01:47:09,956 --> 01:47:13,346
into a larger hypothesis around

2587
01:47:13,448 --> 01:47:16,258
the topology of emergence and then

2588
01:47:16,424 --> 01:47:19,234
develop that as a toolkit. Which is

2589
01:47:19,272 --> 01:47:20,862
interesting because inactive inference

2590
01:47:20,926 --> 01:47:22,254
through the lens of active inference,

2591
01:47:22,302 --> 01:47:23,606
in theory, everything can active

2592
01:47:23,628 --> 01:47:25,574
inference lab and then it leads to this

2593
01:47:25,612 --> 01:47:27,874
sort of recursive hierarchical

2594
01:47:27,922 --> 01:47:31,122
structure. But following thinkers

2595
01:47:31,186 --> 01:47:34,134
such as like Robert Ronen in terms of

2596
01:47:34,172 --> 01:47:37,030
his and like Vashevsky in relational

2597
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:40,186
biology and bringing in theories of a

2598
01:47:40,208 --> 01:47:44,138
temporal causal structure that

2599
01:47:44,224 --> 01:47:46,966
basically can contextualize the temporal

2600
01:47:46,998 --> 01:47:49,166
unfolding of entailments, you can

2601
01:47:49,188 --> 01:47:52,400
actually use those understandings to

2602
01:47:53,170 --> 01:47:56,014
take active inference as a tool and

2603
01:47:56,052 --> 01:47:58,346
weave it into larger fabrics like you're

2604
01:47:58,378 --> 01:48:01,002
talking about. And those fabric

2605
01:48:01,066 --> 01:48:03,350
connections, they are related to active

2606
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:05,170
inference, but they're not necessarily

2607
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:08,418
active inference itself. Although you

2608
01:48:08,424 --> 01:48:09,906
could then take a meta step outside of

2609
01:48:09,928 --> 01:48:12,078
that and say we can apply the principles

2610
01:48:12,094 --> 01:48:14,694
to the entire system. But there's this

2611
01:48:14,732 --> 01:48:17,346
role of understanding novel closures,

2612
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:19,926
of observing of reflexivity. And that

2613
01:48:19,948 --> 01:48:22,406
reflexivity, I think is really like the

2614
01:48:22,428 --> 01:48:23,698
approach I described as the approach I'm

2615
01:48:23,714 --> 01:48:26,746
taking to introduce a different kind of

2616
01:48:26,768 --> 01:48:29,354
reflexivity and a kind that I believe is

2617
01:48:29,392 --> 01:48:32,246
consonant with multiscale arbitrarily

2618
01:48:32,278 --> 01:48:35,418
complex emergence into the world of

2619
01:48:35,424 --> 01:48:37,946
active inference. But experimenting with

2620
01:48:37,968 --> 01:48:39,370
how to stitch active inference together

2621
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:42,430
into itself I think is a very the entire

2622
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,398
field is new and exploratory, but even

2623
01:48:44,484 --> 01:48:46,366
amongst that, it's that the sort of

2624
01:48:46,388 --> 01:48:48,030
periphery in the edge of exploration.

2625
01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:53,840
Indeed. And just these last two points,

2626
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:57,954
belief Jorge was mentioned and

2627
01:48:58,072 --> 01:49:00,546
active inference helps us with the

2628
01:49:00,568 --> 01:49:04,482
composability legibility and simulation

2629
01:49:04,546 --> 01:49:07,238
evolution analytics on different

2630
01:49:07,324 --> 01:49:09,778
systems, physical cyber, physical

2631
01:49:09,874 --> 01:49:13,654
cognitive unknown, et cetera. So if

2632
01:49:13,692 --> 01:49:16,454
we're doing brikoulage on the edges now

2633
01:49:16,492 --> 01:49:19,386
we have the glue or the sticky tape or

2634
01:49:19,408 --> 01:49:22,394
whatever it is. And then last point was

2635
01:49:22,432 --> 01:49:25,994
on the peacocks and pyramids. It's not

2636
01:49:26,032 --> 01:49:28,854
so simple as just an adaptive buffer,

2637
01:49:28,982 --> 01:49:31,694
even throwing pletropy. So the

2638
01:49:31,732 --> 01:49:33,690
consequences on different phenotypes

2639
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:37,594
aside because it becomes integrated

2640
01:49:37,722 --> 01:49:40,910
as the kind of thing I am. And so,

2641
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:42,498
yes, it's like the eraser is the

2642
01:49:42,504 --> 01:49:44,238
capacity of the pencil, but we don't rub

2643
01:49:44,254 --> 01:49:46,354
our erasers all the way down. We're not

2644
01:49:46,392 --> 01:49:48,962
always on our last life in the video

2645
01:49:49,016 --> 01:49:52,606
game. And a symbol

2646
01:49:52,718 --> 01:49:55,926
that on one hand the energy could have

2647
01:49:55,948 --> 01:49:59,090
been diverted to some other purpose.

2648
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:04,054
That symbol can actually become an

2649
01:50:04,092 --> 01:50:06,206
introduction at even the mythopoetic

2650
01:50:06,258 --> 01:50:09,900
level and therefore actually

2651
01:50:11,630 --> 01:50:13,974
lose its capacity to be an adaptive

2652
01:50:14,022 --> 01:50:17,546
buffer at one level and become a

2653
01:50:17,568 --> 01:50:21,740
pivotal player at another level.

2654
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:24,138
I think that is also related to that

2655
01:50:24,144 --> 01:50:26,874
evidence scram problem, particularly

2656
01:50:26,922 --> 01:50:28,366
with respect to the abstraction of that

2657
01:50:28,388 --> 01:50:30,046
buffer as well. Right. So if you

2658
01:50:30,068 --> 01:50:32,318
abstract the buffer as well, the buffer

2659
01:50:32,414 --> 01:50:34,206
is, in theory, a signal of underlying

2660
01:50:34,238 --> 01:50:36,226
quality of behavior to accumulate and

2661
01:50:36,248 --> 01:50:40,030
accrete resources over and above

2662
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:42,446
the requisite level of short term

2663
01:50:42,478 --> 01:50:44,846
consumption or metabolic need. Right.

2664
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:46,502
That's the evolutionary instinct we have

2665
01:50:46,556 --> 01:50:48,950
for sort of appreciating someone who

2666
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:51,286
has, quote unquote, gathered wealth, at

2667
01:50:51,308 --> 01:50:53,206
least by means that were constructive or

2668
01:50:53,228 --> 01:50:56,518
generative. But then to the extent that

2669
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,286
that becomes associated with identity

2670
01:50:58,418 --> 01:51:01,194
and then you look at the signals as that

2671
01:51:01,232 --> 01:51:02,538
wealth manifests in a particular

2672
01:51:02,624 --> 01:51:05,580
culture, as the proxy measurement for

2673
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:09,018
the underlying phenomenon, then you can

2674
01:51:09,024 --> 01:51:10,398
start to get into the manipulation of

2675
01:51:10,404 --> 01:51:12,426
those signals. If someone understands

2676
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:14,526
and observes others behaving as if the

2677
01:51:14,548 --> 01:51:16,906
signals were the process of production

2678
01:51:17,018 --> 01:51:19,006
of that capacity for wealth, the

2679
01:51:19,028 --> 01:51:21,258
capacity for production of generating

2680
01:51:21,434 --> 01:51:24,706
wealth or useful. Byproducts then you

2681
01:51:24,728 --> 01:51:27,006
can see again this emergent parasitism

2682
01:51:27,198 --> 01:51:29,634
element dropping in there because people

2683
01:51:29,672 --> 01:51:32,354
will try to middleman that process and

2684
01:51:32,392 --> 01:51:34,374
say, if I can get you to treat me as if

2685
01:51:34,412 --> 01:51:36,662
I am that person, maybe I can get access

2686
01:51:36,716 --> 01:51:38,966
to whatever associated privileges come

2687
01:51:38,988 --> 01:51:41,910
alongside that. Yeah, 100%.

2688
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:45,430
That's that identity association and

2689
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,574
all of the games that it opens up are

2690
01:51:47,772 --> 01:51:49,946
essentially central. What your gain to

2691
01:51:49,968 --> 01:51:51,594
what we're talking about? What we were

2692
01:51:51,632 --> 01:51:54,918
talking about? Awesome. And a closing

2693
01:51:55,014 --> 01:51:57,626
thought. The discussion made me think of

2694
01:51:57,648 --> 01:52:01,360
a July 4 Fireworks for information.

2695
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:06,602
What does it look like when the weaponry

2696
01:52:06,666 --> 01:52:09,566
is turned into livingry and when there

2697
01:52:09,588 --> 01:52:13,874
can be a symbolic ritual around the

2698
01:52:13,992 --> 01:52:18,094
utilization of that dual

2699
01:52:18,142 --> 01:52:21,300
function technology within

2700
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:25,430
the boundaries across those levels?

2701
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:29,046
Yeah, we're in a beautiful time for that

2702
01:52:29,068 --> 01:52:30,902
right now. I think so much of the

2703
01:52:31,036 --> 01:52:32,594
emerging technology, the generative

2704
01:52:32,642 --> 01:52:34,534
technologies out there, especially under

2705
01:52:34,572 --> 01:52:37,130
the offices of AI or ML,

2706
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:41,290
the capacity to use that generative

2707
01:52:42,110 --> 01:52:45,242
toolkit and its ability to allow

2708
01:52:45,296 --> 01:52:49,022
people to a much broader swath of people

2709
01:52:49,076 --> 01:52:52,266
to produce potentially resonant artistic

2710
01:52:52,298 --> 01:52:54,858
and cultural artifacts that are pointers

2711
01:52:54,954 --> 01:52:56,878
to something they find unique or

2712
01:52:56,884 --> 01:52:58,974
interesting or insightful that might

2713
01:52:59,012 --> 01:53:01,774
then spread if it aligns with a given

2714
01:53:01,812 --> 01:53:04,414
moment or need. And that's particularly

2715
01:53:04,462 --> 01:53:08,046
fascinating to me as a catalyst

2716
01:53:08,078 --> 01:53:11,490
for increasing our capacity to think

2717
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:14,950
collectively transcending just the

2718
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:17,702
verbal domain and bringing in other

2719
01:53:17,756 --> 01:53:21,366
sensory modalities aligned with the word

2720
01:53:21,468 --> 01:53:22,614
I. Dean that's the funny thing about

2721
01:53:22,652 --> 01:53:24,214
these LLMs, right? Like, they're large

2722
01:53:24,252 --> 01:53:26,746
language models. And language can act as

2723
01:53:26,768 --> 01:53:30,854
that fabric, as that language,

2724
01:53:30,902 --> 01:53:33,146
as the neural network itself, as the

2725
01:53:33,168 --> 01:53:35,434
computational network between these

2726
01:53:35,472 --> 01:53:38,090
other sensory apparatus, and the ability

2727
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:42,478
to produce artifacts that bring people

2728
01:53:42,564 --> 01:53:45,326
into forms of alignment or

2729
01:53:45,348 --> 01:53:46,926
phenomenological resonance that just

2730
01:53:46,948 --> 01:53:50,160
would not have otherwise existed. Now,

2731
01:53:51,810 --> 01:53:53,358
there are potential downsides to this as

2732
01:53:53,364 --> 01:53:55,394
well, just like anything. But I'm very

2733
01:53:55,432 --> 01:53:57,314
excited about that because I look at,

2734
01:53:57,352 --> 01:53:58,974
you know, the all of the art that I've

2735
01:53:59,022 --> 01:54:02,210
seen, this new generative artwork,

2736
01:54:02,630 --> 01:54:04,034
it is, like, you know, very much

2737
01:54:04,072 --> 01:54:05,506
informational, fireworks. Right? People

2738
01:54:05,528 --> 01:54:07,586
are able to take five ideas that they

2739
01:54:07,608 --> 01:54:09,038
heard today. You could go, you know,

2740
01:54:09,064 --> 01:54:10,518
based on this podcast, you could

2741
01:54:10,524 --> 01:54:12,498
basically say, like, take any subsection

2742
01:54:12,514 --> 01:54:13,986
of that, produce a series of generative

2743
01:54:14,018 --> 01:54:15,846
artworks, and then associate that

2744
01:54:15,868 --> 01:54:19,450
lineage or series of generative art

2745
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:22,902
with this as a network, a visual network

2746
01:54:22,966 --> 01:54:25,946
that could be a dynamic placeholder that

2747
01:54:25,968 --> 01:54:28,790
could attract attention automatically

2748
01:54:28,950 --> 01:54:30,586
from the potential network that

2749
01:54:30,608 --> 01:54:32,554
resonates with that artwork. Right. And

2750
01:54:32,592 --> 01:54:34,474
tap into the latent space of this

2751
01:54:34,512 --> 01:54:36,474
conversation that none of us hold

2752
01:54:36,512 --> 01:54:38,506
explicitly in our heads, but we're all

2753
01:54:38,528 --> 01:54:39,866
pointing to it based on our words and

2754
01:54:39,888 --> 01:54:40,930
our conversations and the kind of things

2755
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,146
we're trying to talk about here. Like,

2756
01:54:42,168 --> 01:54:44,210
there is a latent space representation

2757
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:47,218
possible. So, yeah, I think we're in

2758
01:54:47,224 --> 01:54:48,754
fascinating times for that and using

2759
01:54:48,792 --> 01:54:50,146
that as a tool constructively and

2760
01:54:50,168 --> 01:54:52,882
wisely. I'm looking forward to seeing

2761
01:54:52,936 --> 01:54:56,146
that part of this unfold. Thank you,

2762
01:54:56,168 --> 01:54:59,234
Matthew. Thank you to Jordan. Till next

2763
01:54:59,272 --> 01:55:01,790
time. Thanks, Al. Always a pleasure.
