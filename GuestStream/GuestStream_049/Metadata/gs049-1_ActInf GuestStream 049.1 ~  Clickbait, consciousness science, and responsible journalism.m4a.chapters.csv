4740	64632	00:04	Megan Peters and Nora Bradford will present followed by a discussion on clickbait consciousness science and responsible journalism. This is in response to the way the media has been covering consciousness science just in the past few weeks.	Megan Peters and Nora Bradford talk about clickbait consciousness science	Conscious Science: Clickbait and Responsible Journalism
64766	593584	01:04	The field of consciousness science borders on the religious and spiritual in many ways. It's really straddling the border between the natural sciences and philosophy and spirituality. The field has an uphill battle when it comes to potential misrepresentation in the media.	Christoph Coke: Consciousness science has been misrepresented in the media	The misrepresentation of consciousness science
593632	1054420	09:53	Science says neither idea lost, remember? Or rather both of them lost. And so why would science say that one of them is even losing? There's no discussion in these articles beyond a trivial passing mention that there are any other theories out there at all. Scientists have an uphill battle to legitimize their research.	The Economist article says one theory lost, but neither idea lost	The Battle for the Nature of Consciousness
1054490	1178990	17:34	The challenges with communicating the crux of this question and in doing the science itself makes the people who are doing this pretty brave, especially the younger trainees. Please come join us. There's a lot of people doing some really cool stuff, really amazing, mind blowing stuff.	Daniel Martin: Challenges in communicating consciousness science make some scientists brave	A talk on Consciousness Science
1184640	1436130	19:44	Laura: It was really exciting to see consciousness science kind of being celebrated in the way that it was. Nora: The interpretations are really nuanced, they're really difficult to get right. Laura: The ethical stakes, the moral implications of this field are just staggering.	Laura: Conscious science is a harder journalist to cover than other fields	Why Conscious Science is a Harder Journal to Cover
1436580	2198470	23:56	 consciousness science spans all the way from wakefulness versus coma or locked in syndrome or traumatic brain injury. A scientific understanding of X is what shapes evidence driven policy about X. The big one is falsifiability and that's any student of science going back to grade.	St'm'm: Consciousness science spans all the way from wakefulness	Understanding the science of consciousness
2200040	2306064	36:40	It's like an itch that some can't scratch with this inscrutable and ineffable nature that does verge into the mystical. So what do we do with the huge mystery that makes it a training and exhibition field? How do you have a multidecade conversation with potentially non compatible theorizing?	Training and exhibition theory integrates across disciplines and goes beyond academia	The mystery of neuroscience
2306112	2777816	38:26	There is a growing understanding that information processing capacity and intelligence are not the same thing as internal phenomenal experience. The tests that we have are woefully inadequate and, as you said, are locked to particular implementations. We need to get a better handle on artificial intelligence.	Joshua Beng: The current tests for consciousness are woefully inadequate	What is the 3-Step Test for Consciousness?
2778008	3181196	46:18	A lot of data science feels pretty inaccessible to the general public. Finding ways to communicate what you do and how you're conducting your work is helpful. Don't be scared to email journalists if you see that something's inaccurate.	Daniel Low: Finding ways to communicate data science to different audiences is helpful	Questions about communication in the scientific community
3181388	3509194	53:01	Megan and Nora: What are some exciting areas that you'd like to see unfolding in the coming months and years? Megan: Consciousness science might be the leading edge of how interdisciplinary science and metascience needs to be done going forward. Nora: I hope journalists don't get scared of covering conscious of science.	Megan Love: Getting consciousness science right is a priority for me	Conversation on Conscious Science
