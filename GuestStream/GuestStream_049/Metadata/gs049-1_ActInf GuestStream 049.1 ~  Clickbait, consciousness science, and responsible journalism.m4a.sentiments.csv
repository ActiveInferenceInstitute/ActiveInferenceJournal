4740	5290	A	0.546256959438324	You.
7260	8456	B	0.872096598148346	Hello and welcome.
8558	11192	B	0.8601300120353699	It's July 26, 2023.
11246	19124	B	0.8579440712928772	We're here in active inference Livestream 49.1 with Megan Peters and Nora Bradford.
19172	21172	B	0.9761011004447937	So thank you both for joining.
21236	30332	B	0.8853045701980591	We're looking forward to a presentation followed by a discussion on clickbait consciousness science and responsible journalism.
30476	32290	B	0.8483380079269409	So, Megan, to you.
32820	33472	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
33526	35504	A	0.9798667430877686	And thanks so much, Daniel, for having us.
35542	38272	A	0.9876798391342163	We're really happy to be here and to chat about this.
38326	43170	A	0.9481725692749023	So I'll talk for a little over ten minutes and then we'll hopefully have a nice discussion here.
43540	52404	A	0.973520040512085	So, yeah, we're really happy to be here because I think that this is a really topical thing for us to be talking about right now.
52442	53732	A	0.6798421740531921	It's very in the media.
53866	60490	A	0.750329852104187	It's really in response to the way the media has been covering consciousness science just in the past few weeks.
60860	62504	A	0.5792620778083801	So here we go.
62542	64632	A	0.805006206035614	I'll have a few things to share with you.
64766	70860	A	0.8579281568527222	Okay, so since we're talking about consciousness science, let's start with a provocative question.
71010	72540	A	0.7739404439926147	So you are conscious.
72880	74430	A	0.5696468949317932	How is this possible?
75280	80476	A	0.7584352493286133	How is it possible that your brain creates the conscious experience of you?
80658	84912	A	0.6188446283340454	And so this is a captivating, and it's a stimulating kind of crazy question.
84966	86690	A	0.6590439081192017	It's a really huge question.
87060	90912	A	0.6836685538291931	It borders on the religious and spiritual in many ways.
90966	94100	A	0.6601024270057678	It borders on the cutting edge of physics in many ways.
94250	107800	A	0.6788981556892395	And so the study of this question and the field of consciousness science more generally, it's really straddling the border between the natural sciences and philosophy and spirituality in a way that a lot of other domains maybe don't need to do.
107950	126584	A	0.6277765035629272	And so, as a result, this field of consciousness science, it really captures the hearts and minds and sometimes pretty wild imaginations of all sorts of folks, as I said, from psychologists and biologists and neuroscientists all the way to computer scientists and engineers to religious and spiritual leaders.
126712	135968	A	0.8118507862091064	Basically anybody who wonders about our origins or place in the universe, why that we know that we are here, why there is something that it is like to be us.
136134	141952	A	0.5860974788665771	They are the people who are interested in this question, and that's probably a lot of people who are listening and watching right now.
142086	149430	A	0.6071639060974121	So it's actually really quite easy, I think, to get swept up in the sensational nature of this question.
149880	152084	A	0.5578196048736572	Consciousness science is a really big deal.
152122	155910	A	0.6408265829086304	It touches on so many aspects of our everyday experience.
156760	163300	A	0.6413154006004333	And so this kind of leads us to another version of this question, which is, is this even really science?
163380	166164	A	0.6924580335617065	Is this something that can be even studied scientifically?
166212	169728	A	0.869994044303894	Or does it transcend beyond scientific inquiry?
169924	174264	A	0.8602930903434753	Do consciousness scientists do something that can be characterized really as science?
174312	184764	A	0.8286775946617126	Or maybe they're studying something that's a little bit more on the border, like, I don't know, telepathy or panpsychism, like maybe rocks and trees are also conscious.
184812	186576	A	0.5156928300857544	Wouldn't that be crazy?
186758	190700	A	0.8565079569816589	Or maybe the vibrations of the mean that the universe is conscious.
190780	197060	A	0.5837934017181396	So it kind of quickly starts to feel a little fuzzy, a little less scientific.
198280	207370	A	0.5277886390686035	And that's what I want to talk about today, is that perception and how that is kind of exacerbated by the way that this field is portrayed in the media and maybe what we can do about it.
208300	208808	A	0.7123861312866211	Okay?
208894	219688	A	0.7134774327278137	And so all this means that consciousness science is really difficult, not just to do scientifically, and it is really difficult, I promise you, but it's also really difficult from a social perspective.
219784	240800	A	0.6691243052482605	So more than for some other fields, those of us who do consciousness science and who study this scientifically, we have a really crucial and difficult responsibility, which is to accurately and precisely communicate the state of our field and its methods and its discoveries and how it relates to other fields, from physics to medicine and beyond.
241140	247750	A	0.6935096383094788	And it's in fact, so difficult that our field has actually written a number of papers about just how difficult it is.
248120	255210	A	0.6879950165748596	So this is a fairly recent paper TS colleagues, including many others.
255820	257688	A	0.8278151154518127	This is just from a few years ago.
257854	273676	A	0.6672139167785645	And these papers, and this one in particular, really highlight why our field in specific has kind of an uphill battle compared to a lot of other areas of study, especially when it comes to potential misrepresentation in the media.
273858	285820	A	0.7603645920753479	So I thought that maybe in order to drive this point home, I could actually give you some examples of how consciousness science has been misrepresented in the media so that we can get a handle on this, we can see it concretely.
285980	303028	A	0.7544081211090088	And as I'm giving you some of these examples, I want you to try to imagine how it would sound if the same kinds of statements, the same kind of sweeping claims were made about discoveries in biology or chemistry, neuroscience, climate science, engineering, that kind of thing.
303114	305024	A	0.7354187369346619	All right, let's do some examples.
305072	306100	A	0.7758647799491882	Here is the first one.
306170	309816	A	0.5980761647224426	Okay, this is an example which is actually 13 years old at this point.
309998	314680	A	0.4512459933757782	As I think you'll see, maybe it hasn't gotten so much better over the past 13 years.
314830	325416	A	0.9090842604637146	But in this example, the title Sizing of Consciousness by its bits, we have Christoph Coke, who is an expert on consciousness science at Caltech, being quoted as saying, I love his ideas.
325528	328520	A	0.8306365013122559	It's the only real promising fundamental theory.
328600	346292	A	0.5143187046051025	And here, deciding to present just this one scientist's opinion as fact without challenging it at all, without presenting any other opinions at all, I'll point out that this opinion was actually not representative of the consensus in the field at that time.
346346	352470	A	0.49433955550193787	It was this one scientist's point of view, and it's not actually representative of the consensus in the field now either.
352840	359140	A	0.5307831168174744	And so I want you to take this quote, but I want you to replace consciousness with curing cancer.
359300	370056	A	0.5631468296051025	So this opinion presented as fact is akin to writing that one scientist theory about a cure for cancer is the only really promising fundamental theory for curing cancer.
370248	377980	A	0.7360158562660217	And without presenting any other possibilities that maybe more work needs to be done or more experiments need to be run.
378130	379784	A	0.6787828803062439	This is really hyperbolic.
379832	390290	A	0.47711464762687683	And it seems like maybe this kind of hyperbole would be hopefully at least a little less likely to happen in biomedicine, or at least would receive more pushback if it were presented this way.
391140	395104	A	0.7982609868049622	So here's another example, and this one's a bit more recent.
395152	397460	A	0.8705695271492004	So this one's from 2018.
399880	407430	A	0.5870354771614075	The Is.
410360	418116	A	0.8592987060546875	Okay, so the electrical activity that moves across neurons is sought by some scientists to contribute to human consciousness.
418228	420584	A	0.5427863001823425	This is like a perfectly reasonable statement, right?
420622	422340	A	0.888850748538971	Like totally fine, totally legit.
422420	433280	A	0.6352108120918274	But then the the journalist goes on to say, if electrical activity is being disrupted by anesthetic and plants too, causing them to lose consciousness, does that mean in some way that they are conscious?
434580	438348	A	0.7953641414642334	Okay, so first of all, these statements are pretty vague.
438524	441664	A	0.5294174551963806	That's not really super surprising from a popular science piece.
441702	461476	A	0.6382200717926025	And it's not really the primary problem here, saying that electricity that moves across neurons thought to from disruption of electrical activity to plants being conscious.
461668	464404	A	0.8954312801361084	And this is pretty sensational, kind of to the extreme.
464452	472156	A	0.5154555439949036	And it makes this fuzzy border between consciousness science and pseudoscience, which is this border that we are trying so hard to delete all the time.
472338	473992	A	0.4979812204837799	It makes it even fuzzier.
474056	477704	A	0.7960590720176697	It gives us an even harder problem to fight against as consciousness.
477832	481052	A	0.5362143516540527	And this isn't just happening 13 years ago, five years ago.
481106	484270	A	0.7258351445198059	It's still why we're talking.
485360	494624	A	0.878351092338562	Just last month, there was this project which was held in conjunction with the association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness annual meeting, which was in New York City.
494742	509450	A	0.8844757080078125	And at this public event, Christophe Coke, who you can see here on the right, and Dave Chalmers here's on the left, they presented their 25 year old bet about whether the neural correlates of consciousness, the ones that go up and down with consciousness goes up and down, would be found.
511820	524808	A	0.6030412912368774	And during this public event, some new results were unveiled for the very first time from one of the ongoing projects, which was designed to challenge two of the many theories about how consciousness arises in the brain.
524904	530872	A	0.8800984025001526	And those two theories are called the global neuronal workspace theory and the integrated information theory.
531016	537916	A	0.7846137285232544	And the hot off the press results that were shown in this event, they actually ended up challenging both theories.
538028	546692	A	0.5153056979179382	They showed that the neural correlates of consciousness are still unknown, that neither theory was really strongly supported by the data that were collected, and so on.
546826	548740	A	0.5604593753814697	But that's not the story.
548810	549504	A	0.9563807845115662	That's not exciting.
549552	551556	A	0.574805736541748	And so that's not the story that the press told.
551658	554230	A	0.5066471099853516	And so here is what the media actually said.
554680	557800	A	0.8114102482795715	Okay, so first we're going to start with Nature.
558460	562116	A	0.7594342827796936	Nature, the journalism side of this flagship scientific journal.
562148	577720	A	0.5437040328979492	You'd hope that they would be pretty careful about their scientific journalism, but instead they write taglines like this, like Christophe Wagered Dave, 25 years ago that researchers would learn how the brain achieves consciousness by now, but the quest continues.
577800	579968	A	0.4957621991634369	But this is actually not what the bet was about.
580054	586716	A	0.6615537405014038	The bet was about the neural correlates, not the causal mechanisms, not the generative production of consciousness.
586828	591584	A	0.6368553638458252	And remember as good are not the same thing.
591702	593584	A	0.759040117263794	And there's always a relevant Xkcd.
593632	598592	A	0.9097850918769836	And so I direct you to this one here, but it gets worse.
598656	602150	A	0.8381085991859436	So here's what science had to say.
602760	607204	A	0.4968242943286896	Advocates of the losing idea are not conceding yet.
607402	610280	A	0.6859966516494751	So again, neither idea lost, remember?
610350	611684	A	0.7859108448028564	Or rather both of them lost.
611732	612664	A	0.5920901894569397	Neither one of them won.
612702	613204	A	0.6428003311157227	Nobody lost.
613252	614088	A	0.5430725812911987	Nobody won.
614254	617796	A	0.5725258588790894	And so why would science say that one of them lost or is even losing?
617828	619464	A	0.8394762873649597	That seems a little over the top.
619582	622936	A	0.6410915851593018	And so it kind of makes you wonder, are they like trying to drive clicks?
622968	626408	A	0.5700411200523376	Or what is the point here of sensationalizing quite to this degree?
626504	628300	A	0.868359386920929	It seems like a bad idea.
628370	633760	A	0.8093655705451965	It seems like oversimplification that actually changes the meaning of what was presented.
634260	635472	A	0.667361319065094	So here's another example.
635526	637200	A	0.8452534675598145	This is from the economist.
638180	643568	A	0.9251248240470886	This article largely reported on a different event that was actually part of the ASSC like primary meeting.
643664	649344	A	0.5555546879768372	But it still capitalized on the buzz that this public event, this evening event created.
649472	654964	A	0.8804156184196472	And it opens with this really kind of terrible twist of the actual experimental design.
655082	666836	A	0.8599107265472412	So The Economist article says top of the bill was the announcement of the result of a so called adversarial collaboration between proponents of two hypotheses about the nature of consciousness.
666948	668216	A	0.6429733633995056	Again, not what the bet was about.
668238	669696	A	0.754227340221405	It wasn't about the nature of consciousness.
669748	677884	A	0.8594650030136108	But anyway, this involved running a series of experiments begun in 2020 to determine which, if either of them is correct.
678082	681340	A	0.610069751739502	But again, that's not what the collaboration was designed to do, right?
681410	684176	A	0.48393306136131287	In science, you can never prove anything.
684358	686016	A	0.5990300178527832	You can never show you're correct.
686118	689984	A	0.6334922313690186	You can only show that you are not wrong or that you are wrong.
690102	690704	A	0.532121479511261	That's it.
690742	692480	A	0.7308144569396973	That's what you get in science.
693560	694310	A	0.7123861312866211	Okay?
695160	715124	A	0.6353627443313599	So moreover, all of these articles, the three that I've shown you and a number of others, they also contained essentially no discussion of whether these two theories global Neuronal Workspace Theory and Integrated Information Theory, one of which was losing, apparently, whether they were the only ones worth considering.
715252	719192	A	0.7335987091064453	So the articles didn't really discuss anything else, any other possible theories.
719336	723740	A	0.7003346085548401	In fact, the articles called these two theories leading by the media.
723810	730636	A	0.7325147390365601	But the truth is that they're leading only in number of publications, not in amount of scientific evidence supporting them.
730658	732880	A	0.7408269643783569	They just have a lot of publications out there.
733030	740896	A	0.5921384692192078	There's no discussion in these articles beyond a trivial passing mention that there are any other theories out there at all.
740998	745776	A	0.7790467143058777	And especially that whether they are viable or not, whether they're empirically supported.
745808	746804	A	0.781829833984375	So here's some.
746922	750980	A	0.6772810816764832	This isn't all of the empirically supported theories of consciousness out there.
751050	758376	A	0.9687791466712952	There's a really nice article here by Anil Seth and Tim Bain that came out last year that discusses a bunch of these.
758478	767380	A	0.9416024088859558	And there's a really nice article here by this group also saying they actually looked at the empirical support for different theories of consciousness.
767540	771848	A	0.8537331819534302	How many papers are out there that actually challenge versus support each theory?
772024	779804	A	0.8281912803649902	And so this landscape is the one that should be the one to evaluate all of the results that were presented at this event.
779922	788812	A	0.7497044205665588	In it means that even if one of the two theories that this one project was looking at, if one of them didn't make the cut, that doesn't mean the other one wins.
788956	789904	A	0.5558997392654419	And is right.
790022	792784	A	0.7713925242424011	It just means that one of them maybe lost.
792832	794550	A	0.6439936757087708	And it didn't even lose, remember?
795080	795748	A	0.6823089718818665	In fact.
795834	813636	A	0.6207417249679565	So in addition to these really nice papers, there's also a whole series of these adversarial collaborations from the same funding agency as the one that was shown in this public event that are designed to actually pit these theories against each other in a pairwise fashion, in a Thunderdome style.
813668	817092	A	0.9570404887199402	For all you Mad Max fans out there, I love old school Sci-Fi.
817236	821272	A	0.8586595058441162	And the idea here is that two theories enter and one theory leaves.
821416	825836	A	0.6560235023498535	One theory survives, but it doesn't win because there's another round coming.
826018	830664	A	0.7077293395996094	And so all of these nuances, they were just unfortunately missing from all the news coverage.
830712	841660	A	0.4841371178627014	And I understand that news likes to get people to read it and it likes to be sensational, but the missing aspect of the missing nuance really changes the meaning of what was presented.
841740	844370	A	0.9030857086181641	And that's actually a really big problem here.
844900	847220	A	0.7215080857276917	And why is this such a problem, you might ask?
847290	849556	A	0.7005996704101562	I'm getting myself all worked up here, right?
849738	861208	A	0.6127502918243408	So the answer to why I'm getting all worked up really comes back to what I presented in the beginning, which is that we consciousness scientists have this uphill battle we constantly have to fight to legitimize our research program.
861374	864520	A	0.7265644073486328	And importantly, this isn't just in the eyes of the public.
864590	870456	A	0.5198147296905518	So it's not just in the eyes of the people reading these articles who are not part of this scientific sphere.
870568	879256	A	0.759209156036377	It's also in the eyes of the scientific community, more generally, of our funding agencies, and maybe most importantly, our close peers within adjacent fields.
879368	890400	A	0.7335041165351868	So imagine for a second that you are on a hiring committee at a university and you read a candidate's description of their research program and it is about consciousness science.
890820	897280	A	0.816597580909729	They have pages and pages and several publications, and they maybe have a grant that's about consciousness science.
897440	905780	A	0.7094432711601257	But you, as the member of the hiring committee, just read this, this New York Times article about how plants probably have consciousness.
906280	915444	A	0.804690957069397	And so maybe your eyes are now rolling out of your head because you've been primed to think this isn't real, this is sensational, this isn't something that can be studied scientifically.
915572	918884	A	0.7570894360542297	You might as well be talking about doing research on telepathy.
918932	920990	A	0.6790674328804016	Is this really a colleague that you want?
921440	922700	A	0.667361319065094	So here's another example.
922770	938256	A	0.5502939820289612	What if you're on a grant review committee or you're reviewing a paper and you just read these articles in Science and in Nature that heavily imply that there are only two real theories of consciousness that have any empirical support.
938438	943780	A	0.5700250267982483	But the paper or grant that you're reviewing is not targeting either one of these theories.
944760	947110	A	0.6123063564300537	So now maybe you see the problem here.
948360	951760	A	0.9180539846420288	These journalism articles, they're not just infuriating.
951840	955028	A	0.9532907605171204	They're really actively damaging the legitimacy of our field.
955194	965000	A	0.6080362200737	They're cutting us off at the knees in the eyes of our peers in terms of the financial support we can compete for from granting agencies, in terms of where we can publish our science.
965340	968760	A	0.6164657473564148	And by the way, that science is state of the art and cutting edge.
969260	980140	A	0.727303683757782	We have a responsibility, though, as people who are doing this state of the art consciousness science to try to work with the media so that the reporting can be more honest, so we can continue working there as well.
980290	994900	A	0.6738734245300293	This is a two way street in some ways, but we also hope that folks who are listening right now will recognize this pattern the next time you read an article about consciousness science that maybe those sensationalized claims are not exactly a reflection of the state of art in the field.
994970	996528	A	0.7683361172676086	Because here is the truth.
996704	1000208	A	0.697260856628418	This is real consciousness science, modern consciousness science.
1000384	1006516	A	0.854758620262146	It's a collection of basically every single state of the art discipline and method of scientific inquiry that you can think of.
1006618	1017672	A	0.8164668083190918	So my version of consciousness science that I do in my lab is a conglomeration of cognitive sciences and computational neuroscience and a little bit of computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning thrown in.
1017806	1026680	A	0.8573043942451477	We also have heavy influences from philosophy and psychology and engineering and a little bit of metascience, and we have neuroimaging, and we have statistics.
1026760	1035376	A	0.6905116438865662	And this is really a representation of consciousness science, not just in my research group, but the consciousness science being done worldwide by thousands of people.
1035558	1042160	A	0.7253726124763489	Consciousness science is right at the center, right at the heart, the very bleeding edge of our collective scientific understanding.
1042660	1054420	A	0.6631088256835938	So remember when I put this slide up before and I said that the study of this question straddles the border between natural sciences and philosophy in a way that a lot of other domains maybe don't need to do.
1054490	1056624	A	0.6569501161575317	And as a result, it captures our imagination.
1056672	1062170	A	0.743412435054779	It gets out there, it gets into your brain and your mind and sticks there in a way that some other fields might not.
1062540	1077624	A	0.680854320526123	But maybe you can see through what I've talked about today that the challenges with communicating the crux of this question and in doing the science itself, that actually makes the people who are doing this pretty brave, especially the younger trainees.
1077672	1080284	A	0.5146167874336243	When you think about it, they're fighting this real uphill battle.
1080332	1083484	A	0.8309865593910217	So, personally, me, I'm relatively safe.
1083532	1084640	A	0.6104155778884888	I have job security.
1084790	1091010	A	0.5185824036598206	If people don't take me seriously when I say I'm a consciousness scientist, that's their loss, that's fine.
1091700	1106020	A	0.5798842310905457	But the younger people, the trainees in the field, those who are trying to get jobs, those who are trying to push the envelope of what we know about our brains and our minds and our awareness of ourselves in this world, they've got a lot of misperceptions to overcome.
1106600	1115688	A	0.9553421139717102	So if you are excited and you want to know more about the modern, exciting field of consciousness Science, I suggest that you head to the ASFC website.
1115774	1117752	A	0.8751659989356995	You can have a look at the whole science program.
1117886	1121464	A	0.9859800934791565	They've actually posted videos of the keynotes from this year, so that's pretty cool.
1121502	1123150	A	0.8027215003967285	You can go and see some of those.
1123840	1125950	A	0.8222531676292419	You can also check out the plan for the future.
1126880	1131180	A	0.6974780559539795	And of course, if I've inspired you even a little bit to find out about consciousness science yourself.
1131250	1134624	A	0.6444436311721802	Despite my kind of rant here, I say welcome.
1134742	1135776	A	0.7070980072021484	Please come join us.
1135798	1142752	A	0.9795263409614563	There's a lot of people doing some really cool stuff, really amazing, mind blowing stuff, working to figure this out.
1142886	1144032	A	0.6807147264480591	So please come join us.
1144086	1145780	A	0.8982928395271301	Absolutely, the more the merrier.
1146120	1156036	A	0.5428621172904968	And so I think I will stop there and just say if you've enjoyed this talk or anything that I said resonated with you, I've got a real short little piece here.
1156058	1158508	A	0.6646915078163147	It's about 800 words, so not a long homework assignment.
1158544	1160010	A	0.8244052529335022	You can go and check that out.
1160620	1163284	A	0.8801593780517578	So I think I'll stop and pass the mic back to Daniel.
1163332	1177532	A	0.8907554745674133	And also welcome Nora Bradford, who is a doctoral student here at UC Irvine, who works in Consciousness Science, but who also is an accomplished science journalist who's written articles in Scientific American Science News, Discover, and many more.
1177586	1178990	A	0.9462849497795105	So thanks very much.
1184640	1191264	B	0.894916296005249	Laura, maybe to you for a first reflection about what you see there or how you came to be here.
1191462	1192528	C	0.48728978633880615	Yeah, sure.
1192694	1192976	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1192998	1200310	C	0.8290507793426514	So I was at ASC and went to the event that was associated with ASSC, but not run by ASSC, just to be clear.
1201080	1206260	C	0.9832353591918945	And it was really exciting to see consciousness science kind of being celebrated in the way that it was.
1206410	1212052	C	0.8663781881332397	I had some issues with the event, but overall I was very excited that it was getting this public attention.
1212116	1212730	C	0.5664745569229126	Right.
1213180	1221740	C	0.975361704826355	And then afterwards, I was again excited to see that people were writing about my field, because that journalism.
1222240	1230210	C	0.9452521204948425	Things I'm immediately disappointed by wrong.
1231780	1232096	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1232118	1240450	C	0.5746672749519348	And I guess I started to think about kind of why conscious science is maybe a harder journalist to cover.
1240820	1254180	C	0.5341483950614929	And I think there is just probably a lot more controversy and a lot more room for mistakes to be made than perhaps in fields where the research is more clear cut or more easily interpretable.
1255100	1260890	C	0.8139445781707764	So, yeah, I think there's a lot as journalists and also as researchers from this.
1263100	1263944	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1264142	1276236	A	0.6027249097824097	Can I just really quickly follow up and say I think that, Nora, you're spot on by saying that, by presenting the idea that it's the interpretation that's part of the problem here.
1276338	1280460	A	0.7328552007675171	It's not just that people are maybe getting facts wrong when they're writing about this field.
1280530	1295860	A	0.45917418599128723	It's that the interpretations are really nuanced, they're really difficult to get right, and it's really easy for an oversimplification to end up fundamentally changing the meaning in this space in a way that maybe doesn't occur quite as often in some other fields.
1298040	1311012	B	0.9463533759117126	Yeah, that's really interesting to kind of disentangle the features that make this a unique, although also exemplary case of communicating challenging ideas.
1311076	1315960	B	0.7620222568511963	I mean, the first that presents itself to me is just how much is on the table?
1316300	1318192	B	0.5884755849838257	Whose pain matters?
1318276	1322380	B	0.6871367692947388	Whose experiences or what experiences even matter?
1322450	1324380	B	0.8202191591262817	What's the difference between a who and a what?
1324530	1325900	B	0.7636039853096008	This is the real question.
1325970	1330076	B	0.574924647808075	If something doesn't have an experience, then there's no feeling.
1330188	1340544	B	0.6720154881477356	But if something does have an experience, then it's a feeling and it's a morally culpable or something that we're responsible for treating in an ethical way.
1340582	1357364	B	0.7096585035324097	So it's like whether or not it's always brought up in those articles, the stakes are so high, whereas whether a given molecular compound does this molecular interaction is closer to the objective.
1357412	1362120	B	0.6972120404243469	Whereas this is the ultimate subjective question, seemingly.
1363020	1372584	A	0.5617215037345886	Sure, yeah, I agree with you definitely that the ethical stakes, the moral implications of this field are just staggering.
1372712	1384400	A	0.707901120185852	And certainly it's not unique in that way that the ethical and moral implications of sociological research or of climate science or of many other domains also have these staggering implications.
1386100	1402900	A	0.7542540431022644	I think one of the biggest challenges that we have is not just in the interpretation of objective data, but exactly, as you've just said, that this is the ultimate subjectivity, that the thing that we are studying by its definition is not objectively observable.
1403400	1416520	A	0.616264820098877	And that is absolutely something that is at least you can design measurement tools in a way that have different philosophical foundations in basically every other field.
1416590	1424172	A	0.4882449507713318	But by its very nature, by the definition of subjective experience, we cannot design a measurement tool that actually says, what is it like to be you?
1424226	1425710	A	0.9052932262420654	That's kind of the whole problem.
1426480	1436130	A	0.8587332367897034	But your points also about the ethical implications in medicine, the difference between a who and a what.
1436580	1444944	A	0.6447774171829224	I think that that's also really important to bring up, that here we are trying to I've presented this as like we want to understand consciousness.
1444992	1447552	A	0.5991681218147278	And I never really defined consciousness.
1447696	1453510	A	0.8150500059127808	I just said, like, here's consciousness and here's an umbrella term and you take that kind of how you want.
1454040	1463400	A	0.7979263663291931	But it's true that consciousness science spans all the way from wakefulness versus coma or locked in syndrome or traumatic brain injury.
1463820	1468744	A	0.7203911542892456	Anesthesia all the way through to is a baby conscious?
1468792	1470360	A	0.794933021068573	Is a fetus conscious?
1470440	1471544	A	0.8537055253982544	Is an AI conscious?
1471592	1485552	A	0.6974857449531555	Is a cockroach or your dog, or 200 years ago, people might argue that children were less conscious than adults and so it was okay to hit your children because they wouldn't feel it as much or something.
1485686	1493184	A	0.8104596138000488	And so there's a lot of sociological and ethical and moral implication in everything that we're doing.
1493302	1500896	A	0.5069440603256226	Which is why one of the reason I've chosen this field, too, is that it really scratches a lot of intellectual itch.
1500928	1520556	A	0.5777808427810669	But it also feels really important, especially right now, with the rise of machine intelligence and with ongoing debates about animal or fetal consciousness that really bear extreme impact on legislation, on moral decisions that we make as a people.
1520658	1524350	A	0.7707836627960205	So, yeah, it's a big thing that we're doing.
1524800	1527630	A	0.5497066378593445	I'm a little biased, but it is a big thing.
1528480	1542800	C	0.587593674659729	And I would add that even if researchers are sometimes good at explaining what they mean by consciousness in their research, like to a journalist, say, the journalists are not always necessarily great at communicating that to the public through their writing.
1543620	1545412	C	0.5995961427688599	And I get why that would be hard.
1545546	1549108	C	0.9120663404464722	It can be clunky, it can be awkward and unappealing to explain.
1549194	1557480	C	0.8306437134742737	But that is crucial because people readers can take it however they want based on how they're interpreting the word consciousness.
1557820	1561880	C	0.5497039556503296	So I think that's super important to address if you're writing about consciousness.
1564060	1584080	B	0.6623259782791138	Yeah, it's really a field that's kind of a leading indicator because, especially if approached in a scientific way, in our current setting, a scientific understanding of X is what shapes evidence driven policy about X.
1584230	1591804	B	0.8650201559066772	So I guess this leads to what is or would or could be a science driven approach.
1591852	1593972	B	0.7370732426643372	Like, how do we know it when we see it?
1594106	1601830	B	0.9073891639709473	When someone is approaching this question from a scientific perspective, what would each of you say to this?
1603080	1616756	A	0.6362186074256897	Well, I'm going to give kind of the stock answer, which is that you want to have objective measures that are valid and reliable, but the big one is falsifiability and that's any student of science going back to grade.
1616788	1639276	A	0.845331072807312	School is going to learn a little bit about that, which is that if you've got a theory or you've got a hypothesis about how, let's say, the brain generates consciousness, or even going back to just correlates, just like, which bits of the brain are correlated in their activity with whether you're more conscious or less conscious.
1639308	1641520	A	0.7638245224952698	So let's keep it really very basic.
1642660	1644496	A	0.5006372928619385	You need to have it be falsifiable.
1644528	1650820	A	0.608441174030304	You need to say it's this area of the brain that will correlate and not that area of the brain.
1652200	1674444	A	0.6921534538269043	And the recognition that an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence is also really crucial to this idea, which is that just because I failed to measure a correspondence between the activity and the bit of the brain, that I hypothesized and some measure of awareness that I get from self report doesn't mean that that area of the brain isn't doing the work.
1674482	1678140	A	0.9690399765968323	It just means that our machines are terrible or that our measure sucks.
1679040	1699350	A	0.5306487679481506	And honestly, despite the state of the art measurements that we do have, we have millimeter level precision in humans, we have cellular level precision in non human animals, we can record a lot of stuff, and we have a lot of really fancy machine learning algorithms to help us extract what that stuff means.
1700040	1706660	A	0.7591853737831116	To go from super high dimensional noisy data down to something that we can maybe make the argument is interpretable.
1707820	1708724	A	0.6336460113525391	Interpretable.
1708772	1709370	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1710060	1714792	A	0.5844201445579529	But just because you didn't find what you were looking for doesn't mean that it's not there.
1714846	1719690	A	0.7926029562950134	It just means that you were maybe looking in the wrong place or that you were looking using the wrong tool.
1720700	1732832	A	0.7170331478118896	And so these kind of go hand in hand because on the one hand, you want your hypothesis to be falsifiable, so you aren't allowed to just say, oh, well, I just wasn't looking for it the right way, so I'm just going to revise how I'm looking and try again.
1732886	1734370	A	0.5031678676605225	And therefore I'm still right.
1734900	1747940	A	0.4856220483779907	You need to design your experiments and your theories such that if you find a particular result, a positive result, then it actually disproves your theory as opposed to just failing to provide support for your theory.
1749160	1764360	A	0.849982738494873	So I think that those and other kind of standard criteria that you might find in any Stem classroom that demonstrate the scientific method, those are probably the definitions that I would fall back on.
1764430	1773340	A	0.6238052248954773	And I think that consciousness and science, broadly speaking, the stuff that is present at the ASC, it does all of that, it absolutely does.
1773410	1788416	A	0.7702944278717041	It's the same caliber of computational neuroscience and neuroimaging and psychological psychophysics measurement and logical philosophy approaches that you would find at any other flagship conference in the world.
1788598	1789330	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1791460	1810708	C	0.6408324241638184	And I would say if you're reading an article rather than like a journal paper, like if you're reading something in the press, the way to know if it's trustworthy or not, or one way is if it's making sensational claims, like claiming to have found the root of consciousness or some really large claim.
1810804	1812890	C	0.5490421056747437	It's probably not true.
1813340	1817320	C	0.5537888407707214	I think that wouldn't happen in one study, I'm assuming.
1817680	1828876	C	0.6679664850234985	So just read with a skeptical eye and if you feel comfortable, try to read the primary, like get inspired by the press.
1828978	1835984	C	0.8160191774368286	But if you feel like there's something off, just go to the primary literature and see what's up and see if you can interpret it for yourself.
1836022	1840112	C	0.6490483283996582	It's understandable if you can't, but yeah, that's what I would say.
1840166	1857850	A	0.5524199604988098	That's a good rule of thumb, Nora, that one study is never going to be the answer in any not just ours, but it's easy to get swept away in the sensational claims and to be like, OOH, they found the neural cause of probably.
1858220	1859464	C	0.4935365915298462	Yeah, yeah.
1859502	1861256	C	0.8427014946937561	And I would say like pre registration also.
1861278	1872444	C	0.8382124304771423	I mean, Megan, I don't know what your rule of thumb is for this, but if people, you know, plan for the study and how they're going to analyze it ahead of time, that is usually a really good sign.
1872482	1876364	C	0.7275179028511047	I mean, basically what you're just saying, but just like stamp of we promise we did this.
1876402	1879868	C	0.6998467445373535	Ahead of time kind of thing avoids.
1879884	1883488	A	0.8748731017112732	Harking after the fact, right?
1883654	1905072	B	0.8743208050727844	Yeah, it was kind of cool to see metascience and also maybe kind of bibliographic analyses looking at different trends in literature, but then also going beyond the peer reviewed literature to looking at the real trends that influence people who are outside of the profession.
1905136	1926060	B	0.6452662348747253	And I don't know if canary in the coal mine is the right bird in the right niche here, but it's like proposing unobservables is commonplace in research, like latent cause analysis and any kind of structural equation modeling.
1926400	1935436	B	0.7814080715179443	And here is the tour de force of unobservables, maybe that which is defined as unobservables.
1935468	1951590	B	0.8591424822807312	And so it's actually like a space to bring up all these pieces of epistemic hygiene about from preregistration to the pace and the tone of the scientific community and questions of multidisciplinarity in research.
1954360	1960472	B	0.6318889856338501	And then there's a heart at the intersection of the Venn diagram where it kind of all comes together.
1960526	1964724	B	0.48248401284217834	It's like, well, this synthesis cannot happen without all these pieces.
1964772	1970668	B	0.6012166142463684	If we're not having philosophers in conversation with the statisticians, then this synthesis can't happen.
1970754	1978652	B	0.6912616491317749	Now, maybe the synthesis that you care about doesn't need that, but we care about this and this synthesis requires it.
1978706	1984210	B	0.7999191880226135	So we need to develop the approaches and the communication around that.
1985460	1992550	B	0.7098210453987122	It's really a tip of the spear effort even apart from the consequences of the research.
1994120	1995632	A	0.9566326141357422	What a heartwarming sentiment.
1995696	1997350	A	0.9214180111885071	Thank you for sharing that.
1999480	2005720	A	0.9719475507736206	I love the phrase epistemic hygiene because that is so crucial, I think, to every field.
2005790	2025256	A	0.879035472869873	But it's like particularly aggressively exposed in this field, which is exactly why I think that my science has benefited so powerfully from close collaboration with philosophers and with statisticians.
2025288	2040112	A	0.8030827641487122	I mean, this is kind of the space that I live in here in the cognitive sciences department is we're halfway between AI and philosophy and psychology and neuroscience and engineering and it's kind of at, like where all these things come together.
2040166	2055856	A	0.8075608611106873	But then this metascience thing, I'm happy that you picked up on that because I think that it's also really the bibliometric analyses are really critical and we're at this crazy spot and have been for a long time now.
2055898	2068280	A	0.6510001420974731	But I think it's really coming to a head where the vast majority of our scientific knowledge is not accessible to any one researcher simply because there's so much of it, right?
2068430	2070472	A	0.5178990960121155	You can't read all of the literature.
2070536	2073928	A	0.5903896689414978	You can't even read all the literature that's in your tiny little corner.
2074104	2082056	A	0.7853338718414307	And consciousness science, like many other fields in this way, actually is one of those that brings together a lot of different fields.
2082088	2086796	A	0.6769158840179443	So it makes it even harder for you to keep up with the things that are going to be really relevant.
2086828	2106816	A	0.8050951361656189	I mean, you have to keep up with the cutting edge tools in neuroimaging data analysis, plus the epistemic hygiene that the philosophers are going to bring, plus cutting edge behavioral paradigms and what they mean in naturalistic data collection settings.
2106848	2112968	A	0.7171758413314819	So that you're not just saying, oh, I've discovered something fundamental about consciousness by showing you gabor patches all day?
2113054	2122524	A	0.553420901298523	And I say this as someone who shows people gabor patches all day, but it's a real challenge to bring together all these things.
2122642	2123484	A	0.6001062989234924	And maybe you're right.
2123522	2138848	A	0.774215817451477	Maybe that consciousness science is I don't know about the canary in the cold mine, so to speak, but maybe you're right that it's one of the places where you can really see all these cogs working together to come at one major question.
2138934	2144644	A	0.4950653910636902	Or maybe you don't quite see the need for that hygiene in some other fields, yet it still is.
2144682	2151904	A	0.817732572555542	There like latent cause analysis is not just something that we do in consciousness science or neuroscience.
2151952	2155236	A	0.7982521057128906	We do it in economics, we do it in sociology.
2155348	2157044	A	0.7602946758270264	We do it, like, everywhere.
2157172	2171980	A	0.5211241245269775	And so having a real handle on how to design stuff that actually asks the questions that you're interested in is something that I find that I have to continuously work hard to keep in my sights.
2173440	2182064	A	0.46366649866104126	And I'm lucky that we've got a pile of philosophers that we get to hang out with who blow into your talk and say everything that you just said is wrong.
2182102	2182704	A	0.6384323835372925	And here's why.
2182742	2184624	A	0.49194276332855225	Here's this logical hole in what you've done.
2184662	2185616	A	0.6430258750915527	And they're right.
2185798	2188530	A	0.9600504636764526	And it's great because it makes the science better.
2191300	2197376	A	0.6896361112594604	And you don't typically get philosophers blowing into a talk in a lot of other fields.
2197408	2198470	A	0.5604589581489563	It doesn't happen.
2200040	2201750	A	0.651940643787384	And I think it should.
2203400	2208250	B	0.8088589906692505	We all have that inroad to our experience.
2209100	2233250	B	0.5838549137115479	So it's something that integrates across disciplines, kind of even cast the disciplinary organizational paradigm into at least critical light and then goes even outside of academia because these are what people search engine for and language model, discuss.
2233940	2236530	B	0.7082641124725342	And I think it is one of these.
2237060	2247300	B	0.5318220853805542	It's like an itch that some can't scratch with this inscrutable and ineffable nature that does verge into the mystical.
2248120	2259690	B	0.7032128572463989	So what do we do with the huge mystery that makes it a training and exhibition field?
2261500	2277980	B	0.4939068555831909	Again, that's not just important, but is kind of the archetype of how do you have a multidecade conversation with potentially non compatible theorizing?
2278560	2301248	B	0.6892269253730774	Whereas in many of the physical sciences, including physical or reductionist perspectives on neuroscience, threads open and close, little bit quicker, little bit easier, tend to not delve into ancient history, tend to not need to invoke world knowledge traditions.
2301424	2304756	B	0.844113826751709	So that makes it fun.
2304858	2306064	B	0.9029676914215088	It makes it fun and useful.
2306112	2311000	B	0.5564488768577576	And if something's fun and useful, what secret third thing are we looking for exactly?
2311150	2316970	A	0.6821708083152771	Sounds like if you weren't already a consciousness scientist, maybe we've converted you a little bit.
2318960	2320856	B	0.6820618510246277	As only a bug doctor.
2321048	2335680	B	0.7724596261978149	I did one work on the Ant colony and definitions of consciousness, and we didn't come down on the issue of whether the nest mates are conscious under what definition or the colony.
2336500	2346132	B	0.8274040818214417	But more pointed out, well, if you define it according to some mammalian neuroanatomy, then you kind of already know what the answer is going to be.
2346186	2347332	B	0.47781825065612793	It's going to be no.
2347466	2356616	B	0.8878228068351746	And if you define it according to a specific primate centered symbolic communication approach, again, you know what that's going to be?
2356638	2357400	C	0.5284216403961182	It's no.
2357550	2365496	B	0.8104819655418396	If you define it based upon some generic informational property, then you already know what it's going to be.
2365518	2367408	B	0.8436573147773743	It's going to be on that continuum.
2367604	2386640	B	0.742592453956604	And so we kind of tried to flip the approach by instead of asking which feature would help us differentiate whether the ant colony is conscious or not, we just said, let's just look at what the features that people are using and then ask whether colony is.
2386710	2392604	B	0.5389034152030945	But we don't have the 1 meter metal bar for consciousness.
2392652	2396592	B	0.8645012378692627	So again, it's like, well, let's say seven out of ten that we observed.
2396656	2399428	B	0.6276756525039673	We don't know how many other unproposed theories there are.
2399514	2403940	B	0.5091714859008789	So seven out of ten could be total sampling bias.
2404860	2410810	B	0.6741477251052856	Even if it was ten out of ten, then what would that type of consensus really mean?
2412860	2416970	B	0.8122309446334839	And that's where our road took us.
2417680	2424540	B	0.7759204506874084	And I saw that conclusion as like, a chance to broaden the discussion.
2426800	2432288	B	0.8000229597091675	But discussions are not only about broadening, because there's real decisions that are being made.
2432374	2435520	B	0.7078812122344971	So it can't only be yes.
2435590	2443568	B	0.5681734085083008	And and I think that when you connect it back to falsification and all of these other properties, that's where we get the winnowing.
2443744	2462760	B	0.591071605682373	But it's those two complementary conversations, like the broader inclusion of perspectives that expands the space that we can comprehend and then the diligence that also shrinks it back down and somehow will zigzag to better and better understandings.
2467420	2484960	A	0.6484430432319641	You your point about we don't have a yardstick, we don't have a metal rod, right, that know how conscious I mean, like, according to some folks, we have that metal rod, and we've surpassed that with, for example, large language models.
2487460	2496544	A	0.8259061574935913	And we're not just talking particular Google engineers who decide to get really excited about how their pet language model is conscious.
2496592	2520572	A	0.7617144584655762	We're talking any kind of reasonable interpretation of the old school Turing test would be passed by existing language models right now, in fact, arguably, it might have been passed long ago with Eliza in, like, the if it wasn't passed with Eliza, then certainly it has been passed now.
2520626	2542476	A	0.7181723713874817	But I think that there is a growing understanding that information processing capacity and intelligence are not the same thing as internal phenomenal experience, and that the tests that we have, to the extent that we have any tests at all, are woefully inadequate and, as you said, are locked to particular implementations.
2542588	2555268	A	0.6005773544311523	So you can't apply the mammalian test for consciousness, like, oh, I'm looking for this particular neural signature, which tells me whether the monkey is anesthetized or not, and I can't apply that to ants and expect it to work.
2555434	2557656	A	0.6308465003967285	It's not going to tell me anything useful there.
2557758	2561064	A	0.7009202837944031	Can't necessarily apply it to octopuses either for the record.
2561182	2563172	A	0.5108292102813721	So we're not even going insects.
2563316	2580212	A	0.6137558221817017	We're going other arguably incredibly intelligent beings that can open jars and be sneaky and do all sorts of cool stuff and that have complex social interactions and are basically aliens.
2580296	2585776	A	0.7734060287475586	This is my professional scientific opinion here, but they basically are, right?
2585798	2588736	A	0.4801085293292999	Like, they're so fundamentally, physically different from us.
2588918	2597110	A	0.6110771298408508	And so any consciousness ometer that we develop for us or that applies in monkeys or even in dogs or cats is not really going to apply there.
2598360	2604950	A	0.7469442486763	And so differentiating tests for intelligence, from tests from inner experience is a really difficult problem.
2605320	2614730	A	0.6210187077522278	And then there's the third problem, which is a test for whether we attribute consciousness to an agent, which, if you saw the movie Ex Machina, is the Garland test.
2616380	2622844	A	0.6921660304069519	So that's do never mind whether it actually has consciousness, do I attribute consciousness to it?
2622962	2627756	A	0.7821704745292664	Because that is going to change how we interact with it and the rights that we ascribe to it and so on.
2627778	2633416	A	0.4897398054599762	And so I think we're well past the point at which we need to get a better handle on this.
2633458	2637452	A	0.8204338550567627	Some of the stuff that I'm working on right now is moving in this direction.
2637516	2640530	A	0.6595419049263	Not just me and a huge group of lots of other people.
2641140	2666570	A	0.48592978715896606	And I think Joshua Bengio gave testimony to Congress, like today about the need for increased regulatory oversight of who has access to so called artificial intelligence models so that we can better understand how their implementation and their interaction with humans might exacerbate biases or cause all sorts of other problems.
2667660	2671404	A	0.8153473138809204	So you can actually go and read his testimony that he gave.
2671602	2673372	A	0.5052189826965332	I don't remember where the link is.
2673506	2674590	A	0.7411121129989624	Go find it.
2674960	2677496	A	0.7578760981559753	But he had a summary and then he linked to the testimony.
2677528	2691040	A	0.6280235052108765	And I think that having folks like Yahshua and other giants in the field speaking out about the need for actually tackling this and this isn't just a philosopher's playground to talk about consciousness.
2692200	2695844	A	0.8171427845954895	This is, as you said, the testing bed for where the rest of science is going.
2695882	2699430	A	0.8035517930984497	And it's also very topical right now.
2702040	2714250	B	0.8246734738349915	So what does that healthy conversation look like in the case of the synthetic intelligences and language models and all of this?
2716540	2737056	B	0.5261381268501282	What does that continuum look like between the actual measures and proxies that we use in research and what memes or themes or words that I guess, by definition aren't popular today, like big data wasn't popular till it was.
2737238	2752150	B	0.8887768387794495	So something like what has to come on the scene and come into the lab, do you think, to support the kind of work and knowledge that either of you would want to see?
2757320	2771210	C	0.5436373949050903	This isn't an answer to your question, but it just reminded me of one thing that we need less of, is people writing about these interactions with AI that are like, my AI told me that it wanted to get married, or like, my AI, whatever.
2772000	2772824	C	0.9328877925872803	It's not useful.
2772872	2773724	C	0.6425395011901855	It's not news.
2773842	2775468	C	0.69111168384552	Stop reporting about it.
2775634	2776556	C	0.7465540170669556	That's all I have to say.
2776578	2776716	A	0.584351658821106	Okay.
2776738	2777816	C	0.7914435267448425	Go ahead, Megan.
2778008	2789968	A	0.7378333210945129	No, I wanted you to take this too, because I think that this question is about communication in a way that you're much more embedded in the science communication space than I am.
2790134	2803028	A	0.9060155749320984	And so for I think one possible way to go about this that maybe you can speak to would be what kinds you're Daniel, you're talking about what do we need to bring into the lab?
2803114	2811028	A	0.8958373069763184	Maybe communication tools is one of those or ways of communicating this science ways of and to different audiences.
2811204	2814040	A	0.8427609205245972	And so maybe, Nora, you've got some ideas.
2814380	2816056	A	0.8830273747444153	You've done so much in this space.
2816158	2831016	C	0.8264973759651184	I don't I mean, I guess what we've been talking about with people who study human consciousness, people who study consciousness and other entities as well, just being clear about what you mean by consciousness.
2831128	2832876	C	0.8072977066040039	Do you mean a subjective experience?
2832978	2836930	C	0.8143582344055176	Do you mean basically is a light on or off?
2837620	2839840	C	0.8488752245903015	Do you mean awake versus asleep?
2841220	2846544	C	0.8656385540962219	Just being really clear about what level you're talking at, I think is really helpful.
2846672	2862490	C	0.5080552697181702	Again, when you're just presenting your research, whether it's on Twitter or you're talking to a journalist, really being clear cut about that so that people can't make kind of extrapolations from your work that your work doesn't cover I don't know what else?
2863420	2866072	C	0.7167707681655884	Yeah, I guess just being willing to also talk about your work.
2866126	2870508	C	0.8039787411689758	I feel like a lot of data science feels pretty inaccessible to the general public.
2870674	2876680	C	0.8209111094474792	So finding ways to communicate what you do and how you're conducting your work is helpful.
2876840	2878350	C	0.694972574710846	Being open about it.
2879360	2882044	A	0.7846464514732361	Yeah, there's a lot of Jargon in our field too.
2882082	2883788	A	0.7601108551025391	In any field, there's Jargon.
2883964	2887644	A	0.5711560845375061	But the oversimplification this is going back to what we talked about at the beginning.
2887692	2899750	A	0.5801851153373718	The oversimplification of jargoning terms in our field seems particularly susceptible to creating a situation where the facts haven't changed, but the interpretation has.
2900760	2906600	A	0.6941642165184021	And so I think it's almost like sensitivity training for anybody who's in this space.
2906670	2913624	A	0.7828959822654724	Like just kind of a tutorial that you can do that's like a two hour click through thing.
2913662	2925550	A	0.6212471127510071	It's like, here are all the ways in which communicating this type of science, due to its nature, is more challenging than you might.
2928160	2939392	A	0.5784067511558533	So my own involvement in a program run by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research has given me a little bit of training in speaking with the media.
2939446	2943430	A	0.5292670726776123	And I would never say that I am an expert in this at all.
2943880	2963492	A	0.9263800978660583	I will only say that it was eye opening and it was very useful in the clarity of language that you are used to using the precision of language that you're used to using in a close scientific sphere versus when you're speaking to a more general audience.
2963556	2969820	A	0.8864564299583435	And when you're speaking to a journalist or with several journalists who are then going to be writing for a more general audience.
2970160	2971976	A	0.7826617956161499	It's a different mindset.
2972008	2973470	A	0.8347367644309998	It's a different way of speaking.
2974080	2978328	A	0.8700925707817078	And even just being aware of that, I think is really useful.
2978424	2980748	A	0.6334869861602783	It's not that one is better than the other.
2980834	2982272	A	0.6114445924758911	It's just that they are very different.
2982326	2994356	A	0.621699333190918	And that when we are training to be scientists, when we're doing a PhD in a field related to this, speaking to the general public is not a skill that gets pressed on.
2994538	2999092	A	0.4983128309249878	It's not a skill that gets part of your professional development training.
2999146	3005892	A	0.796059250831604	Maybe you do like one practice talk somewhere, but it's not typically part of a general training protocol.
3005956	3020852	A	0.9549163579940796	And so speaking to non specialists, speaking to the media, speaking to high school audiences, speaking to your mom at the dinner table, learning how to do this effectively can actually be really valuable and really rewarding and really powerful.
3020996	3023644	A	0.49379318952560425	And again, I would never say that I am an expert at this.
3023682	3024380	A	0.601600170135498	At this point.
3024450	3032130	A	0.6193896532058716	I just like to think that I'm a little better at it than I otherwise would be had I not had it drilled into me how careful I need to be.
3033460	3047356	C	0.588081419467926	I would also say, don't be scared to email journalists if you see that something's inaccurate, know, speak up like Megan has done about kind of how things are portrayed inaccurately.
3047548	3055712	C	0.5134955048561096	Because, yeah, as a like, no one's ever done that to me, but if something was inaccurate, I would want to know and I would want to fix it, like ASAP.
3055776	3058692	C	0.5892437100410461	So don't feel bad about emailing journalists.
3058756	3060984	C	0.8215351104736328	They want their pieces to be accurate as well.
3061022	3065396	C	0.5920515060424805	So that's what I would add, that can add to the conversation.
3065588	3073948	A	0.7539618611335754	It would make me feel a little bad about calling out the pieces that I did in the presentation and the piece of writing that I did too.
3074114	3078350	A	0.9206237196922302	But at the same time, they put this in writing, and this is wrong.
3080960	3084960	A	0.9660129547119141	I don't like making people upset and I don't like making people angry.
3085860	3091120	A	0.7002116441726685	But it's out there in the world, and it's not a million eyeballs, and that's a problem.
3091190	3095104	A	0.7805341482162476	And so we're hoping your viewership is about a million, right, Daniel?
3095152	3097104	A	0.747422456741333	So give or take low millions.
3097152	3098020	B	0.5770192742347717	Low millions.
3099320	3102950	A	0.6954077482223511	So this will cover everybody who read those articles, right?
3105640	3107270	B	0.962542712688446	It's really interesting.
3107740	3116564	B	0.7750663161277771	The field is about awareness of other minds, our own mind, but also awareness of other minds in theory.
3116692	3121420	B	0.8266922235488892	But then in practice, awareness of other minds is communication.
3121760	3128892	B	0.5876595973968506	Because if we say something that it's like, well, I wouldn't be annoyed by that, or I wouldn't be angry with that.
3129026	3135296	B	0.6224537491798401	But you missed the point of communication, which it's not about what you would think about it, it's about who the recipient would be.
3135318	3145156	B	0.8423420190811157	So it's kind of like the theory and the practice of situational awareness about different minds, all of which are different than our own.
3145338	3148964	B	0.633601725101471	Some are potentially radically different than our own.
3149082	3151510	B	0.7884184122085571	Others might be more similar.
3152600	3181196	B	0.6505760550498962	So there's really maybe even a quintessential relationship between consciousness studies and communication studies, which provides a really unique two way street that the world is swerving into that two lane highway with these questions that are grabbing people's.
3181388	3198150	B	0.6307008862495422	Salience, what are your sort of closing thoughts or directions or what are some exciting areas that you'd like to see unfolding in the coming months and years?
3201770	3203160	A	0.7685770988464355	Well, I'll go first.
3204890	3214406	A	0.5881996750831604	Yeah, first of all, I think you're spot on by saying communicating consciousness, science being about knowing about other minds.
3214438	3221294	A	0.80683434009552	I mean, it's like effective communication is theory of mind, and theory of mind may have a lot to do with modeling other minds and modeling your own mind.
3221332	3224254	A	0.5204998254776001	And yes, absolutely, it's all wrapped up.
3224292	3234740	A	0.6197130084037781	So I think for me, getting this right going forward or continuing to work towards getting it right is a priority for me.
3235510	3243798	A	0.5518081784248352	And one of the pieces scientifically that I'm working on that I hope to then communicate effectively when we get it right.
3243964	3268394	A	0.8103672862052917	Or several of the pieces is I have a couple of these really wonderful large collaborative projects where we're working on everything from figuring out how you would actually measure consciousness effectively or what it might even take to measure consciousness effectively in other entities that are not necessarily, like, awake, behaving, healthy, adult human beings all the way.
3268432	3273290	A	0.8674218058586121	To let's actually design some experiments to test several different theories of consciousness.
3273370	3283922	A	0.811379611492157	Let's design new some of what Nora's working on actually, is designing new measurement approaches to say, well, we need to actually have a quantitative handle on the things that we're talking about.
3283976	3286690	A	0.5823405981063843	So this becomes objective, it becomes falsifiable.
3287430	3289070	A	0.8320958614349365	We can do model arbitration.
3289230	3298470	A	0.9501258730888367	So all these things I'm really excited about, but overarching all of those is this idea of going it's all connected, right?
3298540	3326250	A	0.5552398562431335	You talked about how consciousness science might be this leading edge or wavefront of how interdisciplinary science and metascience needs to be done going forward as we become even more theory driven in some of our scientific lines of inquiry than we have been in the past, and more interested in latent variables and causal discovery and so on and so forth.
3326410	3342610	A	0.6736536622047424	And as the science teams get bigger and more complicated and the jobs within those science teams become more specialized and we have more and more need for interdisciplinary collaboration, we're going to have to change how we do team.
3342680	3353990	A	0.668877899646759	Science and how we do credit assignment within team science in a way that I think might end up being kind of incompatible with the nice, siloed, cute departmental structure that we have in our universities.
3354650	3370886	A	0.729142427444458	And so a focus on not just tolerating, but celebrating interdisciplinarity, celebrating team science, doing credit assignment correctly, and saying first author isn't the only thing that matters, that it really matters.
3370918	3377930	A	0.963835597038269	If you wrote this gorgeous software package that facilitated a whole bunch of stuff that's also a meaningful and powerful contribution.
3378090	3381502	A	0.7879737615585327	Even if you didn't get first author on that paper, you still deserve a lot of credit.
3381636	3386866	A	0.781099259853363	So I think that there's a lot of shaking up that we need to do about how we do science going forward.
3386968	3391970	A	0.9136438965797424	And I really like the idea of using consciousness science as a case study.
3392120	3393906	A	0.9807332754135132	I think that's beautiful.
3394088	3403686	A	0.9749880433082581	And thank you very much for making that lovely connection, because it really locks together a lot of the things that I've been thinking about recently as well.
3403788	3406310	A	0.7427482604980469	So there's my parting comments.
3408170	3408582	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3408636	3414506	C	0.6785208582878113	I was also going to bring up these huge projects that you're part of and that other people are part of.
3414528	3418006	C	0.9903559684753418	It's really exciting to see so many people working together in these huge teams.
3418038	3421610	C	0.9429060220718384	I feel like it just makes science so much more efficient and more careful.
3421770	3423120	C	0.9883019328117371	So that's very cool.
3423570	3430110	C	0.6948841214179993	Another thing I'm hoping is that one, that journalists don't get scared of covering conscious of science from this.
3430180	3433790	C	0.6564894318580627	I think we'll learn from our mistakes and we'll move forward.
3433940	3437700	C	0.4806032180786133	I don't think we'll get scared, but I hope that there's more coverage of this field.
3438310	3447542	C	0.5160132050514221	And I also hope that something that I've noticed about science journalism is they really like to just have clear cut findings because that's the simplest thing to communicate to people.
3447676	3456258	C	0.6913686990737915	But I think we can, as a society, learn to be comfortable with the ambiguity a little bit more, especially when it comes to conscious science.
3456354	3459178	C	0.6082804203033447	We might have found something, but we're not sure, and that's okay.
3459264	3460198	C	0.6778964400291443	And that's science.
3460294	3463980	C	0.5024392008781433	It's okay if your headline isn't snappy and clear.
3464510	3470174	C	0.6460113525390625	It's important for it to be clear, but snappy and I guess have one takeaway point.
3470212	3472240	C	0.7223954200744629	It's okay if it doesn't have a takeaway point.
3473330	3475806	C	0.9833670854568481	Yeah, I think that's what I'm excited about.
3475988	3478190	C	0.6814741492271423	New era of science journalism.
3480050	3490370	B	0.6522420048713684	Well, it sounds like bigger teams, bigger community, more theory, more data, more philosophy, more ambiguity.
3491990	3494100	B	0.9737007021903992	It'll be a great time.
3495270	3496942	A	0.7580651044845581	More philosophy, more ambiguity.
3497006	3497442	A	0.9116052389144897	Love it.
3497496	3498100	A	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
3499430	3502450	B	0.9694389700889587	Thank you, Megan and Nora, for joining.
3502790	3505594	B	0.9609994888305664	Always welcome back.
3505752	3507898	B	0.7429341673851013	So till next time.
3508064	3508442	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3508496	3509194	A	0.9793016910552979	Thank you so much.
3509232	3510342	A	0.9800690412521362	This has been really a pleasure.
3510406	3511530	A	0.95237135887146	Thanks for having us.
3511680	3512380	A	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
3513550	3514202	B	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
3514256	3514390	A	0.5137446522712708	Bye.
