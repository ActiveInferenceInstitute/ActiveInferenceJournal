1
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,219
hello and welcome it's July 26th 2023

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,920
we're here in octave inference live

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,180
stream for 9.1 with Megan Peters and

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,699
Nora Bradford so thank you both for

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,859
joining we're looking forward to a

6
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,279
presentation followed by a discussion on

7
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,680
clickbait Consciousness science and

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,880
responsible journalism so back in to you

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,160
thank you and thanks so much Daniel for

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,780
having us we're really happy to be here

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,480
uh and to chat about this so I'll talk

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,160
for a little over 10 minutes and then

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,540
we'll hopefully have a nice discussion

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,800
here

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,540
um so yeah we're really happy to be here

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,800
because I think that this is a really

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,379
topical uh really

18
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,539
um yeah very topical thing for us to be

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,399
talking about right now it's very in the

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,160
media it's really in response to the way

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,660
the media has been covering

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,640
Consciousness science just in the past

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,879
few weeks uh so here here we go I'll

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,220
have a few things to share with you okay

25
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,420
so since we're talking about

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,340
Consciousness science

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,200
um let's start with a provocative

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,780
question so you are conscious

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,299
how is this possible

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,460
how is it possible that your brain

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,700
creates the conscious experience of you

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,979
and so this is a captivating and it's a

33
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,259
stimulating kind of crazy question it's

34
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,979
a really huge question uh borders on the

35
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,200
religious and spiritual in many ways it

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,119
borders on The Cutting Edge of physics

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,460
in many ways and so the study of this

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,900
question and the field of Consciousness

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,479
science more generally it's really

40
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,100
straddling the border between the

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,140
Natural Sciences and philosophy and

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,420
spirituality in a way that a lot of

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,479
other domains maybe don't need to do and

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,820
so as a result this field of

45
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,220
Consciousness science it really captures

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,140
the hearts and and minds and sometimes

47
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,259
pretty wild imaginations of all sorts of

48
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,180
folks as I said from psychologists and

49
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,880
biologists and neuroscientists all the

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,619
way to computer scientists and Engineers

51
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,420
to religious and spiritual leaders

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,880
basically anybody who wonders about our

53
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,459
origins or place in the universe why

54
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,620
that we know that we are here why there

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,720
is something that it is like to be us

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,760
they are the people who are interested

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,620
in this question and that's probably a

58
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,940
lot of people who are listening and

59
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,760
watching right now so it's it's actually

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,520
really quite easy I think to get swept

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,860
up in The Sensational nature of this

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,560
question and Consciousness science is a

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,599
really big deal it touches on so many

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,020
aspects of our everyday experience

65
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,819
um and so this kind of leads us to

66
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,860
another version of this question which

67
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,920
is is this even really science is this

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,480
something that can be even studied

69
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,400
scientifically or does it transcend

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,459
Beyond on scientific inquiry did

71
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,379
Consciousness scientists do something

72
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,060
that can be characterized really as

73
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,800
science or maybe they're studying

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,239
something that's a little bit more on

75
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,519
the border like I don't know telepathy

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,540
or pan psychism like maybe rocks and

77
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,580
trees are also conscious wouldn't that

78
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,700
be crazy or maybe the vibrations of the

79
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,680
use mean that the universe is conscious

80
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,620
so it it kind of quickly starts to feel

81
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,599
a little a little fuzzy a little less

82
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,060
scientific

83
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,920
um and that's what I want to talk about

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,440
today is that perception and how that is

85
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,540
kind of exacerbated by the way that this

86
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,920
field is portrayed in the media and

87
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,080
maybe what we can do about it

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,599
um okay and so all this means that the

89
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,860
conscience and science is really

90
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,440
difficult not just to do scientifically

91
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,319
and it is really difficult I promise you

92
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,819
um but it's also really difficult from a

93
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,159
social perspective so more than than for

94
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,280
some other fields those of us who who do

95
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,080
Consciousness science and who study this

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,879
scientifically we have a really crucial

97
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,340
and difficult responsibility which is to

98
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,799
accurately and precisely communicate the

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,480
state of our field and its methods and

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,760
its discoveries and how it relates to

101
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,040
other fields from physics to medicine

102
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,319
and and Beyond

103
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,780
um and it's in fact so difficult that

104
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,340
our field has actually written a number

105
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,099
of papers about just how difficult it is

106
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,439
so um this is a fairly recent paper

107
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,540
always included in many other

108
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,478
um and this is just from a few years ago

109
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:20,160
and uh these papers and this one in

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,959
particular really highlight why our

111
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,620
field in in uh specific has kind of an

112
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,199
uphill battle compared to a lot of other

113
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,840
areas of study especially when it comes

114
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,240
to potential misrepresentation in the

115
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,820
media so I thought that maybe in order

116
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,259
to drive this point home I could

117
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,360
actually give you some examples of how

118
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,919
subconsciousness science has been

119
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,440
misrepresented in the media so that we

120
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,000
can get a handle on this we can see it

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,940
concretely and as I'm giving you some of

122
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,520
these examples I want you to to try to

123
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,280
imagine how it would sound if the same

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,199
kinds of statements the same kind of

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,060
sweeping claims were made about

126
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,580
discoveries in biology or chemistry

127
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,100
Neuroscience climate science engineering

128
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,380
that kind of thing all right so let's do

129
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,479
some examples here is the first one okay

130
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,740
and this is an example which is actually

131
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,440
13 years old at this point um as well as

132
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,240
I think you'll see maybe it hasn't

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,040
gotten so much better over the past 13

134
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,160
years but in this example the title

135
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,320
sizing of Consciousness by its bits we

136
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,360
have Christoph Coke who is an expert on

137
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
Consciousness science at Caltech being

138
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,919
quoted as saying I love his ideas it's

139
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,139
the only real promising fundamental

140
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,400
Theory and here

141
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,639
is deciding to present just this one

142
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,100
scientist's opinion as fact without

143
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,780
challenging it all without presenting

144
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,360
any other opinions at all I'll point out

145
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,740
that this opinion was actually not

146
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,419
representative of the consensus in the

147
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,160
field at that time it was this one

148
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,259
scientist's point of view and it's not

149
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:50,820
actually representative of the consensus

150
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,759
in the field now either and so I want

151
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,620
you to take this quote but I want you to

152
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,880
replace Consciousness with curing cancer

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,800
so this opinion presented as fact is

154
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,780
akin to writing that one scientist's

155
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,360
theory about a cure for cancer is the

156
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,460
only really promising fundamental theory

157
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,320
for curing cancer

158
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,720
and without presenting any other

159
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
possibilities that that maybe more work

160
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,139
needs to be done or more more

161
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,020
experiments need to be run this is

162
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,639
really hyperbolic and it seems like

163
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,979
maybe this kind of hyperbole would be

164
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,080
hopefully at least a little less likely

165
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,759
to happen in biomedicine or at least

166
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,919
with receive more more pushback if it

167
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,840
were presented this way

168
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,440
so here's another example and this one's

169
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,539
a bit more recent so this one's from um

170
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:37,919
2018.

171
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,698
uh

172
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,620
just

173
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,400
is

174
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,880
okay so the electrical activity that

175
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,919
moves across neurons is thought by some

176
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,300
scientists to contribute to human

177
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,520
consciousness this is like a perfectly

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,139
reasonable statement right like totally

179
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,060
fine totally legit but then the

180
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,280
journalist goes on to say if electrical

181
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,900
activity is being disrupted by

182
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,240
anesthetic and plants two causing them

183
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,759
to lose Consciousness does that mean in

184
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,699
some way that they are conscious

185
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,500
okay so first of all these statements

186
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,440
are are pretty vague um that's not

187
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
really super surprising from a popular

188
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,919
science piece and it's not really the

189
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,780
the primary problem here saying that a

190
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,280
liberty that moves across neurons

191
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,599
thought to

192
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,080
distance

193
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,240
from destruction of electrical activity

194
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,759
to plants being conscious

195
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,800
and this is pretty Sensational kind of

196
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,840
to the extreme and it makes this fuzzy

197
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,580
border between Consciousness science and

198
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,319
pseudoscience which is this border that

199
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,599
we are trying so hard to delay all the

200
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,319
time

201
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,960
it makes it even fuzzier gives us an

202
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,000
even harder problem to fight against as

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,860
Consciousness and it isn't Just

204
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,500
Happening 13 years ago five years ago it

205
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,880
still has like if I were talking

206
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,699
just last uh there was this post which

207
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,620
was held in conjunction with the

208
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,360
association for the scientific study of

209
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,800
Consciousness annual meeting which was

210
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,900
in New York City and at this public

211
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,880
event Christoph Coke who you can see

212
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,379
here on the right and Dave Chalmers

213
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,479
here's on the left they presented their

214
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,759
25 year old bet about whether the neural

215
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
correlates of Consciousness the ones

216
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,180
that go up and down with Consciousness

217
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,180
goes up and down uh would be found

218
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,740
later

219
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,559
and during this public event some new

220
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,419
results were unveiled for the very first

221
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,120
time from one of the ongoing projects

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,399
which was designed to challenge two of

223
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,020
the many theories about how

224
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,240
Consciousness arises in the brain and

225
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,100
those two theories are called the global

226
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,320
neuronal workspace Theory and the

227
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,600
integrated information Theory and the

228
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,220
hot off the press results that were

229
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,160
shown in this event uh they actually

230
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,380
ended up challenging both theories they

231
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,060
showed that the neural correlates of

232
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,100
Consciousness are still unknown that

233
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,600
neither theory was really strongly

234
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,860
supported by the data that were

235
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,519
collected and so on but that's not the

236
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,080
story that's not exciting and so that's

237
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,180
not the story that the Press told and so

238
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,640
here is what the media actually said

239
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,220
okay so first we're going to start with

240
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,420
nature

241
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,880
nature the journalism side of this

242
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,680
Flagship scientific journal you'd hope

243
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,180
that they would be pretty careful about

244
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,279
their scientific journalism but instead

245
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,440
they write taglines like this like

246
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,100
Kristoff wager Dave 25 years ago the

247
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,019
researchers would learn how the brain

248
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,420
achieves Consciousness by now

249
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,459
um but the quest continues but this is

250
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,260
actually not what the BET was about but

251
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,480
that was about the neural correlates not

252
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,000
the causal mechanisms not the generative

253
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,399
production of Consciousness and remember

254
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,560
not the same thing and there's always a

255
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,839
relevant XKCD and so I direct you to

256
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,580
this one here

257
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,580
um but it gets worse so here's what

258
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,880
science science had to say

259
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,820
um Advocates of the losing idea are not

260
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,380
conceding yet

261
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,680
so again neither idea lost remember or

262
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,420
rather both of them lost neither one of

263
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,399
them won nobody lost nobody won

264
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,899
um and so why would science say that one

265
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,420
of them lost or is even losing it seems

266
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,820
a little over the top and so it kind of

267
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,320
makes you wonder are they like trying to

268
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,060
drive clicks or what what is the point

269
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,980
here of sensationalizing quite to this

270
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,860
degree it seems like a bad idea it seems

271
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,420
like oversimplification that actually

272
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,940
changes the meaning of of what was

273
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,380
presented

274
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,180
so here's another example this is from

275
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,339
The Economist

276
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,320
um this article largely reported on a

277
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,580
different event that was actually part

278
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,279
of the assc like primary meeting but it

279
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,560
still capitalized on the the buzz that

280
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,420
this public event this evening event

281
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,620
created

282
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,600
um and it opens with this really kind of

283
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,820
terrible Twist of the actual

284
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,040
experimental design so the economist

285
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,279
article says top of the bill was the

286
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,839
announcement of the result of a

287
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,640
so-called adversarial collaboration

288
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,920
between proponents of two hypotheses

289
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,260
about the nature of Consciousness again

290
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,579
not what the BET was about it wasn't

291
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,019
about the nature of Consciousness but

292
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,279
anyway

293
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,200
um this involved running a series of

294
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,779
experiments begun in 2020 to determine

295
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,360
which if either of them is correct

296
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,100
again that's not what the collaboration

297
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,380
was designed to do right in science you

298
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,200
can never prove anything you can never

299
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
show you're correct you can only show

300
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,640
that you are not wrong or that you are

301
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,800
wrong that's it that's what you get in

302
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,540
science

303
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,040
okay

304
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,360
so

305
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,300
moreover all of these articles the three

306
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,740
that I've shown you and a number of

307
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,300
others

308
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,459
um they also contained essentially no

309
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,560
discussion of whether these two theories

310
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,779
Global neuronal workspace Theory and

311
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,820
integrated information Theory one of

312
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,040
which was losing apparently

313
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,300
um whether they were the only ones worth

314
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,459
considering so the Articles didn't

315
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,200
really discuss anything else any other

316
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,660
possible theories in fact the the

317
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,640
Articles called these two theories

318
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,620
leading by the media but the truth is

319
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,600
that they're leading only in number of

320
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,300
Publications not an amount of scientific

321
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,160
evidence supporting them they just have

322
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,440
a lot of Publications out there there's

323
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
no discussion in these articles Beyond a

324
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,140
trivial passing mention that there are

325
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,300
any other theories out there at all and

326
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,459
especially that they are not whether

327
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,899
they are viable or not whether they're

328
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,700
empirically supported so here's some

329
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,040
this isn't all of the empirically

330
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
supported theories of Consciousness out

331
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,579
there there's a really nice article here

332
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,700
by Anil and Tim uh Anil Seth and Tim

333
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,140
Bain that came out last year that

334
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,180
discusses a bunch of these and there's a

335
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,100
really nice article here

336
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,200
um by this group also saying they

337
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,940
actually looked at the empirical support

338
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,040
for different theories of Consciousness

339
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,320
how many papers are out there that

340
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,120
actually challenge versus support each

341
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,720
Theory and so this landscape is the one

342
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,959
that should be the one to evaluate all

343
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,279
of the results that were presented at

344
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,680
this event in it means that even if one

345
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,480
of the two theories that this one

346
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,700
project was looking at if one of them

347
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,560
didn't make the cut that doesn't mean

348
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,620
the other one wins and is right it just

349
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,019
means that one of them may be lost and

350
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,940
it didn't even lose remember

351
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,220
in fact so in addition to these really

352
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,899
nice papers

353
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,120
uh there's also a whole series of these

354
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,880
adversarial collaborations from the same

355
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,040
funding agency as the one that was shown

356
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,500
in his public event that are designed to

357
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,420
actually pit these theories against each

358
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,700
other in a pairwise fashion in a like

359
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,680
Thunderdome style for All You Mad Max

360
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,720
fans out there I love old school sci-fi

361
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,060
and the idea here is that two theories

362
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,300
enter and one Theory leaves one Theory

363
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,339
survives but it doesn't win because

364
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:45,959
there's another round coming

365
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,360
and so all of these nuances they were

366
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,160
just unfortunately missing from all the

367
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
news coverage and I understand that news

368
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,360
likes to get people to read it and it

369
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,000
likes to be Sensational but the missing

370
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,399
aspects of these new the missing Nuance

371
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,019
really changes the meaning of what was

372
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,940
presented and that's actually a really

373
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,680
big problem here

374
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,899
uh and why is this such a problem you

375
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,639
might ask I'm getting myself all worked

376
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,899
out here right

377
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,120
um so the answer to why I'm getting all

378
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,160
worked up really comes back to what I

379
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,600
presented in the beginning which is that

380
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,220
we Consciousness scientists have this

381
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,260
uphill battle we constantly have to

382
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,880
fight to legitimize our research program

383
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,760
and importantly this isn't just in the

384
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,620
eyes of the public so it's not just in

385
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,940
the eyes of the people reading these

386
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,339
articles who are not part of this

387
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,860
scientific sphere it's also in the eyes

388
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,360
of the scientific Community more

389
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,579
generally of our funding agencies and

390
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,500
maybe most importantly our close peers

391
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,339
within adjacent Fields so imagine for a

392
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,540
second that you are on a hiring

393
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,019
committee at a university and you read a

394
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,399
candidate's description of their

395
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,019
research program and it is about

396
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,639
Consciousness science

397
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,860
okay they have pages and pages and

398
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,959
several Publications and they maybe have

399
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,639
a grant that's about Consciousness

400
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,160
science but you as the member of the

401
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,920
hiring Committee just read this this New

402
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,959
York Times article about how plants

403
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,360
probably have consciousness

404
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,220
and so maybe your eyes are now rolling

405
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,899
out of your head because you've been

406
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,180
primed to think this isn't real this is

407
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,920
Sensational this isn't something that

408
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,139
can be studied scientifically you might

409
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,060
as well be talking about doing research

410
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,100
on telepathy is this really a colleague

411
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,480
that you want

412
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,399
so here's another example what if you're

413
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,440
on a grant Review Committee or you're

414
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,699
reviewing a paper

415
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,579
and you just read these articles in

416
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,459
science and in nature that heavily imply

417
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,579
that there are only two real theories of

418
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,500
Consciousness that have any empirical

419
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,459
support

420
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,260
but the paper or grant that you're

421
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,899
reviewing is not targeting either one of

422
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,940
these theories

423
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,420
so now maybe you see the problem here

424
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,519
these journalism articles they're

425
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,260
they're not just infuriating they're

426
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,180
really actively damaging the legitimacy

427
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,399
of our field they're cutting us off at

428
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,560
the knees in the eyes of our peers in

429
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,420
terms of the financial support we can

430
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,940
compete for from granting agencies in

431
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,380
terms of where we can publish our

432
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,019
science and by the way that science is

433
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,300
state of the art and cutting edge

434
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,339
we have a responsibility though as

435
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:12,420
people who are doing the

436
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,920
state-of-the-art Consciousness science

437
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,260
to try to work with the media so that

438
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,000
the reporting can be more honest so you

439
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,560
know we can continue working there as

440
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,839
well this is a two-way street in some

441
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,300
ways but we also hope that folks who are

442
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,579
listening right now will recognize this

443
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:27,779
pattern the next time you read an

444
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,760
article about Consciousness science then

445
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,980
maybe those sensationalized claims are

446
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,899
not exactly a reflection of the state of

447
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,940
Art and in the field because here's the

448
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,660
truth

449
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,519
this is real Consciousness science

450
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,100
modern Consciousness science it's a

451
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,959
collection of basically every single

452
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,699
state of the art discipline and method

453
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,199
of scientific inquiry that you can think

454
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,180
of so my version of Consciousness

455
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,579
science that I do in my lab is a

456
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,740
conglomeration of cognitive sciences and

457
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,420
computational Neuroscience and a little

458
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,800
bit of computer science artificial

459
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,480
intelligence machine learning thrown in

460
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,240
we also have heavy influences from

461
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,579
philosophy and psychology and

462
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,439
engineering and a little bit of meta

463
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,240
science and we have neuroimaging we have

464
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,980
statistics and this is really a

465
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,959
representation of Consciousness science

466
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,119
not just in my research group but the

467
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,260
conscious of science being done

468
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,599
worldwide by thousands of people

469
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
conscious that science is right at the

470
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,319
center right at the heart the very

471
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,699
bleeding edge of our Collective

472
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,919
scientific understanding

473
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:23,760
um so

474
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
remember when I put this slide up before

475
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,359
and I said that the study of this

476
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,880
question straddles the border between

477
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,100
Natural Sciences and philosophy in a way

478
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,780
that a lot of other domains maybe don't

479
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,940
need to do and as a result it captures

480
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,740
our imagination it gets out there it

481
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,600
gets into your brain and your mind and

482
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,980
sticks there in a way that some other

483
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,539
fields might not

484
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,340
but maybe you can see through what I've

485
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,799
talked about today that the challenge is

486
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,500
uh with communicating the Crux of this

487
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,620
question and in doing the science itself

488
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,240
that actually makes the people who are

489
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,760
doing this pretty brave especially the

490
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,620
younger trainees when you think about it

491
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,240
they're fighting this real uphill battle

492
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,780
so personally me I'm relatively safe I

493
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,880
have job security if people don't take

494
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,860
me seriously when I say I'm a conscious

495
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,740
scientist that's their loss that's fine

496
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,200
you know but the younger people the

497
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,460
trainees in the field those who are

498
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,780
trying to get jobs those who are trying

499
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,760
to to push the envelope of what we know

500
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,400
about our brains and our minds and our

501
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,100
awareness of ourselves in in this world

502
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,380
they've got a lot of misperceptions to

503
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,220
overcome uh so if you are excited and

504
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,919
you want to know more about the modern

505
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,240
exciting field of Consciousness science

506
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,520
I suggest that you head to the assc

507
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,900
website you can have a look at the whole

508
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,000
Science Program they've actually posted

509
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,860
videos of the Keynotes from this year so

510
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,360
that's pretty cool you can go and see

511
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,679
some of those

512
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,000
um they can you can also check out the

513
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,679
plan for the future

514
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,539
um and of course if I've inspired you

515
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,980
even a little bit to find out about

516
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,660
Consciousness science yourself despite

517
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,580
my kind of Grant here

518
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,860
um I say welcome please come join us

519

520
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,240
really cool stuff really amazing

521
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
mind-blowing stuff working to figure

522
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,020
this out so please come join us

523
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,600

say if you've enjoyed uh this talk or or

526
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,980
anything that I said resonated with you

527
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,080
I've got a real short little piece here

528
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,880
it's about 800 words so not a long

529
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,200
homework assignment you can go and check

530
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,520
that out

531
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,500
um so I think I'll stop and pass the mic

532
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,720
back to Daniel and also welcome Nora

533
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,940
Bradford who is a doctoral student here

534
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,580
at UC Irvine who works in Consciousness

535
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,160
science but who also is an accomplished

536
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,380
science journalist and he's written

537
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,059
articles in Scientific American Science

538
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,280
News discover and many more so thanks

539
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,679
very much

540
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,820
awesome

541
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,860
wow

542
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,799
cool Dora baby to you for our first

543
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,020
reflection about what what you see there

544
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,860
or how you came to be here yeah sure

545
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,740
um yeah so I was at assc and went to the

546
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,700
event

547
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,679
um that was associated with assc but not

548
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,020
run by ascc just to be clear

549
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,299
um and it was really exciting to see

550
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,679
Continental science kind of being

551
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,080
celebrated in the way that it was I had

552
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,940
some issues with the event but overall

553
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,500
like I was very excited that it was

554
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,260
getting this like public attention right

555
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,360
um and then afterwards I was again like

556
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
excited to see that people were writing

557
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,860
about my field because

558
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,520
that doesn't happen

559
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,340
I'm like I could do

560
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,980
um like immediately kind of disappointed

561
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,960
by not wrong

562
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,799
um

563
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,240
yeah and I guess I started to think

564
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,480
about kind of why conscious science is

565
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
maybe a harder

566
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,179
journalist to cover and I think there is

567
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,039
just probably a lot more controversy and

568
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,360
a lot more room for mistakes to be made

569
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,760
um then perhaps in fields where the

570
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,679
research is more clear-cut or more

571
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,960
easily interpretable

572
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,660
um so yeah I think there's a lot as

573
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,360
journalists and also as researchers from

574
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,600
this

575
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,100
yeah I'll um can I can I just really

576
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,720
probably follow up and say I I think

577
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,840
that Nora you're spot on by saying that

578
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
uh it's or by

579
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,220
presenting the idea that it's it's the

580
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,539
interpretation that's part of the

581
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,400
problem here it's not just that people

582
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,320
are maybe getting facts wrong when

583
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,820
they're writing about this field it's

584
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,620
that the interpretations are really

585
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,960
nuanced they're really difficult to get

586
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,240
right and it's really easy for an

587
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,740
oversimplification to end up

588
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,960
fundamentally changing the meaning in

589
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,120
this space in a way that maybe doesn't

590
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,100
occur quite as often in some other

591
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,520
fields

592
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,320
yeah that that's really interesting to

593
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,440
kind of disentangle the features that

594
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,679
that make this a unique although also

595
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,919
exemplary case of communicating

596
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,559
challenging ideas I mean the first that

597
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
presents itself to me is just how much

598
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,419
is on the table I mean whose pain

599
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,240
matters whose experiences or what

600
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,940
experiences even matter what's the

601
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,980
difference between a who and a what this

602
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,419
is the real question if something

603
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,340
doesn't have an experience

604
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,980
then there's no feeling but if something

605
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,020
does have an experience then it's it's a

606
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,880
feeling and it's a morally

607
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,620
um culpable or

608
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,320
um something that we're responsible for

609
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,200
treating in an ethical way so it's like

610
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,640
whether or not it's always brought up in

611
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,360
those articles the stakes are so high

612
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
whereas whether a given molecular

613
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,980
compound does this molecular interaction

614
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,980
is closer to the objective whereas this

615
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,380
is the ultimate subjective

616
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,080
questions seemingly

617
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,500
sure yeah I I agree with you definitely

618
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,900
that the ethical Stakes the the moral

619
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,780
implications of this field are are just

620
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,480
staggering and certainly there it's not

621
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,940
unique in that that way that the ethical

622
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,039
and moral implications of sociological

623
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,080
research or climate science or you know

624
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,820
of many other domains also have like

625
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,400
these staggering implications

626
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,159
um I think one of the the biggest

627
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,340
challenges that we have is not just in

628
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,700
the interpretation of objective data but

629
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,500
exactly as you've just said this is the

630
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,360
ultimate subjectivity that the thing

631
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,520
that we are studying by its definition

632
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,460
is not objectively observable

633
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,600
and that is absolutely something that is

634
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,299
uh at least you can design measurement

635
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,580
Tools in a way that have different

636
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,640
philosophical foundations in basically

637
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,799
every other field but by its very Nature

638
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,419
by the definition of subjective

639
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,400
experience we cannot design a

640
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,200
measurement tool that actually says what

641
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,000
is it like to be you that's kind of the

642
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,039
whole problem

643
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:49,740
but your your uh

644
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,840
your points also about the ethical

645
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,539
implications in medicine the difference

646
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,360
between a who and a what um I think that

647
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,039
that's also really important to bring it

648
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,400
outside here we are trying to to you

649
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,960
know I presented this as like we want to

650
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,760
understand Consciousness and I never

651
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,400
really defined consciousness he just

652
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,659
said like here's Consciousness and like

653
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,220
here's an umbrella term and you you take

654
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,220
that kind of how you want

655
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,720
um but it's true that Consciousness

656
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,299
science spans all the way from you know

657
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,299
wakefulness versus coma uh or locked in

658
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:24,000
syndrome or traumatic brain injury

659
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,480
um anesthesia all the way through to uh

660
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,419
is a baby conscious is a fetus conscious

661
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,000
is an AI conscious is a cockroach all

662
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,200
right or your dog uh or you know 200

663
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,179
years ago people might argue that

664
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,159
children were less conscious than adults

665
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,840
and so it was okay to hit your children

666
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,120
because they wouldn't feel it as much or

667
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,460
something and so there's there's a lot

668
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,100
of sociological and ethical and moral

669
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,860
implications in everything that we're

670
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,520
doing

671
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,500
which is why

672
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,360
one of the reasons I've chosen this

673
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,880
field too is that it really scratches a

674
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,559
lot of intellectual itch but it also

675
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,419
feels really important especially right

676
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,280
now with the rise of machine

677
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,980
intelligence and with uh ongoing debates

678
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,520
about animal uh or fetal Consciousness

679
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,280
that really bear

680
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,419
extreme impact on legislation on you

681
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,280
know moral decisions that we make as a

682
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,280
people so yeah it's it's a big thing

683
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,539
that we're doing

684
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,179
I'm a little biased but it is a big

685
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:28,500
thing

686
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,260
and I would add that even if researchers

687
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,179
are sometimes good at explaining what

688
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,620
they mean by Consciousness in their

689
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,679
research like two journalists say the

690
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,120
journalists are not always necessarily

691
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,580
great at communicating that to the

692
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,440
public for their writing

693
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,480
um and I get why that would be hard it's

694
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,039
kind of it can be fun it can be like

695
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,500
awkward and unappealing to explain but

696
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,799
that is crucial because people readers

697
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,659
can take it however they want based on

698
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,460
how they're interpreting the word

699
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,020
Consciousness

700
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,000
um so I think that's super important to

701
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,020
address if you're writing about

702
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,620
consciousness

703
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,539
yeah it's really a field that's kind of

704
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,960
a a leading indicator

705
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,100
because

706
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,200
especially if approached in a scientific

707
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,679
way

708
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,840
in our current setting uh a scientific

709
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,720
understanding of X is what shapes

710
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,380
evidence-driven policy about X so I

711
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,679
guess this leads to what what is or or

712
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,559
would or could be a science-driven

713
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,299
approach like how do we know it when we

714
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,720
see it when someone is approaching this

715
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,120
question from a scientific perspective

716
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,340
what would what would each of you say to

717
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,080
this

718
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,640
well I'm going to give kind of the stock

719
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,159
answer which is that you want to have

720
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,860
objective measures that are valid and

721
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,419
reliable

722
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,340
um but the the big one is falsifiability

723
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,500
and that's you know any student of

724
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,360
science going back to grade school is

725
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,799
going to learn a little bit about that

726
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,200
which is that if you've got a theory or

727
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,100
you've got a hypothesis uh about how

728
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,980
let's say the brain uh generates

729
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,600
Consciousness or even going back to just

730
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,940
correlates just like which bits of the

731
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,360
brain are are

732
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,279
correlated in their activity with

733
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,900
whether you're more conscious or less

734
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,520
conscious so let's keep it really like

735
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,320
very basic

736
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,539
um you need to have it be falsifiable

737
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:27,120
you need to have say it's this area of

738
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,220
the brain that will correlate and not

739
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,760
that area of the brain or that uh and

740
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,500
the recognition that an absence of

741
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,539
evidence is not evidence of absence is

742
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,940
also really crucial to this idea which

743
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,039
is that just because I failed to measure

744
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,159
a correspondence between the activity

745
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,419
and the bit of the brain that I

746
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:48,720
hypothesized and you know some measure

747
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,500
of awareness that I get from self-report

748
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,640
doesn't mean that that area of the brain

749
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,140
isn't doing the work it just means that

750
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,120
our machines are terrible or that our

751
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,980
measure sucks

752
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,840
um and and honestly despite the

753
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,640
state-of-the-art measurements that we do

754
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,980
have we have you know millimeter level

755
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,279
Precision in humans we have cellular

756
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,559
level precision and non-human animals we

757
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,080
can record a lot of stuff

758
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,980
um

759
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,720
and we have a lot of really fancy

760
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,520
machine learning algorithms to help us

761
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,799
extract what that stuff means

762
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,620
to go from super high dimensional noisy

763
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,360
data down to something that we can maybe

764
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,940
make the argument is interpretable

765
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,880
uh inter interpretable yeah

766
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,500
um but

767
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,000
just because you didn't find what you

768
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,440
were looking for doesn't mean that it's

769
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,000
not there it just means that you were

770
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,679
maybe looking in the wrong place or that

771
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,020
you were looking using the wrong tool

772
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,600
uh and so these these kind of go hand in

773
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,580
hand because on the one hand you want

774
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,100
your hypothesis to be falsifiable so you

775
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,779
aren't allowed to just say oh well I

776
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,100
just wasn't looking for it the right way

777
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,840
so I'm just gonna you know revise how

778
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,340
I'm looking and try again and therefore

779
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,900
I'm still right

780
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,240
you need to design your experiments and

781
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,779
your theories such that if you find a

782
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,640
particular result a positive result that

783
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,799
it actually disproves your theory as

784
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,480
opposed to just failing to provide

785
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,059
support for your theory

786
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,360
um so I think that those those those and

787
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,980
you know other kind of standard criteria

788
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,539
that you might find in any stem

789
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,940
classroom that demonstrate the

790
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,840
scientific method uh those are probably

791
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,820
the the definitions that I would fall

792
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,039
back on and I think that Consciousness

793
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,380
and science broadly speaking the stuff

794
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,899
that is presented in assc it does all of

795
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,159
that

796
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,440
um it absolutely does it's the same

797
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,720
caliber of computational Neuroscience

798
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,500
and neuroimaging and psychological

799
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,539
psychophysics measurement and logical

800
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,580
philosophy approaches that you would

801
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,740
find at any other Flagship conference in

802
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,020
the in the world yeah

803
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,240
and I would say if you're reading

804
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,460
um an article rather than like a journal

805
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,720
paper like if you're reading something

806
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,399
in the in the Press

807
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,320
um the way to know if it's trustworthy

808
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,299
or not or one way is if it's making

809
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,760
Sensational claims like claiming to have

810
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,279
you know found the root of Consciousness

811
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,460
or some really large claim it's probably

812
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,059
not true like I think we would that

813
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:16,559
wouldn't happen in one study I'm

814
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,740
assuming um so just read with a

815
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,140
skeptical eye and

816
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,899
um if you feel comfortable try to read

817
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,659
the primary Literature Like get inspired

818
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,659
by the the Press but if you feel like

819
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,580
there's something off just go to the

820
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,559
primary literature and see what's up and

821
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,880
and see if you can interpret for

822
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,260
yourself it's understandable if you can

823
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,100
but

824
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,799
yeah that's what I would say that's a

825
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,840
good rule of thumb Nora that like one

826
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,620
study is never going to be the answer

827
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,200
yeah not just ours but it's it's easy to

828
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,120
get swept away in The Sensational claims

829
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,179
and to be like ooh they found like the

830
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:57,000
neural cause of Consciousness like

831
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,120
probably not yeah yeah and I would say

832
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,860
like pre-registration also I mean Megan

833
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,539
I don't know like what your rule of

834
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,580
thumb is for this but those I mean if

835
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,980
people pre-register there

836
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,659
um you know plan for the study and how

837
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,860
they're going to analyze it ahead of

838
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,480
time that is usually a really good sign

839
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,679
I mean basically what you're just saying

840
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,320
but just like stamp of we promise we did

841
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,659
this ahead of time kind of thing

842
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,120
um yeah avoids parking

843
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,140
lotsizing after the fact right yeah

844
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,600
yeah it was kind of cool to see Meta

845
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,679
science

846
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,520
um

847
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,539
and also maybe kind of a

848
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:34,919
bibliographic analyzes looking at

849
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:36,480
different Trends in literature but then

850
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,880
also going beyond the peer-reviewed

851
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,399
literature to looking at the real trends

852
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,200
that that influence people who are

853
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,740
outside of the profession and it's like

854
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,960
um it's kind of I don't know if Canary

855
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,240
in the coal mine is the right

856
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,360
um birds in the right Niche here but

857
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,159
it's like

858
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,919
um proposing unobservables

859
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,980
is commonplace in research like latent

860
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,320
cause analysis and and any kind of

861
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,360
structural equation modeling

862
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,840
and here is the um

863
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,840
the tour de force of unobservables maybe

864
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,480
that which is defined as unobservables

865
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,580
and so it's actually like a space to to

866
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,860
bring up all these pieces of epistemic

867
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,399
hygiene about from pre-registration to

868
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,399
the PACE and the tone of the scientific

869
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,120
community and questions of like

870
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,860
multi-disciplinarity in research it's

871
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,919
it's kind of um it's a fun and then

872
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,500
there's a heart at the intersection of

873
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,899
the Venn diagram where it kind of all

874
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:41,940
comes together it's like well this

875
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,279
synthesis cannot happen without all

876
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,720
these pieces if we're not having

877
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,580
philosophers in conversation with the

878
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,340
statisticians then this synthesis can't

879
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,620
happen now maybe the synthesis that you

880
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,440
care about doesn't need that but

881
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
we care about this and this synthesis

882
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,299
requires it so we need to develop the

883
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:03,539
approaches and the communication around

884
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,679
that and um so it's uh really a tip of

885
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,740
the spear effort even apart from the

886
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,039
consequences of the research

887
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,200
what a heartwarming sentiment thank you

888
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,440
for sharing that I I think

889
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,720
I love the phrase epistemic hygiene

890
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,960
because that is so crucial I think to

891
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,279
every field but it's like particularly

892
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,000
aggressively exposed in this field which

893
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,940
is exactly why I think that

894
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,840
um

895
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,340
my science has has benefited so

896
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,200
powerfully from close collaboration with

897
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,539
philosophers and with statisticians I

898
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,100
mean this is kind of the space that I I

899
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,919
live in here in the cognitive Sciences

900
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,480
department is where we're halfway

901
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,659
between Ai and philosophy and Psychology

902
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,820
and Neuroscience and engineering and

903
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,220
it's like it it's kind of like where all

904
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,779
these things come together but then this

905
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:03,240
meta science thing I'm happy that you

906
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,559
picked up on that

907
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,860
um because I think that it's also really

908
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,320
the the bibliometric analyzes are really

909
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,699
critical and

910
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,699
we're at this crazy spot and have been

911
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,679
for a long time now but I think it's

912
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,440
really really coming to a head

913
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,679
where the vast majority of our

914
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,540
scientific knowledge is not accessible

915
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,159
to anyone researchers simply because

916
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,599
there's so much of it

917
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,300
right you can't read all of the

918
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,679
literature you can't even read all the

919
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,239
literature that's in your tiny little

920
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,280
corner and

921
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,040
Consciousness science like many other

922
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,020
fields in this way actually is one of

923
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,520
those that brings together a lot of

924
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,839
different fields so it makes it even

925
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,239
harder for you to keep up with the

926
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,379
things that are going to be really

927
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,119
relevant I mean you have to keep up with

928
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,540
The Cutting Edge tools in neuroimaging

929
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,619
data analysis plus the epistemic hygiene

930
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,320
that the philosophers are going to bring

931
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,119
plus like Cutting Edge behavioral

932
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,280
paradigms and what they mean and like

933
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,240
you know naturalistic data uh collection

934
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,099
settings so that you're not just saying

935
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,780
oh I've discovered something fundamental

936
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,060
about Consciousness by showing you Gabor

937
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,820
patches all day and I say this as

938
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,440
someone who shows people Gabor patches

939
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,339
all day but it's it's really like it's a

940
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:21,960
real challenge to bring together all

941
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,520
these things and maybe you're right

942
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,920
maybe that Consciousness science is I

943
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,240
don't know about the canary in the cold

944
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,420
mine so to speak but maybe you're right

945
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,920
that

946
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,900
it's one of the places where you can

947
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,520
really see all these cogs working

948
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,820
together to come at one major question

949
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,560
or maybe you don't

950
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,260
quite see the need for that hygiene and

951
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,940
some other fields yet it still is there

952
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,540
like latent cause analysis is not just

953
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,640
something that we do in Consciousness

954
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,980
science or Neuroscience we do it in

955
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,980
economics we do it in sociology we do it

956
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,920
like everywhere and so having a real

957
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,099
handle on how to design stuff that

958
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,599
actually asks the questions that you're

959
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,780
interested in is something that

960
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,960
I find that I have to continuously work

961
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,900
hard to keep in my sights

962
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,240
um and and I'm lucky that we've got a

963
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,680
pile of philosophers that we get to hang

964
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,320
out with who

965
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
blow into your talk and say everything

966
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,560
that you just said is wrong and here's

967
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,300
why here's this logical hole in what

968
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,859
you've done and they're right

969
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,599
and it's great because it makes the

970
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,200
science better

971
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,140
and you don't typically get philosophers

972
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,960
you know blowing into a talk in a lot of

973
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,700
other fields it doesn't happen

974
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,320
and um and I think it should

975
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,680
we all have that inroad

976
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,140
to our experience

977
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,380
so it is something that integrates

978
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,599
across disciplines kind of even casts

979
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,420
the disciplinary organizational Paradigm

980
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,160
into

981
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,880
um at least critical light and and then

982
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,280
um goes even outside of Academia because

983
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,400
these are these are what people

984
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,320
search engine for and uh language model

985
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,280
discuss and I think it is one of these

986
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,440
um it's like an itch that some can't

987
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,099
scratch with this inscrutable and

988
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,220
ineffable nature that that does Verge

989
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,800
into the mystical and then like so what

990
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,640
do we do with the huge mystery

991
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,440
and and so that that makes it a um a a

992
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,460
training and exhibition fields

993
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,440
um again that's not just important but

994
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,440
like is kind of the the

995
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,160
um

996
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,720
the archetype of well how do you have a

997
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,180
multi-decade conversation

998
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,579
with potentially non-compatible

999
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,560
theorizing

1000
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,619
whereas in many of the physical sciences

1001
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,420
including physical reductionist

1002
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,020
perspectives on on neuroscience

1003
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,480
threads open and close a little bit

1004
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,920
quicker a little bit easier tend to not

1005
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,240
um delve into ancient history tend to

1006
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,099
not need to invoke World Knowledge

1007
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,640
Traditions so that

1008
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,220
makes it fun it makes it fun and useful

1009
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,200
and if something's fun and useful what

1010
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,820
what secret third thing are we looking

1011
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,940
for exactly sounds like uh if you

1012
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,200
weren't already a Consciousness

1013
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,939
scientist maybe we've converted you

1014
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,960
um as as only a bug doctor I did did uh

1015
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,200
one one work on the uh ant colony and

1016
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,079
definitions of Consciousness and we

1017
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,240
didn't come down on the issue of weather

1018
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,579
like the nest mates are conscious under

1019
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,280
what definition or the colony

1020
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,760
um but more pointed out well if you

1021
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,800
define it according to some neuro

1022
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,560
mammalian neuroanatomy then you kind of

1023
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,060
already know what the answer is going to

1024
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,280
be it's going to be no and if you define

1025
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,400
it according to a specific

1026
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,820
um primate censored symbolic

1027
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,200
communication approach again you know

1028
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,119
what that's going to be it's no if you

1029
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,280
define it based upon some generic

1030
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,040
informational property

1031
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,440
then you already know what it's going to

1032
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,660
be it's going to be on that continuum

1033
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,359
and so we kind of tried to flip the

1034
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:33,000
approach by instead of asking like in

1035
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,740
which

1036
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,200
um

1037
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,300
teacher would help us differentiate

1038
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,920
whether the ant colony is conscious or

1039
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,960
not we just said let's just look at what

1040
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,180
the features that people are using and

1041
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,160
then ask whether colony is but but we

1042
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,740
don't have we don't have the um one

1043
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,800
meter metal bar for Consciousness so

1044
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,839
again it's like well let's say 7 out of

1045
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,300
10 that we observed we don't know how

1046
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,280
many other unproposed theories there are

1047
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,099
so 7 out of 10 could be total

1048
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,859
um uh sampling bias

1049
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,560
um even if it was 10 or 10 then what

1050
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,680
would that type of consensus really mean

1051
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,700
and um

1052
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,640
that's where our road took us

1053
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,200
and I I saw that conclusion as like

1054
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,299
a chance to broaden the discussion

1055
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,640
but discussions are not only about

1056
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,720
broadening because there's real

1057
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,880
decisions that are being made so it

1058
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,980
can't only be

1059
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,380
yes and and I think that when you

1060
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,480
connect it back to falsification and all

1061
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,040
of these other properties that's where

1062
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,760
we get the the winnowing but it's those

1063
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,920
two complementary conversations like the

1064
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,480
broader

1065
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,520
um inclusion of perspectives that

1066
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,980
expands the space that we can comprehend

1067
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,820
and then the diligence that that also

1068
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,520
shrinks it back down and somehow will

1069
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,079
zigzag to better and better

1070
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,079
understandings

1071
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,140
your uh your point about

1072
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,280
we don't have a yardstick we don't have

1073
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,920
a metal rod right that says you know how

1074
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,380
conscious I mean like according to to

1075
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,079
some folks we we have that metal rod and

1076
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,460
we've surpassed that with for example

1077
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,400
large language models

1078
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,680
uh they're uh and we're not just talking

1079
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,260
you know particular Google Engineers who

1080
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,839
decide to get really excited about how

1081
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,000
their pad language model gets is

1082
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,280
conscious we're talking

1083
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,859
any any kind of reasonable

1084
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,839
interpretation of the old school Turing

1085
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:43,680
test

1086
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,700
would be passed by existing language

1087
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,740
models right now in fact arguably it

1088
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,720
might have been passed long ago with

1089
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,099
Eliza

1090
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,160
uh in like the 70s

1091
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,380
um and and if it wasn't passed with

1092
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,420
Eliza then certainly it has been passed

1093
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,119
now but I think that there is a growing

1094
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,760
understanding that information

1095
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,820
processing capacity and intelligence are

1096
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,680
not the same thing as internal

1097
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,420
phenomenal experience

1098
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,300
and that the tests that we have to the

1099
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,800
extent that we have any tests at all are

1100
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,420
willfully inadequate

1101
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,660
and as you said are locked to particular

1102
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,960
implementations so you can't apply the

1103
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,660
mammalian test for Consciousness like oh

1104
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,520
I'm looking for this particular neural

1105
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,200
signature which tells me whether the

1106
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,119
monkey is anesthetized or not I can't

1107
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,579
apply that to ants and expect it to work

1108
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:36,780
it's not going to tell me anything

1109
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,359
useful there can't necessarily apply it

1110
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,579
to octopuses either for the record so

1111
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,040
we're not even going insects we're going

1112
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,700
other arguably incredibly intelligent

1113
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,680
beings that can open jars and be sneaky

1114
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,140
and like do all sorts of cool stuff

1115
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,859
and uh and that have complex social

1116
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:57,420
interactions

1117
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,380
and are basically aliens this is my my

1118
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,720
you know professional scientific opinion

1119
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,000
here what they basically are right like

1120
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,619
they're so fundamentally physically

1121
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:08,940
different from us

1122
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,980
and so any consciousness of meter that

1123
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,140
we develop for us or that applies in

1124
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,540
monkeys or even in dogs or cats is not

1125
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,000
really going to apply there

1126
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,280
um and so differentiating tests for

1127
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,380
intelligence from tests from like inner

1128
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,240
experience it's a really difficult

1129
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,319
problem

1130
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,119
and then there's the third problem which

1131
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,740
is a test for whether we attribute

1132
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,740
Consciousness to an agent which if you

1133
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,079
saw a movie X Machina is the Garland

1134
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,380
test

1135
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,640
um so that's like you know do never mind

1136
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,740
whether it actually has Consciousness do

1137
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,380
I attribute Consciousness to it because

1138
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,599
that is going to change how we interact

1139
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,099
with it and the rights that we ascribe

1140
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,839
to it and so on and so I think we're

1141
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:52,020
well past the point at which we need to

1142
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,060
get a better handle on this some of the

1143
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,339
stuff that I'm working on right now is

1144
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,500
moving in this direction not just me and

1145
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,960
a huge group of lots of other people

1146
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,540
um and I think Joshua bengio gave

1147
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,839
testimony to Congress like today uh

1148
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,900
about the need for uh increased

1149
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,500
regulatory oversight of uh who has

1150
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,140
access to so-called artificial

1151
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,000
intelligence models so that we can

1152
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,700
better understand

1153
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,079
how their implementation and their

1154
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,119
interaction with humans might exacerbate

1155
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,920
biases or cause all sorts of other

1156
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,660
problems

1157
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,520
um so you can actually go and read his

1158
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,160
his testimony that he gave I don't

1159
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,839
remember whether the link is you can

1160
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:34,859
find it

1161
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:36,599
um but he had a summary and then he

1162
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,520
links to the testimony and I think that

1163
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,800
having folks like yahshua and other

1164
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,319
Giants in the field speaking out about

1165
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:44,880
the need for

1166
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,160
actually tackling this and not this

1167
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,800
isn't just a philosopher's playground to

1168
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,200
talk about Consciousness this is

1169
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,420
this is as you said it's a testing bed

1170
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,859
for where the rest of science is going

1171
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,920
and it's also like very topical right

1172
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,099
now

1173
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,140
so what is that

1174
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,720
healthy

1175
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,300
conversation looked like in the case of

1176
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,540
the synthetic intelligences and language

1177
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,180
models and all of this

1178
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,079
um

1179
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,660
what what does that continue to look

1180
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,660
like between the actual measures and

1181
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,160
proxies that we use in research and uh I

1182
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,000
mean what memes or themes or words that

1183
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,940
I guess by definition aren't popular

1184
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,060
today like big data wasn't Popular until

1185
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,920
it was so what some something like what

1186
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,099
has to come on the scene and come into

1187
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:47,280
the lab do you think to support the kind

1188
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,240
of

1189
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,520
um like work and knowledge that that

1190
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,700
either of you would want to see

1191
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,480
thank you

1192
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,040
this isn't an answer to your question

1193
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,020
but it just reminded me of one thing

1194
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,200
that we need less of is people writing

1195
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,180
about these interactions with AI that

1196
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,339
are like my AI told me that it wanted to

1197
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:11,280
get married or like my AI whatever like

1198
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,560
that's not it's not useful it's not news

1199
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,660
stop reporting about it

1200
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,000
that's all I have to say okay go ahead

1201
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,460
no I I wanted you to take this too

1202
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,960
because I think that the question is

1203
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,760
about

1204
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,099
Communication in a way that is you're

1205
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:27,599
you're much more embedded in the science

1206
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,599
communication space than I am and so for

1207
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:35,880
I think one possible way to go about

1208
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,280
this that maybe you can speak to would

1209
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,160
be what kinds of you know you're Daniel

1210
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,240
you're talking about what do we need to

1211
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,440
bring into the lab and maybe

1212
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,660
communication tools is one of those or

1213
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,300
ways of communicating this science ways

1214
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,300
of of end to different audiences

1215
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,400
um and so maybe Nora you've got some

1216
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,560
ideas even if you've done so much in

1217
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,599
this space I don't know

1218
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,900
yeah I mean I guess I what we've been

1219
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,220
talking about with people who study

1220
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,079
human consciousness

1221
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:04,920
um

1222
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,720
people who study Consciousness and other

1223
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,300
entities as well like just being clear

1224
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,859
about what you mean by Consciousness

1225
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:12,839
like do you mean a subjective experience

1226
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:14,700
do you mean

1227
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,380
um you know basically is a light on or

1228
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,900
off like uh do you mean awake versus

1229
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,400
asleep

1230
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,180
um

1231
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,579
just being really clear about what level

1232
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:25,560
you're talking at I think is really

1233
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,900
helpful again when you're just like

1234
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,940
presenting your research whether it's on

1235
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,079
Twitter or you're talking to a

1236
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,520
journalist

1237
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,619
um really being clear-cut about that so

1238
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,480
that people can't make kind of

1239
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,940
extrapolations from your work that your

1240
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,859
work doesn't cover

1241
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:41,520
um

1242
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,440
I don't know what else I mean

1243
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,359
yeah I guess just being willing to also

1244
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,280
talk about your work I feel like a lot

1245
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,720
of data science feels pretty

1246
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,880
inaccessible to the general public

1247
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,920
um so finding ways to communicate what

1248
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,079
you do and how you're conducting your

1249
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,280
work is helpful being open about it

1250
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,800
yeah there's a lot of jargon in our

1251
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,200
field too in any field there's jargon um

1252
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,240
but the the oversimplification this is

1253
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,440
going back to what we talked about at

1254
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,940
the beginning the oversimplification of

1255
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,619
jargoning terms in our field seems

1256
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:13,079
particularly susceptible to

1257
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:14,520
uh

1258
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,579
creating a situation where the the facts

1259
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:19,020
haven't changed but the interpretation

1260
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,280
has

1261
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,740
uh and so I think

1262
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,599
it's almost like sensitivity training

1263
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,000
for anybody who's in this space like

1264
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,180
just kind of a you know a little a

1265
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,099
tutorial that you can do that's like a

1266
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,660
two hour you know click-through thing

1267
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,839
it's like here are all the ways in which

1268
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,740
communicating this type of science due

1269
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,440
to its nature is

1270
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,359
more challenging than you might

1271
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,460
anticipate and so my my own involvement

1272
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,680
in um

1273
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,200
in a program run by the Canadian

1274
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,640
Institute for advanced research has

1275
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,440
given me a little bit of training and

1276
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,940
speaking with the media and I would

1277
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,339
never never say that I am an expert in

1278
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:06,960
this at all uh I will only say that uh

1279
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,540
it was eye-opening and it was very

1280
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,020
useful and the clarity of language that

1281
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,540
you are used to using the the Precision

1282
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,819
of language that you're used to using in

1283
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:21,060
a close scientific sphere versus when

1284
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,980
you're speaking to a more General

1285
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,260
audience and when you're speaking to a

1286
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,180
journalist or with several journalists

1287
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,740
who are then going to be writing for a

1288
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,839
more General audience it's a it's a

1289
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,880
different mindset it's a different way

1290
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,960
of speaking

1291
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,540
and even just being aware of that I

1292
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,000
think is really really useful it's not

1293
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,220
that one is better than the other it's

1294
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,660
just that they are very different and

1295
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,480
that when we are training to be

1296
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,000
scientists when we're doing a PhD in a

1297
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,740
field related to this

1298
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,500
speaking to the general public is not a

1299
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,480
skill that gets pressed on

1300
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,780
it's not a skill that gets it's part of

1301
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,920
like your professional development

1302
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,560
training maybe you do like one practice

1303
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,300
talk somewhere but it's not typically

1304
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,240
part of a general training protocol and

1305
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,880
So speaking to non-specialists speaking

1306
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,099
to the media is speaking to high school

1307
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:13,560
audiences speaking to your mom at the

1308
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,540
dinner table like learning how to do

1309
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,359
this effectively can actually be really

1310
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:20,099
valuable and really rewarding and really

1311
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,440
powerful and again I would never say

1312
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,060
that I am an expert at this at this

1313
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,800
point I just like to think that I'm a

1314
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,240
little better at it than I otherwise

1315
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,359
would be had I not had it drilled into

1316
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:33,480
me how careful I need to be

1317
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,339
I would also say

1318
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:37,500
um don't be scared to like email

1319
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,180
journalists if you see that something's

1320
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,640
inaccurate or you know speak up like

1321
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,260
Megan has done

1322
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,180
um about the kind of how things are

1323
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,900
portrayed inaccurately because yeah as a

1324
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,400
journalist like no one's ever done that

1325
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,220
to me but it would if something wasn't

1326
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,480
accurate I would want to know and I

1327
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,819
would want to fix it like ASAP so don't

1328
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,099
feel bad about emailing journalists they

1329
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,960
want their pieces to be accurate as well

1330
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,460
so

1331
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,680
that's what I would add that can add to

1332
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,599
the conversation yeah it does make me

1333
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,460
feel a little bad about like you know

1334
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,859
calling out the pieces that I did in in

1335
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,660
the presentation in the the piece of

1336
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,119
writing that I did too but at the same

1337
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,460
time like they put this in writing and

1338
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,700
this is wrong and and it's

1339
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,339
I I don't like making people upset and I

1340
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:25,859
don't like making people angry

1341
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,119
um but

1342
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,280
it's out there in the world and I saw a

1343
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,079
million eyeballs and that's a problem

1344
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,960
and so we're hoping your viewership is

1345
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,819
about a million right Daniel so give or

1346
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:38,780
take and so no Brilliance for everybody

1347
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,220
so this will cover everybody who read

1348
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,460
those those articles right

1349
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,559
it's it's

1350
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,020
interesting like the field is about

1351
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,819
awareness of

1352
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,760
other Minds our own mind but also

1353
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,460
awareness of other minds and in theory

1354
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,520
but then in practice awareness of other

1355
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,180
Minds is communication because if we say

1356
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,859
something that it's like well I wouldn't

1357
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,559
be annoyed by that or I wouldn't be

1358
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,720
angry with that but it's like but you

1359
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,040
missed the point of communication which

1360
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,900
it's not about what you would think

1361
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,579
about it it's about because the

1362
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:16,079
recipient would be so it's kind of like

1363
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,380
the theory and the practice of of

1364
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,619
um situational awareness about different

1365
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:24,420
Minds all of which are different than

1366
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,780
our own some are potentially radically

1367
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,000
different than our own others might be

1368
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,700
more similar

1369
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,740
um so it's there's really

1370
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,540
um maybe even a quintessential

1371
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,020
relationship between

1372
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,099
Consciousness studies and communication

1373
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:47,339
studies which provides like a really

1374
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:50,819
unique two-way street

1375
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:52,859
that that

1376
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:55,980
um the world is swerving into that to

1377
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,980
Lane Highway with these questions that

1378
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,960
are grabbing people's salience

1379
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,500
what what are your sort of um like

1380
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,140
closing thoughts or directions or what

1381
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,420
are some exciting areas that that you'd

1382
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,980
like to

1383
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,579
see unfolding in the coming months and

1384
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,760
years

1385
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,740
well I'll go first

1386
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,960
yeah first of all I

1387
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,200
I think I

1388
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,880
communicating conscious to science being

1389
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,800
about knowing about other Minds I mean

1390
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,780
it's like effective communication is

1391
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,400
theory of mind and theory of mine may

1392
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,960
have a lot to do with modeling other

1393
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,880
minds and modeling your own mind and yes

1394
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,220
absolutely it's all it's all wrapped up

1395
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,240
so

1396
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,420
I think for me

1397
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,520
um getting this right going forward or

1398
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,440
continuing to to work towards getting it

1399
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,900
right is a priority for me

1400
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,380
uh and one of the the pieces

1401
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,599
scientifically that I'm working on that

1402
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:02,460
I hope to then communicate effectively

1403
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,859
when we get it right or several of the

1404
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:07,800
pieces is I have a couple

1405
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,260
um these really wonderful large

1406
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,880
collaborative projects where we're

1407
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,180
working on everything from figuring out

1408
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,800
how you would actually measure of

1409
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,440
Consciousness effectively or what it

1410
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,940
might even take to measure Consciousness

1411
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,700
effectively in other entities that are

1412
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,680
not necessarily like awake behaving and

1413
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,380
healthy adult human beings uh all the

1414
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,540
way to Let's actually design some

1415
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,280
experiments to test several different

1416
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,380
theories of Consciousness let's design a

1417
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,420
new uh some of what Nora's working on

1418
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,980
actually is designing new measurement

1419
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,260
approaches to say well we need to

1420
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,480
actually like have a quantitative handle

1421
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,859
on the things that we're talking about

1422
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:45,720
so this becomes objective it becomes

1423
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,000
falsifiable and becomes like we can do

1424
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,160
model arbitration so all these things

1425
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,440
I'm really excited about but overarching

1426
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,040
all of those is this idea of

1427
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,980
going it's all connected right you've

1428
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,380
talked about how Consciousness science

1429
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,460
might be this this Leading Edge or wave

1430
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,160
front of how uh interdisciplinary

1431
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,440
science and meta science needs to be

1432
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,780
done going forward as

1433
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,559
uh as we become even more Theory driven

1434
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,880
in some of our uh scientific lines of

1435
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,260
inquiry than we have been in the past

1436
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,059
and more interested in latent variables

1437
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,800
and causal Discovery and so on and so

1438
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,319
forth and as the science teams get

1439
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,760
bigger

1440
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,059
and more complicated and the jobs within

1441
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:34,680
those science teams become more

1442
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,780
specialized and we have more and more

1443
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,599
need for interdisciplinary collaboration

1444
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,480
we're gonna have to change How We Do

1445
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,160
team science and how we do credit

1446
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,319
assignment within team science in a way

1447
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,780
that I think might end up being kind of

1448
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,119
incompatible with the nice siled cute

1449
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,040
departmental structure that we have in

1450
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,240
our universities

1451
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,099
uh and so

1452
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,619
a focus on not just tolerating but

1453
00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:00,300
celebrating interdisciplinarity

1454
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,640
celebrating team science doing credit

1455
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,200
assignment correctly and you know saying

1456
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,420
first author isn't the only thing that

1457
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,220
matters that like it really matters if

1458
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,900
you wrote this gorgeous software package

1459
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,579
that facilitated a whole bunch of stuff

1460
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,619
like that's also a meaningful and

1461
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:18,900
Powerful contribution even if you didn't

1462
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,460
get first author on that paper you still

1463
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,440
deserve a lot of credit so I think that

1464
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,000
there's a lot of shaking up that we need

1465
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,400
to do about how we do science going

1466
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,099
forward and I really like the idea of

1467
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:31,500
using Consciousness science as a case

1468
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,980
study I think that's beautiful and thank

1469
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,280
you very much for making that lovely

1470
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,740
connection because it really locks

1471
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,059
together a lot of the things that I've

1472
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:44,160
been thinking about recently as well so

1473
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,839
there's my my parting

1474
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,720
it's a

1475
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,880
yeah I was also going to bring up the

1476
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,480
um

1477
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,460
these huge projects that you're a part

1478
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,599
of and that other people are part of

1479
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:56,400
it's really exciting to see so many

1480
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,839
people working together in these huge

1481
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,040
teams I feel like it just makes science

1482
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,380
so much more efficient and more careful

1483
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,540
so that's very cool

1484
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,300
another thing I'm hoping is that one the

1485
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,099
journalists don't get scared of covering

1486
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:10,640
Consciousness science from this I think

1487
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,900
like we'll learn from our mistakes and

1488
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,640
we'll move forward I I don't think we'll

1489
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,380
get scared but I hope that there's more

1490
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,119
coverage of this field

1491
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:20,400
um and I also hope that I mean something

1492
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,300
that I've noticed about science

1493
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,339
journalism is they really like to just

1494
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,619
have clear-cut findings because that's

1495
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,059
the simplest thing to communicate to

1496
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,760
people but I think we can as a society

1497
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,040
like learn to be comfortable with the

1498
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,960
ambiguity a little bit more

1499
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,760
um especially when it comes to conscious

1500
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,020
science like we might have found

1501
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,760
something but we're not sure and that's

1502
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,740
okay and that's science like it's okay

1503
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,260
if your headline isn't Snappy and

1504
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,020
clear it's important for it to be clear

1505
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,780
but snappy and I guess

1506
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,940
have one takeaway point it's okay if it

1507
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,920
doesn't have a takeaway point

1508
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,140
um yeah I think that's what I'm excited

1509
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:55,980
about

1510
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,720
New Era of science journalism

1511
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,000
well it sounds like

1512
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,819
bigger teams bigger Community more

1513
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:09,480
Theory more data more philosophy more

1514
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,079
ambiguity

1515
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,720
it'll be a great time

1516
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,400
more philosophy more ambiguity love it

1517
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,500
