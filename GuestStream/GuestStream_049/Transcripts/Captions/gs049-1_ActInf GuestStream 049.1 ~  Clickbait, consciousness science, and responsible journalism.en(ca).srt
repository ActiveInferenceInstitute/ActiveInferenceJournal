1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,456
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,392
It's July 26, 2023. We're here in

3
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:16,216
active inference Livestream 49.1

4
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:19,528
with Megan Peters and Nora Bradford. So

5
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:21,476
thank you both for joining. We're

6
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:23,700
looking forward to a presentation

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,932
followed by a discussion on clickbait

8
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,340
consciousness science and responsible

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,184
journalism. So, Megan, to you. Thank

10
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:34,992
you. And thanks so much, Daniel, for

11
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,896
having us. We're really happy to be here

12
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:39,632
and to chat about this. So I'll talk for

13
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:41,276
a little over ten minutes and then we'll

14
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,170
hopefully have a nice discussion here.

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,524
So, yeah, we're really happy to be here

16
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:47,110
because I think that this is a really

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,924
topical thing for us to be talking about

18
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:54,256
right now. It's very in the media. It's

19
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,548
really in response to the way the media

20
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:58,884
has been covering consciousness science

21
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:02,296
just in the past few weeks. So here we

22
00:01:02,318 --> 00:01:04,104
go. I'll have a few things to share with

23
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:06,344
you. Okay, so since we're talking about

24
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:09,228
consciousness science, let's start with

25
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:11,724
a provocative question. So you are

26
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:14,430
conscious. How is this possible?

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,320
How is it possible that your brain

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,476
creates the conscious experience of you?

29
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:22,848
And so this is a captivating, and it's a

30
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:24,912
stimulating kind of crazy question.

31
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:28,044
It's a really huge question. It borders

32
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:30,624
on the religious and spiritual in many

33
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:32,736
ways. It borders on the cutting edge of

34
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:35,044
physics in many ways. And so the study

35
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:36,356
of this question and the field of

36
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:38,672
consciousness science more generally,

37
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,512
it's really straddling the border

38
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:42,164
between the natural sciences and

39
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,644
philosophy and spirituality in a way

40
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:46,836
that a lot of other domains maybe don't

41
00:01:46,868 --> 00:01:49,912
need to do. And so, as a result, this

42
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,296
field of consciousness science, it

43
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:54,616
really captures the hearts and minds and

44
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:57,512
sometimes pretty wild imaginations of

45
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:59,292
all sorts of folks, as I said, from

46
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:01,100
psychologists and biologists and

47
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,372
neuroscientists all the way to computer

48
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:05,336
scientists and engineers to religious

49
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,580
and spiritual leaders. Basically anybody

50
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,932
who wonders about our origins or place

51
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:12,204
in the universe, why that we know that

52
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:14,168
we are here, why there is something that

53
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,864
it is like to be us. They are the people

54
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:18,512
who are interested in this question,

55
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:20,096
and that's probably a lot of people who

56
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,952
are listening and watching right now.

57
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:24,900
So it's actually really quite easy,

58
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,916
I think, to get swept up in the

59
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,430
sensational nature of this question.

60
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,844
Consciousness science is a really big

61
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:34,644
deal. It touches on so many aspects of

62
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:37,624
our everyday experience. And so this

63
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:39,848
kind of leads us to another version of

64
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:42,200
this question, which is, is this even

65
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,296
really science? Is this something that

66
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,376
can be even studied scientifically? Or

67
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:48,692
does it transcend beyond scientific

68
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:51,932
inquiry? Do consciousness scientists do

69
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:53,384
something that can be characterized

70
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:55,256
really as science? Or maybe they're

71
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:56,716
studying something that's a little bit

72
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:58,652
more on the border, like, I don't know,

73
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:01,564
telepathy or panpsychism,

74
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:04,272
like maybe rocks and trees are also

75
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:07,056
conscious. Wouldn't that be crazy? Or

76
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:09,296
maybe the vibrations of the mean that

77
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:12,496
the universe is conscious. So it kind of

78
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:14,752
quickly starts to feel a little fuzzy,

79
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,896
a little less scientific. And that's

80
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:20,564
what I want to talk about today, is that

81
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:22,724
perception and how that is kind of

82
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:24,724
exacerbated by the way that this field

83
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:26,208
is portrayed in the media and maybe what

84
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:29,496
we can do about it. Okay? And so all

85
00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:31,544
this means that consciousness science is

86
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:33,672
really difficult, not just to do

87
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:35,144
scientifically, and it is really

88
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,896
difficult, I promise you, but it's also

89
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:38,972
really difficult from a social

90
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:41,660
perspective. So more than for some other

91
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,824
fields, those of us who do consciousness

92
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:46,044
science and who study this

93
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:47,832
scientifically, we have a really crucial

94
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:50,076
and difficult responsibility, which is

95
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:52,524
to accurately and precisely communicate

96
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:54,268
the state of our field and its methods

97
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,524
and its discoveries and how it relates

98
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:58,656
to other fields, from physics to

99
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:01,980
medicine and beyond. And it's in

100
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,356
fact, so difficult that our field has

101
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,808
actually written a number of papers

102
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:09,156
about just how difficult it is. So this

103
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:13,552
is a fairly recent paper TS colleagues,

104
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,536
including many others. This is just from

105
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:19,576
a few years ago. And these papers, and

106
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:21,220
this one in particular, really highlight

107
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,208
why our field in specific has kind

108
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:27,896
of an uphill battle compared to a lot of

109
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,588
other areas of study, especially when it

110
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:32,876
comes to potential misrepresentation in

111
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,596
the media. So I thought that maybe in

112
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,196
order to drive this point home, I could

113
00:04:37,218 --> 00:04:39,292
actually give you some examples of how

114
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,796
consciousness science has been

115
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:43,296
misrepresented in the media so that we

116
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:44,896
can get a handle on this, we can see it

117
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,696
concretely. And as I'm giving you some

118
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:50,352
of these examples, I want you to try to

119
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:53,172
imagine how it would sound if the same

120
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,156
kinds of statements, the same kind of

121
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:57,012
sweeping claims were made about

122
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,520
discoveries in biology or chemistry,

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,312
neuroscience, climate science,

124
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,316
engineering, that kind of thing. All

125
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:05,444
right, let's do some examples. Here is

126
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:07,284
the first one. Okay, this is an example

127
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,144
which is actually 13 years old at this

128
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:11,736
point. As I think you'll see, maybe it

129
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:13,528
hasn't gotten so much better over the

130
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:16,616
past 13 years. But in this example, the

131
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:18,376
title Sizing of Consciousness by its

132
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:20,876
bits, we have Christoph Coke, who is an

133
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:22,156
expert on consciousness science at

134
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:24,524
Caltech, being quoted as saying, I love

135
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:27,352
his ideas. It's the only real promising

136
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,550
fundamental theory. And here,

137
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,424
deciding to present just this one

138
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:38,080
scientist's opinion as fact without

139
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,312
challenging it at all, without

140
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,408
presenting any other opinions at all,

141
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,216
I'll point out that this opinion was

142
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:44,608
actually not representative of the

143
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:46,516
consensus in the field at that time. It

144
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,468
was this one scientist's point of view,

145
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,228
and it's not actually representative of

146
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,470
the consensus in the field now either.

147
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,864
And so I want you to take this quote,

148
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:57,236
but I want you to replace consciousness

149
00:05:57,428 --> 00:06:00,644
with curing cancer. So this opinion

150
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,516
presented as fact is akin to writing

151
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:04,836
that one scientist theory about a cure

152
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:07,376
for cancer is the only really promising

153
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:10,056
fundamental theory for curing cancer.

154
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:12,604
And without presenting any other

155
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:14,636
possibilities that maybe more work needs

156
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:17,228
to be done or more experiments need to

157
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:19,996
be run. This is really hyperbolic. And

158
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:21,456
it seems like maybe this kind of

159
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:24,128
hyperbole would be hopefully at least a

160
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,616
little less likely to happen in

161
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:27,516
biomedicine, or at least would receive

162
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,664
more pushback if it were presented this

163
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:33,190
way. So here's another example,

164
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,364
and this one's a bit more recent. So

165
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:37,460
this one's from 2018.

166
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:47,430
The Is.

167
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,704
Okay, so the electrical activity that

168
00:06:53,742 --> 00:06:55,784
moves across neurons is sought by some

169
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:57,320
scientists to contribute to human

170
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,476
consciousness. This is like a perfectly

171
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:00,824
reasonable statement, right? Like

172
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:02,856
totally fine, totally legit. But then

173
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:04,604
the the journalist goes on to say, if

174
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:06,616
electrical activity is being disrupted

175
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:09,016
by anesthetic and plants too, causing

176
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:11,288
them to lose consciousness, does that

177
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,464
mean in some way that they are

178
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:15,664
conscious? Okay, so first of all,

179
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,348
these statements are pretty vague.

180
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:20,656
That's not really super surprising from

181
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:22,096
a popular science piece. And it's not

182
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,356
really the primary problem here, saying

183
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,572
that electricity that moves across

184
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:37,544
neurons thought to from

185
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,784
disruption of electrical activity to

186
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:42,344
plants being conscious. And this is

187
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:43,976
pretty sensational, kind of to the

188
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:46,052
extreme. And it makes this fuzzy border

189
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,496
between consciousness science and

190
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:49,176
pseudoscience, which is this border that

191
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:51,484
we are trying so hard to delete all the

192
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:54,364
time. It makes it even fuzzier. It gives

193
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:56,364
us an even harder problem to fight

194
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,536
against as consciousness. And this isn't

195
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,764
just happening 13 years ago, five years

196
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:04,270
ago. It's still why we're talking.

197
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,424
Just last month, there was this project

198
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,464
which was held in conjunction with the

199
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:12,288
association for the Scientific Study of

200
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:13,728
Consciousness annual meeting, which was

201
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,872
in New York City. And at this public

202
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,844
event, Christophe Coke, who you can see

203
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:19,456
here on the right, and Dave Chalmers

204
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:21,444
here's on the left, they presented their

205
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:23,664
25 year old bet about whether the neural

206
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,544
correlates of consciousness, the ones

207
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:27,204
that go up and down with consciousness

208
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,450
goes up and down, would be found.

209
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,344
And during this public event, some new

210
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:36,360
results were unveiled for the very first

211
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,268
time from one of the ongoing projects,

212
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:41,324
which was designed to challenge two of

213
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:42,956
the many theories about how

214
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:45,164
consciousness arises in the brain. And

215
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:47,064
those two theories are called the global

216
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:49,196
neuronal workspace theory and the

217
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:51,528
integrated information theory. And the

218
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:53,152
hot off the press results that were

219
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:56,556
shown in this event, they actually ended

220
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:58,304
up challenging both theories. They

221
00:08:58,342 --> 00:08:59,968
showed that the neural correlates of

222
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:02,032
consciousness are still unknown, that

223
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:03,516
neither theory was really strongly

224
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:04,816
supported by the data that were

225
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:08,340
collected, and so on. But that's not the

226
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,876
story. That's not exciting. And so

227
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:11,092
that's not the story that the press

228
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,108
told. And so here is what the media

229
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:16,368
actually said. Okay, so first we're

230
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:19,464
going to start with Nature. Nature, the

231
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:21,316
journalism side of this flagship

232
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:22,936
scientific journal. You'd hope that they

233
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,392
would be pretty careful about their

234
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:26,424
scientific journalism, but instead they

235
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:28,392
write taglines like this, like

236
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:31,676
Christophe Wagered Dave, 25 years ago

237
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:33,676
that researchers would learn how the

238
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,870
brain achieves consciousness by now,

239
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,396
but the quest continues. But this is

240
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:39,968
actually not what the bet was about.

241
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:42,076
The bet was about the neural correlates,

242
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:44,464
not the causal mechanisms, not the

243
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,716
generative production of consciousness.

244
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:50,656
And remember as good are

245
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:52,468
not the same thing. And there's always a

246
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:54,836
relevant Xkcd. And so I direct you to

247
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:57,956
this one here, but it

248
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:01,316
gets worse. So here's what science had

249
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:04,560
to say. Advocates of the losing

250
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,484
idea are not conceding yet. So again,

251
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,872
neither idea lost, remember? Or rather

252
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:12,456
both of them lost. Neither one of them

253
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,856
won. Nobody lost. Nobody won. And so why

254
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:16,452
would science say that one of them lost

255
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,664
or is even losing? That seems a little

256
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,904
over the top. And so it kind of makes

257
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:22,268
you wonder, are they like trying to

258
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:24,236
drive clicks? Or what is the point here

259
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,916
of sensationalizing quite to this

260
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:28,556
degree? It seems like a bad idea. It

261
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:30,124
seems like oversimplification that

262
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,896
actually changes the meaning of what was

263
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:35,472
presented. So here's another example.

264
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:38,924
This is from the economist. This article

265
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,784
largely reported on a different event

266
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:42,544
that was actually part of the ASSC like

267
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:44,324
primary meeting. But it still

268
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:47,108
capitalized on the buzz that this public

269
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:49,716
event, this evening event created. And

270
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:51,572
it opens with this really kind of

271
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:53,700
terrible twist of the actual

272
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,004
experimental design. So The Economist

273
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:59,144
article says top of the bill was the

274
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,856
announcement of the result of a so

275
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:03,160
called adversarial collaboration between

276
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,496
proponents of two hypotheses about the

277
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:07,608
nature of consciousness. Again, not what

278
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:08,808
the bet was about. It wasn't about the

279
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:10,510
nature of consciousness. But anyway,

280
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,116
this involved running a series of

281
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:15,704
experiments begun in 2020 to determine

282
00:11:15,752 --> 00:11:17,884
which, if either of them is correct.

283
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:19,436
But again, that's not what the

284
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,972
collaboration was designed to do,

285
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:23,356
right? In science, you can never prove

286
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:25,596
anything. You can never show you're

287
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:27,440
correct. You can only show that you are

288
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,476
not wrong or that you are wrong. That's

289
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:32,480
it. That's what you get in science.

290
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,380
Okay? So moreover,

291
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,508
all of these articles, the three that

292
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:41,350
I've shown you and a number of others,

293
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,436
they also contained essentially no

294
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,628
discussion of whether these two theories

295
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:48,712
global Neuronal Workspace Theory and

296
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,728
Integrated Information Theory, one of

297
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:53,304
which was losing, apparently, whether

298
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:54,344
they were the only ones worth

299
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:56,388
considering. So the articles didn't

300
00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:58,104
really discuss anything else, any other

301
00:11:58,142 --> 00:12:01,384
possible theories. In fact, the articles

302
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:03,468
called these two theories leading by the

303
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:05,016
media. But the truth is that they're

304
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,560
leading only in number of publications,

305
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,880
not in amount of scientific evidence

306
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,536
supporting them. They just have a lot of

307
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,664
publications out there. There's no

308
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:16,656
discussion in these articles beyond a

309
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:18,976
trivial passing mention that there are

310
00:12:18,998 --> 00:12:20,896
any other theories out there at all.

311
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:23,744
And especially that whether they are

312
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:24,848
viable or not, whether they're

313
00:12:24,864 --> 00:12:26,804
empirically supported. So here's some.

314
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:28,944
This isn't all of the empirically

315
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:30,644
supported theories of consciousness out

316
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,304
there. There's a really nice article

317
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:36,116
here by Anil Seth and Tim Bain that

318
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:37,688
came out last year that discusses a

319
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:39,256
bunch of these. And there's a really

320
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,200
nice article here by this group also

321
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,056
saying they actually looked at the

322
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,324
empirical support for different theories

323
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:48,616
of consciousness. How many papers are

324
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:50,344
out there that actually challenge versus

325
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:53,340
support each theory? And so this

326
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,636
landscape is the one that should be the

327
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:58,508
one to evaluate all of the results that

328
00:12:58,514 --> 00:13:00,684
were presented at this event. In it

329
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:01,964
means that even if one of the two

330
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:04,064
theories that this one project was

331
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,096
looking at, if one of them didn't make

332
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,112
the cut, that doesn't mean the other one

333
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,136
wins. And is right. It just means that

334
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,328
one of them maybe lost. And it didn't

335
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:16,276
even lose, remember? In fact. So in

336
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:18,260
addition to these really nice papers,

337
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,964
there's also a whole series of these

338
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:23,860
adversarial collaborations from the same

339
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,016
funding agency as the one that was shown

340
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:28,304
in this public event that are designed

341
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:30,152
to actually pit these theories against

342
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:32,520
each other in a pairwise fashion, in a

343
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,724
Thunderdome style. For all you Mad Max

344
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,232
fans out there, I love old school

345
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,636
Sci-Fi. And the idea here is that two

346
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:41,272
theories enter and one theory leaves.

347
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,980
One theory survives, but it doesn't win

348
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,836
because there's another round coming.

349
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:48,156
And so all of these nuances, they were

350
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:50,028
just unfortunately missing from all the

351
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,564
news coverage. And I understand that

352
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:54,096
news likes to get people to read it and

353
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:56,320
it likes to be sensational, but the

354
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,420
missing aspect of the missing nuance

355
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,104
really changes the meaning of what was

356
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:02,912
presented. And that's actually a really

357
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:06,228
big problem here. And why is this such a

358
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:07,684
problem, you might ask? I'm getting

359
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,484
myself all worked up here, right? So the

360
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:12,756
answer to why I'm getting all worked up

361
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:14,468
really comes back to what I presented in

362
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:15,684
the beginning, which is that we

363
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,124
consciousness scientists have this

364
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:19,176
uphill battle we constantly have to

365
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:20,520
fight to legitimize our research

366
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,156
program. And importantly, this isn't

367
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:24,996
just in the eyes of the public. So it's

368
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:26,312
not just in the eyes of the people

369
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,732
reading these articles who are not part

370
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:31,516
of this scientific sphere. It's also in

371
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,972
the eyes of the scientific community,

372
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:35,192
more generally, of our funding agencies,

373
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:37,052
and maybe most importantly, our close

374
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:40,760
peers within adjacent fields. So imagine

375
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,476
for a second that you are on a hiring

376
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,776
committee at a university and you read a

377
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,344
candidate's description of their

378
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:49,072
research program and it is about

379
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,964
consciousness science. They have pages

380
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:54,220
and pages and several publications, and

381
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,844
they maybe have a grant that's about

382
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,516
consciousness science. But you, as the

383
00:14:58,538 --> 00:15:00,052
member of the hiring committee, just

384
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:02,672
read this, this New York Times article

385
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,884
about how plants probably have

386
00:15:04,922 --> 00:15:07,364
consciousness. And so maybe your eyes

387
00:15:07,402 --> 00:15:09,272
are now rolling out of your head because

388
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,996
you've been primed to think this isn't

389
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:13,364
real, this is sensational, this isn't

390
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,404
something that can be studied

391
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:16,536
scientifically. You might as well be

392
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:18,216
talking about doing research on

393
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:20,056
telepathy. Is this really a colleague

394
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:22,332
that you want? So here's another

395
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:23,656
example. What if you're on a grant

396
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:25,836
review committee or you're reviewing a

397
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,032
paper and you just read these articles

398
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,044
in Science and in Nature that heavily

399
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:34,688
imply that there are only two real

400
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,928
theories of consciousness that have any

401
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:39,456
empirical support. But the paper or

402
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:41,584
grant that you're reviewing is not

403
00:15:41,622 --> 00:15:43,780
targeting either one of these theories.

404
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,110
So now maybe you see the problem here.

405
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,804
These journalism articles, they're not

406
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:52,324
just infuriating. They're really

407
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:54,436
actively damaging the legitimacy of our

408
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,356
field. They're cutting us off at the

409
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:58,744
knees in the eyes of our peers in terms

410
00:15:58,782 --> 00:16:00,756
of the financial support we can compete

411
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:03,256
for from granting agencies, in terms of

412
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:05,816
where we can publish our science. And by

413
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,496
the way, that science is state of the

414
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,848
art and cutting edge. We have a

415
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:11,748
responsibility, though, as people who

416
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:13,004
are doing this state of the art

417
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,116
consciousness science to try to work

418
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:16,828
with the media so that the reporting can

419
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,700
be more honest, so we can continue

420
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,164
working there as well. This is a two way

421
00:16:21,202 --> 00:16:23,232
street in some ways, but we also hope

422
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:25,392
that folks who are listening right now

423
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:27,056
will recognize this pattern the next

424
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:28,256
time you read an article about

425
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,144
consciousness science that maybe those

426
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:32,656
sensationalized claims are not exactly a

427
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:34,596
reflection of the state of art in the

428
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,996
field. Because here is the truth. This

429
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:38,864
is real consciousness science, modern

430
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:41,264
consciousness science. It's a collection

431
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:43,316
of basically every single state of the

432
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:45,104
art discipline and method of scientific

433
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:47,136
inquiry that you can think of. So my

434
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:48,856
version of consciousness science that I

435
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:51,336
do in my lab is a conglomeration of

436
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,044
cognitive sciences and computational

437
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:54,536
neuroscience and a little bit of

438
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:55,716
computer science, artificial

439
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,156
intelligence, machine learning thrown

440
00:16:57,188 --> 00:17:00,124
in. We also have heavy influences from

441
00:17:00,162 --> 00:17:02,412
philosophy and psychology and

442
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:03,916
engineering and a little bit of

443
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,736
metascience, and we have neuroimaging,

444
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:07,404
and we have statistics. And this is

445
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,576
really a representation of consciousness

446
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,580
science, not just in my research group,

447
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,184
but the consciousness science being done

448
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:15,376
worldwide by thousands of people.

449
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:17,056
Consciousness science is right at the

450
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,104
center, right at the heart, the very

451
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:20,556
bleeding edge of our collective

452
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:24,160
scientific understanding. So remember

453
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,196
when I put this slide up before and I

454
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,910
said that the study of this question

455
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,416
straddles the border between natural

456
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,468
sciences and philosophy in a way that a

457
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:34,116
lot of other domains maybe don't need to

458
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:36,036
do. And as a result, it captures our

459
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:37,844
imagination. It gets out there, it gets

460
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:39,828
into your brain and your mind and sticks

461
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:41,316
there in a way that some other fields

462
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:43,944
might not. But maybe you can see through

463
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:46,056
what I've talked about today that the

464
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,804
challenges with communicating the crux

465
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:51,196
of this question and in doing the

466
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:53,596
science itself, that actually makes the

467
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,736
people who are doing this pretty brave,

468
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:57,836
especially the younger trainees. When

469
00:17:57,858 --> 00:17:59,016
you think about it, they're fighting

470
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:00,832
this real uphill battle. So,

471
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:03,648
personally, me, I'm relatively safe. I

472
00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:05,856
have job security. If people don't take

473
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,488
me seriously when I say I'm a

474
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:09,552
consciousness scientist, that's their

475
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:12,476
loss, that's fine. But the younger

476
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,904
people, the trainees in the field,

477
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,228
those who are trying to get jobs, those

478
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:17,236
who are trying to push the envelope of

479
00:18:17,258 --> 00:18:19,396
what we know about our brains and our

480
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:22,436
minds and our awareness of ourselves in

481
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,356
this world, they've got a lot of

482
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:27,764
misperceptions to overcome. So if

483
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,736
you are excited and you want to know

484
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:32,296
more about the modern, exciting field of

485
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:34,296
consciousness Science, I suggest that

486
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:36,056
you head to the ASFC website. You can

487
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:37,204
have a look at the whole science

488
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:39,192
program. They've actually posted videos

489
00:18:39,246 --> 00:18:40,776
of the keynotes from this year, so

490
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:42,204
that's pretty cool. You can go and see

491
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:44,748
some of those. You can also check out

492
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:47,596
the plan for the future. And of course,

493
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,116
if I've inspired you even a little bit

494
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,824
to find out about consciousness science

495
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:53,136
yourself. Despite my kind of rant here,

496
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:55,776
I say welcome. Please come join us.

497
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,584
There's a lot of people doing some

498
00:18:57,622 --> 00:19:00,432
really cool stuff, really amazing, mind

499
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:02,192
blowing stuff, working to figure this

500
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:04,032
out. So please come join us.

501
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:06,692
Absolutely, the more the merrier. And so

502
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:10,036
I think I will stop there and just say

503
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,724
if you've enjoyed this talk or anything

504
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:14,452
that I said resonated with you, I've got

505
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:16,208
a real short little piece here. It's

506
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:18,064
about 800 words, so not a long homework

507
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,384
assignment. You can go and check that

508
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:22,216
out. So I think I'll stop and pass the

509
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:24,152
mic back to Daniel. And also welcome

510
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,632
Nora Bradford, who is a doctoral student

511
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:29,004
here at UC Irvine, who works in

512
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,020
Consciousness Science, but who also is

513
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,976
an accomplished science journalist who's

514
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,628
written articles in Scientific American

515
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:37,532
Science News, Discover, and many more.

516
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:38,990
So thanks very much.

517
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Laura, maybe to you for a first

518
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,136
reflection about what you see there or

519
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:52,528
how you came to be here. Yeah, sure.

520
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:55,652
Yeah. So I was at ASC and went to the

521
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:58,288
event that was associated with ASSC,

522
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:00,310
but not run by ASSC, just to be clear.

523
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,364
And it was really exciting to see

524
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:04,644
consciousness science kind of being

525
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:07,172
celebrated in the way that it was. I had

526
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:08,980
some issues with the event, but overall

527
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,664
I was very excited that it was getting

528
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:13,704
this public attention. Right. And then

529
00:20:13,742 --> 00:20:16,024
afterwards, I was again excited to see

530
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:18,060
that people were writing about my field,

531
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,740
because that journalism.

532
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,500
Things I'm immediately

533
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,210
disappointed by wrong.

534
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,136
Yeah. And I guess I started to think

535
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:36,256
about kind of why conscious science is

536
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:39,760
maybe a harder journalist to

537
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,268
cover. And I think there is just

538
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:44,068
probably a lot more controversy and a

539
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:47,750
lot more room for mistakes to be made

540
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,676
than perhaps in fields where the

541
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:52,676
research is more clear cut or more

542
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:55,992
easily interpretable. So, yeah,

543
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,424
I think there's a lot as journalists and

544
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:00,890
also as researchers from this.

545
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,544
Yeah. Can I just really quickly follow

546
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:07,236
up and say I think that, Nora, you're

547
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:09,850
spot on by saying that,

548
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,044
by presenting the idea that it's the

549
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:15,436
interpretation that's part of the

550
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,356
problem here. It's not just that people

551
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:19,196
are maybe getting facts wrong when

552
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:20,740
they're writing about this field. It's

553
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,592
that the interpretations are really

554
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,944
nuanced, they're really difficult to get

555
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:27,184
right, and it's really easy for an

556
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:28,704
oversimplification to end up

557
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:30,816
fundamentally changing the meaning in

558
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:33,216
this space in a way that maybe doesn't

559
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,044
occur quite as often in some other

560
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:35,860
fields.

561
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,308
Yeah, that's really interesting to kind

562
00:21:40,314 --> 00:21:44,004
of disentangle the features that make

563
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:47,572
this a unique, although also exemplary

564
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:51,012
case of communicating challenging ideas.

565
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,112
I mean, the first that presents itself

566
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,960
to me is just how much is on the table?

567
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,852
Whose pain matters? Whose experiences or

568
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:02,796
what experiences even matter? What's the

569
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:04,380
difference between a who and a what?

570
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,412
This is the real question. If something

571
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:09,016
doesn't have an experience, then there's

572
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:11,376
no feeling. But if something does have

573
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,456
an experience, then it's a feeling and

574
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:16,944
it's a morally culpable or something

575
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:19,776
that we're responsible for treating in

576
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,276
an ethical way. So it's like whether or

577
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:23,844
not it's always brought up in those

578
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:27,508
articles, the stakes are so high,

579
00:22:27,674 --> 00:22:30,432
whereas whether a given molecular

580
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:33,860
compound does this molecular interaction

581
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,928
is closer to the objective. Whereas this

582
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:41,016
is the ultimate subjective question,

583
00:22:41,118 --> 00:22:44,170
seemingly. Sure, yeah,

584
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,916
I agree with you definitely that the

585
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,432
ethical stakes, the moral implications

586
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:52,584
of this field are just staggering.

587
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:55,324
And certainly it's not unique in that

588
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:57,416
way that the ethical and moral

589
00:22:57,448 --> 00:22:59,616
implications of sociological research or

590
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:01,616
of climate science or of many other

591
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:03,516
domains also have these staggering

592
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:07,600
implications. I think one of the

593
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,784
biggest challenges that we have is not

594
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,984
just in the interpretation of objective

595
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:15,876
data, but exactly, as you've just said,

596
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:17,600
that this is the ultimate subjectivity,

597
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,700
that the thing that we are studying by

598
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,984
its definition is not objectively

599
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:25,368
observable. And that is

600
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:28,856
absolutely something that is at

601
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:30,916
least you can design measurement tools

602
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:32,520
in a way that have different

603
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,528
philosophical foundations in basically

604
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,464
every other field. But by its very

605
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:39,416
nature, by the definition of subjective

606
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:41,276
experience, we cannot design a

607
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:42,892
measurement tool that actually says,

608
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,668
what is it like to be you? That's kind

609
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:50,364
of the whole problem. But your

610
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:51,644
points also about the ethical

611
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:54,512
implications in medicine, the difference

612
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,216
between a who and a what. I think that

613
00:23:57,238 --> 00:23:58,784
that's also really important to bring

614
00:23:58,822 --> 00:24:02,588
up, that here we are trying to I've

615
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:03,924
presented this as like we want to

616
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:05,732
understand consciousness. And I never

617
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:08,116
really defined consciousness. I just

618
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:09,444
said, like, here's consciousness and

619
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,124
here's an umbrella term and you take

620
00:24:11,162 --> 00:24:14,904
that kind of how you want. But it's true

621
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:16,696
that consciousness science spans all the

622
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:20,632
way from wakefulness versus coma or

623
00:24:20,686 --> 00:24:22,564
locked in syndrome or traumatic brain

624
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:25,960
injury. Anesthesia all the way through

625
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,688
to is a baby conscious? Is a fetus

626
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:31,868
conscious? Is an AI conscious? Is a

627
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:34,270
cockroach or your dog,

628
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,744
or 200 years ago, people might argue

629
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,684
that children were less conscious than

630
00:24:40,722 --> 00:24:42,496
adults and so it was okay to hit your

631
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:44,176
children because they wouldn't feel it

632
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:47,136
as much or something. And so there's a

633
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:49,456
lot of sociological and ethical and

634
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:52,496
moral implication in everything that

635
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:55,968
we're doing. Which is why one of the

636
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:58,004
reason I've chosen this field, too, is

637
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,956
that it really scratches a lot of

638
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:01,824
intellectual itch. But it also feels

639
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:03,860
really important, especially right now,

640
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,892
with the rise of machine intelligence

641
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:10,312
and with ongoing debates about animal or

642
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:13,000
fetal consciousness that really bear

643
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,964
extreme impact on legislation,

644
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:20,188
on moral decisions that we make as a

645
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:23,516
people. So, yeah, it's a big thing that

646
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:26,508
we're doing. I'm a little biased, but it

647
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:29,708
is a big thing. And I would add that

648
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,224
even if researchers are sometimes good

649
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:33,696
at explaining what they mean by

650
00:25:33,718 --> 00:25:35,456
consciousness in their research, like to

651
00:25:35,478 --> 00:25:38,208
a journalist, say, the journalists are

652
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:39,664
not always necessarily great at

653
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:41,936
communicating that to the public through

654
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,756
their writing. And I get why that would

655
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:47,172
be hard. It can be clunky, it can be

656
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:49,636
awkward and unappealing to explain. But

657
00:25:49,738 --> 00:25:52,752
that is crucial because people readers

658
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:54,696
can take it however they want based on

659
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:56,472
how they're interpreting the word

660
00:25:56,526 --> 00:25:59,192
consciousness. So I think that's super

661
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,756
important to address if you're writing

662
00:26:00,788 --> 00:26:01,880
about consciousness.

663
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,730
Yeah, it's really a field that's kind of

664
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,750
a leading indicator because,

665
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,320
especially if approached in a scientific

666
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,880
way, in our current setting,

667
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,264
a scientific understanding of X is what

668
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:24,080
shapes evidence driven policy about X.

669
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,032
So I guess this leads to what is

670
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,436
or would or could be a science driven

671
00:26:31,468 --> 00:26:32,996
approach. Like, how do we know it when

672
00:26:33,018 --> 00:26:35,920
we see it? When someone is approaching

673
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,304
this question from a scientific

674
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,996
perspective, what would each of you say

675
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:44,148
to this? Well, I'm going to give kind of

676
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:46,344
the stock answer, which is that you want

677
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:48,872
to have objective measures that are

678
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:52,536
valid and reliable, but the big one is

679
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,416
falsifiability and that's any student of

680
00:26:55,438 --> 00:26:57,384
science going back to grade. School is

681
00:26:57,422 --> 00:26:58,844
going to learn a little bit about that,

682
00:26:58,882 --> 00:27:01,116
which is that if you've got a theory or

683
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:04,956
you've got a hypothesis about how,

684
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:07,944
let's say, the brain generates

685
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:09,448
consciousness, or even going back to

686
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,516
just correlates, just like, which bits

687
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:15,340
of the brain are correlated

688
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,948
in their activity with whether you're

689
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:19,456
more conscious or less conscious. So

690
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:22,976
let's keep it really very basic. You

691
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:24,788
need to have it be falsifiable. You need

692
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:27,556
to say it's this area of the brain that

693
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:30,116
will correlate and not that area of the

694
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:33,344
brain. And the recognition

695
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:35,204
that an absence of evidence is not

696
00:27:35,242 --> 00:27:37,032
evidence of absence is also really

697
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:39,496
crucial to this idea, which is that just

698
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:41,656
because I failed to measure a

699
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:44,248
correspondence between the activity and

700
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:45,256
the bit of the brain, that I

701
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,776
hypothesized and some measure of

702
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,550
awareness that I get from self report

703
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,656
doesn't mean that that area of the brain

704
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:55,068
isn't doing the work. It just means that

705
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:57,036
our machines are terrible or that our

706
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,008
measure sucks. And honestly,

707
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:01,440
despite the state of the art

708
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,856
measurements that we do have, we have

709
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:07,052
millimeter level precision in humans,

710
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:09,516
we have cellular level precision in non

711
00:28:09,548 --> 00:28:11,456
human animals, we can record a lot of

712
00:28:11,478 --> 00:28:14,916
stuff, and we have a lot

713
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:16,340
of really fancy machine learning

714
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,292
algorithms to help us extract what that

715
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:21,556
stuff means. To go from super high

716
00:28:21,578 --> 00:28:23,444
dimensional noisy data down to something

717
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:25,684
that we can maybe make the argument is

718
00:28:25,722 --> 00:28:28,724
interpretable. Interpretable.

719
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:32,468
Yeah. But just because you didn't

720
00:28:32,484 --> 00:28:33,796
find what you were looking for doesn't

721
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,384
mean that it's not there. It just means

722
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,904
that you were maybe looking in the wrong

723
00:28:36,942 --> 00:28:38,808
place or that you were looking using the

724
00:28:38,814 --> 00:28:42,204
wrong tool. And so these kind of go

725
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:44,172
hand in hand because on the one hand,

726
00:28:44,226 --> 00:28:45,516
you want your hypothesis to be

727
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:47,836
falsifiable, so you aren't allowed to

728
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:49,096
just say, oh, well, I just wasn't

729
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,488
looking for it the right way, so I'm

730
00:28:50,504 --> 00:28:52,416
just going to revise how I'm looking and

731
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:53,744
try again. And therefore I'm still

732
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:56,224
right. You need to design your

733
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:58,688
experiments and your theories such that

734
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:01,696
if you find a particular result, a

735
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:03,012
positive result, then it actually

736
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:05,412
disproves your theory as opposed to just

737
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:07,284
failing to provide support for your

738
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:10,630
theory. So I think that

739
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,300
those and other kind of standard

740
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,444
criteria that you might find in any Stem

741
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,656
classroom that demonstrate the

742
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:20,890
scientific method, those are probably

743
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,024
the definitions that I would fall back

744
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,184
on. And I think that consciousness and

745
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,264
science, broadly speaking, the stuff

746
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:30,636
that is present at the ASC, it does all

747
00:29:30,658 --> 00:29:33,884
of that, it absolutely does. It's the

748
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:35,720
same caliber of computational

749
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,444
neuroscience and neuroimaging and

750
00:29:38,562 --> 00:29:40,972
psychological psychophysics measurement

751
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:44,176
and logical philosophy approaches that

752
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:45,996
you would find at any other flagship

753
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:49,330
conference in the world. Yeah.

754
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,704
And I would say if you're reading an

755
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:56,432
article rather than like a journal

756
00:29:56,496 --> 00:29:57,924
paper, like if you're reading something

757
00:29:58,042 --> 00:30:00,688
in the press, the way to know if it's

758
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,804
trustworthy or not, or one way is if

759
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,920
it's making sensational claims, like

760
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,736
claiming to have found the root of

761
00:30:07,758 --> 00:30:10,152
consciousness or some really large

762
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:14,250
claim. It's probably not true. I think

763
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,516
that wouldn't happen in one study, I'm

764
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,072
assuming. So just read with a skeptical

765
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:23,420
eye and if you feel

766
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,740
comfortable, try to read the primary,

767
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,836
like get inspired by the press. But if

768
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:31,596
you feel like there's something off,

769
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:33,436
just go to the primary literature and

770
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,296
see what's up and see if you can

771
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:36,188
interpret it for yourself. It's

772
00:30:36,204 --> 00:30:38,928
understandable if you can't, but yeah,

773
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:40,656
that's what I would say. That's a good

774
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:43,216
rule of thumb, Nora, that one study is

775
00:30:43,238 --> 00:30:46,836
never going to be the answer in any not

776
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:49,568
just ours, but it's easy to get swept

777
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:52,036
away in the sensational claims and to be

778
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,364
like, OOH, they found the neural cause

779
00:30:55,482 --> 00:30:58,968
of probably. Yeah,

780
00:30:59,134 --> 00:31:00,424
yeah. And I would say like pre

781
00:31:00,462 --> 00:31:01,928
registration also. I mean, Megan, I

782
00:31:01,934 --> 00:31:03,736
don't know what your rule of thumb is

783
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:06,090
for this, but if people,

784
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,496
you know, plan for the study and how

785
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:10,696
they're going to analyze it ahead of

786
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:12,236
time, that is usually a really good

787
00:31:12,258 --> 00:31:13,436
sign. I mean, basically what you're just

788
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,564
saying, but just like stamp of we

789
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:17,148
promise we did this. Ahead of time kind

790
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:19,868
of thing avoids.

791
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:23,488
Harking after the fact, right?

792
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:26,880
Yeah, it was kind of cool to see

793
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,320
metascience and also

794
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,320
maybe kind of bibliographic analyses

795
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,636
looking at different trends in

796
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:37,568
literature, but then also going beyond

797
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:40,132
the peer reviewed literature to looking

798
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:42,644
at the real trends that influence people

799
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:48,088
who are outside of the profession. And I

800
00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:50,104
don't know if canary in the coal mine is

801
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:53,832
the right bird in the right niche here,

802
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:58,380
but it's like proposing unobservables

803
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,928
is commonplace in research, like latent

804
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:04,188
cause analysis and any kind of

805
00:32:04,194 --> 00:32:07,804
structural equation modeling. And here

806
00:32:07,922 --> 00:32:12,540
is the tour de force of unobservables,

807
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,544
maybe that which is defined as

808
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:16,512
unobservables. And so it's actually like

809
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:19,136
a space to bring up all these pieces of

810
00:32:19,158 --> 00:32:21,916
epistemic hygiene about from

811
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:25,232
preregistration to the pace and the tone

812
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,684
of the scientific community and

813
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:30,964
questions of multidisciplinarity in

814
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:31,590
research.

815
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,288
And then there's a heart at the

816
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:39,096
intersection of the Venn diagram where

817
00:32:39,118 --> 00:32:40,756
it kind of all comes together. It's

818
00:32:40,788 --> 00:32:43,512
like, well, this synthesis cannot happen

819
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:45,352
without all these pieces. If we're not

820
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,288
having philosophers in conversation with

821
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:49,816
the statisticians, then this synthesis

822
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:52,216
can't happen. Now, maybe the synthesis

823
00:32:52,248 --> 00:32:54,268
that you care about doesn't need that,

824
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:57,164
but we care about this and this

825
00:32:57,202 --> 00:32:59,496
synthesis requires it. So we need to

826
00:32:59,538 --> 00:33:01,552
develop the approaches and the

827
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:04,210
communication around that.

828
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,052
It's really a tip of the spear effort

829
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,948
even apart from the consequences of the

830
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:15,104
research. What a heartwarming

831
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:17,350
sentiment. Thank you for sharing that.

832
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,712
I love the phrase epistemic hygiene

833
00:33:21,776 --> 00:33:25,096
because that is so crucial, I think, to

834
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:28,680
every field. But it's like particularly

835
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,170
aggressively exposed in this field,

836
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,324
which is exactly why I think that my

837
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:41,304
science has benefited so powerfully

838
00:33:41,432 --> 00:33:43,004
from close collaboration with

839
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:45,388
philosophers and with statisticians. I

840
00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:47,084
mean, this is kind of the space that I

841
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:49,844
live in here in the cognitive sciences

842
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:52,972
department is we're halfway between AI

843
00:33:53,036 --> 00:33:55,056
and philosophy and psychology and

844
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:58,076
neuroscience and engineering and it's

845
00:33:58,108 --> 00:33:59,552
kind of at, like where all these things

846
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:01,324
come together. But then this metascience

847
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,764
thing, I'm happy that you picked up on

848
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:05,972
that because I think that it's also

849
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:09,792
really the bibliometric analyses

850
00:34:09,856 --> 00:34:13,060
are really critical and we're at this

851
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,572
crazy spot and have been for a long time

852
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:18,536
now. But I think it's really coming to a

853
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:22,456
head where the vast majority of

854
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,104
our scientific knowledge is not

855
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:25,988
accessible to any one researcher simply

856
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:28,280
because there's so much of it, right?

857
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,472
You can't read all of the literature.

858
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,784
You can't even read all the literature

859
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:34,830
that's in your tiny little corner. And

860
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,060
consciousness science, like many other

861
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,948
fields in this way, actually is one of

862
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,516
those that brings together a lot of

863
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,020
different fields. So it makes it even

864
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,056
harder for you to keep up with the

865
00:34:45,078 --> 00:34:46,304
things that are going to be really

866
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:47,824
relevant. I mean, you have to keep up

867
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:50,672
with the cutting edge tools in

868
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:54,180
neuroimaging data analysis, plus the

869
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,496
epistemic hygiene that the philosophers

870
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,504
are going to bring, plus cutting edge

871
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:01,652
behavioral paradigms and what they mean

872
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:06,208
in naturalistic data collection

873
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,704
settings. So that you're not just

874
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:09,032
saying, oh, I've discovered something

875
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:11,304
fundamental about consciousness by

876
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,416
showing you gabor patches all day? And I

877
00:35:13,438 --> 00:35:15,624
say this as someone who shows people

878
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:19,988
gabor patches all day, but it's

879
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,916
a real challenge to bring together all

880
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:23,484
these things. And maybe you're right.

881
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,836
Maybe that consciousness science is I

882
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:27,224
don't know about the canary in the cold

883
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:29,976
mine, so to speak, but maybe you're

884
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:33,376
right that it's one of the places where

885
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,244
you can really see all these cogs

886
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:38,336
working together to come at one major

887
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:41,312
question. Or maybe you don't quite see

888
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:43,468
the need for that hygiene in some other

889
00:35:43,494 --> 00:35:45,604
fields, yet it still is. There like

890
00:35:45,642 --> 00:35:48,484
latent cause analysis is not just

891
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,512
something that we do in consciousness

892
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:52,964
science or neuroscience. We do it in

893
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:55,784
economics, we do it in sociology. We do

894
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:58,696
it, like, everywhere. And so having a

895
00:35:58,718 --> 00:36:01,912
real handle on how to design stuff that

896
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:03,556
actually asks the questions that you're

897
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:07,224
interested in is something that I

898
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,772
find that I have to continuously work

899
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:11,980
hard to keep in my sights.

900
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,516
And I'm lucky that we've got a pile of

901
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:16,796
philosophers that we get to hang out

902
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:20,364
with who blow into your talk and

903
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:21,856
say everything that you just said is

904
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:23,184
wrong. And here's why. Here's this

905
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,768
logical hole in what you've done. And

906
00:36:24,774 --> 00:36:27,136
they're right. And it's great because it

907
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:28,530
makes the science better.

908
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,860
And you don't typically get philosophers

909
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,964
blowing into a talk in a lot of other

910
00:36:37,002 --> 00:36:40,788
fields. It doesn't happen. And I

911
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:43,924
think it should. We all

912
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:48,250
have that inroad to our experience.

913
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,680
So it's something that integrates across

914
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,584
disciplines, kind of even cast the

915
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:57,608
disciplinary organizational paradigm

916
00:36:57,704 --> 00:37:01,836
into at least critical light and

917
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:04,984
then goes even outside of academia

918
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:08,940
because these are what people search

919
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,400
engine for and language model,

920
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,936
discuss. And I think it is one of

921
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,452
these. It's like an itch that some can't

922
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:23,012
scratch with this inscrutable and

923
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:26,324
ineffable nature that does verge into

924
00:37:26,362 --> 00:37:29,876
the mystical. So what do we do with the

925
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:35,000
huge mystery that

926
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,948
makes it a training and exhibition

927
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:42,584
field? Again, that's not just

928
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:47,564
important, but is kind of the

929
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:51,116
archetype of how do

930
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:54,876
you have a multidecade conversation with

931
00:37:54,978 --> 00:37:57,980
potentially non compatible theorizing?

932
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,748
Whereas in many of the physical

933
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:02,736
sciences, including physical or

934
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:04,512
reductionist perspectives on

935
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:08,224
neuroscience, threads open and

936
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:11,056
close, little bit quicker, little bit

937
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:15,104
easier, tend to not delve

938
00:38:15,152 --> 00:38:18,372
into ancient history, tend to not

939
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,112
need to invoke world knowledge

940
00:38:20,176 --> 00:38:24,132
traditions. So that makes

941
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:26,288
it fun. It makes it fun and useful. And

942
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:28,504
if something's fun and useful, what

943
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,264
secret third thing are we looking for

944
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:32,996
exactly? Sounds like if you weren't

945
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:34,692
already a consciousness scientist,

946
00:38:34,756 --> 00:38:36,970
maybe we've converted you a little bit.

947
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,830
As only a bug doctor. I did

948
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,108
one work on the Ant colony and

949
00:38:46,194 --> 00:38:48,956
definitions of consciousness, and we

950
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:51,376
didn't come down on the issue of whether

951
00:38:51,478 --> 00:38:53,696
the nest mates are conscious under what

952
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:57,408
definition or the colony. But more

953
00:38:57,494 --> 00:39:00,224
pointed out, well, if you define it

954
00:39:00,262 --> 00:39:02,444
according to some mammalian

955
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:04,692
neuroanatomy, then you kind of already

956
00:39:04,746 --> 00:39:06,132
know what the answer is going to be.

957
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:08,336
It's going to be no. And if you define

958
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:12,464
it according to a specific primate

959
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:15,104
centered symbolic communication

960
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,368
approach, again, you know what that's

961
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:18,504
going to be? It's no. If you define it

962
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:21,204
based upon some generic informational

963
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:24,936
property, then you already know

964
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:25,976
what it's going to be. It's going to be

965
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:29,004
on that continuum. And so we kind of

966
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:31,628
tried to flip the approach by instead of

967
00:39:31,714 --> 00:39:36,940
asking which feature

968
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,628
would help us differentiate whether the

969
00:39:39,634 --> 00:39:41,376
ant colony is conscious or not, we just

970
00:39:41,398 --> 00:39:42,928
said, let's just look at what the

971
00:39:42,934 --> 00:39:45,184
features that people are using and then

972
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:48,224
ask whether colony is. But we don't have

973
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:52,604
the 1 meter metal bar for consciousness.

974
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:54,084
So again, it's like, well, let's say

975
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:56,836
seven out of ten that we observed. We

976
00:39:56,858 --> 00:39:58,432
don't know how many other unproposed

977
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,532
theories there are. So seven out of ten

978
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:03,940
could be total sampling bias.

979
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,384
Even if it was ten out of ten, then what

980
00:40:07,422 --> 00:40:09,992
would that type of consensus really

981
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:10,810
mean?

982
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,970
And that's where our road took us.

983
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,390
And I saw that conclusion as like,

984
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,540
a chance to broaden the discussion.

985
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,748
But discussions are not only about

986
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:30,764
broadening, because there's real

987
00:40:30,802 --> 00:40:32,784
decisions that are being made. So it

988
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:35,520
can't only be yes.

989
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,728
And and I think that when you connect it

990
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:39,696
back to falsification and all of these

991
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:41,730
other properties, that's where we get

992
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,980
the winnowing. But it's those two

993
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,756
complementary conversations, like the

994
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:50,080
broader inclusion of perspectives

995
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,876
that expands the space that we can

996
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:55,428
comprehend and then the diligence

997
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:58,552
that also shrinks it back down and

998
00:40:58,686 --> 00:41:01,384
somehow will zigzag to better and better

999
00:41:01,582 --> 00:41:02,760
understandings.

1000
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,716
You your point about we

1001
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:14,348
don't have a yardstick, we don't have a

1002
00:41:14,354 --> 00:41:16,844
metal rod, right, that know how

1003
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:19,304
conscious I mean, like, according to

1004
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:21,968
some folks, we have that metal rod, and

1005
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:23,392
we've surpassed that with, for example,

1006
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:24,960
large language models.

1007
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,568
And we're not just talking particular

1008
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,436
Google engineers who decide to get

1009
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,384
really excited about how their pet

1010
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:36,816
language model is conscious. We're

1011
00:41:36,848 --> 00:41:40,068
talking any kind of

1012
00:41:40,234 --> 00:41:42,036
reasonable interpretation of the old

1013
00:41:42,058 --> 00:41:46,004
school Turing test would be passed

1014
00:41:46,132 --> 00:41:48,584
by existing language models right now,

1015
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:50,136
in fact, arguably, it might have been

1016
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:53,944
passed long ago with Eliza in,

1017
00:41:53,982 --> 00:41:57,848
like, the if it wasn't passed

1018
00:41:57,944 --> 00:41:59,996
with Eliza, then certainly it has been

1019
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,604
passed now. But I think that there is a

1020
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:05,836
growing understanding that information

1021
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:08,652
processing capacity and intelligence are

1022
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:10,628
not the same thing as internal

1023
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:13,376
phenomenal experience, and that the

1024
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,488
tests that we have, to the extent that

1025
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,052
we have any tests at all, are woefully

1026
00:42:17,116 --> 00:42:20,124
inadequate and, as you said, are locked

1027
00:42:20,172 --> 00:42:24,032
to particular implementations. So you

1028
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:25,876
can't apply the mammalian test for

1029
00:42:25,898 --> 00:42:28,324
consciousness, like, oh, I'm looking for

1030
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:30,292
this particular neural signature, which

1031
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:31,556
tells me whether the monkey is

1032
00:42:31,578 --> 00:42:33,252
anesthetized or not, and I can't apply

1033
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:35,268
that to ants and expect it to work.

1034
00:42:35,434 --> 00:42:36,792
It's not going to tell me anything

1035
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:39,256
useful there. Can't necessarily apply it

1036
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:41,416
to octopuses either for the record. So

1037
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:43,636
we're not even going insects. We're

1038
00:42:43,668 --> 00:42:45,684
going other arguably incredibly

1039
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:48,744
intelligent beings that can open jars

1040
00:42:48,792 --> 00:42:51,052
and be sneaky and do all sorts of cool

1041
00:42:51,106 --> 00:42:54,476
stuff and

1042
00:42:54,498 --> 00:42:56,860
that have complex social interactions

1043
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,944
and are basically aliens. This is

1044
00:43:01,062 --> 00:43:04,192
my professional scientific opinion here,

1045
00:43:04,326 --> 00:43:05,984
but they basically are, right? Like,

1046
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:07,564
they're so fundamentally, physically

1047
00:43:07,612 --> 00:43:09,664
different from us. And so any

1048
00:43:09,702 --> 00:43:11,456
consciousness ometer that we develop for

1049
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:13,876
us or that applies in monkeys or even in

1050
00:43:13,898 --> 00:43:16,116
dogs or cats is not really going to

1051
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:19,632
apply there. And so differentiating

1052
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:21,780
tests for intelligence, from tests from

1053
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,260
inner experience is a really difficult

1054
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,392
problem. And then there's the third

1055
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:28,136
problem, which is a test for whether we

1056
00:43:28,158 --> 00:43:30,504
attribute consciousness to an agent,

1057
00:43:30,702 --> 00:43:32,980
which, if you saw the movie Ex Machina,

1058
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,730
is the Garland test.

1059
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,016
So that's do never mind whether it

1060
00:43:39,038 --> 00:43:40,904
actually has consciousness, do I

1061
00:43:40,942 --> 00:43:43,340
attribute consciousness to it? Because

1062
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,496
that is going to change how we interact

1063
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:46,904
with it and the rights that we ascribe

1064
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:48,904
to it and so on. And so I think we're

1065
00:43:49,032 --> 00:43:51,390
well past the point at which we need to

1066
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,856
get a better handle on this. Some of the

1067
00:43:53,878 --> 00:43:56,224
stuff that I'm working on right now is

1068
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,112
moving in this direction. Not just me

1069
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:59,936
and a huge group of lots of other

1070
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,444
people. And I think Joshua Bengio gave

1071
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:07,140
testimony to Congress, like today about

1072
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,544
the need for increased regulatory

1073
00:44:10,592 --> 00:44:14,676
oversight of who has access to

1074
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:17,204
so called artificial intelligence models

1075
00:44:17,252 --> 00:44:20,472
so that we can better understand how

1076
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:21,944
their implementation and their

1077
00:44:21,982 --> 00:44:24,084
interaction with humans might exacerbate

1078
00:44:24,132 --> 00:44:25,944
biases or cause all sorts of other

1079
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:28,936
problems. So you can actually go and

1080
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,008
read his testimony that he gave. I don't

1081
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:34,590
remember where the link is. Go find it.

1082
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,776
But he had a summary and then he linked

1083
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:38,556
to the testimony. And I think that

1084
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:40,848
having folks like Yahshua and other

1085
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:43,232
giants in the field speaking out about

1086
00:44:43,286 --> 00:44:46,688
the need for actually tackling this and

1087
00:44:46,774 --> 00:44:48,236
this isn't just a philosopher's

1088
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,040
playground to talk about consciousness.

1089
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,324
This is, as you said, the testing bed

1090
00:44:54,362 --> 00:44:55,844
for where the rest of science is going.

1091
00:44:55,882 --> 00:44:59,430
And it's also very topical right now.

1092
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,320
So what does that healthy

1093
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,112
conversation look like in the case of

1094
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:12,644
the synthetic intelligences and language

1095
00:45:12,692 --> 00:45:14,250
models and all of this?

1096
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,812
What does that continuum look like

1097
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:22,072
between the actual measures and proxies

1098
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:26,444
that we use in research and what

1099
00:45:26,482 --> 00:45:30,288
memes or themes or words that I

1100
00:45:30,374 --> 00:45:33,052
guess, by definition aren't popular

1101
00:45:33,116 --> 00:45:36,156
today, like big data wasn't popular till

1102
00:45:36,188 --> 00:45:40,192
it was. So something

1103
00:45:40,246 --> 00:45:43,540
like what has to come on the scene and

1104
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,988
come into the lab, do you think, to

1105
00:45:46,154 --> 00:45:49,872
support the kind of work and knowledge

1106
00:45:49,936 --> 00:45:52,150
that either of you would want to see?

1107
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,048
This isn't an answer to your question,

1108
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:00,904
but it just reminded me of one thing

1109
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:04,052
that we need less of, is people writing

1110
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:06,056
about these interactions with AI that

1111
00:46:06,078 --> 00:46:08,104
are like, my AI told me that it wanted

1112
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:10,468
to get married, or like, my AI,

1113
00:46:10,564 --> 00:46:13,244
whatever. It's not useful. It's not

1114
00:46:13,282 --> 00:46:15,976
news. Stop reporting about it. That's

1115
00:46:16,008 --> 00:46:17,084
all I have to say. Okay. Go ahead,

1116
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:20,224
Megan. No, I wanted you to take this

1117
00:46:20,262 --> 00:46:21,744
too, because I think that this question

1118
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:25,090
is about communication in a way that

1119
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,644
you're much more embedded in the science

1120
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:30,768
communication space than I am. And so

1121
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:34,144
for I think one

1122
00:46:34,262 --> 00:46:37,012
possible way to go about this that maybe

1123
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:40,224
you can speak to would be what kinds

1124
00:46:40,352 --> 00:46:41,748
you're Daniel, you're talking about what

1125
00:46:41,754 --> 00:46:43,412
do we need to bring into the lab? Maybe

1126
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:45,768
communication tools is one of those or

1127
00:46:45,854 --> 00:46:48,152
ways of communicating this science ways

1128
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:51,656
of and to different audiences. And so

1129
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:54,040
maybe, Nora, you've got some ideas.

1130
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,328
You've done so much in this space. I

1131
00:46:56,334 --> 00:47:00,396
don't I mean, I guess what

1132
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:01,724
we've been talking about with people who

1133
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:03,660
study human consciousness,

1134
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,684
people who study consciousness and other

1135
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:09,436
entities as well, just being clear about

1136
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:11,516
what you mean by consciousness. Do you

1137
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:13,276
mean a subjective experience? Do you

1138
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:16,930
mean basically is a light on or off?

1139
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,840
Do you mean awake versus asleep?

1140
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,472
Just being really clear about what level

1141
00:47:23,526 --> 00:47:25,668
you're talking at, I think is really

1142
00:47:25,834 --> 00:47:27,748
helpful. Again, when you're just

1143
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:29,616
presenting your research, whether it's

1144
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:30,948
on Twitter or you're talking to a

1145
00:47:30,954 --> 00:47:34,276
journalist, really being clear cut about

1146
00:47:34,298 --> 00:47:36,504
that so that people can't make kind of

1147
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:38,824
extrapolations from your work that your

1148
00:47:38,862 --> 00:47:41,896
work doesn't cover I don't know what

1149
00:47:41,918 --> 00:47:44,836
else? Yeah, I guess just being willing

1150
00:47:44,868 --> 00:47:46,376
to also talk about your work. I feel

1151
00:47:46,398 --> 00:47:48,684
like a lot of data science feels pretty

1152
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:51,004
inaccessible to the general public. So

1153
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:53,580
finding ways to communicate what you do

1154
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,804
and how you're conducting your work is

1155
00:47:55,922 --> 00:47:58,350
helpful. Being open about it.

1156
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,596
Yeah, there's a lot of Jargon in our

1157
00:48:01,618 --> 00:48:03,788
field too. In any field, there's Jargon.

1158
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,256
But the oversimplification this is going

1159
00:48:06,278 --> 00:48:07,376
back to what we talked about at the

1160
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:08,816
beginning. The oversimplification of

1161
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:10,432
jargoning terms in our field seems

1162
00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:15,424
particularly susceptible to creating

1163
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:17,744
a situation where the facts haven't

1164
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:19,750
changed, but the interpretation has.

1165
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,444
And so I think it's almost like

1166
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:25,696
sensitivity training for anybody who's

1167
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:30,056
in this space. Like just kind of a

1168
00:48:30,078 --> 00:48:31,976
tutorial that you can do that's like a

1169
00:48:31,998 --> 00:48:34,024
two hour click through thing. It's like,

1170
00:48:34,062 --> 00:48:35,880
here are all the ways in which

1171
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,820
communicating this type of science,

1172
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,012
due to its nature, is more

1173
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:45,550
challenging than you might.

1174
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,100
So my own involvement in

1175
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,388
a program run by the Canadian Institute

1176
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:57,248
for Advanced Research has given me a

1177
00:48:57,254 --> 00:48:58,976
little bit of training in speaking with

1178
00:48:58,998 --> 00:49:01,568
the media. And I would never say that I

1179
00:49:01,574 --> 00:49:04,692
am an expert in this at all. I will only

1180
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:08,644
say that it was eye opening and

1181
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:11,684
it was very useful in the clarity of

1182
00:49:11,722 --> 00:49:15,076
language that you are used to using the

1183
00:49:15,098 --> 00:49:16,376
precision of language that you're used

1184
00:49:16,398 --> 00:49:20,116
to using in a close scientific sphere

1185
00:49:20,228 --> 00:49:22,616
versus when you're speaking to a more

1186
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:24,116
general audience. And when you're

1187
00:49:24,148 --> 00:49:26,596
speaking to a journalist or with several

1188
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:27,976
journalists who are then going to be

1189
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,820
writing for a more general audience.

1190
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,348
It's a different mindset. It's a

1191
00:49:32,354 --> 00:49:35,356
different way of speaking. And even just

1192
00:49:35,378 --> 00:49:37,484
being aware of that, I think is really

1193
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:40,204
useful. It's not that one is better than

1194
00:49:40,242 --> 00:49:41,984
the other. It's just that they are very

1195
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:45,072
different. And that when we are training

1196
00:49:45,126 --> 00:49:47,532
to be scientists, when we're doing a PhD

1197
00:49:47,596 --> 00:49:50,416
in a field related to this, speaking to

1198
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:52,884
the general public is not a skill that

1199
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:56,084
gets pressed on. It's not a skill that

1200
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:58,384
gets part of your professional

1201
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:00,390
development training. Maybe you do like

1202
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,688
one practice talk somewhere, but it's

1203
00:50:02,704 --> 00:50:05,344
not typically part of a general training

1204
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,108
protocol. And so speaking to non

1205
00:50:07,124 --> 00:50:09,624
specialists, speaking to the media,

1206
00:50:09,742 --> 00:50:11,812
speaking to high school audiences,

1207
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,748
speaking to your mom at the dinner

1208
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:15,736
table, learning how to do this

1209
00:50:15,758 --> 00:50:18,232
effectively can actually be really

1210
00:50:18,286 --> 00:50:20,104
valuable and really rewarding and really

1211
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,388
powerful. And again, I would never say

1212
00:50:22,414 --> 00:50:24,044
that I am an expert at this. At this

1213
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:25,708
point. I just like to think that I'm a

1214
00:50:25,714 --> 00:50:27,272
little better at it than I otherwise

1215
00:50:27,336 --> 00:50:30,336
would be had I not had it drilled into

1216
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:33,936
me how careful I need to be. I would

1217
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:37,440
also say, don't be scared to email

1218
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,052
journalists if you see that something's

1219
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:41,852
inaccurate, know, speak up like Megan

1220
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:45,168
has done about kind of how things are

1221
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:48,144
portrayed inaccurately. Because,

1222
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:50,356
yeah, as a like, no one's ever done that

1223
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:53,536
to me, but if something was inaccurate,

1224
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:54,628
I would want to know and I would want to

1225
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,252
fix it, like ASAP. So don't feel bad

1226
00:50:57,306 --> 00:50:59,176
about emailing journalists. They want

1227
00:50:59,198 --> 00:51:01,610
their pieces to be accurate as well. So

1228
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,488
that's what I would add, that can add to

1229
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,584
the conversation. It would make me feel

1230
00:51:06,622 --> 00:51:08,936
a little bad about calling out the

1231
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:11,432
pieces that I did in the presentation

1232
00:51:11,496 --> 00:51:13,948
and the piece of writing that I did too.

1233
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:16,876
But at the same time, they put this in

1234
00:51:16,898 --> 00:51:18,350
writing, and this is wrong.

1235
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,296
I don't like making people upset and I

1236
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:24,960
don't like making people angry.

1237
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,496
But it's out there in the world, and

1238
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,668
it's not a million eyeballs, and that's

1239
00:51:30,684 --> 00:51:33,236
a problem. And so we're hoping your

1240
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:34,676
viewership is about a million, right,

1241
00:51:34,698 --> 00:51:37,104
Daniel? So give or take low millions.

1242
00:51:37,152 --> 00:51:40,292
Low millions. So this will cover

1243
00:51:40,346 --> 00:51:42,304
everybody who read those articles,

1244
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:46,484
right? It's really

1245
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:49,080
interesting. The field is about

1246
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:52,760
awareness of other minds, our own

1247
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:55,240
mind, but also awareness of other minds

1248
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,152
in theory. But then in practice,

1249
00:51:58,296 --> 00:52:00,332
awareness of other minds is

1250
00:52:00,386 --> 00:52:03,164
communication. Because if we say

1251
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:04,636
something that it's like, well, I

1252
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:06,764
wouldn't be annoyed by that, or I

1253
00:52:06,802 --> 00:52:09,596
wouldn't be angry with that. But you

1254
00:52:09,618 --> 00:52:10,744
missed the point of communication,

1255
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:12,624
which it's not about what you would

1256
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,336
think about it, it's about who the

1257
00:52:14,358 --> 00:52:16,208
recipient would be. So it's kind of like

1258
00:52:16,294 --> 00:52:19,090
the theory and the practice of

1259
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,580
situational awareness about different

1260
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,356
minds, all of which are different than

1261
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:27,680
our own. Some are potentially radically

1262
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,972
different than our own. Others might be

1263
00:52:30,026 --> 00:52:31,510
more similar.

1264
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,704
So there's really maybe even a

1265
00:52:35,742 --> 00:52:38,170
quintessential relationship between

1266
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,152
consciousness studies and

1267
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:45,496
communication studies, which provides a

1268
00:52:45,518 --> 00:52:48,684
really unique two

1269
00:52:48,722 --> 00:52:52,270
way street that

1270
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,264
the world is swerving into that two lane

1271
00:52:56,312 --> 00:52:59,004
highway with these questions that are

1272
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:02,400
grabbing people's. Salience,

1273
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,636
what are your sort of closing thoughts

1274
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:11,020
or directions or what are some exciting

1275
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,408
areas that you'd like to see unfolding

1276
00:53:15,504 --> 00:53:18,150
in the coming months and years?

1277
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,160
Well, I'll go first.

1278
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:27,286
Yeah, first of all, I think you're spot

1279
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:31,222
on by saying communicating

1280
00:53:31,286 --> 00:53:33,258
consciousness, science being about

1281
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:34,838
knowing about other minds. I mean, it's

1282
00:53:34,854 --> 00:53:37,046
like effective communication is theory

1283
00:53:37,078 --> 00:53:38,558
of mind, and theory of mind may have a

1284
00:53:38,564 --> 00:53:40,398
lot to do with modeling other minds and

1285
00:53:40,404 --> 00:53:41,822
modeling your own mind. And yes,

1286
00:53:41,876 --> 00:53:45,614
absolutely, it's all wrapped up. So I

1287
00:53:45,652 --> 00:53:49,422
think for me, getting this right

1288
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,626
going forward or continuing to work

1289
00:53:51,668 --> 00:53:53,790
towards getting it right is a priority

1290
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:57,470
for me. And one of the pieces

1291
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,546
scientifically that I'm working on that

1292
00:54:00,568 --> 00:54:02,494
I hope to then communicate effectively

1293
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:04,806
when we get it right. Or several of the

1294
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:08,694
pieces is I have a couple of

1295
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:10,230
these really wonderful large

1296
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,826
collaborative projects where we're

1297
00:54:11,858 --> 00:54:15,222
working on everything from figuring out

1298
00:54:15,276 --> 00:54:16,646
how you would actually measure

1299
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:19,306
consciousness effectively or what it

1300
00:54:19,328 --> 00:54:20,902
might even take to measure consciousness

1301
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,594
effectively in other entities that are

1302
00:54:23,632 --> 00:54:25,494
not necessarily, like, awake, behaving,

1303
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,394
healthy, adult human beings all the way.

1304
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,394
To let's actually design some

1305
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:32,174
experiments to test several different

1306
00:54:32,212 --> 00:54:34,142
theories of consciousness. Let's design

1307
00:54:34,276 --> 00:54:36,366
new some of what Nora's working on

1308
00:54:36,388 --> 00:54:37,914
actually, is designing new measurement

1309
00:54:37,962 --> 00:54:40,206
approaches to say, well, we need to

1310
00:54:40,228 --> 00:54:42,686
actually have a quantitative handle on

1311
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:44,146
the things that we're talking about. So

1312
00:54:44,168 --> 00:54:45,566
this becomes objective, it becomes

1313
00:54:45,598 --> 00:54:48,210
falsifiable. We can do model

1314
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,558
arbitration. So all these things I'm

1315
00:54:50,574 --> 00:54:52,414
really excited about, but overarching

1316
00:54:52,462 --> 00:54:56,918
all of those is this idea of going

1317
00:54:57,084 --> 00:54:59,094
it's all connected, right? You talked

1318
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:02,280
about how consciousness science might be

1319
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:06,906
this leading edge or wavefront of how

1320
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:08,954
interdisciplinary science and

1321
00:55:08,992 --> 00:55:11,050
metascience needs to be done going

1322
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,178
forward as we become even

1323
00:55:15,264 --> 00:55:18,060
more theory driven in some of our

1324
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,566
scientific lines of inquiry than we have

1325
00:55:21,588 --> 00:55:23,246
been in the past, and more interested in

1326
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:24,906
latent variables and causal discovery

1327
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:27,134
and so on and so forth. And as the

1328
00:55:27,172 --> 00:55:30,542
science teams get bigger and more

1329
00:55:30,596 --> 00:55:33,074
complicated and the jobs within those

1330
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:35,198
science teams become more specialized

1331
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:37,074
and we have more and more need for

1332
00:55:37,112 --> 00:55:40,078
interdisciplinary collaboration, we're

1333
00:55:40,094 --> 00:55:42,610
going to have to change how we do team.

1334
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,606
Science and how we do credit assignment

1335
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:46,566
within team science in a way that I

1336
00:55:46,588 --> 00:55:48,646
think might end up being kind of

1337
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:50,674
incompatible with the nice, siloed,

1338
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,694
cute departmental structure that we have

1339
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:56,474
in our universities. And so a

1340
00:55:56,512 --> 00:55:58,554
focus on not just tolerating, but

1341
00:55:58,592 --> 00:56:00,342
celebrating interdisciplinarity,

1342
00:56:00,406 --> 00:56:02,650
celebrating team science, doing credit

1343
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,620
assignment correctly, and saying

1344
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,194
first author isn't the only thing that

1345
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,178
matters, that it really matters. If you

1346
00:56:11,184 --> 00:56:12,794
wrote this gorgeous software package

1347
00:56:12,842 --> 00:56:14,638
that facilitated a whole bunch of stuff

1348
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:17,034
that's also a meaningful and powerful

1349
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,006
contribution. Even if you didn't get

1350
00:56:19,028 --> 00:56:20,414
first author on that paper, you still

1351
00:56:20,452 --> 00:56:22,366
deserve a lot of credit. So I think that

1352
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:23,906
there's a lot of shaking up that we need

1353
00:56:23,928 --> 00:56:26,402
to do about how we do science going

1354
00:56:26,456 --> 00:56:28,946
forward. And I really like the idea of

1355
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,394
using consciousness science as a case

1356
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:34,530
study. I think that's beautiful. And

1357
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,814
thank you very much for making that

1358
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,150
lovely connection, because it really

1359
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,766
locks together a lot of the things that

1360
00:56:41,788 --> 00:56:43,286
I've been thinking about recently as

1361
00:56:43,308 --> 00:56:46,310
well. So there's my parting comments.

1362
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,882
Yeah. I was also going to bring up these

1363
00:56:51,936 --> 00:56:53,578
huge projects that you're part of and

1364
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:54,678
that other people are part of. It's

1365
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:56,474
really exciting to see so many people

1366
00:56:56,512 --> 00:56:58,138
working together in these huge teams. I

1367
00:56:58,144 --> 00:56:59,398
feel like it just makes science so much

1368
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:02,046
more efficient and more careful. So

1369
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:04,346
that's very cool. Another thing I'm

1370
00:57:04,378 --> 00:57:06,714
hoping is that one, that journalists

1371
00:57:06,762 --> 00:57:08,506
don't get scared of covering conscious

1372
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:11,818
of science from this. I think we'll

1373
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:13,214
learn from our mistakes and we'll move

1374
00:57:13,252 --> 00:57:15,134
forward. I don't think we'll get scared,

1375
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,898
but I hope that there's more coverage of

1376
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:19,858
this field. And I also hope that

1377
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:21,074
something that I've noticed about

1378
00:57:21,112 --> 00:57:22,994
science journalism is they really like

1379
00:57:23,032 --> 00:57:25,314
to just have clear cut findings because

1380
00:57:25,352 --> 00:57:26,866
that's the simplest thing to communicate

1381
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:29,270
to people. But I think we can, as a

1382
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,846
society, learn to be comfortable with

1383
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:33,560
the ambiguity a little bit more,

1384
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,714
especially when it comes to conscious

1385
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:37,254
science. We might have found something,

1386
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:39,178
but we're not sure, and that's okay.

1387
00:57:39,264 --> 00:57:40,938
And that's science. It's okay if your

1388
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:43,980
headline isn't snappy and clear.

1389
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:46,330
It's important for it to be clear, but

1390
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,946
snappy and I guess have one takeaway

1391
00:57:49,978 --> 00:57:51,198
point. It's okay if it doesn't have a

1392
00:57:51,204 --> 00:57:53,934
takeaway point. Yeah,

1393
00:57:54,052 --> 00:57:55,806
I think that's what I'm excited about.

1394
00:57:55,988 --> 00:57:58,190
New era of science journalism.

1395
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:04,190
Well, it sounds like bigger teams,

1396
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,722
bigger community, more theory, more

1397
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:10,370
data, more philosophy, more ambiguity.

1398
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,100
It'll be a great time.

1399
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,186
More philosophy, more ambiguity. Love

1400
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:21,054
it. Yes. Thank you, Megan and Nora,

1401
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:24,834
for joining. Always welcome

1402
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:27,898
back. So till next time.

1403
00:58:28,064 --> 00:58:29,706
Yeah. Thank you so much. This has been

1404
00:58:29,728 --> 00:58:31,530
really a pleasure. Thanks for having us.

1405
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,202
Thanks. Thank you.
