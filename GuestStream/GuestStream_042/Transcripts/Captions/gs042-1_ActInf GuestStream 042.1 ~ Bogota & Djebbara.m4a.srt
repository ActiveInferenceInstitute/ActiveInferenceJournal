00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,994
You. Hello and welcome.

00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:11,470
It's active active inference GuestStream

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,734
number 42.1 on May 10,

4
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:18,702
2023. We're here with Juan Diego Bogota

5
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:21,602
and Zach Shabara. We're going to have a

6
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:23,714
presentation, Time Consciousness in

00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:28,626
Analysis of Active Inference by the

9
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:31,418
authors by followed by a discussion. So

10
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:34,026
thank you both very much for being here.

11
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:35,654
We'll look forward to your presentation

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,082
and off to you. Cool. Thank you.

13
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:41,100
So I should start now, right?

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,818
Brilliant. So hello, everybody. My name

15
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:46,286
is Juanito Bogota. I'm one of the co

16
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:48,318
authors of this paper. I'm a PhD student

17
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:51,162
at the University of Extra in the UK.

18
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:54,046
And kind of my broad interest are

19
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:55,966
philosophical phenomenology and how it

20
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:57,742
can be related to empirical sciences,

21
00:00:57,806 --> 00:00:59,454
and more specifically to cognitive

22
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:02,258
science and to our understanding of

23
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:05,234
consciousness. So what we're going to do

24
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,998
now is I'm going to give a broad context

25
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:09,726
of our paper. I'm going to talk about

26
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:11,154
the theoretical and philosophical

27
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:13,318
context that motivated our paper. And

28
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,966
then Zach will talk about kind of the

29
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:16,626
specifics of our analysis of active

30
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:19,080
inference. So let me start now.

31
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,746
So to kind of situate ourselves in

32
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:25,286
the broader literature, I guess there's

33
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,106
a big, big cluster of discussions and

34
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:30,182
topics and approaches within cognitive

35
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:32,620
science and consciousness studies that,

36
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,334
as it names Sudest, is trying to explain

37
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:39,422
consciousness scientifically. Within

38
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:43,146
that kind of big category of approaches,

39
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:46,080
there's a very specific set which is

40
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,026
trying to connect philosophical

41
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:50,222
phenomenology with the natural sciences.

42
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:52,270
So we may call this the naturalization

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,986
of phenomenology. I'll talk about all

44
00:01:54,008 --> 00:01:55,698
this in a bit. I just want to kind of

45
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:57,486
situate ourselves within the broader

46
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,194
context. One of these approaches is

47
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:02,086
quite popular in some circles, which is

48
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:04,758
called neurophenomenology and was first

49
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:07,126
introduced and proposed by Francisco in

50
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:10,694
the late 90s. But recently,

51
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:13,260
Barela's project has been kind of

52
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,494
elaborated on by people within the FEP

53
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,846
and activist community. And they're

54
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:21,002
talking about what is called

55
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,326
computational neurophenomenology or

56
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:25,134
computational phenomenology, which, as

57
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:28,794
we'll see, tries to connect the original

58
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:30,510
project of neurophenomenology of

59
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,526
bringing together cognitive science and

60
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:35,326
phenomenology. But it gives an active

61
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:37,394
inference twist to this whole story.

62
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:39,234
And this is where our project is

63
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:43,060
situated. Our main purpose in the paper

64
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,514
was to give a temporal analysis of the

65
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:48,838
structure of active inference, and in a

66
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:50,742
bit, I'll explain you why we thought

67
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,694
this was important. So, as you

68
00:02:54,732 --> 00:02:57,766
probably know, consciousness is a

69
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,910
bit of a difficult phenomenon to explain

70
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,826
scientifically. We have nowadays a lot

71
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:05,046
of models and theories, scientific

72
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:06,650
theories, to try to address

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,474
consciousness. But there's always this

74
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:10,746
kind of lingering worry that there is a

75
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:13,214
gap, an explanatory gap between our

76
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,358
empirical understanding of the world

77
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:18,846
nature and consciousness, because how we

78
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:21,774
usually do science is try to address and

79
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:24,542
capture empirical phenomena from a third

80
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:26,234
person perspective, whereas

81
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:28,018
consciousness is something that is

82
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:30,402
allegedly given only from a first person

83
00:03:30,456 --> 00:03:32,386
perspective. So we're always

84
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:33,954
experiencing the world from our first

85
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:35,778
person perspective. And allegedly, we

86
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:37,170
don't really have access to

87
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,974
consciousness as these empirical

88
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:41,734
phenomenon we can see in the world. So

89
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:43,554
that's kind of an epistemological gap

90
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:45,846
between how we do science and how we

91
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:47,814
understand consciousness without doing

92
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,922
much science. There's also the Soho

93
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,206
problem of consciousness, which is to

94
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:53,434
say that we don't really know how

95
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:55,014
something like consciousness may arise

96
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:57,258
from, say, neo biological phenomena or

97
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,626
empirical phenomena more generally. So

98
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:01,658
this is kind of a general context which

99
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,846
shows that consciousness is quite

100
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:05,662
difficult to understand. I don't think

101
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:07,146
we would want to say that it's

102
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:08,910
impossible to explain it from a

103
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,586
scientific perspective, but it's

104
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:13,066
somewhat difficult in the broader

105
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:16,242
context of consciousness studies. Since

106
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:18,290
the early 90s, there's been some

107
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,530
proposals within cognitive sciences,

108
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,554
cognitive science and philosophy of mind

109
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:26,562
is trying to connect this whole idea of

110
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,594
explaining consciousness scientifically

111
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:31,542
with what is known within philosophy as

112
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:34,214
phenomenology. So importantly here,

113
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:36,306
when we talk about phenomenology, we're

114
00:04:36,498 --> 00:04:38,754
using a very specific and technical

115
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:40,326
term. So in the literature, you may

116
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,946
distinguish two different ways of

117
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,898
talking about phenomenology. There's the

118
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,586
usual broader sense in which we may mean

119
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:48,250
kind of the what it's like to experience

120
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,682
something or the qualitative contents of

121
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,938
experience. This is not what we're

122
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:55,306
talking about here. Rather, we're

123
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:57,006
referring to phenomenology, which is

124
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:58,778
very specific philosophical tradition,

125
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:01,386
which was first proposed by Ethan

126
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:04,126
Husserl in the early 20th century and

127
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:06,050
was further developed by people like

128
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,038
Morgan Merlot, Martin Heidegger, Simon

129
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:11,074
de Bois. And there's a long, long

130
00:05:11,192 --> 00:05:13,086
tradition going on there. And what's

131
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:15,058
interesting about phenomenology is that

132
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:17,714
it's simply a philosophical method and

133
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:20,034
way of studying the invariant structures

134
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:21,782
of consciousness. So what all these

135
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,254
phenomenologists are trying to say is to

136
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,750
capture what they call the essential

137
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,658
kind of characteristics of what it's

138
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:31,126
like to be conscious of our lived

139
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:32,858
experience through which we experience

140
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:35,834
the world. We do this by describing and

141
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:38,550
analyzing precisely these experiences.

142
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,714
And you may think that this is pretty

143
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:42,778
much what kind of the broader sense of

144
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:44,414
phenomenologists trying to get to. So

145
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:47,246
this idea of what it's like to

146
00:05:47,268 --> 00:05:48,766
experience something. But actually

147
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,558
phenomenologists are not really

148
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:52,462
interested in the what of experience.

149
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:53,966
They're not really interested in the

150
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:56,366
context of consciousness. So when

151
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,874
epenomologists talking about, say,

152
00:05:57,912 --> 00:05:59,474
perceptual experience, they are not

153
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:01,586
really interested in the redness of the

154
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:04,530
red or the flavor of an apple,

155
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,570
what philosophers or qualia rather,

156
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,686
they're actually interested in how is it

157
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,606
possible that these experiences come to

158
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,742
be. So this how this refers to these

159
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:16,278
structures. We may talk about, for

160
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:18,566
example, the temporal structure of

161
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:19,974
consciousness. We may talk about

162
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,590
activity embodiment.

163
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,498
But the important thing here is that

164
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:27,178
we're focusing on the how we experience,

165
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,194
not what we experience. And that's very

166
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:31,354
important because at least how I see it,

167
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,886
I don't know about Zach. This how

168
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:36,186
actually constrains the what. So it's

169
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:39,454
very different to imagine an apple than

170
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:40,958
to experience it. So there's a

171
00:06:40,964 --> 00:06:42,106
difference between the how we're

172
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:44,318
experiencing the world and that

173
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,154
constrains the specific contents of our

174
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:48,866
experience. And this is important for

175
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:51,374
the broader context of explaining

176
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:52,930
consciousness scientifically because

177
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,994
arguably, if we're focusing on the how,

178
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:58,174
we're trying to capture the essentials

179
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:00,022
of consciousness and this is a project

180
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:02,614
that was one of the kind of this project

181
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:05,206
was spearheaded by Franciscoarella in

182
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:07,414
the in the 90s. But we can actually

183
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:09,718
trace back this idea to the works of

184
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:11,894
Melaponte and Adam Hurvich in the

185
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:12,866
philosophical phenomenalogical

186
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:15,378
tradition. We can also talk about Hubert

187
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,386
Dreyfus. And more recently, there's a

188
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:20,362
kind of a very broad discussion about

189
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,622
whether and how can we connect these

190
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,406
philosophical considerations with

191
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:27,166
scientific perspectives of

192
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:29,534
consciousness. And this brings me to the

193
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:31,674
so called project of the naturalization

194
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:33,070
of an immunology.

195
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,288
We do science and world

196
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,416
through the lens, the natural side. We

197
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:47,616
have ethical understanding

198
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:50,000
of the world instead of metaphysical and

199
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,736
epistemological commitments such as

200
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:54,216
that. There is a material world out

201
00:07:54,238 --> 00:07:57,752
there which you can get to know through

202
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:00,520
schematics or doing empirical tests.

203
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,384
That's how we find, very broadly

204
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:06,412
speaking. But when you go and look the

205
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,664
literature, the phenomenological

206
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:10,984
literature, what phenomenologists

207
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:13,596
provide are not causal explanations of

208
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,956
consciousness. They are simply

209
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:17,216
describing a set of what they call

210
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:19,952
motivational connections which not

211
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:23,244
really identify with causality,

212
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:25,696
which is the main thing that science is

213
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:28,156
trying to capture causal relationships.

214
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:30,052
Also, there's the issue that

215
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:32,064
phenomenology is not positing empirical

216
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,972
entities. So when we talk about, say,

217
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:36,244
unconsciousness, we're not talking about

218
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,260
empirical thing an empirical object,

219
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,136
arguably, we're talking about a set of

220
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:42,008
processes which and this is kind of the

221
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:45,256
shift from the scientific issues to

222
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:46,904
philosophical ones. We're talking about

223
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:49,848
something that is arguably prior to

224
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,684
objectivity. So phenomenologists are

225
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:55,900
often reminding the readers

226
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,844
that before we're doing science like

227
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:00,904
we're doing the theoretical science,

228
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:03,052
we're experiencing the world. And

229
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,664
therefore this is something that is

230
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:08,208
prior epistemologically to science. And

231
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,204
to try to capture consciousness

232
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:13,104
scientifically is almost to commit a

233
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:16,304
category mistake. So given these

234
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:18,624
worries, the question is whether we can

235
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:21,300
actually link phenomenology with

236
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,232
empirical science, such as cognitive

237
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,976
science. And this question is precisely

238
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:26,916
what we talk about, what we call the so

239
00:09:26,938 --> 00:09:28,788
called project of naturalization of

240
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:31,556
phenomenology, which is to mean how are

241
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:34,908
we to make phenomenology continuous

242
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:37,256
with empirical science? There's a lot of

243
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:39,800
proposals in the literature. There is a

244
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,780
very important book published in 1999

245
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,828
edited by Dean Petitoat called

246
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:46,844
Naturalizing Phenomenology which the

247
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:50,860
editors and several authors discuss how

248
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,096
and whether we can actually naturalize

249
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:56,272
phenomenology. But one of the most

250
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:59,276
famous proposals is precisely Francisco

251
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,876
Varela's proposal of the naturalization

252
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:02,336
of phenomenology, which is called

253
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:06,140
neurophenomenology. So put very simply,

254
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,276
what neurophenomenology is all about is

255
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:11,636
to provide a non reductive approach to

256
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,648
the study of consciousness. This non

257
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,324
reductive approach takes seriously both

258
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:18,436
the analysis and descriptions made by

259
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,192
phenomenologists as well as the

260
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:23,416
scientific understanding we have of the

261
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:27,156
neurobiology that underpins our lived

262
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:30,616
experience these two kind of domains are

263
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:33,272
put in relation to one another by means

264
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:35,272
of what Valela calls reciprocal

265
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:37,070
constraints. So the idea is that

266
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,628
phenomenology can constrain our

267
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:42,872
understanding of the neurobiological

268
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,948
underpinnings, and these neurobiological

269
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:46,592
biological underpinnings can also

270
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,816
constrain our understanding of

271
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:50,460
experience, our phenomenological

272
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,810
understanding of experience.

273
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,368
Interestingly. And this is where kind of

274
00:10:54,374 --> 00:10:56,236
the computational and mathematical

275
00:10:56,268 --> 00:11:00,032
aspect comes in. Varela also suggested

276
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:03,588
that in order to achieve this

277
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:04,932
kind of circulation between

278
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:07,636
phenomenology and empirical science, we

279
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:09,588
have to have some sort of bridge or what

280
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,384
he calls a generative passage that

281
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,352
allows us to go from these very

282
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,396
abstract, phenomenological descriptions

283
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:17,720
of experience to the more concrete,

284
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,648
concrete descriptions of somatic and

285
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:22,320
neural processes that underpin lived

286
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,492
experience. And this very abstract level

287
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:27,196
that allows for this passage, for this

288
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:30,236
bridge, for him, for Valella, was the

289
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:32,796
use of dynamical systems theory and more

290
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,956
specifically, models of nonlinear

291
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:39,264
dynamics. So if you look at his 99

292
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:41,056
paper on time consciousness, what he

293
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:43,388
does is to connect Edmund Houstral's

294
00:11:43,404 --> 00:11:46,320
analysis of temporality with certain

295
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,632
neural process by introducing

296
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,164
dynamical models into the picture. This

297
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:55,350
is what neurophenomenology is all about.

298
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,284
More recently, and inspired by this

299
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:01,408
whole project of neurophenomenology,

300
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:03,624
maxwell Ransted and colleagues have

301
00:12:03,662 --> 00:12:06,696
proposed to further elaborate on this

302
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:09,636
project by employing generative modeling

303
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:11,864
techniques such as active inference to

304
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:13,272
provide this passage between

305
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:16,600
phenomenology and the neo biology. And

306
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,636
what is interesting about it is that if

307
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:19,896
you do so, if you introduce generative

308
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:21,756
modeling techniques, what you get is the

309
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:24,012
idea that this half of experience, how

310
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,164
experienced the world, or what

311
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,824
phenomenology is called constitution,

312
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:29,820
can be modeled or described in terms of

313
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,576
Bayesian imprints or approximate

314
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,776
Bayesian imprints. An important bit here

315
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:36,864
is that there's different ways of

316
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:38,964
interpret this. One way would be to say

317
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:41,252
that constitution or how we experience

318
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:44,976
the world is literally matter of patient

319
00:12:45,008 --> 00:12:47,732
inference. Or there's a more kind of

320
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:49,968
instrumentalist or non realist

321
00:12:50,064 --> 00:12:51,668
conception of this project in which you

322
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:53,444
would say we can actually just model or

323
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,508
describe our lived experience and how we

324
00:12:55,514 --> 00:12:57,428
experience the world in terms of

325
00:12:57,594 --> 00:13:01,204
approximated patient inference. In this

326
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:04,924
context, what happens is that the what

327
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:06,892
we experience in the world is

328
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:09,048
constituted through a set of inferences

329
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:11,832
which are informed by likelihood

330
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:14,524
mappings and all these matrices that

331
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:17,420
come in place into generative modeling.

332
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,120
So this is kind of a broader context

333
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,216
that informs our proposal. But you may

334
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,064
ask why we were focusing on time

335
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:30,068
consciousness. And I think Zach is going

336
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:32,580
to say something about it. But for now,

337
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,484
I just want to say that there's good

338
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,256
reasons, both phenomenological reasons

339
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:40,004
and scientific reasons, to apply

340
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:41,784
these kind of models to time

341
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,496
consciousness. On the one hand,

342
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,352
importantly, time consciousness is

343
00:13:45,406 --> 00:13:47,064
simply what we mean by time

344
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:48,472
consciousness is our experience of time.

345
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:51,352
So how we subjectively experience the

346
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:54,792
passage of time and this phenomenon,

347
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,956
time consciousness enjoys a sort of

348
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:59,432
privileged position within philosophical

349
00:13:59,496 --> 00:14:00,956
phenomenological literature. For

350
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:03,160
example, Husserl Heideggermer lebanti

351
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,270
are some prominent phenomenologists who

352
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,944
take time consciousness to be the most

353
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,056
basic structure of consciousness. The

354
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:12,428
point is that all that we're

355
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:14,464
experiencing all the time is always

356
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:16,736
experienced in time. There's always this

357
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:18,908
kind of temporal flow to the way we

358
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:21,156
experience the world, and this is kind

359
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:24,836
of essential to the way we engage with

360
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:27,504
the world. So if this is the most basic

361
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:29,424
structure of consciousness and we're

362
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:30,932
trying to understand consciousness

363
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,872
scientifically by modeling through,

364
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:36,072
say, genetic models or dynamical system

365
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,032
theory models, then probably we should

366
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,064
start by the most basic level, time

367
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:42,604
consciousness. And this is something

368
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:44,876
that several authors have actually tried

369
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:47,608
to do. So there's, for example, both Van

370
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:50,396
Gelders and Barela's dynamical models of

371
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:52,188
time consciousness, which borrow from

372
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:54,504
Edmund Husserl's phenomenological

373
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,524
analysis. There's also Gruce's

374
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:58,160
computational model of the same

375
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,588
processes. More recently, there's Vana

376
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:02,416
Visas predictive processing model of

377
00:15:02,438 --> 00:15:04,224
time consciousness. So if you see,

378
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:07,696
there's also a relatively long tradition

379
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:09,956
of trying to capture the dynamics of

380
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:11,572
time consciousness in terms of

381
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:15,140
mathematical modeling. So now,

382
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,796
moving on to our temple analysis, our

383
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,788
main question is whether actually active

384
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:22,232
inference is capable of modeling these

385
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:26,504
dynamics in a way that

386
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,356
makes justice to the original

387
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:30,632
phenomenological analysis made out by

388
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:33,656
usro. And that's it for me. Now I'll

389
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:36,220
give the floor to Zach.

390
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,734
Here I am, and I hope you can hear me

391
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:50,840
and see me.

392
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,540
Yes, thanks. Share my screen.

393
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,418
All right, so going to pick up here from

394
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:05,446
where JD left, Juan Diego

395
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:09,578
left. And basically, like you said,

396
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:12,106
we started talking about, well, there

397
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:15,274
was this problem, right, with the flow

398
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:19,134
of experience and this discreteness in

399
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:22,050
which we we model, well, whatever

400
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,346
phenomena, really, especially in

401
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:27,074
cognitive science. So there is

402
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,826
this relationship and this claim that we

403
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:31,654
are in fact, modeling features of human

404
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,206
experience, like perception, memory and

405
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:35,878
so on. But it's very few, if any, of

406
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,182
them really take seriously the flow of

407
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:41,650
human experience. So phenomenology

408
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,454
is for philosophers and not for

409
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:46,894
scientists, apparently. So computational

410
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,002
phenomenology like JD just talked about

411
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:51,754
is like this new subfield that takes

412
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,062
both seriously, the computational

413
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,698
approaches, but also phenomenology, and

414
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:55,994
is trying to sort of find this middle

415
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:57,038
ground in which we can have a

416
00:16:57,044 --> 00:16:59,594
conversation. And of course, big kudos

417
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:03,050
to Maxwell for this fantastic milestone.

418
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,098
I should say before I start that I'm

419
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:07,760
very happy that JD. Juan Diego is here

420
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,066
because I think that there is a lot of

421
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:13,294
thought and he has this very cautious

422
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:16,450
way of thinking and basically

423
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,980
formulating his sentences that I do not

424
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,150
have. So it's good that he's here. And I

425
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,078
should probably also say explicitly that

426
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,446
I will not be speaking for his behalf at

427
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,926
all. But we agree on basically all of

428
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,120
this. So just to be sure.

429
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,906
All right, so before I dive into the

430
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:39,574
whole temporality and active inference

431
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:43,338
aspect of our paper, I would just like

432
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:44,842
to start with a small thought

433
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,070
experiment. And I usually give this to

434
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,814
those who don't understand why I

435
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:50,960
personally think in time all the time.

436
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,894
So let's imagine that we have

437
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:58,206
to understand our own experience of

438
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:00,398
Space B. This is the Space B, this is

439
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:02,974
the Space A, this is Space C. So these

440
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:04,814
are all very, very different spaces,

441
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,546
right? And imagine there's two like a

442
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:08,206
parallel universe in the first universe.

443
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:09,646
In the first scenario, you approach

444
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:12,066
space B from Space A, right? So this is

445
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:13,606
you and you're basically moving in this

446
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,126
direction and you're experiencing this

447
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:17,494
space. Now in another universe, right?

448
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:19,814
Complete the fictional you're in this

449
00:18:19,852 --> 00:18:21,906
person, you're this person and you're

450
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:24,026
approaching Space B. Now, I usually ask

451
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:25,754
my students, do you think that this

452
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:28,380
experience of Space B will be the same?

453
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,314
And usually they all go like, well, by

454
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:36,540
far the majority says no,

455
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,502
it's two very different experiences and

456
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,038
they have nothing to do with each other.

457
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:45,454
And this is basically what I'm sort of

458
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,470
asking people to sort of start thinking

459
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,842
about. There is no one to one isometric

460
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:53,682
relationship between space and

461
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:56,082
experience. And I think this is a very,

462
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,114
very important and very I wouldn't say

463
00:18:58,152 --> 00:18:59,826
obvious, but to me it's very clear that

464
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,426
it cannot be like that. It cannot be

465
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:04,534
that one space or one specific type of

466
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:06,294
content will make me experience that

467
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:08,838
content the same way every time. And I

468
00:19:08,844 --> 00:19:10,486
think that the reason for that is

469
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:13,522
change, right? Time dynamics,

470
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,234
everything changes. This is sort of what

471
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:18,666
brings me into this will bring us into

472
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,726
the discussion about substance

473
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:23,146
philosophy and process philosophy. I

474
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:24,954
will not unfold that at all, but I will

475
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:27,434
mention from time to time a few things

476
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,134
about them. So here I'm just going

477
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:31,102
trying to make the point that even like

478
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:33,680
intuitively, which is usually what we go

479
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,302
how we reason with these thought

480
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:38,186
experiments, it's basically why they're

481
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,722
here. It just appears to us that space

482
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:44,146
is not necessarily directly mapped to

483
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:46,226
an experience because we have to

484
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:48,290
consider time, right? So I'm asking

485
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,626
three questions here and the first one

486
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,226
will be how does the continuous flow in

487
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:54,386
human experience emerge? And I will try

488
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:55,586
to answer that through the differences

489
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:57,382
and similarities between what we call

490
00:19:57,436 --> 00:19:59,686
objective and subjective time. I will

491
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,974
elaborate on that. Then I will try to

492
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:04,146
answer how we can we extract principles

493
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:06,066
from Husserlian temporalities Edmund

494
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:10,220
Hussarl that Fuentego just talked about.

495
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,554
And to answer that, I will talk a bit

496
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:14,314
about the enduring present and the

497
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:15,658
integration of two types of

498
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:17,318
temporalities that's the objective and

499
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:19,118
subjective one. And then finally, what

500
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:20,554
structured answer does active inference

501
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,622
comply with these principles? Sort of

502
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:25,230
using phenomenology to come up with

503
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,662
principle constraints and see whether

504
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:29,454
active inference is sort of playing by

505
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:31,666
those rules or not. And for that I will

506
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,986
try to give you our temporal analysis of

507
00:20:34,008 --> 00:20:35,374
active inference as a partially

508
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,666
observable Markov decision process

509
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:39,890
computational model. So at Palm DP.

510
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,006
So first things first objective and

511
00:20:44,028 --> 00:20:45,734
subjective time. So the objective time,

512
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,686
what do we mean by this? And I like to

513
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:51,894
think of them as roughly what

514
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:54,170
corresponds to substance and process

515
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,540
philosophy, respectively, because

516
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,820
objective time sort of deals with

517
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,402
spatial features and everything that is

518
00:21:03,456 --> 00:21:06,886
rooted in the space. Whereas subjective

519
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:09,102
time, I like to think, has more to do

520
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:12,606
with how things change. So to give an

521
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:15,134
example, a substance philosopher would

522
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:18,302
say that the sun is simply the sun.

523
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:20,830
It's a thing and it's a sun, whereas a

524
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,754
process philosopher would say that, no,

525
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,434
it's a burning planet, it's doing

526
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:27,026
something. And so the river is not just

527
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:29,906
a river, it's running water. And you are

528
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:31,874
not you you're always changing and so

529
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:34,566
on. It's heraclitus all over. This is

530
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:35,974
basically the idea and the difference

531
00:21:36,012 --> 00:21:37,142
between substance and process

532
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,094
philosophy. Now, if we project this

533
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,670
idea, like this abstract idea, onto the

534
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,870
discussion on the relationship between

535
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,700
objective and subject to time,

536
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,922
first of all, it's an important

537
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,806
discussion because computational models

538
00:21:52,838 --> 00:21:54,890
operate on computers and these follow

539
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,986
the laws of physics, right? So we are

540
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:59,430
sort of bound by the laws of physics and

541
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,874
we sort of have to talk about objective

542
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:03,166
time in the context of the laws of

543
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,494
physics. So I like to think that in

544
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:09,406
space we can have several units at the

545
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,686
same time, right? You can count

546
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,498
different kinds of sheep. Like they

547
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:15,714
don't even have to look alike or

548
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,226
anything. I know that farmers can tell

549
00:22:18,248 --> 00:22:19,730
the difference between the animals, but

550
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,266
maybe to someone who cannot, it will

551
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:22,834
just be like sheep one, sheep two,

552
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:24,478
sheep three, and so on. And you can then

553
00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:25,990
even say a number, like you can go,

554
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,166
let's take a sheep number five. And you

555
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,306
will not even imply any other sheep

556
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:33,586
from, well, one to four. You don't imply

557
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,978
them at all, you just mean this one,

558
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,838
right? There's an identity versus

559
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:39,418
similarity discussion that needs to be

560
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,106
taken up then. So space allows us to

561
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,426
sort of categorize and discretize the

562
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,954
world. And I like to think about this as

563
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,918
the way that geometric series sort of

564
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:51,614
functions. We can take space and just

565
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:54,542
divide it infinitely. You can always

566
00:22:54,596 --> 00:22:56,766
take anything and you can split it in

567
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:58,542
two, then in two again, then in two

568
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:00,946
again, and you essentially get what they

569
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:02,900
call the geometric series, which is

570
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,534
interestingly how you approach

571
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:07,054
continuous numbers and continuous

572
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:09,154
functions. Anyway, of course, I mean

573
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:11,586
this in theoretical terms because at

574
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:12,738
some point we're going to reach the

575
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:14,546
Planck length and then we're going to

576
00:23:14,568 --> 00:23:16,086
have to deal with a different kind of

577
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:18,774
problem. But in any case, my point here

578
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:20,774
is that space allows us in the first

579
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:23,174
place to think in degrees, right? Like

580
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:25,290
there's a change in degree, how much

581
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,554
something is. But time, I think,

582
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:30,906
operates in a different way. Time sort

583
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:33,754
of has this single unit, right?

584
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:36,266
It's just a single kind as opposed to

585
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:38,506
the degrees. So there's a difference in

586
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:40,686
kind when we change moments, not a

587
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,574
change in degrees, which you will have

588
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:44,366
in space. So there cannot be any

589
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,062
division of time. This is why I usually

590
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:47,854
say that time for me is completely

591
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:50,258
indivisible. It doesn't make sense to

592
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:51,954
compare two different moments because

593
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:53,426
they have two different units and we

594
00:23:53,448 --> 00:23:55,906
cannot compare them. So when I say that

595
00:23:55,928 --> 00:23:57,060
we measure. Time.

596
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,106
I'm basically saying that whenever you

597
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:03,106
measure any time, you measure it the

598
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:05,254
same way. So when I say 5 seconds, I

599
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:07,494
imply all the seconds between zero and

600
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:09,798
five as opposed to to the space with the

601
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:11,846
sheep. So I guess you can also think

602
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:15,286
about the units of time.

603
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,514
I'm talking about the measure of time.

604
00:24:17,552 --> 00:24:19,546
I think that sort of makes it easier to

605
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:21,226
understand. But because these

606
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,570
computational models, they are basically

607
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,666
operating with computers that are

608
00:24:24,688 --> 00:24:27,722
operating with electricity and basically

609
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:30,378
the laws of physics, I think it's

610
00:24:30,394 --> 00:24:32,174
important here to sort of think about

611
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:35,086
that in a broader term. And I here I

612
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,258
want to briefly quote Sir Arthur

613
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:39,374
Eddington who sort of is famous for

614
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,214
introducing the idea of the arrow of

615
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:43,726
time, stating that so far as physics is

616
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,874
concerned, times arrow is a property of

617
00:24:45,912 --> 00:24:47,698
entropy alone. And I think that there

618
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:50,226
are some truth to that. So if we

619
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:51,886
consider the whole universe as a closed

620
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:53,798
system then we would expect the heat and

621
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:55,622
the energy to at some point even out

622
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:57,894
completely. Thermodynamically speaking

623
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:00,406
is the thermodynamic equilibrium and

624
00:25:00,428 --> 00:25:02,950
this is where the entropy is highest.

625
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,626
So because the entropy of the system is

626
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:09,226
maximized or basically it's at its

627
00:25:09,248 --> 00:25:11,562
highest value, it has reached a state

628
00:25:11,616 --> 00:25:12,746
where all the possible ways of

629
00:25:12,768 --> 00:25:15,386
distributing energy between the

630
00:25:15,408 --> 00:25:16,986
particles has been completely exhausted.

631
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:18,666
Like there's no reason for any particle

632
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:20,686
to move anymore. There is no hot and

633
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:21,854
cold. Everything is the same

634
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:24,366
temperature. It's the maximum of

635
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:25,630
entropy.

636
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,686
I guess this is also why you sort of say

637
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,690
that energy is unavailable to perform

638
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,426
any work, right? So probably I should

639
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:37,154
also mention here that entropy actually

640
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:39,234
is a Greek word for transformation and

641
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:41,458
change. And I think this is exactly why

642
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,586
it fits very well with my understanding

643
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,974
of time here. It's the change, right?

644
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:50,118
It's the process. So entropy in an

645
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:52,694
abstract way, I think, sort of tries to

646
00:25:52,732 --> 00:25:55,674
explain not only spatial states but also

647
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:57,994
spatial states in relation to time,

648
00:25:58,112 --> 00:26:01,226
like how they can change.

649
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:03,866
So thermodynamically speaking, there

650
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:05,546
will always be a transfer from hot to

651
00:26:05,568 --> 00:26:09,050
cold in order to reach maximum entropy,

652
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,678
to sort of create a balance. And

653
00:26:11,844 --> 00:26:14,794
importantly, there is a linear causal

654
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:16,622
relationship, right? There's always like

655
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,638
one damn thing after the other, as the

656
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:21,118
saying goes. There's never anything

657
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,954
other than the linear way. And it goes

658
00:26:23,992 --> 00:26:25,746
like the past causes the future and so

659
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:28,654
on. And of course, this is no consensus

660
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:30,686
about this. Lots of people in quantum

661
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:32,418
physics and quantum mechanics will

662
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:34,166
completely oppose that and think that it

663
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:36,246
actually goes the other way around. But

664
00:26:36,348 --> 00:26:39,206
typically when we talk about this, at

665
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:41,010
least I believe in Newtonian physics,

666
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,934
there is a linear causal relationship.

667
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:45,526
So the features of objective time is

668
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:47,174
that it's spatial and that it's

669
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:49,946
temporarily linear. Now let's move on to

670
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:52,230
the subjective time. And as Juan Diego

671
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,958
already said, it's the A in the ABCs

672
00:26:55,974 --> 00:26:59,006
of consciousness and subjectivity. So

673
00:26:59,188 --> 00:27:01,486
going to give a brief demonstration of

674
00:27:01,508 --> 00:27:04,014
how this particular diagram, which was

675
00:27:04,052 --> 00:27:07,214
developed originally by Idmud Hussal in

676
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,160
his Bernard manuscript. Basically,

677
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,522
we have to think about the black line

678
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:15,666
here as the objective time, sort of,

679
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:18,002
right? One event, second event, third

680
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:20,626
and fourth and so on. And basically, if

681
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:22,594
we just take the present here as being

682
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:25,222
the event B, well, there is some kind of

683
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,206
expectation of what's going to happen at

684
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,334
the next moment that is affecting this

685
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:31,686
moment here. But not only that, there is

686
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,726
also another layer to that is going sort

687
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:37,046
of what we call a protention, right? A

688
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:38,342
protention of what's going to happen

689
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:40,682
even beyond C. And you can actually draw

690
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:42,714
this huge diagram out there and you will

691
00:27:42,752 --> 00:27:45,462
eventually get a kind of protention

692
00:27:45,526 --> 00:27:49,022
about the future. But at the same time,

693
00:27:49,076 --> 00:27:51,390
we also have some information about

694
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,974
retention, right? There's something that

695
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:55,006
happened already and we are sort of

696
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:58,142
building our present moment based on our

697
00:27:58,196 --> 00:28:01,486
retention. So the retention sort of

698
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:03,506
explains the immediate past and we do

699
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:05,442
not refer to this as memory or working

700
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:07,762
memory. It's very explicit that it's not

701
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:10,786
the same thing. I guess the one way we

702
00:28:10,808 --> 00:28:15,126
can think about this is also in

703
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:17,158
terms of melodies, is what I'm trying to

704
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:20,086
say, and sentences. So, for example, my

705
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:22,182
sentence right now, I started it a few

706
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:24,182
moments ago, but it's still going and

707
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:25,866
you still have the full sentence in your

708
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:29,402
head and so on and so on. And basically

709
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:31,546
when we talk about the structure of

710
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:35,398
human experience and I think that Juan

711
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,034
Diego is absolutely right when he says

712
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:40,160
that for any unnaturalization project,

713
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,086
for it to succeed, it must at the very

714
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:45,166
least get the temporal order right. I

715
00:28:45,188 --> 00:28:46,734
think this is like the basics of the

716
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,918
basics. So in this case,

717
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:51,906
the way that Edmund Hussal thinks about

718
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:54,466
it is that he thinks about it as the

719
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:58,062
living present being made of a synthesis

720
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:00,306
of retention and protention. And this is

721
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:02,174
what we call the primal impression.

722
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:03,846
It's the present moment. I will not

723
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,426
refer to it always as the primal

724
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,320
impression, but that is, I believe,

725
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,446
what you call in philosophy, the

726
00:29:09,468 --> 00:29:12,440
technical term for living present.

727
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,606
But the main issue here still remains,

728
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:17,514
right? So how can what I'm writing here,

729
00:29:17,552 --> 00:29:19,482
how can a sequential structure of time

730
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:21,466
be compatible with one that appears to

731
00:29:21,488 --> 00:29:25,706
flow? This is the

732
00:29:25,728 --> 00:29:27,580
issue that we are dealing with here.

733
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,094
And I think that there is two very

734
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:31,806
important principles that we can point

735
00:29:31,828 --> 00:29:34,254
out from here. Brazilian synthesis that

736
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:36,074
any experienced moment in time cannot

737
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:38,570
consist of a discrete now moment alone,

738
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,330
but must instead coexist with the

739
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,018
immediate past and immediate future

740
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:44,354
which is basically the retention and the

741
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:46,146
protension in this case. But there is

742
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:49,426
also a very berksonian aspect to this

743
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:51,250
which is the interpenetration, right?

744
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,046
So the present moment requires the

745
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:54,982
coming together of subjective and

746
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:56,806
objective temporal structures, which is

747
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,566
exactly also what you see here. There is

748
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,006
an objective direction of time but

749
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:04,778
it's constituted by well past and future

750
00:30:04,864 --> 00:30:05,740
all the time.

751
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,418
And this is basically, if we look at it

752
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:15,194
in diagrammatic or graphical way, well,

753
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:16,938
the objective time that we call the

754
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:18,538
spatial and linear cause relationship,

755
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,406
we say that one event causes the next

756
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,046
one, causes the next one, causes the

757
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:24,206
next one and so on. The the arrow is

758
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:26,094
very very clear. But in subjective time

759
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:28,238
we sort of have this, let's say

760
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,830
opportunity to well, flip one of the

761
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,526
arrows and say that well if I'm looking

762
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:35,058
at the event B not A and C but just the

763
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:36,706
event B. Well, the event B is

764
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:38,514
constituted by a retention and a

765
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:40,046
protention. So we have sort of flipped

766
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:43,794
the arrow here and these

767
00:30:43,832 --> 00:30:45,766
are two very different orders of time as

768
00:30:45,788 --> 00:30:48,358
we call them in our paper. One is

769
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:50,306
characterized by its unidirectional

770
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:51,526
development in time, which is the

771
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:53,094
objective one. The other one is

772
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:54,786
characterized by its bi directional

773
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,506
development in time and this is the

774
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:59,754
subjective one. Basically what we do oh

775
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:01,978
probably I should mention here that the

776
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:03,786
notation here is very important to sort

777
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:05,386
of get but we're always using the

778
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:07,294
SuperScript for the objective and the

779
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,106
subscript for the subject. I meant

780
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:13,214
objective, obviously the SuperScript for

781
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:15,790
objective and subscript of subjective

782
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,014
time dimensions and usually we use T

783
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:21,938
for the SuperScript and tau for the

784
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:24,482
subscript, just to be sure. So what we

785
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:27,330
propose in our paper is basically this

786
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,554
integrated continuity where we try to

787
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:32,226
combine both of them into a husserlin

788
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,454
interpretation. And obviously we're also

789
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:38,450
relying here a lot on conditional

790
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,214
dependencies here and this is from

791
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:43,398
statistics. I guess this is also why I

792
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,574
personally like to think of this as kind

793
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,054
of a tribute to Boltzman's statistical

794
00:31:48,102 --> 00:31:49,786
approach to entropy, right? Because he

795
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:52,042
was the one who sort of took that step

796
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,654
away from simply thermodynamics

797
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:58,762
and movement between energy to thinking

798
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,214
about it more as statistics and

799
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,966
probability distributions. And I think

800
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,358
that was very fascinating. I think in

801
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:06,926
many ways this is kind of a tribute to

802
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:08,286
that, right, sort of taking the

803
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:10,274
boltsmonian way of thinking of it and

804
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:12,062
sort of adding this conditional

805
00:32:12,126 --> 00:32:14,466
dependency layer to the development of

806
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:15,060
time.

807
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:22,274
This is what we sort of get at, right?

808
00:32:22,312 --> 00:32:24,070
So if you look at the present moment B,

809
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,398
this is the event that we're trying to

810
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:28,040
understand. Well, there's a B minus one

811
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,886
in objective time but it's actually a

812
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:34,822
protention. So it's actually a plus one

813
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:37,240
as well because it was a plus. One

814
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,362
retention later for the next event,

815
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,460
which is C. And you can actually

816
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,578
generalize this the way we do at each

817
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:50,522
corner here. So Y, with the SuperScript,

818
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:53,790
the objective time plus minus K and the

819
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,366
subject of time plus minus ten, and you

820
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:58,786
can do the same for the other way, the

821
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:05,250
other direction. So basically

822
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,940
what we've been talking about so far is

823
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,514
talking about systems and whether

824
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:12,274
they're, how they function. And

825
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:13,854
especially I talked about the universe

826
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:15,314
functioning as kind of a closed system.

827
00:33:15,352 --> 00:33:16,726
I think that's a huge assumption and I'm

828
00:33:16,748 --> 00:33:18,406
not really buying into all of this, but

829
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:20,934
it's basically a good way to explain the

830
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:23,126
approaches that we have made. But the

831
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:26,214
body functions as an open system because

832
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:27,602
it's exchanging energy and information

833
00:33:27,676 --> 00:33:29,226
all the time. And I'm preaching to the

834
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:30,934
choir here. You all know about markup

835
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:32,998
blankets and I don't think that it's

836
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:35,914
important to sort of introduce it to

837
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:38,426
this forum, but I would like to just

838
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,126
pinpoint a few things. The first one is

839
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:41,546
that I want to remind you that active

840
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:43,658
inference assumes that there's a border

841
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:46,926
between the central nervous system and

842
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:48,974
the environment and that can be

843
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:50,902
identified through a markup blanket.

844
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:52,546
And I also would like to emphasize the

845
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:54,334
fact that it's describing the processes

846
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:56,706
and dynamics rather than the things

847
00:33:56,808 --> 00:33:59,214
themselves. And I'm really emphasizing

848
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:02,962
the process versus the thing because

849
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:07,046
Markov blanket okay, I'm all right,

850
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:09,094
so basically, Markov blanket, they

851
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,250
represent the statistical boundaries,

852
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:15,142
right, based on these conditional

853
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:16,902
relationships and they're typically

854
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:19,546
applied in the spatial domain. This is

855
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:22,426
my point. It's a statistical boundary in

856
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:25,306
the spatial domain. Also, I should

857
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:26,602
probably mention that when I talk about

858
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:27,898
conditional dependencies, because I

859
00:34:27,904 --> 00:34:30,398
realized that there has been quite a lot

860
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,286
of debate about what we mean when we

861
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:34,490
talk about conditional dependencies.

862
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,302
Well, not specifically for our paper,

863
00:34:36,356 --> 00:34:38,800
but in general, in statistical work,

864
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,458
what we mean here is that there is a

865
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:43,134
relationship between two or more events

866
00:34:43,262 --> 00:34:46,594
that are dependent when a third

867
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:49,154
event occurs. This is basically the most

868
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:52,050
generic definition of conditional

869
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,990
dependencies, which you can find in

870
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,426
Judea Pearl's work on Markov and Beijing

871
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:01,014
networks. So my point here was

872
00:35:01,052 --> 00:35:03,266
just to say that for the Markov blanket,

873
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:05,702
you see that it's just a statistical

874
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:07,478
boundary. And I know that Carl's

875
00:35:07,494 --> 00:35:09,546
monograph, the famous monograph, sort of

876
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,238
takes that one step further and suggests

877
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:15,126
that, well, there are markup

878
00:35:15,158 --> 00:35:17,334
blankets actually make up the physical

879
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:20,000
and the spatial boundary between things,

880
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,734
whereas the way that we apply this is

881
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:24,414
still in terms of statistics and

882
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:26,378
dynamics and processes. So we don't

883
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:28,720
really deal with that aspect here.

884
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,346
Should we really expect things this is

885
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:36,706
my point here. This is the question that

886
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:37,922
I'm asking. Should we really expect

887
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:39,666
things in active inference, which is a

888
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:41,810
process theory? I mean, I understand

889
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,878
that the spatial boundaries, they are a

890
00:35:43,884 --> 00:35:46,422
matter of convenience, but can we really

891
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:49,734
expect them to sort of divide what

892
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,458
really is like the central nervous

893
00:35:51,474 --> 00:35:53,480
system. When does it really transfer

894
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,080
into the actual flesh of the body?

895
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,926
These spatial transitions, they sort of

896
00:36:01,948 --> 00:36:03,606
happen in degree and if we look at the

897
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,734
borderline, we will be looking at that

898
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:07,694
for ever and ever and we will look at

899
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,726
neurons and then atoms of neurons and so

900
00:36:09,748 --> 00:36:11,166
on and so on. We will never be able to

901
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:13,534
really find a delineation. This is where

902
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,818
I think that the idea of temporal Markov

903
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:18,526
blanket sort of is a good idea. Just to

904
00:36:18,548 --> 00:36:20,218
briefly sum this up, right? So Markov

905
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:23,682
blanket of this particular node is

906
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,842
constituted by its parents and its kids

907
00:36:25,896 --> 00:36:28,866
and the parents of the kids here. So

908
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:30,514
anything that is around that will not

909
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:32,854
hold any valuable information about this

910
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:34,630
particular node. Again, I'm probably

911
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,574
preaching to the choir here, but here

912
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:41,846
I'm basically asking. So the

913
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:47,994
delineation is smart because it

914
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:49,706
gives us tractability, right? It makes

915
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:51,114
it tractable. We can start thinking

916
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:54,106
about the dynamics between things, but

917
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,594
in the context of time we might ask can

918
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,726
we apply the Markov blanket to the

919
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:02,030
temporal structure? Because we already

920
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,570
drew them as conditional dependencies.

921
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,646
So we sort of asked in our paper what

922
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:09,634
are the statistical boundaries of the

923
00:37:09,672 --> 00:37:11,666
present moment? So I just show you this

924
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,222
one here before of the integrated

925
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:18,434
continuity drawn up here as a network of

926
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,006
conditional dependencies. So if I were

927
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:22,566
to sort of look at this particular

928
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:26,760
point, the event b,

929
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,986
well, we will find that if we try to map

930
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:32,806
out this Markov blanket, we will find

931
00:37:32,828 --> 00:37:35,546
that, well, the information necessary to

932
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:37,834
understand this particular node is

933
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:42,698
actually constituted by a

934
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:44,666
bit of the present and sorry, a bit of

935
00:37:44,688 --> 00:37:46,170
the past and a bit of the future.

936
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,466
Right? So basically we're kind of cheeky

937
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:50,926
doing this when I think about it because

938
00:37:50,948 --> 00:37:52,318
we're sort of dressing the structure of

939
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:55,614
the blanket that happens in

940
00:37:55,652 --> 00:38:00,020
time. And I think that obviously

941
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,914
how can I put this? This is

942
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:07,394
unconventional and which means that this

943
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:10,786
will have to be there will have to be

944
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:13,654
some limitations compared to the

945
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,826
conventional way you would use markup

946
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:19,030
blankets in spatial conditions, spatial

947
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:24,342
relationships. So first

948
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:26,090
we find that, well, all the information

949
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,074
needed to understand the present moment,

950
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,106
well, we find them to comply completely

951
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,446
with both principles of phenomenology.

952
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,786
We basically get the interpenetration of

953
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:39,454
past on the future and we also get this

954
00:38:39,492 --> 00:38:41,758
integration between the objective and

955
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:43,326
the subjective time. So we get an

956
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:45,038
integration in this direction and we get

957
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:47,120
an integration in this direction here.

958
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,842
So that was actually our very first

959
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,746
surprise. So the second surprise when we

960
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:55,986
did this, it sort of occurred when we

961
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:58,706
tried to understand, to understand what

962
00:38:58,728 --> 00:39:01,182
does it take to update the present

963
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,730
moment, right? And to actually propagate

964
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,246
the whole model through time. And for

965
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,746
that we need to analyze the update

966
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,150
function of a standard active inference.

967
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:14,214
PMDP yeah,

968
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,554
probably I should mention that the

969
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:19,034
conventional pmdps in robotics, they

970
00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:21,654
don't use the same kind of update

971
00:39:21,702 --> 00:39:23,526
function as we use it in active

972
00:39:23,558 --> 00:39:25,882
inference because they are much more

973
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:28,286
explicit about the reward functions and

974
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:31,118
so on. And active inference obviously

975
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:33,422
cashes all of that out as free energy

976
00:39:33,476 --> 00:39:36,238
minimization. So anyway, the dynamics of

977
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:38,510
the present moment are constituted by

978
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,826
two potentials. We have them up here and

979
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:42,434
a single retention which is down here.

980
00:39:42,472 --> 00:39:44,242
And basically you will be able to get

981
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:46,306
this particular equation. And once we

982
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:49,394
start to sort of because these

983
00:39:49,432 --> 00:39:51,698
are factors and if we sort of want to

984
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:54,066
turn that into sums, we need to convert

985
00:39:54,098 --> 00:39:57,334
them to logarithms instead.

986
00:39:57,452 --> 00:39:59,302
And basically if we just keep this one

987
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,686
in mind and put it over here, we see

988
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,654
that the first line is our derived model

989
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,650
from the slide before. And of course,

990
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,346
like anyone who's modeling, we have to

991
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:10,518
engage with this very central exercise

992
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:12,934
which I like to think about as providing

993
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:15,946
quality to quantity. I think this is a

994
00:40:15,968 --> 00:40:18,540
very, very particular problem that

995
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,086
researchers in the field of

996
00:40:21,108 --> 00:40:22,894
computational phenomenology have to deal

997
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:25,354
with as well. So keeping this exercise

998
00:40:25,402 --> 00:40:26,766
in mind, because I will have some

999
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:28,800
comments about this towards the end.

1000
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,706
So we have the hidden potential at T

1001
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:33,966
plus one and the hidden primal

1002
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,938
impression at T and T plus one,

1003
00:40:36,024 --> 00:40:38,466
basically what you see here. And then we

1004
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:41,294
have the observed retention at T minus

1005
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:42,866
one. This is basically what we derived

1006
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:46,120
from our model from before. Now,

1007
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,726
the second line here is basically the

1008
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:51,506
update function of the active inference

1009
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:53,746
pump DP. And once we actually just strip

1010
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:57,026
it away from all its action

1011
00:40:57,058 --> 00:40:58,586
policies you noticed here there are no

1012
00:40:58,608 --> 00:41:00,874
action policies in this update. I will

1013
00:41:00,912 --> 00:41:02,554
return to why we did that. Then

1014
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:04,474
basically what you have is the well,

1015
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,722
it's pretty straightforward actually.

1016
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:07,594
You have the prior, which is the forward

1017
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:08,926
message passing and you have the

1018
00:41:08,948 --> 00:41:10,126
predictive, which is the backward one,

1019
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:11,630
and you have the likely outcome.

1020
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,666
So our notation here with the double

1021
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,638
timeline, the double dimension of time

1022
00:41:18,724 --> 00:41:20,674
in the single notation sort of allows us

1023
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,450
to understand better what is actually

1024
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,886
going on here if we map the phonological

1025
00:41:25,998 --> 00:41:29,134
version or equation that we derived onto

1026
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,820
the existing update function.

1027
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,242
So I've omitted here a few equations

1028
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:38,086
that if you're interested, you can find

1029
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:39,634
them all in the paper. But essentially,

1030
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,334
once it's all mapped out, it appears as

1031
00:41:41,372 --> 00:41:43,842
if the update function can be translated

1032
00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:47,066
into kind of a prior protention, a

1033
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:48,986
predictive primal impression and a

1034
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:51,994
likely retention. So very similar to how

1035
00:41:52,032 --> 00:41:54,554
protention was brought backward, the

1036
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:56,366
retention here is brought forward in

1037
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,686
time, linked with the likelihood and the

1038
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:02,682
hidden state. So the discovery,

1039
00:42:02,746 --> 00:42:05,614
or surprise, I should rena say, is both

1040
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:07,422
that the model appealed to the same

1041
00:42:07,476 --> 00:42:10,526
temporal structure as the active

1042
00:42:10,558 --> 00:42:12,642
inference model, although in a different

1043
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,300
way.

1044
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,110
So I just took this quote

1045
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,846
from our paper because this is how we

1046
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:24,654
sort of reason about it that this gives

1047
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:26,434
rise to an integrated structure of time

1048
00:42:26,472 --> 00:42:28,254
where the past depends on prior

1049
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:30,814
predictions and the future of my likely

1050
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:32,258
retention, which speaks to the

1051
00:42:32,264 --> 00:42:33,426
phonological understanding of

1052
00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:35,342
experience. So just as in the hospital

1053
00:42:35,406 --> 00:42:36,946
analysis that retention, primal

1054
00:42:36,978 --> 00:42:39,766
impression and protension jointly make

1055
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:42,582
up the living present, then we refer to

1056
00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:45,142
the set of inferences presented here as

1057
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,170
the living inferences, which is sort of

1058
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:52,454
a workplace here between Prestonian

1059
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:55,914
and Husserlian formalities. So since

1060
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:57,820
they are jointly, they serve together

1061
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,118
sorry, since jointly they serve to

1062
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,546
describe within an active inference

1063
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:03,166
model the phonological process that give

1064
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:04,880
rise to the living present.

1065
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,406
So this is basically me working my way

1066
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:13,022
here to the end. We don't have the

1067
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:15,986
answer here. I still think that this is

1068
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:18,226
very clear, but we have a suggestion for

1069
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:19,826
an answer, which is the continuity that

1070
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:21,314
we experience is due to the

1071
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:23,666
interpenetration and synthesis of an

1072
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,586
objective and subjective temporal

1073
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:28,834
dimension. So yes, can we extract

1074
00:43:28,882 --> 00:43:30,534
principles? That was basically our

1075
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:32,066
answer here. How does the continuous

1076
00:43:32,098 --> 00:43:34,022
flow in human experience emerge? Well,

1077
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:35,846
through the interpenetration and

1078
00:43:35,868 --> 00:43:39,794
synthesis of two temporal dimensions,

1079
00:43:39,922 --> 00:43:41,446
can we extract principles from her

1080
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:43,702
surian temporality? Yes, we can easily

1081
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:45,206
extract principles from her surveillance

1082
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:47,014
phenomenology. We just need to note

1083
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:48,746
under what conditions this is done. And

1084
00:43:48,768 --> 00:43:50,022
I think this is an important note

1085
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,562
because you remember when I said that

1086
00:43:51,616 --> 00:43:53,418
there is this quality to quantity

1087
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:55,278
exercise that we all have to engage in.

1088
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:56,766
So basically, my view is that

1089
00:43:56,788 --> 00:43:58,862
computational phenomenology, if it wants

1090
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,878
to contribute to science, this will be

1091
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:03,474
an extremely important exercise for when

1092
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:05,714
and how quality is attributed to a

1093
00:44:05,752 --> 00:44:08,338
specific quantity. It needs to be

1094
00:44:08,424 --> 00:44:14,030
extensively and very clearly elaborated

1095
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:18,070
argumentation. You can ask

1096
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,262
why does this particular parameter here,

1097
00:44:20,316 --> 00:44:22,786
right, like typically in active

1098
00:44:22,818 --> 00:44:23,686
inference, there will be the

1099
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,734
temperature. You say that, oh, this

1100
00:44:25,772 --> 00:44:27,234
particular parameter represents

1101
00:44:27,282 --> 00:44:29,094
attention. Well, does it behave like

1102
00:44:29,132 --> 00:44:30,806
attention and to what extent? Because it

1103
00:44:30,828 --> 00:44:32,138
will have a limit and we just need to

1104
00:44:32,144 --> 00:44:34,986
know when is that limit? Basically, in

1105
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:37,414
our case, we saw that the temporality

1106
00:44:37,462 --> 00:44:39,114
can be modeled, but we need to know

1107
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:41,386
under what circumstances. So in our

1108
00:44:41,408 --> 00:44:43,062
case, we assume that the present moment

1109
00:44:43,136 --> 00:44:45,582
is not a static, frozen moment in time,

1110
00:44:45,636 --> 00:44:47,562
just like space, but it endures.

1111
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:49,146
There's a duration, right? And it's

1112
00:44:49,178 --> 00:44:51,166
essentially this insight that allows us

1113
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,266
to create such an integration between

1114
00:44:53,368 --> 00:44:56,820
the two temporal dimensions. So finally,

1115
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,706
I like to think that we demonstrated the

1116
00:45:00,728 --> 00:45:02,354
potential of active inference in being

1117
00:45:02,392 --> 00:45:04,878
used as a point of departure to model

1118
00:45:04,984 --> 00:45:07,634
basically the flow of subjective

1119
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:10,486
experience. But I think that we have yet

1120
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:13,480
to begin analyzing anything beyond that.

1121
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,182
We basically need to start thinking

1122
00:45:16,236 --> 00:45:18,486
about including action policies. So

1123
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,778
that's motion and ActInf and of course,

1124
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:22,554
essentially we would arrive at something

1125
00:45:22,592 --> 00:45:26,218
that looks like content, right? So I

1126
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,182
guess this is, in a way, our rigorous

1127
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:32,078
approach and a humble start with

1128
00:45:32,244 --> 00:45:34,942
the very basics. And I think that this

1129
00:45:34,996 --> 00:45:37,966
very slow approach is exactly how it

1130
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:39,870
should be because we should be cautious

1131
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,402
about this relationship between

1132
00:45:42,456 --> 00:45:44,142
phenomenology and computational

1133
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:46,594
modeling. Just a few words here about

1134
00:45:46,632 --> 00:45:48,114
our future work and what we were working

1135
00:45:48,152 --> 00:45:48,980
on. Now,

1136
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,906
actually, this is an example of one

1137
00:45:55,928 --> 00:45:57,398
of the things that we are working on. I

1138
00:45:57,404 --> 00:45:59,186
will say that right now we are focusing

1139
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:02,806
on another perspective of

1140
00:46:02,828 --> 00:46:04,662
our work which has to do with the direct

1141
00:46:04,716 --> 00:46:07,078
integration of motor, intentionality and

1142
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,938
action. But basically in this particular

1143
00:46:09,024 --> 00:46:10,714
project, we're sort of trying to map out

1144
00:46:10,752 --> 00:46:14,700
the exact, let's say, structure of

1145
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,594
time in any computational model, right?

1146
00:46:17,632 --> 00:46:19,654
Because when you analyze the update

1147
00:46:19,702 --> 00:46:21,886
function of any computational model, it

1148
00:46:21,908 --> 00:46:23,626
will reveal its temporal structure.

1149
00:46:23,658 --> 00:46:25,486
Like how does it bring the past into the

1150
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:28,286
future, into this propagation for time?

1151
00:46:28,468 --> 00:46:32,250
So we could ask what about CNNs

1152
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,526
convolutional neural networks? What

1153
00:46:34,548 --> 00:46:36,446
about recurrent neural networks or auto

1154
00:46:36,478 --> 00:46:37,954
encoders or all the other kinds of

1155
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:39,954
algorithms? How do they function? Like,

1156
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:41,986
how do they update their function? And I

1157
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,306
think that by analyzing all of these

1158
00:46:44,328 --> 00:46:45,746
different algorithms and their update

1159
00:46:45,778 --> 00:46:47,366
function, we could sort of map out all

1160
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,206
of these temporal structures and

1161
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:50,422
understand better how they are

1162
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:54,854
propagating in

1163
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:58,566
space through time. So this would be, I

1164
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:01,126
think, my last slide here. Yes, thank

1165
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:03,146
you for your attention. That was much

1166
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:05,340
longer than I sorry about that.

1167
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,174
Was I muted the whole time longer. In

1168
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:14,254
time or what exactly do you dean by

1169
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:17,402
that? Well, I would say subjective

1170
00:47:17,466 --> 00:47:21,534
the time was very short. Objective time

1171
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:25,650
was much longer. Thank you

1172
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,142
both for this really excellent,

1173
00:47:28,206 --> 00:47:31,170
excellent dyad of presentations.

1174
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:35,902
And I will pass first to Dean

1175
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:38,386
or Ali. Whoever would like to just jump

1176
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:40,754
in with a first thought or reflection,

1177
00:47:40,802 --> 00:47:43,830
please feel free. Go ahead, Ali.

1178
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,818
Well, thank you so much for your amazing

1179
00:47:49,904 --> 00:47:53,802
presentation. Gosh, I have so many

1180
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,774
comments and questions to ask. I don't

1181
00:47:56,822 --> 00:48:01,146
know where to begin. But you

1182
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:03,534
see, because I'm also deeply interested

1183
00:48:03,652 --> 00:48:07,534
in process philosophy as well. It's not

1184
00:48:07,572 --> 00:48:10,798
necessarily the Whiteheadian process

1185
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:13,774
philosophy, but generally thinking in

1186
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:17,074
terms of flows and flocks and so on, as

1187
00:48:17,112 --> 00:48:21,090
opposed to substance and stasis.

1188
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,340
But in my view,

1189
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:28,070
well, historian phenomenology,

1190
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:34,246
these conceptions of flows and the

1191
00:48:34,348 --> 00:48:37,526
temporality and retention, retention and

1192
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:41,050
so on is a step toward

1193
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,220
kind of process thinking, right? But

1194
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,406
ultimately, I believe that Husserlian

1195
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:50,726
philosophy, or more precisely,

1196
00:48:50,758 --> 00:48:54,430
historian phenomenology, fails to escape

1197
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,438
the trap of substance thinking.

1198
00:48:57,604 --> 00:49:01,422
Because, you see, if I read

1199
00:49:01,476 --> 00:49:05,106
a direct quote from Husserl himself, he

1200
00:49:05,128 --> 00:49:07,442
says that time is like a flow but with

1201
00:49:07,496 --> 00:49:10,306
divisions. In other words, not like a

1202
00:49:10,328 --> 00:49:13,554
flow at all and in fact the opposite of

1203
00:49:13,592 --> 00:49:17,954
a flow. So the

1204
00:49:17,992 --> 00:49:23,094
reason he doesn't bestow this

1205
00:49:23,132 --> 00:49:26,742
kind of primacy to the temporality or

1206
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:30,234
continuity is because obviously it

1207
00:49:30,272 --> 00:49:32,426
results in action prediction. In other

1208
00:49:32,448 --> 00:49:33,020
words,

1209
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,614
if time is what constitutes object in

1210
00:49:43,652 --> 00:49:45,806
time, obviously that cannot itself be an

1211
00:49:45,828 --> 00:49:49,230
object in time. So he needs a more

1212
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,810
primary way or more primary

1213
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:56,194
concept to account for that kind of

1214
00:49:56,232 --> 00:49:59,394
division in temporality, namely the

1215
00:49:59,432 --> 00:50:02,418
absolute flu. But, well,

1216
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:05,502
there are some arguments regarding

1217
00:50:05,646 --> 00:50:09,346
whether we can escape this apparent

1218
00:50:09,458 --> 00:50:12,600
or real contradiction or not,

1219
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,454
which I'm not going into detail, but one

1220
00:50:16,492 --> 00:50:20,154
point I wanted to make is that if we

1221
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:23,882
also try to bestow this

1222
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:27,834
kind of primacy to the absolute

1223
00:50:27,952 --> 00:50:30,950
flow or Husserlian. Absolute flow?

1224
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,630
Don't you think? We basically contradict

1225
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:37,200
our initial aim to escape that

1226
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,186
kind of substance

1227
00:50:42,218 --> 00:50:44,946
thinking? Given this contradiction that

1228
00:50:44,968 --> 00:50:47,906
arises? That's one of my question. The

1229
00:50:47,928 --> 00:50:51,220
other ones is about

1230
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,114
the conception of objective time and

1231
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:58,174
subjective time. So interestingly

1232
00:50:58,302 --> 00:51:01,778
well, you also began your discussion of

1233
00:51:01,784 --> 00:51:05,986
usurlean phenomenology with Hussarl's

1234
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:09,074
famous musical example. And it's very

1235
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,978
interesting that probably the most

1236
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:15,050
influential music theory of the past 100

1237
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,170
years, namely the Shankarian theory,

1238
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,874
is fundamentally a phenomenological

1239
00:51:21,942 --> 00:51:25,502
theory because he

1240
00:51:25,556 --> 00:51:28,542
tries to theorize how we perceive each

1241
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:32,298
moment in music as a culmination

1242
00:51:32,394 --> 00:51:35,586
of every bits of music we've heard so

1243
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:38,658
far until that point.

1244
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:41,038
And on the other hand, the anticipation

1245
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:44,066
of what is to come and the other. So

1246
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,580
each point of music is a kind of

1247
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,366
combination of all the elements of

1248
00:51:49,388 --> 00:51:50,150
retention,

1249
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,626
primal moment and also the pretension.

1250
00:51:56,658 --> 00:52:00,806
But there are some criticisms

1251
00:52:00,918 --> 00:52:04,442
put forward, especially by

1252
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,610
Gerald Levinson regarding the

1253
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,050
feasibility of this kind of description

1254
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,174
because of our limited capacity of our

1255
00:52:14,212 --> 00:52:17,294
short term and working memory in trying

1256
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:20,974
to at least consciously grasp all of the

1257
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:24,594
details of the past and also our

1258
00:52:24,632 --> 00:52:27,860
limited capacity to predict every

1259
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,478
possible future or every anticipation

1260
00:52:32,574 --> 00:52:35,698
from that single point. So my question

1261
00:52:35,784 --> 00:52:39,686
is, and also there is

1262
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:43,254
another criticism regarding the the

1263
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:47,858
ignoring the elasticity

1264
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:52,022
of perceived time in Shankarian theory

1265
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,806
and also in Husserlian phenomenology.

1266
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:58,220
So my question is how would you account

1267
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:02,490
for this kind of apparent elasticity

1268
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:07,198
that all of us experience in the

1269
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:11,280
subjective or manifest time?

1270
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:14,946
And my very last question, sorry it took

1271
00:53:14,968 --> 00:53:17,954
me so long. My very last question is

1272
00:53:17,992 --> 00:53:21,106
about the objective time, which is do

1273
00:53:21,128 --> 00:53:23,394
you have any particular justification or

1274
00:53:23,432 --> 00:53:26,806
any particular reason for choosing one

1275
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,494
among many of the physical theories of

1276
00:53:29,532 --> 00:53:32,166
objective time? So, for instance, we

1277
00:53:32,188 --> 00:53:35,474
have view from quantum gravity,

1278
00:53:35,602 --> 00:53:37,960
view from relativity, which basically

1279
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,934
can be seen as kind of contradictory

1280
00:53:40,982 --> 00:53:45,962
because in general relativity we

1281
00:53:46,016 --> 00:53:49,434
allow for the time for temporality to be

1282
00:53:49,472 --> 00:53:52,074
fundamental. But in quantum gravity,

1283
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:54,430
temporality is a kind of emergent

1284
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:58,638
property that emerges from

1285
00:53:58,804 --> 00:54:02,190
Duit Wheeler equation. So is there

1286
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:06,750
a specific reason that you

1287
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,030
decided to choose Carlo Rovelli's

1288
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,980
conception of objective time?

1289
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:17,202
Again, apologies for my long winded

1290
00:54:17,266 --> 00:54:20,360
question. I'm looking forward.

1291
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,220
Did I stop sharing my screen?

1292
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,306
Probably it would be better so we. Can

1293
00:54:31,328 --> 00:54:33,726
see each other. Will you start? I think

1294
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:36,160
some of the first questions were about

1295
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:40,334
the ephemology. I have a few comments to

1296
00:54:40,372 --> 00:54:43,986
that and I think that if I may yeah, go

1297
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:47,726
ahead. I also have some comments,

1298
00:54:47,758 --> 00:54:50,546
but go ahead. Yeah, so I would like to

1299
00:54:50,568 --> 00:54:52,782
just start by making the distinction

1300
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:56,218
between time perception and temporality

1301
00:54:56,254 --> 00:55:00,290
in phenomenology. Because temporality

1302
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:03,954
is more basic than time perception.

1303
00:55:04,002 --> 00:55:05,490
Time perception is actually a skill.

1304
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,926
It's actually something like it's sort

1305
00:55:07,948 --> 00:55:09,830
of like attention and memory and so on.

1306
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,318
It's a skill set we have and it's

1307
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:13,434
something that we are performing. Some

1308
00:55:13,472 --> 00:55:15,754
are good at it, some are very bad, like

1309
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:19,258
me. But in any case,

1310
00:55:19,424 --> 00:55:21,486
temporality and phenomenology talks not

1311
00:55:21,508 --> 00:55:25,214
about how your skills about time

1312
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:27,678
perception. It's more about the actual

1313
00:55:27,764 --> 00:55:29,774
unfolding of anything. Like any

1314
00:55:29,812 --> 00:55:32,590
experience whatsoever. Like me now

1315
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,458
shaping these thoughts to sort of convey

1316
00:55:34,474 --> 00:55:36,174
them. I'm not thinking about time

1317
00:55:36,212 --> 00:55:37,906
perception. I'm actually happening. And

1318
00:55:37,928 --> 00:55:39,282
there's like this unfolding of time

1319
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,038
constantly, this continuous flow,

1320
00:55:41,134 --> 00:55:44,306
right? Whenever I talk about it, I like

1321
00:55:44,328 --> 00:55:47,506
to think about Lee smallen's reality of

1322
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:50,310
time. I think that there is some truth

1323
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:52,886
to his way of reasoning about time. The

1324
00:55:52,908 --> 00:55:54,502
fact that it's real and it's actually

1325
00:55:54,556 --> 00:55:56,486
more real than space. And space is

1326
00:55:56,508 --> 00:55:58,562
actually the emergent property of time.

1327
00:55:58,636 --> 00:56:00,602
That's actually, by the way, from

1328
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:03,946
category theory and geometry theory as

1329
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:07,500
well. That's where that comes from.

1330
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,050
Because if you think about it like that,

1331
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,030
if you think about the time being, the

1332
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,622
thing that sort of pushes us forward,

1333
00:56:14,676 --> 00:56:17,374
right there's like this action, I would

1334
00:56:17,412 --> 00:56:19,434
even say that it's an involuntary

1335
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:21,166
action. Like you're constantly doing

1336
00:56:21,188 --> 00:56:23,566
this, it's constantly happening. So for

1337
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,434
me, I would make a clear distinction

1338
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,230
between time perception and temporality.

1339
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,186
Now, if I just jump directly to the end

1340
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:32,514
of the question because I love to deal

1341
00:56:32,552 --> 00:56:34,754
with you ask why did we go with

1342
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,866
calorovelli's thermodynamic arrow of

1343
00:56:36,888 --> 00:56:38,966
time? There is a good reason for that.

1344
00:56:38,988 --> 00:56:41,606
Because in the beginning, I believe we

1345
00:56:41,628 --> 00:56:44,850
discussed briefly the wheel of divit

1346
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,726
equations. Because in that equation you

1347
00:56:46,748 --> 00:56:48,326
completely take away time, right? You

1348
00:56:48,348 --> 00:56:49,946
just say, well, basically you can

1349
00:56:49,968 --> 00:56:52,538
explain any kind of dynamics and change

1350
00:56:52,624 --> 00:56:54,826
without any variable of time. You just

1351
00:56:54,848 --> 00:56:59,014
need spatial parameters. I personally

1352
00:56:59,062 --> 00:57:01,482
think that that's great, that shows that

1353
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:03,838
math works. Doesn't mean that that's how

1354
00:57:03,844 --> 00:57:07,086
it works. To me, the way that I think

1355
00:57:07,108 --> 00:57:11,166
about it is more about so it

1356
00:57:11,188 --> 00:57:12,286
doesn't matter what I think about it.

1357
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:15,586
Why do we go with thermodynamic color of

1358
00:57:15,608 --> 00:57:18,018
endothermodynamic approach? Because he

1359
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:20,994
starts with entropy. And that sort of

1360
00:57:21,032 --> 00:57:24,398
builds perfectly well on our approach

1361
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:26,574
and our analysis of active inference

1362
00:57:26,622 --> 00:57:29,342
being built on entropy being, however,

1363
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:31,426
another kind of entropy. It still builds

1364
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,634
on the very same, let's say ontology,

1365
00:57:33,762 --> 00:57:35,478
right? It's built on the same idea and

1366
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:38,710
it fits. That idea could still be wrong.

1367
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:42,426
In any case, if you go with David and

1368
00:57:42,448 --> 00:57:45,180
Wheeler's equations, you still have

1369
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,386
another dimension of time that is

1370
00:57:47,408 --> 00:57:49,786
different from the subjective one. I

1371
00:57:49,808 --> 00:57:51,286
think I should be clear here that I'm

1372
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:53,734
not saying that they exist

1373
00:57:53,782 --> 00:57:55,786
independently. I'm just saying that it's

1374
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:57,486
two different things and we can think

1375
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,966
about them individually. And there is an

1376
00:57:59,988 --> 00:58:01,454
advantage in doing something like that

1377
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:02,942
because then you can start looking at

1378
00:58:02,996 --> 00:58:05,246
how they integrate afterwards. So this

1379
00:58:05,268 --> 00:58:08,514
is merely convenience, right? There is

1380
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:10,706
no such thing as only a subjective time

1381
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:11,986
without objective time. And the other

1382
00:58:12,008 --> 00:58:14,546
way around, this is not part of the

1383
00:58:14,568 --> 00:58:16,758
paper. It's way beyond the scope of the

1384
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:17,560
paper. Anyway.

1385
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,946
Yeah, kind of lashing into Sack's

1386
00:58:22,978 --> 00:58:25,686
comment towards the end is that when we

1387
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,186
were writing the paper, we're discussing

1388
00:58:27,218 --> 00:58:28,886
slightly about how we should address

1389
00:58:28,988 --> 00:58:30,982
objective time. And in the end we

1390
00:58:31,036 --> 00:58:33,874
decided to use calorie by this framework

1391
00:58:34,002 --> 00:58:36,102
as sax, as just a matter of convenience.

1392
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:38,426
I think at least I'm very much an

1393
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:40,586
instrumentalist in that sense, that you

1394
00:58:40,608 --> 00:58:42,426
can have a lot of different stories of

1395
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:45,546
how physical time works, and that's

1396
00:58:45,578 --> 00:58:47,486
important and that's okay. But in the

1397
00:58:47,508 --> 00:58:49,678
end, I don't think that affects much our

1398
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:52,426
overall purpose, which is to say there's

1399
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:54,634
an integration between an objective

1400
00:58:54,682 --> 00:58:56,978
sense of time, take calorie, take

1401
00:58:57,064 --> 00:58:59,490
quantum physics, et cetera, and

1402
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,922
subjectivity in which we are pretty much

1403
00:59:01,976 --> 00:59:03,918
committed to the Husserlin framework.

1404
00:59:04,014 --> 00:59:05,634
Which this brings me to the other two

1405
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:08,598
questions concerning the first one about

1406
00:59:08,684 --> 00:59:11,350
kind of the relationship between process

1407
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,846
ontology and husserlin phenomenology. I

1408
00:59:13,868 --> 00:59:16,118
think the important thing to note here,

1409
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:17,686
and this is my interpretation, to be

1410
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:19,862
honest, is that when we talk about

1411
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:22,114
consciousness and time, consciousness

1412
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:24,198
and the absolute flow within the

1413
00:59:24,204 --> 00:59:26,426
Husserlin framework, it's important to

1414
00:59:26,448 --> 00:59:28,698
notice that it is not a thing. And I

1415
00:59:28,704 --> 00:59:30,346
think it's also an important thing to

1416
00:59:30,368 --> 00:59:32,606
keep in mind when we address how are we

1417
00:59:32,628 --> 00:59:34,910
to explain consciousness scientifically.

1418
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:39,194
I do believe that a sort of implicit

1419
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,814
assumption within a lot of the

1420
00:59:40,852 --> 00:59:42,462
literature, especially the earlier one,

1421
00:59:42,516 --> 00:59:44,282
is to assume that consciousness,

1422
00:59:44,346 --> 00:59:46,626
insofar as a phenomenon, it's also a

1423
00:59:46,648 --> 00:59:49,106
thing that has to arise from, say,

1424
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:51,294
neural processes or neurophysiological

1425
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:53,550
processes or whatever kind of frame

1426
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:54,866
you're subscribing to, but it's not

1427
00:59:54,888 --> 00:59:56,706
really that. And that's the nice thing

1428
00:59:56,728 --> 00:59:58,738
about phenomenologists, especially in

1429
00:59:58,744 --> 01:00:00,438
phenomenology, is that when you go to

1430
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:03,734
the kind of the deep level of whatever

1431
01:00:03,772 --> 01:00:05,794
is happening subjectively, you won't

1432
01:00:05,842 --> 01:00:07,766
find a thing. You find what he calls the

1433
01:00:07,788 --> 01:00:10,038
absolute flow, which does sound like a

1434
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:12,122
thing as a river. And he does say that

1435
01:00:12,176 --> 01:00:13,526
it's a flow, but it's not. There's

1436
01:00:13,558 --> 01:00:15,414
always this hesitation in the literature

1437
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:19,050
because he notices that

1438
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,180
everything in flow, what we experience,

1439
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,806
there's a lot of stuff happening at the

1440
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,966
same time and in time, but it kind of

1441
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:28,234
keeps an structure which is retention,

1442
01:00:28,282 --> 01:00:30,414
primal impression and protention. So

1443
01:00:30,452 --> 01:00:32,954
there's this kind of paradoxical nature

1444
01:00:33,002 --> 01:00:35,338
to the absolute flow. It's pure flow,

1445
01:00:35,434 --> 01:00:38,194
but it has a specific structure. But

1446
01:00:38,232 --> 01:00:39,774
when you look at how that structure

1447
01:00:39,822 --> 01:00:41,522
functions and that's kind of the step

1448
01:00:41,576 --> 01:00:43,266
that he takes from what the so called

1449
01:00:43,368 --> 01:00:45,214
static to the genetic or dynamical

1450
01:00:45,262 --> 01:00:47,906
phenomenology is that this structure is

1451
01:00:47,928 --> 01:00:49,990
just a set of processes that are always

1452
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,014
happening, not things. It's not that

1453
01:00:53,052 --> 01:00:54,674
retention is a thing, but no, it's

1454
01:00:54,722 --> 01:00:56,038
literally processes, happening,

1455
01:00:56,124 --> 01:00:58,066
synthesis, as he calls it. And that's

1456
01:00:58,098 --> 01:01:00,886
what we think it's interesting to

1457
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,166
connect to the ActInf inference

1458
01:01:02,198 --> 01:01:04,246
framework or any other modeling

1459
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:06,282
framework, is that then you don't really

1460
01:01:06,336 --> 01:01:08,986
have to capture a thing, say quality as

1461
01:01:09,168 --> 01:01:10,714
the redness of the red, but actually

1462
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:12,982
you're just trying to capture processes

1463
01:01:13,126 --> 01:01:15,410
with processes. So you have retention

1464
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:18,046
and you have inferences that's it you

1465
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:19,774
don't have really things, you have stuff

1466
01:01:19,812 --> 01:01:21,614
that is happening through time and you

1467
01:01:21,652 --> 01:01:23,054
don't really have to commit to any sort

1468
01:01:23,092 --> 01:01:25,986
of object ontology. You have just

1469
01:01:26,008 --> 01:01:28,578
processes moving on through which

1470
01:01:28,664 --> 01:01:30,958
something more stable arises. But it's

1471
01:01:30,974 --> 01:01:32,914
not a thing. Once again, when we

1472
01:01:32,952 --> 01:01:35,138
experience, say, the bottle, it's a

1473
01:01:35,144 --> 01:01:37,554
thing, but it's always given itself in

1474
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:38,966
time. It's always changing. I can see

1475
01:01:38,988 --> 01:01:41,494
its movement. I can move around all its

1476
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:43,510
time. That's the nice thing about it.

1477
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,560
And concerning the other question,

1478
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:49,560
which was the one and the limitations on

1479
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:52,486
working. Memory, how's the elasticity of

1480
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,982
time perception. Can you elaborate more

1481
01:01:55,036 --> 01:01:57,098
about the concepts of elasticity as you

1482
01:01:57,104 --> 01:02:00,314
were using it? Sure. You see

1483
01:02:00,432 --> 01:02:03,662
the familiar phenomena that we

1484
01:02:03,716 --> 01:02:06,686
experience when we somehow experience

1485
01:02:06,788 --> 01:02:09,774
this speeding up or slowing down the

1486
01:02:09,812 --> 01:02:12,634
experience or living present. That's

1487
01:02:12,682 --> 01:02:15,026
basically what I mean by elasticity of

1488
01:02:15,048 --> 01:02:18,210
time perception. Brilliant.

1489
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:21,858
I often wonder because certainly when we

1490
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:24,178
talk about subjective temporality in the

1491
01:02:24,184 --> 01:02:26,398
husserlin sense, that's not really what

1492
01:02:26,424 --> 01:02:29,046
he's trying to capture. That's quite

1493
01:02:29,068 --> 01:02:32,726
clear. When he talks about structure of

1494
01:02:32,748 --> 01:02:34,306
time conscious, he's very explicit.

1495
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:35,586
We're talking about formal structure

1496
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:37,926
that remains arguably invariant through

1497
01:02:37,948 --> 01:02:39,606
all experiences. But it's true that

1498
01:02:39,628 --> 01:02:41,446
there's a sort of flexibility to how to

1499
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:44,602
experience the world. And this is

1500
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:46,426
literally a speculation for me. I'd have

1501
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:47,578
to sit down and think more about it.

1502
01:02:47,584 --> 01:02:48,682
But I think there's an important

1503
01:02:48,736 --> 01:02:49,978
connection between affectivity and

1504
01:02:49,984 --> 01:02:53,466
temporality here. So especially

1505
01:02:53,568 --> 01:02:55,750
in activism, there's this discussions

1506
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,214
about how affectivity and time conscious

1507
01:02:58,262 --> 01:03:00,302
in the Australian or Penometrical sense

1508
01:03:00,436 --> 01:03:03,246
link to one another. For example, this

1509
01:03:03,268 --> 01:03:04,798
is not an activism disclosure. Matthew

1510
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,866
Ratcliffe talks about styles of

1511
01:03:06,888 --> 01:03:08,414
anticipation. We may anticipate

1512
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:12,018
something with anxiety or with hope or

1513
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:14,574
with fear, and that probably stretches

1514
01:03:14,622 --> 01:03:17,710
out not only that we anticipate, but how

1515
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,974
we anticipate. And that's very important

1516
01:03:20,012 --> 01:03:21,266
distinction between how we anticipate

1517
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,770
something and what we're anticipating

1518
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,726
something. And this also kind of

1519
01:03:24,748 --> 01:03:28,166
constitutes our general openness to the

1520
01:03:28,188 --> 01:03:30,378
world because, say, I'm sitting down

1521
01:03:30,464 --> 01:03:32,474
completely bored, waiting for something,

1522
01:03:32,592 --> 01:03:36,060
not only the experience of time kind of

1523
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:40,186
stretches out, but also there's a

1524
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:42,038
special kind of effective atmosphere to

1525
01:03:42,064 --> 01:03:44,862
our world. But once again, this kind of

1526
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:46,974
opens up another question about for

1527
01:03:47,012 --> 01:03:48,686
computational neurophenomenology, which

1528
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:50,666
is, okay, now we have inactive

1529
01:03:50,698 --> 01:03:52,430
inference, this kind of clear cut

1530
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,182
temporal structure that links up to

1531
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:57,246
cocellant phenomenology. How can we

1532
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:58,686
introduce effectivity into the picture?

1533
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,074
And there's of course a lot of work and

1534
01:04:01,112 --> 01:04:02,946
effectivity emotions athlete more

1535
01:04:02,968 --> 01:04:04,494
generally in the active inference

1536
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:06,290
framework. But that's an interesting

1537
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,534
question. How does it relate to our

1538
01:04:08,572 --> 01:04:11,654
temporal model? I don't know if Zach has

1539
01:04:11,692 --> 01:04:14,822
anything else to add? I was just

1540
01:04:14,956 --> 01:04:17,878
reminded of a few things there. I think

1541
01:04:17,964 --> 01:04:20,262
you're totally on point with everything

1542
01:04:20,316 --> 01:04:22,406
you said. I just want to emphasize the

1543
01:04:22,428 --> 01:04:24,454
fact that the stretch and the plasticity

1544
01:04:24,502 --> 01:04:25,974
of time is still, in my opinion,

1545
01:04:26,022 --> 01:04:27,450
something of a skill that we have.

1546
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,874
Right? It's an impression. And that

1547
01:04:28,912 --> 01:04:31,580
impression is something that we get at.

1548
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,106
And just because I have that experience

1549
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,446
doesn't mean if I had, like, a twin and

1550
01:04:36,468 --> 01:04:37,918
we were doing this not even just a

1551
01:04:37,924 --> 01:04:39,214
friend, and we were doing the exact same

1552
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:41,262
thing, that stretch will be very

1553
01:04:41,316 --> 01:04:44,254
individual. And that just means that it

1554
01:04:44,292 --> 01:04:47,442
depends on who you are and your skill at

1555
01:04:47,496 --> 01:04:49,506
doing that. I cannot really

1556
01:04:49,608 --> 01:04:51,278
differentiate between time perception

1557
01:04:51,294 --> 01:04:53,234
and the plasticity that sort of is

1558
01:04:53,272 --> 01:04:55,406
implicit in time perception. I cannot

1559
01:04:55,438 --> 01:04:57,886
distinguish that from other skills,

1560
01:04:57,918 --> 01:05:00,246
like being able to remember something or

1561
01:05:00,348 --> 01:05:02,360
directing your attention at something

1562
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:04,886
because that's exactly the same thing.

1563
01:05:04,908 --> 01:05:06,214
We don't have the same skill. Like,

1564
01:05:06,252 --> 01:05:08,590
some people are very bad at suppressing

1565
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,338
peripheral information, others are not.

1566
01:05:11,424 --> 01:05:13,260
And it just continues like that.

1567
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,900
But I do have a point.

1568
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:20,746
So do you guys know James Terrell, the

1569
01:05:20,768 --> 01:05:23,786
light designer? Artist, american artist?

1570
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:25,726
He's a fantastic light designer. I

1571
01:05:25,828 --> 01:05:27,934
highly recommend you go see all of his

1572
01:05:27,972 --> 01:05:31,326
work. Basically, he studied the

1573
01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:34,186
eye and vision. So he's not a vision

1574
01:05:34,218 --> 01:05:35,706
neuroscientist, but he studied vision

1575
01:05:35,738 --> 01:05:37,602
for many, many years. And he's a light

1576
01:05:37,656 --> 01:05:39,234
designer. And basically he creates these

1577
01:05:39,272 --> 01:05:42,386
huge installations everywhere. And one

1578
01:05:42,408 --> 01:05:44,066
that really caught my attention was in

1579
01:05:44,088 --> 01:05:47,426
Japan, I think now it's seven years ago,

1580
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:49,654
where we went into this pitch dark room,

1581
01:05:49,692 --> 01:05:51,606
right? It's a big temple that was

1582
01:05:51,788 --> 01:05:53,974
reconstructed. Pitch dark, couldn't see

1583
01:05:54,012 --> 01:05:55,926
anything. And you just had to touch the

1584
01:05:55,948 --> 01:05:57,720
wall. And you had to follow the wall.

1585
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,662
And then suddenly you feel like, okay,

1586
01:06:00,716 --> 01:06:02,658
now there are other people also holding

1587
01:06:02,674 --> 01:06:04,794
the wall. And you sort of feel other

1588
01:06:04,832 --> 01:06:06,618
people. You go, okay, I need to stop. I

1589
01:06:06,624 --> 01:06:07,946
shouldn't follow the wall anymore. And

1590
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:09,306
at some point, you're just staring out

1591
01:06:09,328 --> 01:06:11,734
in complete darkness. The space suddenly

1592
01:06:11,782 --> 01:06:14,734
emerges. Your eyes adjust to the very,

1593
01:06:14,772 --> 01:06:18,366
very low light. Well, the lux I don't

1594
01:06:18,388 --> 01:06:20,158
know the exact illuminance. I suppose in

1595
01:06:20,164 --> 01:06:22,798
English, the very low illuminance, you

1596
01:06:22,804 --> 01:06:24,642
start to adjust. And this can only

1597
01:06:24,696 --> 01:06:27,394
happen over time. I think that this sort

1598
01:06:27,432 --> 01:06:29,310
of is an example of temporality,

1599
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:32,046
sensory impression content. I wouldn't

1600
01:06:32,078 --> 01:06:33,474
say quality, because I don't buy into

1601
01:06:33,512 --> 01:06:34,100
that.

1602
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:38,518
I'm more of a time person. I don't know

1603
01:06:38,524 --> 01:06:41,638
if you get the impression. But I have a

1604
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:43,318
question for you as well, Ellie, if I

1605
01:06:43,324 --> 01:06:46,166
may, because this example that I just

1606
01:06:46,188 --> 01:06:49,258
gave here with James Terrell and I'm an

1607
01:06:49,264 --> 01:06:51,674
architect myself, usually I give that

1608
01:06:51,712 --> 01:06:53,370
example with the spaces.

1609
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:56,474
Would you say that it's the same

1610
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,122
experience or would you say that those

1611
01:06:58,176 --> 01:07:00,090
are two very different experiences?

1612
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:05,338
Well, certainly there are similarities

1613
01:07:05,434 --> 01:07:08,014
between those two experiences. I'm not

1614
01:07:08,052 --> 01:07:12,174
sure if they're identical or even they

1615
01:07:12,212 --> 01:07:14,690
can be. Discussed,

1616
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:18,706
I don't know in the same terms,

1617
01:07:18,888 --> 01:07:22,180
but going back to your

1618
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:25,554
point on the temporality and also the

1619
01:07:25,592 --> 01:07:30,006
skill, the discrepancy between the

1620
01:07:30,028 --> 01:07:33,366
primacy of the temporality versus the

1621
01:07:33,468 --> 01:07:37,270
scale of time perception, I certainly

1622
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,762
agree with you on that. But I also

1623
01:07:40,816 --> 01:07:43,180
believe that, you see,

1624
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:47,334
I don't think, at least in my opinion,

1625
01:07:47,382 --> 01:07:50,774
that temporality or the absolute flow,

1626
01:07:50,822 --> 01:07:53,118
or at least historically an absolute

1627
01:07:53,204 --> 01:07:59,114
flow, is the most fundamental

1628
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:01,674
concept that needs to be grounded

1629
01:08:01,722 --> 01:08:05,602
because there needs to be even

1630
01:08:05,656 --> 01:08:09,742
more fundamental prior to even existence

1631
01:08:09,806 --> 01:08:12,334
of that temporality or that flow.

1632
01:08:12,382 --> 01:08:15,726
Right? Which I'm not going into details

1633
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,634
about how that fundamentality can

1634
01:08:19,672 --> 01:08:22,614
be accounted for or it can even be

1635
01:08:22,652 --> 01:08:25,910
discussed in terms of our

1636
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,706
observed phenomena or our experience

1637
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:31,946
phenomena. But I wanted to thank both of

1638
01:08:31,968 --> 01:08:35,434
you for your extensive response you

1639
01:08:35,472 --> 01:08:38,442
provided and helpful responses. I wanted

1640
01:08:38,496 --> 01:08:42,560
to ask for your permission to

1641
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:45,854
I wanted to discuss these matters a bit

1642
01:08:45,892 --> 01:08:48,078
further with you. So if you permit, I

1643
01:08:48,084 --> 01:08:50,400
wanted to email you about them and

1644
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,342
discuss them a bit further because

1645
01:08:53,476 --> 01:08:55,774
that's something that I'm deeply

1646
01:08:55,822 --> 01:08:58,594
interested in. So, again, thank you so

1647
01:08:58,632 --> 01:09:02,066
much. Thank you. Of course. Thank you.

1648
01:09:02,088 --> 01:09:04,834
Can I say something before we go? Just a

1649
01:09:04,872 --> 01:09:06,642
small thing, because Ali just mentioned

1650
01:09:06,696 --> 01:09:08,226
this that he doesn't think that the

1651
01:09:08,248 --> 01:09:10,786
balls is kind of the basic thing. And I

1652
01:09:10,808 --> 01:09:12,134
don't know to what extent I agree. But

1653
01:09:12,172 --> 01:09:13,606
something I do think that happens is

1654
01:09:13,628 --> 01:09:15,218
that at least in the Whosolian

1655
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,498
framework, this kind of conception,

1656
01:09:16,514 --> 01:09:18,134
that consciousness or subjectivity more

1657
01:09:18,172 --> 01:09:20,166
generally is this kind of layered or

1658
01:09:20,188 --> 01:09:22,506
hierarchical structure of which you have

1659
01:09:22,528 --> 01:09:25,226
to find literally the basis and go from

1660
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:27,594
the ground up, so to speak. And I think

1661
01:09:27,632 --> 01:09:30,838
there's something true to that, but it's

1662
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:33,566
not as hierarchical as Wishful would put

1663
01:09:33,588 --> 01:09:35,326
it. Because once again, this brings us

1664
01:09:35,348 --> 01:09:36,878
back to the concept, this relationship

1665
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,650
between affectivity and temporality.

1666
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:41,738
For me, I would say affectivity informs

1667
01:09:41,754 --> 01:09:43,146
temporality, and temporality informs

1668
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:45,646
affectivity are co emergent. But how can

1669
01:09:45,668 --> 01:09:47,626
you affect it? Because you have a body

1670
01:09:47,668 --> 01:09:49,906
and then you introduce embodiment into

1671
01:09:49,928 --> 01:09:50,926
the picture. And if you introduce

1672
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:53,266
embodiment to the picture, you open up a

1673
01:09:53,288 --> 01:09:55,278
lot of like you open up the Pandora's

1674
01:09:55,294 --> 01:09:58,322
box almost. So maybe this whole idea of

1675
01:09:58,376 --> 01:10:00,726
the most basic stuff, it's a bit of a

1676
01:10:00,748 --> 01:10:02,322
red herring. But I also think there's

1677
01:10:02,386 --> 01:10:04,166
something valuable and Husserl would

1678
01:10:04,188 --> 01:10:06,482
agree on this bit, is that temporality

1679
01:10:06,546 --> 01:10:09,126
is very abstract. It's just a formal

1680
01:10:09,158 --> 01:10:11,210
structure which underpins all

1681
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,006
experience, regardless of whether it's

1682
01:10:14,038 --> 01:10:16,438
the most basic structure or not. That's

1683
01:10:16,454 --> 01:10:18,458
a different question. And that's all I

1684
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,246
wanted to say for now. Awesome. All

1685
01:10:21,268 --> 01:10:24,554
right, we'll pause

1686
01:10:24,602 --> 01:10:26,640
in time and move on.

1687
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:31,200
Dean, please. Where does this take you?

1688
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:35,138
Well, I'm like Ally a whole bunch of

1689
01:10:35,144 --> 01:10:37,602
places. I'm not like Ally in the sense

1690
01:10:37,656 --> 01:10:40,626
that I do place a very high priority and

1691
01:10:40,648 --> 01:10:44,114
emphasis on timing and

1692
01:10:44,152 --> 01:10:46,370
perspectives. That doesn't mean that

1693
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,006
Allie and I don't get along

1694
01:10:48,188 --> 01:10:51,234
fantastically. We do it's just that it's

1695
01:10:51,282 --> 01:10:53,526
that different perspective thing that I

1696
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:55,782
think gives this whole topic a certain

1697
01:10:55,836 --> 01:10:58,182
richness. I want to touch for a second

1698
01:10:58,236 --> 01:11:02,726
on Zach's teasing

1699
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,666
out the word skills because I think

1700
01:11:04,688 --> 01:11:06,794
that's really important here. My

1701
01:11:06,832 --> 01:11:08,902
background is sort of in the practical

1702
01:11:09,046 --> 01:11:12,786
aspects of learning. So I tend

1703
01:11:12,838 --> 01:11:15,946
to zoom out on not just the particulars,

1704
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:18,446
but the whole picture. And I want to

1705
01:11:18,468 --> 01:11:22,014
just say before I ask my question is

1706
01:11:22,212 --> 01:11:24,886
I thought it was a fantastic comparative

1707
01:11:24,938 --> 01:11:27,394
analysis in your paper and I thought

1708
01:11:27,512 --> 01:11:29,166
your presentation and your sharings

1709
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,242
today were also very clear in terms of

1710
01:11:32,376 --> 01:11:34,818
being able to show difference and same,

1711
01:11:34,984 --> 01:11:38,646
which I think only comes about when we

1712
01:11:38,748 --> 01:11:41,542
account for the temporality. I'm not

1713
01:11:41,596 --> 01:11:44,646
saying measure it, but at least have a

1714
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:48,406
certain appreciation of it. So here's my

1715
01:11:48,428 --> 01:11:51,706
thing practicalities. In other

1716
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:54,170
words, the actions in active inference

1717
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:58,410
are not necessarily always a capture.

1718
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:03,146
That could be one form of an action,

1719
01:12:03,178 --> 01:12:05,614
but it's not the only one. There are

1720
01:12:05,652 --> 01:12:07,982
plays, there are creations and

1721
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:11,214
compositions which we looking at

1722
01:12:11,252 --> 01:12:13,862
category theory are quite intimately

1723
01:12:13,946 --> 01:12:17,346
familiar with now. So one

1724
01:12:17,368 --> 01:12:21,154
of the things that I tried to bring to

1725
01:12:21,192 --> 01:12:24,482
the conversation about a decade ago,

1726
01:12:24,616 --> 01:12:26,674
I was working with a number of people in

1727
01:12:26,712 --> 01:12:29,054
complexity science and complexity

1728
01:12:29,102 --> 01:12:31,574
research and they were huge maturana and

1729
01:12:31,612 --> 01:12:34,966
Varella fans. And for about two years

1730
01:12:35,068 --> 01:12:37,574
all I did was have conversations like

1731
01:12:37,612 --> 01:12:39,354
the one we're having today with

1732
01:12:39,392 --> 01:12:42,850
complexity scientists. And one of the

1733
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,234
things I tried to bring to them in terms

1734
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:47,034
of understanding the possibility of

1735
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:50,780
applying skills as learning were

1736
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,320
number one.

1737
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:56,062
You first have to be able to get people

1738
01:12:56,116 --> 01:12:59,534
to pay some sort of attention, have an

1739
01:12:59,572 --> 01:13:02,766
awareness of what they

1740
01:13:02,788 --> 01:13:05,680
are embedded in, what their niche is,

1741
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,618
what is being signaled to them, et

1742
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,246
cetera. Number two, you have to be able

1743
01:13:11,268 --> 01:13:13,966
to link and combine. And I know that in

1744
01:13:13,988 --> 01:13:16,950
a lot of formal learning settings, that

1745
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,422
association piece, that skill of being

1746
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:24,614
able to do that sort of compare and is

1747
01:13:24,652 --> 01:13:26,662
this same, is this different? Again,

1748
01:13:26,716 --> 01:13:28,838
category theory stuff, there's a heavy

1749
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:31,638
emphasis placed on that. Then there's

1750
01:13:31,654 --> 01:13:34,874
another skill which is to be able to set

1751
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:38,746
a rule, to be able to scale up around

1752
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:42,762
what is consistent, what is seeming,

1753
01:13:42,826 --> 01:13:45,520
to be able to have a certain shelf life

1754
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:48,250
and things that are changing rapidly,

1755
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:50,222
because you guys talked a lot about

1756
01:13:50,276 --> 01:13:52,910
change today. So that's basically an

1757
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:56,062
understanding. You can know in English

1758
01:13:56,126 --> 01:13:57,842
where that came from. You're basically

1759
01:13:57,976 --> 01:14:00,322
standing under the abstracted state,

1760
01:14:00,376 --> 01:14:02,926
the heuristics, the little sort of rules

1761
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:06,394
of thumb that you apply as a skill

1762
01:14:06,462 --> 01:14:09,126
subjectively. And then finally, and this

1763
01:14:09,148 --> 01:14:12,502
is one that's left off of most

1764
01:14:12,556 --> 01:14:15,014
conversations, there's a particular type

1765
01:14:15,052 --> 01:14:17,382
of self organ. All of these are self

1766
01:14:17,516 --> 01:14:19,574
organizations. Even if you're being

1767
01:14:19,612 --> 01:14:21,946
prompted by the teacher, you still have

1768
01:14:21,968 --> 01:14:24,166
to take up the skill of organizing

1769
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:27,242
yourself. But there's a fourth type of

1770
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,562
skill, which is a particular type of

1771
01:14:29,616 --> 01:14:32,094
self organization, which is being the

1772
01:14:32,132 --> 01:14:35,694
capacity to transfer recapitulate in a

1773
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:38,894
timely manner. And I think that's where

1774
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:41,998
your paper is opening up a bit of a

1775
01:14:42,004 --> 01:14:44,194
Pandora's box. It's not just a

1776
01:14:44,232 --> 01:14:46,254
comparison of objective and subjective

1777
01:14:46,302 --> 01:14:50,594
time. It's how do we know when

1778
01:14:50,632 --> 01:14:53,906
to reapply the rule? And I think from

1779
01:14:53,928 --> 01:14:57,286
a learning standpoint, that's a

1780
01:14:57,308 --> 01:14:59,746
big moment. It's not just a Eureka

1781
01:14:59,778 --> 01:15:03,302
moment, but it's a sense of do my

1782
01:15:03,356 --> 01:15:06,550
inferences now

1783
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,466
withstand the scrutiny of the

1784
01:15:09,488 --> 01:15:11,894
environment? The environment generally,

1785
01:15:12,022 --> 01:15:15,638
not just the niche. So is the niche

1786
01:15:15,814 --> 01:15:19,162
capturing us, or are we still free to

1787
01:15:19,216 --> 01:15:24,106
think about how that next move fits

1788
01:15:24,218 --> 01:15:26,494
with all the prior moves? And I think

1789
01:15:26,532 --> 01:15:29,486
that requires the representation that

1790
01:15:29,508 --> 01:15:30,894
you guys had in your paper, that

1791
01:15:30,932 --> 01:15:37,026
essential diagonal line. And so I

1792
01:15:37,048 --> 01:15:39,074
think that's what you did, I think what

1793
01:15:39,112 --> 01:15:40,980
you've touched on it and put into

1794
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:44,946
defendable form is, okay, so there's all

1795
01:15:44,968 --> 01:15:47,570
these skills, and do we cut ourselves

1796
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:51,474
off at the more phenomenological

1797
01:15:51,522 --> 01:15:54,086
ones? Are you paying attention? Are you

1798
01:15:54,108 --> 01:15:57,186
making associations? Or are you freeing

1799
01:15:57,218 --> 01:15:59,674
yourself up to be able to have these

1800
01:15:59,712 --> 01:16:04,134
rules, but then know when to repurpose

1801
01:16:04,182 --> 01:16:07,546
them as the context changes? So I

1802
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:10,314
want to applaud you because I've had

1803
01:16:10,352 --> 01:16:12,138
many, many conversations for over a

1804
01:16:12,144 --> 01:16:13,806
decade where there's a whole bunch of

1805
01:16:13,828 --> 01:16:16,446
people who do not want to talk about the

1806
01:16:16,548 --> 01:16:19,226
third and the fourth skill because it's

1807
01:16:19,258 --> 01:16:21,934
hard to measure, but I think you guys

1808
01:16:21,972 --> 01:16:27,102
have brought some ability to compose

1809
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:29,346
that. And so that's all I wanted to say.

1810
01:16:29,368 --> 01:16:31,298
I don't have any questions. Just want to

1811
01:16:31,304 --> 01:16:34,210
give you two claps.

1812
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:42,110
Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.

1813
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,836
I don't even know what to say because I

1814
01:16:45,858 --> 01:16:48,110
guess to Juan Diego and I,

1815
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,648
it was actually, I think, over a Twitter

1816
01:16:50,664 --> 01:16:52,396
conversation, we sort of realized a few

1817
01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:55,664
things and basically linked up and

1818
01:16:55,702 --> 01:16:57,692
started working on this. And apparently

1819
01:16:57,756 --> 01:16:59,216
we have a lot in common in terms of

1820
01:16:59,238 --> 01:17:01,472
philosophy. Well, and also other things.

1821
01:17:01,526 --> 01:17:04,404
But interestingly, we found out that

1822
01:17:04,522 --> 01:17:06,432
there was actually a plausible

1823
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:08,660
attractable relationship that we could

1824
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:12,324
exploit, so well,

1825
01:17:12,522 --> 01:17:15,876
thanks a lot. I'm very happy to

1826
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:17,236
see that there's someone else who is

1827
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:19,112
also like a very temporal person,

1828
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:21,624
right? Like thinking about things and

1829
01:17:21,662 --> 01:17:23,896
time and events rather than things. And

1830
01:17:23,918 --> 01:17:25,080
I think this is a very important

1831
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:28,008
distinction. Yeah, for sure. Thank you

1832
01:17:28,014 --> 01:17:30,156
for that comment, Dean. And I also think

1833
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:33,724
that it kind of speaks to the whole

1834
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:35,084
temporal thing we're talking about

1835
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:37,964
precisely because what we learn, we

1836
01:17:38,002 --> 01:17:39,804
learn through time. And that's kind of

1837
01:17:39,842 --> 01:17:43,244
obvious, but you have to kind of address

1838
01:17:43,362 --> 01:17:45,184
how this temporality works in order to

1839
01:17:45,222 --> 01:17:46,752
eventually talk about learning and

1840
01:17:46,806 --> 01:17:49,676
following rules and being understanding

1841
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,216
our environment. You were saying kind of

1842
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:52,716
understanding how to apply these rules

1843
01:17:52,748 --> 01:17:54,860
and how to apply different skills in a

1844
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,356
proper environment, adaptively, so to

1845
01:17:56,378 --> 01:17:59,444
speak. And something that first kind of

1846
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:01,620
attracted me to the active inference and

1847
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:04,756
FEP context was the possibility of

1848
01:18:04,778 --> 01:18:07,656
making sense of how, through updates to

1849
01:18:07,678 --> 01:18:10,984
generative models, you can try to make

1850
01:18:11,022 --> 01:18:13,944
sense formally of these skills and these

1851
01:18:13,982 --> 01:18:16,296
process that underline what it's like to

1852
01:18:16,318 --> 01:18:19,576
be an organism and a human being in a

1853
01:18:19,678 --> 01:18:21,412
changing world. And once again, it

1854
01:18:21,486 --> 01:18:23,352
brings us back to change temporality.

1855
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:25,820
All this stuff, it's all connected.

1856
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,596
Can I just do one quick follow up,

1857
01:18:29,618 --> 01:18:30,828
Daniel? Because I know I want to make

1858
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:33,440
sure you have some time as well. I think

1859
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:36,592
what people struggle with is they can

1860
01:18:36,726 --> 01:18:40,160
name it and call it transference.

1861
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:44,580
And oftentimes that gets conflated with

1862
01:18:44,650 --> 01:18:47,728
understanding and wisdom, and that isn't

1863
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:51,044
necessarily so. That timely way of

1864
01:18:51,082 --> 01:18:53,604
being able to recapitulate something is

1865
01:18:53,642 --> 01:18:56,504
an incredibly important skill. If we get

1866
01:18:56,542 --> 01:19:00,116
that wrong, we oftentimes materially

1867
01:19:00,148 --> 01:19:03,736
fall off a cliff. But whether or not we

1868
01:19:03,758 --> 01:19:07,272
can see it as both discretized as its

1869
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:10,712
own entity, its own particulars,

1870
01:19:10,776 --> 01:19:13,692
and part of this massive hole that

1871
01:19:13,746 --> 01:19:16,190
requires all of these priors as well,

1872
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,420
being able to juggle that,

1873
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:22,844
I think, is, again, that's what you've

1874
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:27,152
opened up here. And hopefully people

1875
01:19:27,206 --> 01:19:29,344
are able to then take that information

1876
01:19:29,542 --> 01:19:32,176
and test it, because that's the best

1877
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:34,756
thing to do. In fact, this morning, in

1878
01:19:34,778 --> 01:19:36,560
another separate conversation

1879
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:40,004
altogether, I was asked how to

1880
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:42,356
take some of the practicalities and the

1881
01:19:42,378 --> 01:19:44,308
skills that you guys talked about in

1882
01:19:44,314 --> 01:19:48,212
your paper and apply them in real time.

1883
01:19:48,346 --> 01:19:51,368
And it's not really, really hard if you

1884
01:19:51,374 --> 01:19:54,184
have at least those four skills. It is

1885
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:56,376
very difficult if you stop at the

1886
01:19:56,398 --> 01:19:59,892
associative level or if you stop at the

1887
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:02,604
I built a rule now, and I know how far

1888
01:20:02,642 --> 01:20:06,076
that rule will extend. So that's my

1889
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:08,684
final say for today. Go ahead. Sorry,

1890
01:20:08,722 --> 01:20:12,290
Daniel. Oh, it's all great.

1891
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,904
So many threads weaving together. So,

1892
01:20:15,942 --> 01:20:18,140
again, to both presenters and authors,

1893
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:22,400
it was excellent. The dominant

1894
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,976
sense or impression is that it's

1895
01:20:27,008 --> 01:20:30,112
very evocative, what you've presented.

1896
01:20:30,256 --> 01:20:32,884
The idea of a generative passage. Not

1897
01:20:32,922 --> 01:20:34,992
just does it touch upon generative

1898
01:20:35,056 --> 01:20:37,956
models, generative AI, but also this

1899
01:20:37,978 --> 01:20:40,736
idea that our travels are generative.

1900
01:20:40,848 --> 01:20:42,568
Like, whenever we see a friend and we

1901
01:20:42,574 --> 01:20:44,072
take the train, we always have some

1902
01:20:44,126 --> 01:20:45,976
story to share and like something that

1903
01:20:45,998 --> 01:20:48,148
happened along the way. I know that's

1904
01:20:48,164 --> 01:20:50,228
not necessarily how it's used, but it's

1905
01:20:50,244 --> 01:20:52,336
just what it evoked. When you describe

1906
01:20:52,388 --> 01:20:54,840
formal, dynamical models as generative

1907
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,536
passages, it's not 95 theses to pin

1908
01:20:58,568 --> 01:21:00,812
onto the door. It's something that

1909
01:21:00,866 --> 01:21:03,552
evokes. And you even spoke about taking

1910
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:05,344
different perspectives on your work

1911
01:21:05,462 --> 01:21:07,424
rather than your work advancing a

1912
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:09,696
perspective. And then to hear about the

1913
01:21:09,718 --> 01:21:12,992
connections with the light and sound art

1914
01:21:13,046 --> 01:21:16,964
and visual art and the

1915
01:21:17,002 --> 01:21:19,412
notion of architecture and your

1916
01:21:19,466 --> 01:21:21,664
background. Zach and the interplay

1917
01:21:21,712 --> 01:21:24,372
between space and time and the way that

1918
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:26,424
sometimes we can look at a blueprint and

1919
01:21:26,462 --> 01:21:28,312
see it as static, or even the

1920
01:21:28,366 --> 01:21:30,824
constructed, embodied building as a

1921
01:21:30,862 --> 01:21:34,024
static object when it also moves through

1922
01:21:34,062 --> 01:21:37,524
time. Then one more impression

1923
01:21:37,572 --> 01:21:39,950
and then a question. Finally,

1924
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,796
the vocabulary and the

1925
01:21:44,818 --> 01:21:47,164
delicacy of the articulation with the

1926
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,912
protention retention and the primal

1927
01:21:49,976 --> 01:21:53,184
impression or the living presence. And

1928
01:21:53,222 --> 01:21:55,312
then the way in which graphically you

1929
01:21:55,366 --> 01:21:58,860
arranged it along orthogonal axes

1930
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:02,352
like rows and columns that allowed us to

1931
01:22:02,406 --> 01:22:05,540
slide through on the diagonal.

1932
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,750
It gives a lot to work with.

1933
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,552
And my question is where is the action

1934
01:22:13,616 --> 01:22:16,352
perception loop? Or how do you believe

1935
01:22:16,426 --> 01:22:20,810
that this time consciousness and

1936
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,640
associated methods and skills?

1937
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,900
How can we then go back to potentially

1938
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:29,640
earlier or contemporary representations

1939
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,476
of the particular partition under the

1940
01:22:32,498 --> 01:22:36,696
FEP or just the active inference action

1941
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:40,764
perception loop? How can we see that or

1942
01:22:40,882 --> 01:22:43,296
be with that differently with the

1943
01:22:43,318 --> 01:22:45,936
advances that are happening literally in

1944
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:48,610
the last year in this area?

1945
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:56,796
Oh, man, that's right on. I mean,

1946
01:22:56,898 --> 01:22:58,976
spot on. This is exactly the kind of

1947
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:02,224
research I do. Basically, I have like,

1948
01:23:02,262 --> 01:23:05,856
I guess, two paths in my research. I

1949
01:23:05,878 --> 01:23:08,172
think 80% of my time is empirical

1950
01:23:08,236 --> 01:23:10,244
research, doing neuroscience and

1951
01:23:10,282 --> 01:23:12,308
basically doing experiments all the

1952
01:23:12,314 --> 01:23:14,676
time. And one way that I translate all

1953
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,676
of this, all of these insights that I

1954
01:23:16,698 --> 01:23:19,328
get from working with someone like Juan

1955
01:23:19,344 --> 01:23:22,490
Diego is to try to understand them as

1956
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,324
what I like to think about as sensory

1957
01:23:26,372 --> 01:23:29,304
motor entropy. Basically talking about

1958
01:23:29,342 --> 01:23:32,024
it as the interaction and the loop that

1959
01:23:32,062 --> 01:23:34,516
naturally occurs not only in action

1960
01:23:34,548 --> 01:23:36,476
perception, but also in past and

1961
01:23:36,498 --> 01:23:40,412
present. And if I may just briefly share

1962
01:23:40,466 --> 01:23:42,636
my screen again, I would like to show

1963
01:23:42,658 --> 01:23:45,788
you that this last aspect, I think I

1964
01:23:45,794 --> 01:23:47,790
hope you can see my arrow. I'm not sure

1965
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,372
I'm just going to take the laser pointer

1966
01:23:51,436 --> 01:23:53,712
just to be sure that this last point

1967
01:23:53,766 --> 01:23:56,064
here, I think this sort of maybe over

1968
01:23:56,102 --> 01:23:57,696
here it's better. You can see that the

1969
01:23:57,718 --> 01:23:59,890
retention and the protension sort of

1970
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:04,864
correlating or sort of meeting

1971
01:24:04,912 --> 01:24:06,896
here in the middle and sort of creating

1972
01:24:06,928 --> 01:24:08,516
a loop through time. So if we have to

1973
01:24:08,538 --> 01:24:10,224
jump from this point, this is the update

1974
01:24:10,272 --> 01:24:12,308
step some from updates that one to two.

1975
01:24:12,394 --> 01:24:13,912
You sort of need to create this

1976
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,360
interwoven link between them. This is

1977
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:18,728
naturally creating a loop between,

1978
01:24:18,894 --> 01:24:20,392
well, action and perception because

1979
01:24:20,446 --> 01:24:22,472
action what brings you forward in time

1980
01:24:22,526 --> 01:24:24,440
perception was part of the retention.

1981
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,172
And basically there will be this

1982
01:24:26,226 --> 01:24:28,936
naturally occurring loop just from basic

1983
01:24:28,968 --> 01:24:31,276
principles of temporality. It's like you

1984
01:24:31,298 --> 01:24:33,144
cannot get around that ActInf.

1985
01:24:33,192 --> 01:24:35,388
Perception sort of emerges from

1986
01:24:35,474 --> 01:24:38,476
temporality all naturally. So in my

1987
01:24:38,498 --> 01:24:39,776
opinion, the way that I think about it

1988
01:24:39,798 --> 01:24:42,224
is as sensory motor entropy. And

1989
01:24:42,262 --> 01:24:44,352
basically you can look at that and the

1990
01:24:44,406 --> 01:24:46,236
amazing results that people are finding

1991
01:24:46,268 --> 01:24:47,904
now around the thalamus, which is

1992
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:49,888
basically the central organ of the

1993
01:24:49,894 --> 01:24:52,020
brain, the subcortical structure

1994
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,660
actually functions as a bridge between

1995
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:56,884
major brain regions, right? So for you

1996
01:24:56,922 --> 01:24:58,944
to actually perform any kind of ActInf,

1997
01:24:58,992 --> 01:25:01,076
it needs to use the thalamus as a

1998
01:25:01,098 --> 01:25:03,116
bridge, which means that it's

1999
01:25:03,168 --> 01:25:05,272
intrinsically related to the way things

2000
01:25:05,326 --> 01:25:07,464
change. And there's like this, I guess

2001
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,608
you can think about it not as things,

2002
01:25:09,694 --> 01:25:12,968
but as events, right? So to give an

2003
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:15,100
example like Juan Diego did with his

2004
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,484
bottle. This is my cup. And the fact

2005
01:25:17,522 --> 01:25:21,340
that my cup continuously exists is not

2006
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:24,332
the thing that exists all the time, but

2007
01:25:24,386 --> 01:25:26,524
there are events occurring in which this

2008
01:25:26,562 --> 01:25:29,788
one continues to exist. Right. So it's

2009
01:25:29,804 --> 01:25:31,856
more about thinking of the evolution of

2010
01:25:31,878 --> 01:25:34,160
time being highly correlated with itself

2011
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:35,872
rather than thinking about things

2012
01:25:35,926 --> 01:25:37,856
existing in time. But this is like a

2013
01:25:37,878 --> 01:25:39,472
reverse way of thinking about it. And

2014
01:25:39,526 --> 01:25:41,808
the typical strategy of active inference

2015
01:25:41,824 --> 01:25:43,716
is flipping things on the head and see

2016
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:46,596
if it actually still makes sense. In

2017
01:25:46,618 --> 01:25:49,796
this case, I genuinely think it does. I

2018
01:25:49,818 --> 01:25:51,850
don't know if I answered your question.

2019
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,200
Yes. Thank you, Dean.

2020
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:58,824
Yeah. Just to be able to hold up two

2021
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:01,384
things again, I would say that there is

2022
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:04,044
the Bridging piece and there is also the

2023
01:26:04,082 --> 01:26:06,664
high occupancy vehicle lane as opposed

2024
01:26:06,712 --> 01:26:09,116
to the intersection. Like a lot of the

2025
01:26:09,138 --> 01:26:12,044
ways that we represent this stuff is

2026
01:26:12,082 --> 01:26:16,148
when we get those X and Y vectors

2027
01:26:16,264 --> 01:26:18,720
crossing one another. But there's also

2028
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:22,476
let's get all four skills onto

2029
01:26:22,508 --> 01:26:25,904
one platform and remove a lot of the

2030
01:26:25,942 --> 01:26:28,156
impediments. And that's that flipping

2031
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:31,296
part. I would agree exactly with what

2032
01:26:31,318 --> 01:26:35,330
you're saying. You have to have both one

2033
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,164
as a metaphor. That's all it is,

2034
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:40,116
metaphorical. But if you can get all

2035
01:26:40,138 --> 01:26:44,170
four skills in one place and then

2036
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,848
down the distance, you'll shorten the

2037
01:26:47,854 --> 01:26:50,056
amount of time it takes to arrive at

2038
01:26:50,078 --> 01:26:51,210
wherever you're going.

2039
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:59,196
Thank you, Juan. And please feel

2040
01:26:59,218 --> 01:27:01,800
free to give kind of your closing

2041
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,596
thoughts and next angles as we come

2042
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:07,824
near. I don't even know whether to call

2043
01:27:07,862 --> 01:27:08,960
it an ends.

2044
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:15,088
Lovely. So I just wanted to go back to

2045
01:27:15,174 --> 01:27:16,800
Daniel's question because I thought was

2046
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:19,056
a great question, one I didn't think

2047
01:27:19,078 --> 01:27:20,688
about, at least in the specific terms,

2048
01:27:20,774 --> 01:27:22,096
which Zach, we've been discussing

2049
01:27:22,128 --> 01:27:26,096
precisely, kind of where action fits

2050
01:27:26,128 --> 01:27:27,604
in all the story. And this, of course,

2051
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:29,712
brings us to the action perception loop.

2052
01:27:29,856 --> 01:27:31,796
And I guess I'm going to do what we

2053
01:27:31,818 --> 01:27:33,316
usually do in our collaborations with

2054
01:27:33,338 --> 01:27:35,796
Zack, which is album the Phenomenology

2055
01:27:35,908 --> 01:27:38,616
and see whether it fits. And I think it

2056
01:27:38,638 --> 01:27:41,256
fits quite well because what we did in

2057
01:27:41,278 --> 01:27:43,672
our model is to show that precisely this

2058
01:27:43,726 --> 01:27:46,332
boundary, this temporal boundary to the

2059
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:48,664
updating scheme of active inference

2060
01:27:48,712 --> 01:27:51,804
which integrates past and future. And we

2061
01:27:51,842 --> 01:27:53,672
kind of relate this to protention,

2062
01:27:53,736 --> 01:27:55,436
retention, primal attraction, and you

2063
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:57,536
have this nice living present. What is

2064
01:27:57,558 --> 01:27:59,872
fascinating is that when you go a step

2065
01:27:59,926 --> 01:28:02,592
further away from the pure temporal form

2066
01:28:02,646 --> 01:28:04,844
of experience, you have an embodied

2067
01:28:04,892 --> 01:28:07,324
being whose anticipations, whose

2068
01:28:07,372 --> 01:28:10,636
protentions are not simply the tones

2069
01:28:10,668 --> 01:28:12,176
that are coming from the melody, but

2070
01:28:12,278 --> 01:28:14,436
what do you do with them or what do you

2071
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:17,124
do? So if I see my bottle again, this

2072
01:28:17,162 --> 01:28:18,736
bottle appears as something I can grasp.

2073
01:28:18,768 --> 01:28:20,452
And you can think about this in terms of

2074
01:28:20,506 --> 01:28:22,680
importances, action possibilities.

2075
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:25,016
That's very clear in the

2076
01:28:25,038 --> 01:28:26,712
phenomenological literature. And also,

2077
01:28:26,766 --> 01:28:27,828
I think, in the active inference

2078
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,764
literature, when you talk about action

2079
01:28:29,812 --> 01:28:32,216
policies and specific importances, all

2080
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:34,504
this stuff, it is fascinating because

2081
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:37,416
then you get action just by introducing

2082
01:28:37,448 --> 01:28:40,344
the temporal aspect of active inference.

2083
01:28:40,392 --> 01:28:42,652
But this action is always informed by

2084
01:28:42,706 --> 01:28:44,664
prior observation, so by literally

2085
01:28:44,712 --> 01:28:46,076
perception. And that happens as well in

2086
01:28:46,098 --> 01:28:48,412
phenomenology. All our actions are

2087
01:28:48,466 --> 01:28:50,096
informed, but what we are seeing, what

2088
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:52,272
we're perceiving more generally and what

2089
01:28:52,326 --> 01:28:54,544
we've perceived in the past, and you can

2090
01:28:54,582 --> 01:28:57,376
just kind of unfold that loop and get a

2091
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:59,376
very nice correlation between action and

2092
01:28:59,398 --> 01:29:01,616
perception through time. So the action

2093
01:29:01,648 --> 01:29:03,284
perception loop is not like this

2094
01:29:03,322 --> 01:29:05,652
monolithic circle. It's something that

2095
01:29:05,786 --> 01:29:07,956
it's more like in a spiral, so to speak.

2096
01:29:08,138 --> 01:29:10,870
And I think our model speaks to that.

2097
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,208
I don't know if Zach wants to add

2098
01:29:14,234 --> 01:29:15,290
anything to this.

2099
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,944
It really would make worlds of

2100
01:29:19,982 --> 01:29:21,924
difference to call it an action

2101
01:29:21,972 --> 01:29:24,028
perception spiral. If it's just going to

2102
01:29:24,034 --> 01:29:27,212
be a visual metaphor and rely on our

2103
01:29:27,266 --> 01:29:29,500
cultural understandings of shapes,

2104
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:34,392
why not firstly, hold up multiple

2105
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:38,640
and then secondly, bring in this

2106
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:42,224
kind of perhaps even double helical or

2107
01:29:42,262 --> 01:29:46,268
triple helical nature of unfolding.

2108
01:29:46,444 --> 01:29:50,496
And three makes a party. So it's

2109
01:29:50,528 --> 01:29:54,144
awesome. Ollie and Dean,

2110
01:29:54,192 --> 01:29:57,376
first, any closing thoughts?

2111
01:29:57,488 --> 01:29:59,492
And then the authors with the final

2112
01:29:59,546 --> 01:30:01,976
words. I'll be really quick. I really

2113
01:30:01,998 --> 01:30:04,136
want to thank you both for sharing the

2114
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:06,360
paper and the great presentation.

2115
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:11,656
Thank you, Dean. Ali. Yeah, as I said,

2116
01:30:11,758 --> 01:30:15,004
it was a really fascinating paper for me

2117
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:17,976
personally because I was really obsessed

2118
01:30:18,008 --> 01:30:20,748
with process thinking, processual and

2119
01:30:20,834 --> 01:30:22,988
all kinds of dynamic thinking. So,

2120
01:30:23,154 --> 01:30:25,356
again, I really wanted to thank you for

2121
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:28,536
writing such an amazing paper. Yeah,

2122
01:30:28,578 --> 01:30:29,650
thank you so much.

2123
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:34,640
Awesome. And so, to the authors,

2124
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:38,884
any closing thoughts or where you'll be

2125
01:30:38,922 --> 01:30:41,152
heading now, or what you're excited,

2126
01:30:41,216 --> 01:30:42,580
what you're protending?

2127
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,476
I guess, first of all, I would just like

2128
01:30:47,498 --> 01:30:49,764
to thank you because this has been an

2129
01:30:49,802 --> 01:30:51,860
amazing experience, an experience,

2130
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:53,796
temple experience, actually, just to

2131
01:30:53,818 --> 01:30:55,448
discuss our paper with you. Thank you

2132
01:30:55,454 --> 01:30:56,936
for reading the paper. Thank you for

2133
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:59,108
enjoying the paper and having us. It's

2134
01:30:59,124 --> 01:31:02,456
been lovely. And I think it's quite

2135
01:31:02,478 --> 01:31:04,676
clear that the way to go now is to start

2136
01:31:04,718 --> 01:31:06,476
talking about action and see how it

2137
01:31:06,498 --> 01:31:09,292
fits. And hopefully sooner rather than

2138
01:31:09,346 --> 01:31:10,924
later you'll see something about this,

2139
01:31:10,962 --> 01:31:12,232
because it's precisely what we're

2140
01:31:12,296 --> 01:31:14,300
discussing with Zach more recently.

2141
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,472
Yeah, I also would like to extend this.

2142
01:31:17,526 --> 01:31:20,000
Thank you. It's fantastic.

2143
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:21,964
The whole active active inference

2144
01:31:22,012 --> 01:31:23,456
institute, just, in my opinion, the

2145
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,610
right thing is really amazing to follow.

2146
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:29,730
So I'm very happy to be part of this.

2147
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,584
Besides the active aspect of hopefully

2148
01:31:35,632 --> 01:31:39,252
the next paper, I'm also looking

2149
01:31:39,306 --> 01:31:41,136
into phases and looking at active

2150
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:42,976
inference as if it did not work with

2151
01:31:43,018 --> 01:31:44,264
states, because I think that's too

2152
01:31:44,302 --> 01:31:45,844
spatial and it's making things static.

2153
01:31:45,892 --> 01:31:47,652
But actually moving that into phases,

2154
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:50,264
into a continuous space is something

2155
01:31:50,302 --> 01:31:52,170
that I'm trying to establish now,

2156
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:55,336
trying to start up a collaboration with

2157
01:31:55,358 --> 01:31:57,976
Ryan Smith about that. But it's still a

2158
01:31:57,998 --> 01:31:59,416
really early work in progress, so

2159
01:31:59,438 --> 01:32:01,816
hopefully we'll see something from that

2160
01:32:01,838 --> 01:32:03,672
project in a few months time.

2161
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:07,010
Hopefully. But thanks again. Thank you.

2162
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:10,284
Awesome. Thank you all for joining.

2163
01:32:10,332 --> 01:32:12,416
Thanks, everybody, for listening, and

2164
01:32:12,438 --> 01:32:14,976
you're always welcome back. So till the

2165
01:32:14,998 --> 01:32:16,130
next time.

2166
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:19,776
Bye. Thank you.
