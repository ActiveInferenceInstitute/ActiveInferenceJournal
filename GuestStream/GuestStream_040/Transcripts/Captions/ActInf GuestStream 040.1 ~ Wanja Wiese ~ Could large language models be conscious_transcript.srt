1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,410
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:11,295
It's March 29, 2023.

3
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:13,487
We're here in ActInf

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:17,878
GuestStream number 40.1 with Wanja Wiese.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:23,439
We're going to be hearing a presentation

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:23,439
in the first section and then having a

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:23,439
discussion.

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:25,687
So thank you, Wanja, for joining.

9
00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:28,978
Again, really looking forward to your

10
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:28,978
presentation.

11
00:00:25,694 --> 00:00:32,328
Wanja: Thank you very much.

12
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:40,105
So this presentation is based on a

13
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:40,105
preprint that can be found at Phil

14
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:40,105
Archive.

15
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:44,530
And this is work in progress.

16
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:52,366
And I probably or hopefully upload a

17
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:52,366
revised version of this preprint in a few

18
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:52,366
weeks.

19
00:00:45,604 --> 00:01:01,669
So if you're watching this or if you're

20
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:01,669
reading the preprint and have any

21
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:01,669
comments or questions, feedback is very

22
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:01,669
much welcome.

23
00:00:53,413 --> 00:01:17,239
And I'm also, again, grateful for having

24
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,239
the opportunity to present here because

25
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,239
I'm really looking forward to the

26
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,239
discussion and any comments that people

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,239
may have while watching this video.

28
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:21,626
So do contact me if you have questions or

29
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:21,626
comments.

30
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:34,979
Now I want to start this presentation

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:34,979
with an idea from this wonderful novella

32
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:34,979
by Tet Qiang, The Lifecycle of Software

33
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:34,979
Objects.

34
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:38,377
And if you're not familiar with the

35
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:38,377
novella, it doesn't matter.

36
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:51,066
So there are some digital entities, or

37
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:51,066
Digians as they are called in the

38
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:51,066
novella, who at first live in a purely

39
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:51,066
virtual environment.

40
00:01:38,389 --> 00:02:03,124
So these are virtual entities like

41
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:03,124
virtual pets, and human users can

42
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:03,124
interact with them in a virtual

43
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:03,124
environment.

44
00:01:51,067 --> 00:02:25,347
Then in some passages of the novella,

45
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:25,347
there are scenes in which some Digians

46
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:25,347
are, as it were, downloaded from this

47
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:25,347
purely virtual environment and are

48
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:25,347
implemented in a physically embodied

49
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:25,347
robot.

50
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:59,687
So the program that is running within

51
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
this computer simulation and is

52
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
controlling the purely virtual body is

53
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
then downloaded into a physically

54
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
embodied computer and is controlling a

55
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
physical robot which can interact with

56
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
its physical environment, non virtual

57
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
environment, in the same way in which the

58
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
virtual agent, the virtual digient,

59
00:02:59,687 --> 00:02:59,687
interacts with the virtual environment.

60
00:02:25,349 --> 00:03:04,674
And I find this idea really fascinating

61
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:04,674
and powerful.

62
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:24,872
So the novella suggests that these

63
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:24,872
virtual entities are conscious and that

64
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:24,872
they can switch back and forth, as it

65
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:24,872
were, between this purely virtual

66
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:24,872
environment and the physical non virtual

67
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:24,872
environment.

68
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:35,984
And the idea is that these entities

69
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:35,984
remain conscious when they're in the

70
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:35,984
robot, but also when they return to the

71
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:35,984
virtual environment.

72
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:59,219
And to some people it may be unintuitive

73
00:03:59,219 --> 00:03:59,219
or counterintuitive that a purely virtual

74
00:03:59,219 --> 00:03:59,219
entity in a simulated environment can be

75
00:03:59,219 --> 00:03:59,219
conscious, but maybe some of these people

76
00:03:59,219 --> 00:03:59,219
will find it less counterintuitive to

77
00:03:59,219 --> 00:03:59,219
imagine a conscious robot.

78
00:03:36,995 --> 00:04:24,410
And so the the idea is is fascinating to

79
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,410
me because it suggests that if you can

80
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,410
switch back and forth from the virtual

81
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,410
environment to the physical environment

82
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,410
and in the other direction, it really

83
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,410
doesn't matter where the software is

84
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,410
implemented, the system remains

85
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,410
conscious.

86
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:37,547
And I will come back to this idea at the

87
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:37,547
end of my presentation and we will see

88
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:37,547
what the account that I'm presenting here

89
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:37,547
suggests with respect to this scenario.

90
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:46,633
So this is the overview of my

91
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:46,633
presentation, which is based on the

92
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:46,633
preprint.

93
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:49,660
I'm just omitting a lot of details.

94
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:54,711
I'll start by saying just a few things

95
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:54,711
about the free energy principle.

96
00:04:49,665 --> 00:05:04,750
Then I will ask what is the difference

97
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:04,750
between an unconscious simulation of a

98
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:04,750
conscious system and a conscious

99
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:04,750
computational system?

100
00:04:54,713 --> 00:05:10,818
Or in other words, what's the difference

101
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:10,818
between what is called weak and strong

102
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:10,818
artificial consciousness?

103
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:35,064
So strong artificial consciousness is an

104
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:35,064
actually conscious artificial system and

105
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:35,064
weak artificial consciousness is

106
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:35,064
constituted by an visual system that

107
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:35,064
maybe behaves as if it were conscious or

108
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:35,064
that simulates a conscious being but is

109
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:35,064
not actually conscious.

110
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:39,099
And I'm interested in the question what's

111
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:39,099
the difference?

112
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:50,217
And a particular version of this question

113
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:50,217
is whether a computer simulation in a

114
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:50,217
computer with a Bonoman architecture can

115
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:50,217
be conscious.

116
00:05:40,118 --> 00:06:01,265
So I start with the free energy principle

117
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:01,265
and I don't want to go into the details.

118
00:05:54,254 --> 00:06:08,330
So we start with a description of a

119
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,330
physical system.

120
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:11,364
So the X is the the physical system.

121
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:23,480
And the fundamental assumption is that

122
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,480
the dynamics, the physical dynamics of

123
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,480
this system can be decomposed into two

124
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,480
components.

125
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:32,574
So we on the one hand have a

126
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:32,574
deterministic flow term f and then some

127
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:32,574
noise term, stochastic noise term.

128
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:41,665
So we end up with a stochastic

129
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:41,665
differential equation which describes how

130
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:41,665
the physical system evolves over time.

131
00:06:32,574 --> 00:07:04,831
The further assumption is that we can

132
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:04,831
decompose the states of the system into

133
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:04,831
internal states mu, external states ETA,

134
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:04,831
sensory states S and active states A,

135
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:04,831
which together the sensory and active

136
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:04,831
states together constitute the blanket

137
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:04,831
states B.

138
00:06:41,667 --> 00:07:17,967
And this then is a particular system

139
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:17,967
system that can be partitioned into

140
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:17,967
internal and external states, separated

141
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:17,967
by blanket states.

142
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:36,151
And a further assumption is that the

143
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:36,151
dynamics of this system can also be

144
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:36,151
partitioned in the following sense that

145
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:36,151
we can decompose this flow term into

146
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:36,151
individual flow terms for the different

147
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:36,151
states.

148
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:48,278
So we have a flow term for internal

149
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:48,278
states mu and can also describe the

150
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:48,278
dynamics of internal states in terms of

151
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:48,278
such a differential equation here.

152
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:56,349
Okay, so these are just technical

153
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:56,349
fundamental assumptions made by the free

154
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:56,349
energy principle.

155
00:07:49,286 --> 00:08:07,405
But then interesting thing starts here

156
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:07,405
when we look at how else we can describe

157
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:07,405
internal states and the dynamics of

158
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:07,405
internal states.

159
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:18,510
So the idea is that we can map internal

160
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:18,510
states mu to probability distributions.

161
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:23,561
So this is your formulation in terms of

162
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:23,561
states.

163
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:46,798
And then the idea is that at every point

164
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:46,798
in time the system will be in certain

165
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:46,798
states, so there will be internal states

166
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:46,798
relative to each time point and we can

167
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:46,798
map each of these states to some

168
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:46,798
probability distribution Q of external

169
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:46,798
states given blanket states.

170
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:53,869
Okay, so we can do that, but then the

171
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:53,869
question is why should we do that?

172
00:08:47,808 --> 00:09:04,918
And the idea is that maybe we can

173
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:04,918
redescribe the flow term, which is

174
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:04,918
essential for characterizing the dynamics

175
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:04,918
of internal states.

176
00:08:54,869 --> 00:09:16,036
Can we redescribe this flow term in terms

177
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:16,036
of the probability distribution encoded

178
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:16,036
by internal states and the free energy

179
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:16,036
principle?

180
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:17,045
Answers.

181
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:35,227
Yes, we can rewrite this term in terms of

182
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:35,227
a variational free energy functional,

183
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:35,227
which specifies how the probability

184
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:35,227
distribution q, which is parametrized by

185
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:35,227
mu, and thereby also how mu changes over

186
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:35,227
time.

187
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:43,303
So we can reformulate the physical

188
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:43,303
dynamics of internal states.

189
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:59,463
We can rewrite the flow term in terms of

190
00:09:59,463 --> 00:09:59,463
variational free energy or in terms of

191
00:09:59,463 --> 00:09:59,463
minimizing variational free energy with

192
00:09:59,463 --> 00:09:59,463
respect to a probability distribution

193
00:09:59,463 --> 00:09:59,463
encoded by internal states.

194
00:09:43,304 --> 00:10:04,453
And this is then called Bayesian

195
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:04,453
mechanics.

196
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:24,653
And it's called Bayesian mechanics

197
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:24,653
because minimizing variation of the

198
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:24,653
energy involves minimizing a divergence

199
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:24,653
term between the internally encoded

200
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:24,653
probability distribution q and a

201
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:24,653
posterior over external states given

202
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:24,653
blanket states.

203
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:33,748
Okay, so to sum this up, I will give

204
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:33,748
these ideas some labels.

205
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:46,877
So, I've already talked about the

206
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:46,877
physical dynamics, and these are the

207
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:46,877
dynamics of a particular system described

208
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:46,877
by a stochastic differential equation

209
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:46,877
involving a flow term and a noise term.

210
00:10:33,749 --> 00:11:06,015
And recall that a particular system is a

211
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:06,015
system that can be partitioned into

212
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:06,015
internal, external, and blanket states,

213
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:06,015
and then, according to the free free

214
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:06,015
energy principle, can redescribe these

215
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:06,015
physical dynamics in terms of as

216
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:06,015
computational dynamics.

217
00:10:47,889 --> 00:11:23,186
We can reformulate them in terms of a

218
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:23,186
description of the system's internal

219
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:23,186
states, Mu, as performing approximative

220
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:23,186
Bayesian inference by minimizing

221
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:23,186
variation of free energy with respect to

222
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:23,186
a probability density encoded by mu.

223
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:34,294
So, in short, we can reformulate the

224
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:34,294
physical dynamics as a computational

225
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:34,294
process that involves a form of Bayesian

226
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:34,294
inference.

227
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:51,465
Now, a further assumption that I want to

228
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:51,465
make here is that we can capture the

229
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:51,465
computational correlates of consciousness

230
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:51,465
in terms of the computational dynamics as

231
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:51,465
described by the free energy principle.

232
00:11:35,306 --> 00:12:07,569
So here the computational correlates of

233
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:07,569
consciousness, or Cccs, are defined as

234
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:07,569
the computational dynamics of a physical

235
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:07,569
system, of a conscious physical system,

236
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:07,569
as specified by the free energy

237
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:07,569
principle.

238
00:11:52,471 --> 00:12:13,626
So this is not just any physical system,

239
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:13,626
it's a conscious physical system.

240
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:16,650
Forgot to add this on the slide.

241
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:27,761
All right, so given these initial

242
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:27,761
assumptions and definitions, can we say

243
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:27,761
something about the difference between

244
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:27,761
weak and strong artificial

245
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:27,761
consciousness?

246
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:29,782
And I think we can.

247
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:37,860
So let's start with the idea of a

248
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:37,860
computational call it of consciousness.

249
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:48,974
Computations are medium independent, so

250
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:48,974
it's plausible that a digital computer

251
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:48,974
can implement computational correlates of

252
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:48,974
consciousness.

253
00:12:38,873 --> 00:13:06,091
But then the question if we want to

254
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:06,091
distinguish weak from strong artificial

255
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:06,091
consciousness is, is every system that

256
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:06,091
implements Cccs conscious, or do systems

257
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:06,091
have to implement these computations in

258
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:06,091
the right way?

259
00:12:49,980 --> 00:13:07,107
And what would that be?

260
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:20,237
To better understand this question, I

261
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:20,237
find it useful to look at this diagram

262
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:20,237
and see where we started.

263
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:28,318
So we have a description of a conscious

264
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:28,318
system's physical dynamics in the bottom

265
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:28,318
left.

266
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:37,409
And then according to the free energy

267
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:37,409
principle, we can reformulate this,

268
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:37,409
redescribe this as some computational

269
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:37,409
dynamics.

270
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:52,551
And by assumption, these include the

271
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:52,551
computational correlates of

272
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:52,551
consciousness, and they must be

273
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:52,551
implemented by the physical dynamics of

274
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:52,551
the conscious system.

275
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:57,607
Now, given that these are medium

276
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:57,607
independent properties.

277
00:13:52,557 --> 00:14:02,597
They can also be instantiated by other

278
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:02,597
systems.

279
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:10,675
And here I'm assuming that these

280
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:10,675
computations can also be implemented by a

281
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:10,675
digital computer.

282
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:16,736
And the digital computer, as a physical

283
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:16,736
system, has some physical dynamics.

284
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:24,815
And if we can apply the drainage

285
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:24,815
principle to it, we can reformulate these

286
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:24,815
physical dynamics as computational

287
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:24,815
dynamics.

288
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:36,934
And so then the question becomes, do

289
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:36,934
these computational dynamics, do they

290
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:36,934
include the computational correlates of

291
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:36,934
consciousness, whatever they are?

292
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:49,061
So this is a crucial question that we

293
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:49,061
have to answer if we want to know what

294
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:49,061
the difference between weak and strong

295
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:49,061
artificial consciousness is.

296
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:50,079
Maybe there is no difference.

297
00:14:49,063 --> 00:15:16,279
So before I present an argument to the

298
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:16,279
effect that in general, the computational

299
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:16,279
dynamics of a digital computer will not

300
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:16,279
entail the computational corals of

301
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:16,279
consciousness, before I present this

302
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:16,279
argument, I will present some

303
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:16,279
observations on the free energy

304
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:16,279
principle.

305
00:14:53,107 --> 00:15:28,397
So note that systems that conform to the

306
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:28,397
French principle sustain their existence

307
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:28,397
by minimizing variation of free energy,

308
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:28,397
but the reverse does not hold.

309
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:45,566
So you can run simulations of agents that

310
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:45,566
minimize variation of free energy, and

311
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:45,566
you can do that on a computer which does

312
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:45,566
not thereby sustain its existence.

313
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:52,629
So it would continue to exist regardless

314
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,629
of whether it runs these simulations or

315
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,629
not.

316
00:15:45,566 --> 00:16:05,702
Okay, just to illustrate this with a

317
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:05,702
quotation which may be familiar to many

318
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:05,702
so this is by Chris Mattel.

319
00:15:53,642 --> 00:16:12,775
Many theories in the biological sciences

320
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:12,775
are answers to the question, what must

321
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:12,775
things do in order to exist?

322
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:19,845
The French principle turns this question

323
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:19,845
on its head and asks, if things exist,

324
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:19,845
what must they do?

325
00:16:12,777 --> 00:16:29,943
More formally, if we can define what it

326
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:29,943
means to be something, can we identify

327
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:29,943
the physics or dynamics that a thing must

328
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:29,943
possess?

329
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:35,999
And Jacob Howie puts a similar point as

330
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:35,999
follows.

331
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:42,072
The free energy principle analyzes the

332
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:42,072
concept of existence of particular self

333
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:42,072
organizing systems.

334
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:52,178
So the idea is that continuing to exist,

335
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:52,178
sustaining one's existence, means

336
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:52,178
minimizing variational free energy.

337
00:16:42,072 --> 00:17:05,248
And so any processes that contribute to

338
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:05,248
minimizing variation of fringe thereby

339
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:05,248
contribute to the sustained existence of

340
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:05,248
the system.

341
00:16:53,186 --> 00:17:18,372
But such processes can also be

342
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:18,372
implemented in other ways by different

343
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:18,372
systems which do not thereby sustain

344
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:18,372
their existence.

345
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:30,490
And this, I want to suggest, is a crucial

346
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:30,490
difference between systems that merely

347
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:30,490
simulate conscious systems and systems

348
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:30,490
that actually are conscious.

349
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:38,574
Okay, I will hopefully clarify this idea

350
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:38,574
in a moment by presenting an argument.

351
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:41,599
But before that, I need a definition.

352
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:47,669
So I want to introduce a notion of

353
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,669
intrinsic computation.

354
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:54,738
And these are just computations that

355
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:54,738
contribute to the sustained existence of

356
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:54,738
the systems.

357
00:17:48,676 --> 00:18:02,758
So these are the computations that figure

358
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:02,758
in the computational reformulation of the

359
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:02,758
system's physical dynamics.

360
00:17:54,739 --> 00:18:10,835
According to the free energy principle,

361
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:10,835
an intrinsic here means these

362
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:10,835
computations are observer independent.

363
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:24,975
So it's not the case that we as observers

364
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:24,975
say, okay, we can interpret the system as

365
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:24,975
performing these computations, or it's

366
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:24,975
useful for us to use them as

367
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:24,975
computational devices.

368
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:45,018
The idea is that these computations are

369
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
processes that are intrinsic to the

370
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
system, that only depend on properties of

371
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
the system itself and not on relations

372
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
that the system has to observers or to

373
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
other beings.

374
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:58,031
Okay, so here's the argument, which in a

375
00:18:58,031 --> 00:18:58,031
way is already contained in the

376
00:18:58,031 --> 00:18:58,031
preprint.

377
00:18:47,020 --> 00:19:06,033
But I did not formulate the argument in

378
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:06,033
this explicit way.

379
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:23,050
So I'm grateful to Tommy corBack, who

380
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,050
provided some comments on my preprint and

381
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,050
who also suggested a reconstruction of

382
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,050
the argument that I'm presenting in the

383
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,050
preprint.

384
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:30,057
And this formulation here is based on

385
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:30,057
Tomic's suggestions.

386
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:38,065
And I hope this clarifies the argument

387
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:38,065
that I'm putting forward developing in

388
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:38,065
the preprint.

389
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:47,074
Okay, so the first assumption, and the

390
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:47,074
argument is a version of computationalism

391
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:47,074
about consciousness.

392
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:56,083
So the idea is that causal roles that

393
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
characterize phenomenal consciousness are

394
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
medium independent and can be captured in

395
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
terms of computation.

396
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:59,086
These are computational correlates of

397
00:19:59,086 --> 00:19:59,086
consciousness.

398
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:08,089
So the idea is that consciousness does

399
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:08,089
not require a particular type of

400
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:08,089
substrate.

401
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:21,102
It can be, in principle, can be realized

402
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:21,102
by different types of system as long as

403
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:21,102
these systems implement the right

404
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:21,102
computations.

405
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:35,116
So this assumption, as I intended, does

406
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:35,116
not entail that implementing the right

407
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:35,116
computations is sufficient for being

408
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:35,116
conscious.

409
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:39,120
It's here just meant as a necessary

410
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,120
condition.

411
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:53,134
And the idea is that there are

412
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
informative, interesting computational

413
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
crawlers of consciousness and they can,

414
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
in principle be performed implemented by

415
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
different types of system.

416
00:20:40,121 --> 00:21:09,144
Then comes the second assumption,

417
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
according to which every conscious system

418
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
and its computational correlates can be

419
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
described by a mechanical theory that

420
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
conforms to the free energy principle.

421
00:20:54,135 --> 00:21:14,149
So this is an assumption about the scope

422
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,149
of the free energy principle.

423
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:27,162
And it's at least clear that the free

424
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:27,162
energy principle is intended to have a

425
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:27,162
very wide scope that's not meant just to

426
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:27,162
apply to the human brain.

427
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:40,175
It's not just meant to apply to living

428
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,175
systems, but it's meant to apply to a

429
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,175
very wide class of self organizing

430
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,175
systems.

431
00:21:27,162 --> 00:22:04,193
And this idea or this intention that the

432
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
free energy principle has a very wide

433
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
scope is also evidenced by the fact that

434
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
recent formulations and recent

435
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
developments in research on the free

436
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
energy principle seek to relax certain

437
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
assumptions.

438
00:21:40,175 --> 00:22:20,209
That were made in previous version so as

439
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
to make the free energy principle

440
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
applicable to a very wide class of

441
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
systems and not, for instance, just to

442
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
systems in non equilibrium steady state.

443
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:25,214
For instance, just as one example.

444
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:34,223
All right, so the idea is that we can

445
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:34,223
apply the free energy principle to

446
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:34,223
conscious systems.

447
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:42,231
And that means we can move from a

448
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:42,231
description of physical dynamics to a

449
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:42,231
description of computational dynamics.

450
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:46,235
And these will include computational

451
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:46,235
correlates of consciousness.

452
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:52,241
The third assumption makes a connection

453
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:52,241
between intrinsic computation and

454
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:52,241
consciousness.

455
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:59,248
A system is conscious only if it sustains

456
00:22:59,248 --> 00:22:59,248
its existence by virtue of the

457
00:22:59,248 --> 00:22:59,248
computational correlates.

458
00:22:52,241 --> 00:23:11,254
It realizes such computational correlates

459
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:11,254
of consciousness are intrinsic

460
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:11,254
computations, computations that

461
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:11,254
contribute to the sustained existence of

462
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:11,254
the system.

463
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:31,274
So if a system follows certain or

464
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
implements certain physical dynamics,

465
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
which under the Fep can be described as

466
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
computational dynamics that entail

467
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
computational correlates of

468
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
consciousness, whatever they are, then

469
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
the system is conscious.

470
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:36,279
But it's only conscious if it's in this

471
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:36,279
direction.

472
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:44,287
So, in principle, it's possible to

473
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:44,287
implement the same computational

474
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:44,287
processes without being conscious.

475
00:23:36,279 --> 00:24:11,308
And this becomes clear in conclusion or

476
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
described by conclusion one, it's

477
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
possible to instantiate computational

478
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
calls of consciousness in a physical

479
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
system without instantiating

480
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
consciousness, namely, if realizing the

481
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
computational correlates of consciousness

482
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
does not contribute to the sustained

483
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:11,308
existence of the system.

484
00:23:44,287 --> 00:24:35,332
So assuming that a digital computer can

485
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:35,332
perform the computations that

486
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:35,332
characterize consciousness in conscious

487
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:35,332
systems, it's likely, according to this

488
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:35,332
proposal, it's likely that the computer

489
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:35,332
will not thereby be conscious because it

490
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:35,332
could implement different computations.

491
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:39,336
It really doesn't matter what

492
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:39,336
computations it performs.

493
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:48,345
It will continue to exist as a physical

494
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:48,345
system regardless of the computational

495
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:48,345
processes that it implements.

496
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:56,353
So it does not sustain its existence by

497
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:56,353
virtue of the computations it performs.

498
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:59,356
All right?

499
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:16,367
And a condition that is entailed by this

500
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:16,367
is that from the point of view of the

501
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:16,367
free energy principle, computation of the

502
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:16,367
physical system is intrinsic if it

503
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:16,367
matches the system's physical dynamics.

504
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:30,381
And this will be important also for the

505
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
question about consciousness in computer

506
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
simulations.

507
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:48,399
So the second conclusion that I want to

508
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
draw here is that computers with a von

509
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
Neumann architecture cannot implement

510
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
intrinsic computations because their

511
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
physical dynamics induces a causal flow

512
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
that is different from the causal flow

513
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
entailed by the computational dynamics.

514
00:25:30,381 --> 00:26:01,406
So there's no match between the physical

515
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:01,406
and the computational dynamics or between

516
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:01,406
the physical dynamics and the

517
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:01,406
computations that are performed within

518
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:01,406
the computer simulation.

519
00:25:48,399 --> 00:26:07,412
I will unpack this in the third part of

520
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:07,412
my presentation.

521
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:16,421
So could there be consciousness in a

522
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:16,421
computer simulation, in a computer with a

523
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:16,421
classical architecture?

524
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:24,429
So this is an idea that I already

525
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:24,429
presented in previous works.

526
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:41,446
So in a system that conforms to the free

527
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:41,446
energy principle, there's a basic flow

528
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:41,446
from internal states via active states to

529
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:41,446
external states and from external states

530
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:41,446
via sensory states to internal states.

531
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:44,449
So we have these circular dynamics.

532
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:52,457
And in a computer with a von Neumann

533
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:52,457
architecture, the basic causal flow is a

534
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:52,457
bit different.

535
00:26:44,449 --> 00:27:10,469
So we have memory and we have a separate

536
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
processing unit and units that store the

537
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
values of the different variables of

538
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
internal that stand for internal,

539
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
external and blanket states.

540
00:26:52,457 --> 00:27:22,481
They are in the memory unit, and there's

541
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:22,481
no direct causal interaction between

542
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:22,481
these units, but it's always mediated by

543
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:22,481
the CPU.

544
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:25,484
So that's a basic idea.

545
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:29,488
And therefore, there's difference in a

546
00:27:29,488 --> 00:27:29,488
causal flow.

547
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:51,509
And this means that the physical dynamics

548
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:51,509
of the computer does not have a or the if

549
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:51,509
we want to reformulate the physical

550
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:51,509
dynamics of the computer in terms of

551
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:51,509
minimizing variation of the energy, we

552
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:51,509
end up with something that cannot match.

553
00:27:29,488 --> 00:28:20,533
We end up with computational processes

554
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:20,533
that cannot be identical to the

555
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:20,533
computations that are simulated by the

556
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:20,533
computer because then there would have to

557
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:20,533
be a match between the states that

558
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:20,533
represent the probability distributions

559
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:20,533
encoded by internal states and the

560
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:20,533
internal states themselves.

561
00:27:54,513 --> 00:28:23,536
Okay?

562
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:29,542
So from this, I suggest we can derive two

563
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:29,542
necessary conditions for consciousness.

564
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:31,544
One is the flow condition.

565
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:47,560
The causal flow of a physical system's

566
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
computational dynamics, which may realize

567
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
computational correlates of consciousness

568
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
must match the causal flow of the

569
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
system's physical dynamics.

570
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:53,566
And then there's a second condition which

571
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:53,566
I call the existential condition.

572
00:28:48,561 --> 00:29:05,572
A physical system sustains existence by

573
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:05,572
virtue of realizing computational

574
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:05,572
correlates of consciousness.

575
00:28:53,566 --> 00:29:10,577
So if it's a conscious physical system,

576
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:10,577
then this is the case.

577
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:15,582
All right, just a few observations or

578
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:15,582
notes about this.

579
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:20,587
So a system can satisfy the first the

580
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:20,587
flow condition without thereby satisfying

581
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:20,587
the existential condition.

582
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:26,593
So the existential condition is stronger

583
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:26,593
than the flow condition.

584
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:33,600
But if a system satisfies the existential

585
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:33,600
condition, then it also satisfies the

586
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:33,600
flow conditions.

587
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:40,607
And not all systems that satisfy both of

588
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
these conditions are conscious.

589
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:45,612
In other words, neither of them are

590
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
sufficient for consciousness.

591
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:50,617
These are really just strictly necessary

592
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:50,617
conditions for consciousness.

593
00:29:45,612 --> 00:30:02,623
All right, let me return to the idea that

594
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:02,623
I presented in the beginning from Pat

595
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:02,623
Xiang's novella.

596
00:29:52,618 --> 00:30:14,635
So from the point of view of the account

597
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:14,635
that I presented here, is it possible to

598
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:14,635
download virtual entity to a robot?

599
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:20,641
And will it be conscious, or can it be

600
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:20,641
conscious in the simulation?

601
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:31,651
So I should just assume here that these

602
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:31,651
systems satisfy the flow condition first

603
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:31,651
condition.

604
00:30:21,642 --> 00:31:01,676
So assuming that this is a very special

605
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:01,676
computer simulation in which the physical

606
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:01,676
states that represent internal, external

607
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:01,676
and blanket states, that these physical

608
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:01,676
states also directly causally interact

609
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:01,676
with each other and according to the

610
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:01,676
account proposed here, the computer

611
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:01,676
simulation.

612
00:30:31,652 --> 00:31:13,688
There would still not be consciousness in

613
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:13,688
the computer simulation because the

614
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:13,688
computer does not sustain its existence

615
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:13,688
by virtue of performing these

616
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:13,688
computations.

617
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:22,697
It could also run different simulations

618
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:22,697
which do not involve these digital

619
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:22,697
entities, and it would continue to

620
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:22,697
exist.

621
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:29,704
So according to the account presented

622
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:29,704
here, there would not be consciousness in

623
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:29,704
this system.

624
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:47,722
And if we download the part of the

625
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:47,722
program that controls the virtual agent

626
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:47,722
and download it to a physically inverted

627
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:47,722
robot, could that robot be conscious?

628
00:31:32,707 --> 00:32:00,729
Well, in principle it could if the robot

629
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:00,729
sustains its existence by virtue of

630
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:00,729
performing the computations that are also

631
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:00,729
performed by the computer simulation.

632
00:31:47,722 --> 00:32:22,751
And now this result might be a bit

633
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:22,751
strange because contrary to what the

634
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:22,751
novella suggests, it would suggest that

635
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:22,751
the system cannot switch back and forth

636
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:22,751
between the virtual and the physical non

637
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:22,751
virtual environment without losing

638
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:22,751
consciousness.

639
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:30,759
And I admit that that is a kind of

640
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:30,759
counterintuitive implication.

641
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:36,765
But maybe it only seems

642
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:36,765
counterintuitive.

643
00:32:31,760 --> 00:33:02,785
Maybe it's not technically possible to

644
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
download a virtual entity which was

645
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
trained in a purely virtual environment

646
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
and download it to implement it in a

647
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
physical robot and thereby allowing the

648
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
physical robot to interact with its

649
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
environment in the same way as a virtual

650
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
entity can interact with a virtual

651
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
environment.

652
00:32:36,765 --> 00:33:32,815
So I know that in robotics there's a

653
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
certain strategy to train robots or to

654
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
develop the controller of the physical

655
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
robot, naming that you first train it in

656
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
a virtual and a simulated environment,

657
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
and then you use that to control the

658
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
robot.

659
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:42,825
Maybe this only works for robots that

660
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:42,825
kind of have certain limitations in their

661
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:42,825
sensory motor abilities.

662
00:33:32,815 --> 00:34:08,845
Maybe it doesn't work for highly

663
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
sophisticated robots that are more like

664
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
conscious organisms which can react

665
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
adaptively and very flexible in a

666
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
flexible way, can interact flexibly with

667
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
the environment on the basis, maybe, of

668
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
effectively guided, effectively shaped

669
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
representations.

670
00:33:42,825 --> 00:34:36,873
So this would be maybe an empirical

671
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:36,873
hypothesis derived from my account that

672
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:36,873
this strategy, this symptom real strategy

673
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:36,873
of simulating an entity in a virtual

674
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:36,873
environment and then applying that to a

675
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:36,873
physical entity, the prediction would be

676
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:36,873
that this has at some point reach limits

677
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:36,873
and will not be successful.

678
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:50,887
If, on the other hand, this hypothesis or

679
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
this prediction will turn out to be

680
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
false, I think we should reconsider the

681
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
account that I'm presenting here.

682
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:53,890
Okay, let me conclude.

683
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:59,896
I've asked what is the difference between

684
00:34:59,896 --> 00:34:59,896
weak and strong artificial

685
00:34:59,896 --> 00:34:59,896
consciousness?

686
00:34:54,891 --> 00:35:04,895
And the suggestion is that it's about

687
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:04,895
intrinsic computation.

688
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:05,896
That's the difference.

689
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,898
Actually.

690
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:13,904
Conscious systems sustain their

691
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
existence, at least in part by virtue of

692
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:13,904
performing certain computations.

693
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:20,911
And a mere simulation of a conscious

694
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:20,911
system does not thereby sustain its

695
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:20,911
existence.

696
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:25,916
It could also perform different

697
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
computations and still continue to

698
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
exist.

699
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:31,922
This condition entails the flow

700
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:31,922
condition, which is important for the

701
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:31,922
second question.

702
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:35,926
Could a computer simulation in a computer

703
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:35,926
with a Van Neumann architecture be

704
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:35,926
conscious?

705
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:39,930
No, because it violates the flow

706
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,930
condition.

707
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:53,944
Okay, here's an ad for the journal

708
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
Philosophy and the Mind Sciences, which

709
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
I'm running together with Sasha Fing,

710
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
Jennifer Wind, and Regina Farpri, and I

711
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
thank you for your attention.

712
00:35:39,930 --> 00:36:06,951
Daniel: Awesome.

713
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,952
Thank you.

714
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:26,971
I'm just getting my video back in the

715
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
game while I'm getting everything back on

716
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
the stream.

717
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:38,983
First, just thank you for the

718
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:38,983
presentation and wanted to pick up with

719
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:38,983
that robotics intro and conclusion.

720
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:52,997
To what extent does the embodiment in the

721
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
robot matter beyond the ability of the

722
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
virtual simulation to do things like

723
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:52,997
eject.

724
00:36:39,984 --> 00:37:03,002
The CD drive or ultimately do physical

725
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:03,002
things, just not the kinds of physical

726
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:03,002
things that we see human children do,

727
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:03,002
like play with toys?

728
00:36:52,997 --> 00:37:14,013
When you were thinking about the

729
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
virtualized simulation, were you thinking

730
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
about one that had no access to sensors

731
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
and actuators?

732
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:26,025
Or what happens when the digital

733
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:26,025
simulation also has access in some

734
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:26,025
limited way to the ability to sense and

735
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:26,025
act on the outside world?

736
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:40,039
If you have any thoughts sorry about

737
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:40,039
that.

738
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:42,041
On the stream, it was audible, but not to

739
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:42,041
you.

740
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:45,044
But now I've resolved the zoom.

741
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:51,050
So we can, from your consciousness

742
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,050
perspective, consider it a new question.

743
00:37:45,044 --> 00:38:10,063
So I just wanted to pick up with that

744
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:10,063
robotics example, a digital simulation

745
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:10,063
may still have sensors engaging with the

746
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:10,063
world and may still be able to undertake

747
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:10,063
actuation if only something like flipping

748
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:10,063
a switch on a processor.

749
00:37:51,050 --> 00:38:27,080
So what exactly about the embodiment do

750
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
you think matters for it to have that

751
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
kind of adaptivity and maybe even open

752
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
endedness and learning that you pointed

753
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
to as an important property?

754
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:31,084
Wanja: Yeah, good question.

755
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:39,092
I think there are many different aspects

756
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,092
that you're touching upon.

757
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:41,094
Let me start with this one.

758
00:38:39,092 --> 00:39:09,116
So I mentioned my correspondence with

759
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
Atomic corBack and one thing that he

760
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
suggested was that couldn't we regard a

761
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
language model as a system that has

762
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
certain sensory motor abilities so it can

763
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
interact with physical environment via a

764
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:09,116
linguistic interface?

765
00:38:41,094 --> 00:39:16,123
So it receives text as input and it

766
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:16,123
outputs text as outputs text.

767
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:27,134
And can't we regard this as sensing and

768
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:27,134
acting?

769
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:39,146
I think it's similar to one of the

770
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:39,146
aspects that your question touches upon.

771
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:42,149
So what is it about the embodiment?

772
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:52,159
And can there be different forms of

773
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,159
embodiment that might still lead to

774
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,159
consciousness?

775
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:59,166
And I don't have a full reply to this,

776
00:39:59,166 --> 00:39:59,166
just two things that I would mention

777
00:39:59,166 --> 00:39:59,166
here.

778
00:39:52,159 --> 00:40:18,179
The first is that there are certainly

779
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:18,179
some analogies between what a language

780
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:18,179
model does when it interacts with a user

781
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:18,179
and a system that maybe an organism that

782
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:18,179
interacts with its environment via

783
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:18,179
perception and action.

784
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:21,182
But there are also some dis analogies.

785
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:45,206
So when it comes to interacting with the

786
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:45,206
environment, when an organism interacts

787
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:45,206
with its environment, their temporal

788
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:45,206
constraints, it's really important that

789
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:45,206
it does the right thing at the right time

790
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:45,206
and reacts fast enough and so on.

791
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:49,210
And for a language model, that does not

792
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,210
play a big role.

793
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:53,213
So there's one difference.

794
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:57,218
And then there's also a difference in the

795
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:57,218
format of the representations.

796
00:40:53,214 --> 00:41:02,217
And in principle you could say, okay, why

797
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:02,217
does this matter?

798
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:06,221
And maybe in the end it doesn't.

799
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:18,233
But I just want to mention that there's

800
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:18,233
some crucial dis analogies that I think

801
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:18,233
would be important to take into

802
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:18,233
consideration and evaluate.

803
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:33,248
Then there's a question, okay, is there

804
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
something about these more low level

805
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
sensory motor skills that is crucial when

806
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
it comes to consciousness?

807
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:49,264
Now, on the one hand, we know that an

808
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:49,264
organism can be conscious without having

809
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:49,264
any language skills, without being able

810
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:49,264
to speak or understand language.

811
00:41:33,248 --> 00:42:11,280
So this is why when it comes to functions

812
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
of consciousness, for instance, people

813
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
don't look for or usually don't look for

814
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
linguistic abilities, but more for

815
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
sensory motor abilities or forms of

816
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
learning that enable or improve

817
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
interaction with the world.

818
00:41:50,265 --> 00:42:25,294
This is one thing, but of course, in

819
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:25,294
principle it could still be that a system

820
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:25,294
that lacks these low level, low level

821
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:25,294
skills is conscious.

822
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:43,312
But then I would say if it's possible to

823
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:43,312
be conscious without having these sensory

824
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:43,312
remote skills, then it's not really about

825
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:43,312
any ability for interaction with an

826
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:43,312
environment that a system is conscious.

827
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:49,318
But then it's merely because of some

828
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:49,318
internal computations that the system

829
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:49,318
performs.

830
00:42:43,312 --> 00:43:17,340
So if you're thinking about systems that

831
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
might be islands of awareness, systems

832
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
that don't receive any sensory input and

833
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
don't produce any motor output, then I

834
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
wouldn't want to rule out that such

835
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
systems are conscious and these such

836
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
systems don't have any ways of

837
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
interacting with their environment.

838
00:42:49,318 --> 00:43:29,352
So I'm happy to accept that interaction

839
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:29,352
with the environment is not required for

840
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:29,352
consciousness.

841
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:44,367
But coming back to language models this

842
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:44,367
would mean that being able to interact

843
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:44,367
with users using language is similarly

844
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:44,367
not required for consciousness.

845
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:53,376
So I would say if such a system is

846
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:53,376
conscious then it's not because of its

847
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:53,376
ability to interact with the environment,

848
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:53,376
but because of the internal processes.

849
00:43:44,367 --> 00:44:09,386
And what may be crucial is not the actual

850
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:09,386
interaction with the environment but just

851
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:09,386
the potential for interaction with the

852
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:09,386
physical alignment.

853
00:43:54,377 --> 00:44:26,403
And then it might in principle it might

854
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
very well be that a language model can

855
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
facilitate interaction with the physical

856
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
environment, for instance if it's

857
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
connected to a physically embodied

858
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
robot.

859
00:44:09,386 --> 00:44:32,409
And I mean, there's research going on on

860
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:32,409
such things.

861
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:50,427
Researchers who try to improve the

862
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:50,427
abilities of their robots by connecting

863
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:50,427
them or interfacing them with a language

864
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:50,427
model which can then help translate

865
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:50,427
commands into motor sequences.

866
00:44:33,410 --> 00:45:17,448
What this suggests is that maybe there

867
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
are some crucial types of representation

868
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
or computational processes that are

869
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
actually already implemented in language

870
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
models or in other systems that don't

871
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
really not directly interact with the

872
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:17,448
physical environment.

873
00:44:53,430 --> 00:45:20,451
And I'm happy to accept that.

874
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:30,461
But I would add that at least according

875
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:30,461
to the proposal that I've presented here,

876
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:30,461
you need something more for that.

877
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:58,489
And you need really it's not sufficient

878
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
to just implement these computations, but

879
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
they must have a meaning for the system

880
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
itself, in the sense that the system will

881
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
sustain its existence by virtue of these

882
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
processes if it is connected to the real

883
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
physical environment.

884
00:45:30,461 --> 00:46:08,493
Now maybe that I've not addressed every

885
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:08,493
aspect of your question so feel free to

886
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:08,493
restate your question.

887
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:10,495
Daniel: It's great.

888
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:17,502
It got to a great place because I wanted

889
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
to follow up with this intrinsic

890
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
computation concept.

891
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:40,524
So you mentioned that they're observer

892
00:46:40,524 --> 00:46:40,524
independent to the extent that anything

893
00:46:40,524 --> 00:46:40,524
or any process can be and that these are

894
00:46:40,524 --> 00:46:40,524
the kinds of processes that actually

895
00:46:40,524 --> 00:46:40,524
enable the persistence of that thing

896
00:46:40,524 --> 00:46:40,524
according to the Fep.

897
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:46,531
And so I was thinking about this first in

898
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:46,531
a bottom up way.

899
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:48,533
Like this is the firmware, this is the

900
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:48,533
Linux kernel.

901
00:46:46,531 --> 00:47:14,553
This is the kind of enabling software

902
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
that is supporting potentially extraneous

903
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
higher order functions and that is

904
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
allowing some kind of separation or

905
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
delineation between what we can say are

906
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
like the vital and intrinsic like almost

907
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
the homeostatic functions and then second

908
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
order functions.

909
00:46:49,534 --> 00:47:30,569
But then I thought about the ecology that

910
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
the computation is deployed in and so

911
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
let's just say that the software is being

912
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
the software simulation is being used in

913
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
a scientific context.

914
00:47:15,554 --> 00:47:42,581
Or to run photoshop and another cognitive

915
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:42,581
agent keeps that simulation alive because

916
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:42,581
it's performing some function.

917
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:50,589
And so from that bottom up sense the

918
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,589
Photoshop program is not the Linux kernel

919
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,589
so it's not like the Photoshop.

920
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:59,598
Like the Photoshop in principle is not

921
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
sustaining the persistence of the entity

922
00:47:59,598 --> 00:47:59,598
in a bottom up fashion.

923
00:47:50,589 --> 00:48:18,611
However, in deployment it actually

924
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:18,611
becomes a necessary condition imposed

925
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:18,611
externally and that will also be

926
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:18,611
extremely observer dependent or

927
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:18,611
subjective.

928
00:47:59,598 --> 00:48:26,619
So how do we think about in standard

929
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:26,619
modern computers or in Wetware?

930
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:29,622
What are these intrinsic computations?

931
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:33,626
Wanja: Thank you.

932
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,627
That's a great question.

933
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:46,639
I can say more about intrinsic

934
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:46,639
computation in a moment but just one

935
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:46,639
comment before that.

936
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:56,649
So I think you're touching on a very

937
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:56,649
important issue and that's a question by

938
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:56,649
what is a system in the first place.

939
00:48:46,639 --> 00:49:06,653
So if we want to consider the question

940
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
what kinds of entities can be conscious?

941
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:13,660
And we have to first say okay, what are

942
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660
the entities that we're looking in at in

943
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660
the first place?

944
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:15,662
What are these things?

945
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:28,675
And why can't we look at a piece of

946
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:28,675
software or some process that is running

947
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:28,675
an app that a user is using?

948
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:31,678
What was the example that you gave?

949
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:34,681
Photoshop or something?

950
00:49:31,678 --> 00:50:02,703
So why can't we regard Photoshop and a

951
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:02,703
particular instance of this software as a

952
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:02,703
system which exists for some time and it

953
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:02,703
will continue to exist if it's useful for

954
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:02,703
a human being and it's useful by virtue

955
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:02,703
of the computation computations that are

956
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:02,703
realized by it.

957
00:49:35,682 --> 00:50:12,713
And so can't we say that the system

958
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:12,713
sustains its existence by virtue of the

959
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:12,713
computations that it performs?

960
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:22,723
That's I think a very crucial question

961
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:22,723
because it's so fundamental what is a

962
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:22,723
system?

963
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:36,737
And currently I think that the free

964
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:36,737
energy principle is sufficient to answer

965
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:36,737
this question but it may be that it's

966
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:36,737
still too general.

967
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:44,745
So I dean the free energy principle gives

968
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
us an answer to the question if something

969
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
exists, what must it do?

970
00:50:36,737 --> 00:51:09,764
And so it analyzes this notion of the

971
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
continued existence of self organizing

972
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
systems and maybe it does apply to the

973
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
processes that implement photoshop in the

974
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
computer of a human being who uses this

975
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:09,764
software.

976
00:50:45,745 --> 00:51:41,796
And if that's the case, then I think we

977
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
have to add some further constraints it

978
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
may be necessary to add some further

979
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
constraints on the kinds of systems that

980
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
we want to regard as potentially

981
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
conscious or that we want to consider

982
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
when it comes to the question what kinds

983
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
of systems can be conscious?

984
00:51:10,765 --> 00:52:03,812
And one suggestion or idea that I think

985
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
would be worthwhile to explore here is to

986
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
investigate to what extent something like

987
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
the free energy integrated information

988
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
theory may complement the free energy

989
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
principle in this regard.

990
00:51:42,797 --> 00:52:26,835
Because integrated information theory has

991
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:26,835
a very strong emphasis on the notion of

992
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:26,835
existence, of what it means to exist,

993
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:26,835
what it means to be what it means to

994
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:26,835
intrinsically exist, as it were, and not

995
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:26,835
just in the eye of a beholder.

996
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:42,851
And maybe we need to add constraints from

997
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:42,851
something like integrated information

998
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:42,851
theory, which would then tell us what

999
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:42,851
types of systems really exist.

1000
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:56,865
And then maybe it would say, okay, the

1001
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:56,865
processes that are implementing Photoshop

1002
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:56,865
in this computer don't really exist in an

1003
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:56,865
intrinsic sense.

1004
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:58,867
Yeah.

1005
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:04,867
So this would then be my suggestion to

1006
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:04,867
add some constraints.

1007
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:09,872
But of course, you could say, well, no,

1008
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:09,872
such constraints are completely

1009
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:09,872
unnecessary.

1010
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:28,891
We don't need to exclude certain systems,

1011
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:28,891
and we can regard the processes that

1012
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:28,891
implement Photoshop as a real system that

1013
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:28,891
sustains its existence.

1014
00:53:09,872 --> 00:54:05,922
But my intuition would be, at least

1015
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
currently, that such processes would, at

1016
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
least in a classical system with a

1017
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
classical hardware, would be too

1018
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
scattered, and there would be so many

1019
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
physical processes interfering, as it

1020
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
were, that you can regard this as a

1021
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
separate thing which is distinct from

1022
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
other things that are happening in the

1023
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
computer.

1024
00:53:28,891 --> 00:54:13,930
But I would say this is more an observer

1025
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:13,930
dependent property.

1026
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:30,947
Those processes, they're so entangled

1027
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
with other processes in the physical

1028
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
system that they are not particular

1029
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
systems in the sense of the free energy

1030
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
principle.

1031
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:31,948
Daniel: Awesome.

1032
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:47,964
And again, kind of journeys us to another

1033
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:47,964
question about the topological or

1034
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:47,964
geometric concordances between physical

1035
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:47,964
and computational dynamics.

1036
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:51,968
And it made me think of a few different

1037
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:51,968
kinds of systems.

1038
00:54:47,964 --> 00:54:59,976
The von Neumann architecture described

1039
00:54:59,976 --> 00:54:59,976
with the CPU and the Ram regular desktop

1040
00:54:59,976 --> 00:54:59,976
computer situation.

1041
00:54:51,968 --> 00:55:06,977
Of course, we have unconventional

1042
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
computing paradigms, quantum and analog

1043
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
computers.

1044
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:22,993
We have the brain and the SPM package in

1045
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
which statistical inferences help us

1046
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
model how brain regions that aren't

1047
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
connected through, for example, axons can

1048
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
still have an edge in a Bayesian graph.

1049
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:31,002
They could still have a causal effective

1050
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:31,002
or functional connectivity without being

1051
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:31,002
structurally connected and vice versa.

1052
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:55,026
And then to kind of bring it back to the

1053
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:55,026
computer and what you brought up about

1054
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:55,026
whether or not those processes would be

1055
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:55,026
too scattered, what about a computer,

1056
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:55,026
either a distributed computing cluster or

1057
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:55,026
a strict virtualization scheme on the

1058
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:55,026
computer such that certain variables were

1059
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:55,026
isolated?

1060
00:55:31,002 --> 00:56:18,043
Would it be enough for the system to have

1061
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
some kind of constraint, again through a

1062
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
physical networked layout or through a

1063
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
virtualized system so that the

1064
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
computational flow and the causal flow

1065
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:18,043
could be played with in a different way?

1066
00:55:56,027 --> 00:56:20,045
And then how would we know?

1067
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:21,046
What would we be looking for?

1068
00:56:20,045 --> 00:56:28,053
Surely not simply test retest accuracy or

1069
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:28,053
efficiency in some way.

1070
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:30,055
That's not what consciousness is.

1071
00:56:28,053 --> 00:56:47,072
So, I mean, it really comes down to what

1072
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
are we looking for or talking about if we

1073
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
did have the ability to design different

1074
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
systems that did have different overlap

1075
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
with their computational and structural

1076
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
aspects.

1077
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:51,076
Wanja: Yeah, great question.

1078
00:56:49,074 --> 00:57:06,085
I think it's very important to look at

1079
00:57:06,085 --> 00:57:06,085
different types of computer architecture,

1080
00:57:06,085 --> 00:57:06,085
different types of hardware, and you

1081
00:57:06,085 --> 00:57:06,085
mentioned some.

1082
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:14,093
So there's actually something that was

1083
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:14,093
pointed out to me by Johannes Kleiner.

1084
00:57:06,085 --> 00:57:37,116
So he pointed me to the notion of

1085
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:37,116
computation and memory or something

1086
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:37,116
similar, and if I understand that

1087
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:37,116
correctly, it is a slight departure from

1088
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:37,116
the Van Norman architecture because you

1089
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:37,116
actually do computations within the

1090
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:37,116
memory unit.

1091
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:57,136
So it's not that you have additional

1092
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:57,136
memory units within the CPU, but you

1093
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:57,136
perform computations in the memory unit

1094
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:57,136
itself, which would be a way of

1095
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:57,136
satisfying the Axel constant, the flow

1096
00:57:57,136 --> 00:57:57,136
condition that I mentioned.

1097
00:57:37,116 --> 00:58:13,146
And similarly, there may be other

1098
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:13,146
architecture, maybe neuromorphic hardware

1099
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:13,146
that also could implement simulations in

1100
00:58:13,146 --> 00:58:13,146
a way that satisfies the flow condition.

1101
00:57:57,136 --> 00:58:27,160
And as I pointed out in the presentation,

1102
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,160
the flow condition is just one necessary

1103
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,160
condition which is weaker than the

1104
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:27,160
existential condition.

1105
00:58:14,147 --> 00:58:36,169
So all of these systems, even if they

1106
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:36,169
satisfy the flow condition, would not

1107
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:36,169
thereby also satisfy the stronger

1108
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:36,169
existential condition.

1109
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:48,181
But as may have become clear, I am not

1110
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:48,181
completely certain about this existential

1111
00:58:48,181 --> 00:58:48,181
condition.

1112
00:58:37,170 --> 00:59:26,213
Or rather, there may be some ways in

1113
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
which one can describe what's going on in

1114
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
such systems that you can actually say,

1115
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
okay, the processes that implement these

1116
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
computations, they are systems,

1117
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
particular systems to which the free

1118
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
energy principle can be applied, even if

1119
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
maybe the material on which these

1120
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
processes run is not directly affected by

1121
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
these computational processes.

1122
00:58:48,181 --> 00:59:39,226
So maybe if we think about maybe

1123
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:39,226
neuromorphic computer chips, maybe the

1124
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:39,226
chips themselves, they will continue to

1125
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:39,226
exist no matter what computations they

1126
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:39,226
perform.

1127
00:59:26,213 --> 01:00:04,150
But if what's going on, if the activity

1128
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,150
that implements the computations within

1129
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,150
such a chip is sophisticated enough or

1130
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,150
has certain properties, maybe this

1131
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,150
activity can be regarded as an instance

1132
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,150
of a particular system to which the free

1133
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,150
energy principle can be applied.

1134
00:59:40,227 --> 01:00:11,293
So I'm not completely certain about this

1135
01:00:11,293 --> 01:00:11,293
and I think this is something that has to

1136
01:00:11,293 --> 01:00:11,293
be clarified.

1137
01:00:04,198 --> 01:00:25,603
Maybe it will be useful also to see what

1138
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:25,603
people are actually working on the free

1139
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:25,603
energy principle would say about this.

1140
01:00:16,721 --> 01:00:28,925
That's very important point.

1141
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:38,902
Daniel: Yeah, a few things that makes me

1142
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:38,902
think of first is kind of like the hard

1143
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:38,902
problem of virtualization or something in

1144
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:38,902
that some modification of a hard or an

1145
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:38,902
easy question.

1146
01:00:28,978 --> 01:01:06,168
And then also about the difference

1147
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:06,168
between a case where the material

1148
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:06,168
substrate of computation is its own self

1149
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:06,168
referent sustainer and another case in

1150
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:06,168
which the material basis of a computation

1151
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:06,168
is projecting, let's just say a non

1152
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:06,168
equilibrium steady state like a holograph

1153
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:06,168
or it's creating robots, it's spinning

1154
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:06,168
out robots or it's doing 3D printing.

1155
01:00:38,987 --> 01:01:28,344
So in that situation, depending on how

1156
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:28,344
the system boundaries are modeled, the

1157
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:28,344
viability of one part, maybe even like

1158
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:28,344
its kind of semantic germline is required

1159
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:28,344
for the continued propagation of some

1160
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:28,344
other part of this persistent system.

1161
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:32,785
But Thomas Parr is actually disposable

1162
01:01:32,785 --> 01:01:32,785
even though it's the embodiment.

1163
01:01:28,364 --> 01:01:44,899
I'll go to a question in the live chat

1164
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:44,899
and also I think it was a mem computing

1165
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:44,899
was the memory based computing

1166
01:01:44,899 --> 01:01:44,899
architecture.

1167
01:01:35,027 --> 01:01:44,933
Yeah.

1168
01:01:44,906 --> 01:01:48,031
And agree, there's a lot of interesting

1169
01:01:48,031 --> 01:01:48,031
threads there.

1170
01:01:44,939 --> 01:01:54,095
So Ali asks a question in the chat he

1171
01:01:54,095 --> 01:01:54,095
wrote, what about understanding?

1172
01:01:48,032 --> 01:02:01,107
If we define understanding as a kind of

1173
01:02:01,107 --> 01:02:01,107
correlation or mapping between spaces of

1174
01:02:01,107 --> 01:02:01,107
semantic possibilities?

1175
01:01:54,096 --> 01:02:07,166
Can we say that large language models do

1176
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:07,166
indeed understand their prompts and

1177
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:07,166
outputs?

1178
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:13,223
And does understanding in this sense

1179
01:02:13,223 --> 01:02:13,223
require or entail consciousness or vice

1180
01:02:13,223 --> 01:02:13,223
versa?

1181
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:20,294
So with understanding as a map among

1182
01:02:20,294 --> 01:02:20,294
semantic spaces, what can we say about

1183
01:02:20,294 --> 01:02:20,294
Llms and understanding?

1184
01:02:13,225 --> 01:02:23,326
And what is the relationship between

1185
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:23,326
understanding and consciousness?

1186
01:02:20,294 --> 01:02:25,342
Wanja: Thank you.

1187
01:02:24,336 --> 01:02:29,380
That's a very good or these are very good

1188
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:29,380
questions.

1189
01:02:25,343 --> 01:02:35,448
And of course, it depends on the notion

1190
01:02:35,448 --> 01:02:35,448
of understanding.

1191
01:02:29,388 --> 01:03:02,657
And if we conceive of understanding as a

1192
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:02,657
way of grasping inferential relations or

1193
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:02,657
associative relations between different

1194
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:02,657
notions, there certainly is some form of

1195
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:02,657
understanding that large language models

1196
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:02,657
have.

1197
01:02:35,448 --> 01:03:06,691
They can relate concepts to one another.

1198
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:27,899
And their representations of concepts in

1199
01:03:27,899 --> 01:03:27,899
a vector space preserves some important

1200
01:03:27,899 --> 01:03:27,899
parts of the structure of conceptual

1201
01:03:27,899 --> 01:03:27,899
spaces of our language.

1202
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:31,946
So in this sense, they do understand some

1203
01:03:31,946 --> 01:03:31,946
things.

1204
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:48,110
Then there are other forms of

1205
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:48,110
understanding and about which I will say

1206
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:48,110
is something in a moment, but because

1207
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:48,110
that's a bit more complicated and I

1208
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:48,110
cannot say as much about it, I think.

1209
01:03:32,953 --> 01:04:01,184
But the question whether understanding

1210
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:01,184
entails consciousness or understanding in

1211
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:01,184
the sense you mentioned, I would say,

1212
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:01,184
does not entail, does not require

1213
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:01,184
consciousness.

1214
01:03:48,112 --> 01:04:05,222
So you can have that without

1215
01:04:05,222 --> 01:04:05,222
consciousness.

1216
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:14,317
And another question is well, does

1217
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:14,317
consciousness require some other form of

1218
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:14,317
understanding?

1219
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:15,323
Maybe.

1220
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:27,439
Or at least my proposal here would

1221
01:04:27,439 --> 01:04:27,439
suggest that yes, there is some form of

1222
01:04:27,439 --> 01:04:27,439
understanding that is required by

1223
01:04:27,439 --> 01:04:27,439
consciousness.

1224
01:04:17,345 --> 01:04:41,588
And this is an understanding which is

1225
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:41,588
related to knowing what things in the

1226
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:41,588
world some words or representations refer

1227
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:41,588
to.

1228
01:04:27,444 --> 01:04:50,671
So this requires that you actually have a

1229
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:50,671
concept of there being a world of which

1230
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:50,671
you are part.

1231
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:56,731
And I don't think that large Lagrange

1232
01:04:56,731 --> 01:04:56,731
models understand that they are things in

1233
01:04:56,731 --> 01:04:56,731
the world.

1234
01:04:50,673 --> 01:05:02,737
They don't know that there is something

1235
01:05:02,737 --> 01:05:02,737
out there of which they are a part.

1236
01:04:56,735 --> 01:05:12,833
And I think that's crucial for a certain

1237
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:12,833
form of understanding.

1238
01:05:03,745 --> 01:05:36,071
And in order for certain things to be

1239
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:36,071
meaningful for you, you must somehow have

1240
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:36,071
a concept of the world and a sense of

1241
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:36,071
that you are part of this world and how

1242
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:36,071
you relate to things in the world and so

1243
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:36,071
on.

1244
01:05:13,847 --> 01:05:53,246
Now, this, I think, is required for some

1245
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:53,246
form of understanding and I think it's

1246
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:53,246
also required for consciousness, at least

1247
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:53,246
according to the proposal that I

1248
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:53,246
presented here.

1249
01:05:37,083 --> 01:06:14,395
And the idea is that if a system not only

1250
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:14,395
has some internal representations that it

1251
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:14,395
manipulates, but if by virtue of doing so

1252
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:14,395
it sustains its existence, then this puts

1253
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:14,395
some very strong constraints on what the

1254
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:14,395
system will do with these

1255
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:14,395
representations.

1256
01:05:53,247 --> 01:06:35,605
So if you if you think about a self

1257
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:35,605
driving car, then in principle it may

1258
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:35,605
compute all sorts of things and it will

1259
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:35,605
not have a meaning for the system, for

1260
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:35,605
the car itself.

1261
01:06:15,401 --> 01:07:13,927
But if these processes are realized in a

1262
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:13,927
way that the system's continued existence

1263
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:13,927
depends on these computations and this

1264
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:13,927
puts some more constraints on what it can

1265
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:13,927
do with these internal representations

1266
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:13,927
which will give such a system maybe some

1267
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:13,927
form of common sense and allowing it to

1268
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:13,927
draw certain inferences and avoiding

1269
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:13,927
other inferences and so on.

1270
01:06:35,607 --> 01:07:32,119
So that would be my hypothesis that

1271
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:32,119
there's a certain form of understanding

1272
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:32,119
that requires these, that also requires

1273
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:32,119
the conditions that I think are necessary

1274
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:32,119
for consciousness.

1275
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:48,272
Daniel: In that I hear a shift from

1276
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:48,272
semantics and semantic embeddings to true

1277
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:48,272
semiosis and the abductive process of

1278
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:48,272
generation of embedded meanings.

1279
01:07:35,145 --> 01:07:50,294
That's very interesting.

1280
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:53,322
Okay, a few more questions.

1281
01:07:50,299 --> 01:08:05,381
One, you've been writing excellent and

1282
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:05,381
diverse papers on different mathematical

1283
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:05,381
formalisms of consciousness for some

1284
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:05,381
years now.

1285
01:07:54,330 --> 01:08:18,518
So how have you seen the empirical side

1286
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:18,518
and the theoretical side of scientific

1287
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:18,518
study of consciousness developing in the

1288
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:18,518
last several years?

1289
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:31,642
And how do you believe that the current

1290
01:08:31,642 --> 01:08:31,642
inflection points in artificial

1291
01:08:31,642 --> 01:08:31,642
intelligence are like recontextualizing

1292
01:08:31,642 --> 01:08:31,642
or modifying your agenda or bringing

1293
01:08:31,642 --> 01:08:31,642
different relevance to your work?

1294
01:08:18,519 --> 01:08:35,684
Wanja: Yeah, that's a good question.

1295
01:08:33,660 --> 01:09:00,877
And in general, I would say that since

1296
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:00,877
the 90s there's been an explosion of

1297
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:00,877
empirical work on consciousness, partly

1298
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:00,877
also due to certain methods that were and

1299
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:00,877
paradigms that were developed and then

1300
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:00,877
imaging technology that improved and so

1301
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:00,877
on.

1302
01:08:35,685 --> 01:09:05,924
So we have better ways of empirically

1303
01:09:05,924 --> 01:09:05,924
studying consciousness.

1304
01:09:00,878 --> 01:09:20,074
And so in the past years, there's been or

1305
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:20,074
decades, a lot of empirical data on

1306
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:20,074
consciousness has been gathered and many

1307
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:20,074
things have been found out.

1308
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:37,242
And I think there are two reasons for

1309
01:09:37,242 --> 01:09:37,242
which many people are now driven to

1310
01:09:37,242 --> 01:09:37,242
theoretical approaches again or looking

1311
01:09:37,242 --> 01:09:37,242
more closely at theoretical approaches.

1312
01:09:20,076 --> 01:09:47,347
The first is that data alone doesn't give

1313
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:47,347
you understanding, so you need ways of

1314
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:47,347
interpreting data and constraining

1315
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:47,347
experiments and so on.

1316
01:09:37,243 --> 01:10:19,599
And I think some evidence for this is are

1317
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:19,599
these recent adversarial collaborations

1318
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:19,599
in which proponents of different theories

1319
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:19,599
of consciousness team up design

1320
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:19,599
experiments that would lead to, or could

1321
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:19,599
lead to evidence which more strongly

1322
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:19,599
favors one but not the other theory.

1323
01:09:47,349 --> 01:10:51,921
And part of why such adversarial

1324
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:51,921
collaborations are needed or are

1325
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:51,921
perceived as necessary by some is that in

1326
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:51,921
previous years people working with

1327
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:51,921
certain theoretical assumptions in mind

1328
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:51,921
or with their pet theory, maybe global

1329
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:51,921
workspace theory, they've been or other

1330
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:51,921
theories.

1331
01:10:19,608 --> 01:11:12,077
Of course they've then been looking for

1332
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
evidence that would confirm their

1333
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
theoretical assumptions and maybe

1334
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
designing experiments in a way that is

1335
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
more likely to yield certain kinds of

1336
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
evidence or confirming evidence,

1337
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
supporting evidence for their own

1338
01:11:12,077 --> 01:11:12,077
theoretical assumptions.

1339
01:10:51,921 --> 01:11:37,321
So realizing that in order to make

1340
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:37,321
progress and constrain also the class of

1341
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:37,321
theories that you have, realizing that

1342
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:37,321
it's important to do more rigorous

1343
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:37,321
experiments and explore ways in which you

1344
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:37,321
can actually find also find evidence that

1345
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:37,321
disconfirms certain theoretical

1346
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:37,321
assumptions.

1347
01:11:12,078 --> 01:11:52,476
That I think is one of the motivations

1348
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:52,476
behind these adversarial collaborations

1349
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:52,476
and also makes people a bit more self

1350
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:52,476
conscious of the theoretical assumptions

1351
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:52,476
that they're making.

1352
01:11:38,338 --> 01:12:06,553
Yeah, then another big issue is, of

1353
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:06,553
course, that the scope of empirical and

1354
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:06,553
theoretical approaches has to be

1355
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:06,553
expanded.

1356
01:11:54,493 --> 01:12:15,640
We now have good evidence that many

1357
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:15,640
animals that were previously thought to

1358
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:15,640
be unconscious actually are conscious.

1359
01:12:06,558 --> 01:12:19,686
Animals such as octopuses.

1360
01:12:16,655 --> 01:12:32,810
And there's at least reason to take the

1361
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
hypothesis seriously that some insects

1362
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
may also be conscious, maybe bees are

1363
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
conscious.

1364
01:12:19,688 --> 01:12:57,067
And in order to make progress here

1365
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:57,067
theoretical approaches are needed to help

1366
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:57,067
structure debates and determine what kind

1367
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:57,067
of evidence would be supportive for

1368
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:57,067
certain hypotheses or which type of kinds

1369
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:57,067
of evidence would be relevant.

1370
01:12:32,815 --> 01:13:03,067
To answer the distribution question which

1371
01:13:03,067 --> 01:13:03,067
entities, which animals are conscious.

1372
01:12:57,067 --> 01:13:05,086
So that's one thing.

1373
01:13:04,076 --> 01:13:23,261
And then, of course, you mentioned

1374
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:23,261
progress in AI and people are now

1375
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:23,261
seriously considering what artificial

1376
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:23,261
systems might be conscious and whether

1377
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:23,261
some existing systems might actually

1378
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:23,261
already be conscious.

1379
01:13:05,087 --> 01:13:36,390
And we need theories to make progress on

1380
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,390
this or maybe not necessarily theories,

1381
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,390
but theoretical work.

1382
01:13:23,267 --> 01:13:56,599
And what I and also, there's a very

1383
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:56,599
difficult problem here that artificial

1384
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:56,599
systems are in many ways not only unlike

1385
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:56,599
human beings, but also unlike other

1386
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:56,599
animals.

1387
01:13:36,391 --> 01:14:17,746
So whereas in research on animal

1388
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:17,746
consciousness you can try and draw some

1389
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:17,746
analogies between human beings and other

1390
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:17,746
animals, it's less straightforward when

1391
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:17,746
it comes to artificial systems and this

1392
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:17,746
means that empirical research alone will

1393
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:17,746
be less helpful.

1394
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:26,831
We also need very sophisticated

1395
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:26,831
theoretical approaches to deal with these

1396
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:26,831
issues.

1397
01:14:17,747 --> 01:14:41,982
And there will always remain some

1398
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:41,982
uncertainty just because artificial

1399
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:41,982
systems can be so can be physically or

1400
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:41,982
physiologically so different from

1401
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:41,982
conscious organisms.

1402
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:47,041
And it's not clear how best to deal with

1403
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:47,041
these uncertainties.

1404
01:14:41,986 --> 01:14:52,095
We need theoretical approaches to make

1405
01:14:52,095 --> 01:14:52,095
sense of all this.

1406
01:14:47,043 --> 01:15:03,145
And I would say we might face the reality

1407
01:15:03,145 --> 01:15:03,145
at some point.

1408
01:14:53,100 --> 01:15:14,251
So maybe it will turn out that we won't

1409
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:14,251
ever know whether certain systems are

1410
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:14,251
conscious or not.

1411
01:15:03,146 --> 01:15:24,355
I'm very skeptical that we'll someday

1412
01:15:24,355 --> 01:15:24,355
find a theory of consciousness that will

1413
01:15:24,355 --> 01:15:24,355
tell us exactly which entities are

1414
01:15:24,355 --> 01:15:24,355
conscious and which are not.

1415
01:15:14,253 --> 01:15:38,490
I mean, integrated information theory is

1416
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:38,490
a proposal for such a theory and it's for

1417
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:38,490
this reason very important that theories

1418
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:38,490
like IIT are being developed.

1419
01:15:24,357 --> 01:15:47,586
On the other hand, it makes very ActInf

1420
01:15:47,586 --> 01:15:47,586
prediction about what kinds of systems

1421
01:15:47,586 --> 01:15:47,586
can be conscious and which can't.

1422
01:15:38,497 --> 01:16:21,862
So it would agree with the proposal I

1423
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:21,862
presented here that a computer simulation

1424
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:21,862
in a classical hardware will not be

1425
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:21,862
conscious and many artificial systems

1426
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:21,862
will not be conscious even if they have

1427
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:21,862
all the abilities that we that are

1428
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:21,862
associated with consciousness, even if

1429
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:21,862
they can interact with the environment,

1430
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:21,862
have sophisticated cognitive abilities

1431
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:21,862
and so on.

1432
01:15:48,591 --> 01:16:30,950
So it's very important that such theories

1433
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:30,950
are developed.

1434
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:35,003
But I think it's also very hard to gain

1435
01:16:35,003 --> 01:16:35,003
certainty.

1436
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:37,027
And maybe so.

1437
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:54,193
This is one strategy that I'm pursuing is

1438
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:54,193
to try and find necessary conditions for

1439
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:54,193
consciousness which would allow us to

1440
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:54,193
rule out that certain systems are

1441
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:54,193
conscious.

1442
01:16:37,027 --> 01:17:09,284
So maybe we will never have a theory of

1443
01:17:09,284 --> 01:17:09,284
consciousness that says with certainty if

1444
01:17:09,284 --> 01:17:09,284
a system, an artificial system has x or

1445
01:17:09,284 --> 01:17:09,284
X-Y-Z and so on, then it is conscious.

1446
01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:22,415
But maybe we will have some theoretical

1447
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:22,415
approaches that are empirically informed

1448
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:22,415
and which strongly suggests that if a

1449
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:22,415
system does not have X, then it is not

1450
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:22,415
conscious.

1451
01:17:10,298 --> 01:17:31,505
So maybe this will be all that we can

1452
01:17:31,505 --> 01:17:31,505
hope to achieve when it comes to

1453
01:17:31,505 --> 01:17:31,505
understanding artificial consciousness.

1454
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:43,622
And I see the account that I'm presenting

1455
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:43,622
here as contributing to this project by

1456
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:43,622
proposing some necessary conditions for

1457
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:43,622
consciousness.

1458
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:52,709
And as I already indicated, I'm not

1459
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:52,709
completely certain about either of these

1460
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:52,709
conditions.

1461
01:17:43,625 --> 01:18:19,923
But maybe something like the weaker

1462
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:19,923
condition, the flow condition, maybe that

1463
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:19,923
would something like that could be a

1464
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:19,923
useful, necessary condition for

1465
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:19,923
consciousness, which would rule out

1466
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:19,923
consciousness in a wide class of systems,

1467
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:19,923
but which would, for example, not rule

1468
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:19,923
out the possibility of consciousness in a

1469
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:19,923
computer simulation.

1470
01:17:52,714 --> 01:18:22,957
Not in all computer simulations.

1471
01:18:20,935 --> 01:18:26,991
Daniel: Awesome.

1472
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:29,002
The via negativa of consciousness

1473
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:29,002
studies.

1474
01:18:26,992 --> 01:18:36,009
So one question on measurement and then a

1475
01:18:36,009 --> 01:18:36,009
closing question on ethics.

1476
01:18:31,004 --> 01:18:39,012
So you mentioned the distribution

1477
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:39,012
question.

1478
01:18:36,009 --> 01:18:45,018
What is the distribution of consciousness

1479
01:18:45,018 --> 01:18:45,018
in our scenario?

1480
01:18:40,013 --> 01:18:49,021
What kind of distribution is that?

1481
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:51,024
Is it a z axis?

1482
01:18:49,022 --> 01:19:01,028
There's a scalar quantity that is going

1483
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
to summarize the density of some

1484
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
distribution in space like we were doing

1485
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:01,028
some kind of topographical map?

1486
01:18:51,024 --> 01:19:06,033
Or is that distribution

1487
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:06,033
multidimensional?

1488
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:10,037
Are there different dimensions to

1489
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:10,037
consciousness?

1490
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:23,050
So to what extent do we even aim for a

1491
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,050
unidimensional scalar representation,

1492
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,050
potentially using IIT or other measures?

1493
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:33,060
Or to what extent will we have a

1494
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:33,060
plurality of consciousness measures

1495
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:33,060
without necessarily like a higher or

1496
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:33,060
lower.

1497
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:36,063
Wanja: Thanks.

1498
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:46,073
Yeah, that's a very tough question as you

1499
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
already alluded to.

1500
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:58,085
According to some theories, such as IIT,

1501
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:58,085
consciousness does come in degrees, but

1502
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:58,085
it varies along a single scale, a degree

1503
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:58,085
of consciousness.

1504
01:19:46,073 --> 01:20:06,087
And classically, there's also this

1505
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:06,087
distinction between the level of

1506
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:06,087
consciousness and the contents of

1507
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:06,087
consciousness.

1508
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:20,101
Or the level would be defined in terms of

1509
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:20,101
wakefulness or vigilance and the contents

1510
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:20,101
in terms of that which is experienced.

1511
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:31,112
And the idea would be that you can

1512
01:20:31,112 --> 01:20:31,112
distinguish between levels of

1513
01:20:31,112 --> 01:20:31,112
consciousness in a unidimensional way.

1514
01:20:21,102 --> 01:21:12,147
But then more recent proposals according

1515
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:12,147
to which consciousness is

1516
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:12,147
multidimensional and as you already

1517
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:12,147
mentioned, which means that it may be

1518
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:12,147
impossible to define a unidimensional

1519
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:12,147
degree of consciousness, maybe you can

1520
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:12,147
only order conscious experiences along

1521
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:12,147
these different dimensions individually,

1522
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:12,147
but not have a total order on conscious

1523
01:21:12,147 --> 01:21:12,147
states.

1524
01:20:32,113 --> 01:21:34,169
Yeah, so I think these are, to a large

1525
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:34,169
extent unresolved questions and I don't

1526
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:34,169
have a strong opinion on this, but I do

1527
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:34,169
think that consciousness, there are at

1528
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:34,169
least some crucial dimensions of

1529
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:34,169
consciousness that come in degrees.

1530
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:47,182
And I'm open to the idea that there will

1531
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:47,182
be borderline cases between systems that

1532
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:47,182
are clearly conscious and systems that

1533
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:47,182
are clearly unconscious.

1534
01:21:34,169 --> 01:22:00,189
So I'm open to the idea, to the

1535
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:00,189
possibility that there will be some

1536
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:00,189
systems for which it's indeterminate

1537
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:00,189
whether they're conscious or not.

1538
01:21:47,182 --> 01:22:15,204
And apart from I, Dean IIT would not

1539
01:22:15,204 --> 01:22:15,204
imply this, of course, but there some

1540
01:22:15,204 --> 01:22:15,204
computational approaches to consciousness

1541
01:22:15,204 --> 01:22:15,204
would specify some properties.

1542
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:34,223
I mean, if you think about the

1543
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:34,223
counterfactual depth action, action

1544
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:34,223
oriented representation instance, that's

1545
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:34,223
something that comes in degrees, and it's

1546
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:34,223
not clear at what point a system will be

1547
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:34,223
conscious and cease to be unconscious.

1548
01:22:16,205 --> 01:22:41,230
What degree of counterfactual depth is

1549
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:41,230
necessary for consciousness.

1550
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:51,240
I'm open to the possibility of borderline

1551
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:51,240
cases of consciousness.

1552
01:22:45,234 --> 01:23:10,253
And similarly, if we try to apply

1553
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:10,253
theories of consciousness to other

1554
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:10,253
animals, then there may be cases in which

1555
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:10,253
it's not clear whether what a theory of

1556
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:10,253
consciousness would say.

1557
01:22:52,241 --> 01:23:23,266
So Jonathan Birch has a wonderful paper

1558
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:23,266
about the problem of trying to determine

1559
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:23,266
of finding out which non human animals

1560
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:23,266
are consciousness.

1561
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:46,288
And the idea is that if you try to use a

1562
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:46,288
theory of consciousness that was

1563
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:46,288
developed on the basis of what we know

1564
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:46,288
about consciousness in human beings, then

1565
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:46,288
there may be many cases in which it's not

1566
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:46,288
clear whether the theory applies or not,

1567
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:46,288
or whether the conditions for

1568
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:46,288
consciousness are fulfilled or not.

1569
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:51,294
So if you think about global workspace

1570
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:51,294
theory, what is a global workspace?

1571
01:23:46,289 --> 01:24:14,311
We can, for human beings, distinguish

1572
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:14,311
between different consuming systems,

1573
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:14,311
local processes that have access to the

1574
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:14,311
global workspace and which receive the

1575
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:14,311
contents that are represented in the

1576
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:14,311
workspace and which are thereby

1577
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:14,311
consciously processed.

1578
01:23:52,295 --> 01:24:33,330
But there are animals that don't have as

1579
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:33,330
many cognitive sub processes, that don't

1580
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:33,330
have such sophisticated cognitive

1581
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:33,330
abilities, that may maybe have something

1582
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:33,330
like a global workspace, but with fewer

1583
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:33,330
consuming systems.

1584
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:40,337
So when does it cease to be a global

1585
01:24:40,337 --> 01:24:40,337
workspace in the sense that will be

1586
01:24:40,337 --> 01:24:40,337
required for consciousness?

1587
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:55,352
And because of such indeterminacy, it may

1588
01:24:55,352 --> 01:24:55,352
be more useful than to look for other

1589
01:24:55,352 --> 01:24:55,352
markers of consciousness, evidence for

1590
01:24:55,352 --> 01:24:55,352
consciousness, such as learning

1591
01:24:55,352 --> 01:24:55,352
abilities.

1592
01:24:40,337 --> 01:25:19,370
That's what Birch proposes, and in part,

1593
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:19,370
I think, inspired by work by Yvonne

1594
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:19,370
Jablanca and Simona Ginsburg, who

1595
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:19,370
suggests that certain forms of learning

1596
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:19,370
are transition markers for consciousness,

1597
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:19,370
which provides strong evidence for the

1598
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:19,370
presence of consciousness.

1599
01:24:55,352 --> 01:25:25,376
And yeah, what about the distribution

1600
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,376
question?

1601
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:37,387
So this is more about evidence for

1602
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:37,387
consciousness in different types of

1603
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:37,387
systems and what will the distribution

1604
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:37,387
look like in the end?

1605
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:38,389
I don't know.

1606
01:25:37,388 --> 01:25:55,406
But what I'm mainly interested is in

1607
01:25:55,406 --> 01:25:55,406
trying to find out how we can determine

1608
01:25:55,406 --> 01:25:55,406
whether a system is conscious or how we

1609
01:25:55,406 --> 01:25:55,406
can rule out that a system is conscious

1610
01:25:55,406 --> 01:25:55,406
and what, in the end, this will tell us

1611
01:25:55,406 --> 01:25:55,406
about the distribution of consciousness,

1612
01:25:55,406 --> 01:25:55,406
I think is a great open question.

1613
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:59,410
Daniel: Awesome.

1614
01:25:58,409 --> 01:26:04,409
Well, as we say in the ant colony, the

1615
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:04,409
whole nest is our workspace.

1616
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:06,411
So different systems will do it

1617
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:06,411
differently.

1618
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:13,418
And in closing, I know that you're

1619
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:13,418
teaching a course on this, so to compress

1620
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:13,418
it will be a challenge.

1621
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:26,431
But could you conclude with a statement,

1622
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:26,431
or actually a pair of statements on AI

1623
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:26,431
ethics, one addressed to natural humans,

1624
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:26,431
one addressed to the machines?

1625
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:29,434
Wanja: Yeah.

1626
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:37,442
So AI ethics so I don't want to say

1627
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:37,442
anything about AI ethics in general, but

1628
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:37,442
just about consciousness.

1629
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:55,460
So when it comes to human beings what I

1630
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
find interesting is a question what is

1631
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
required for being a moral agent?

1632
01:26:37,442 --> 01:27:18,477
So most people would agree that

1633
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:18,477
consciousness gives people or gives

1634
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:18,477
entities gives organisms at least some

1635
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:18,477
moral status even if it's maybe not

1636
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:18,477
required for having a moral standing but

1637
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:18,477
it's at least sufficient for some form of

1638
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:18,477
moral status.

1639
01:26:56,461 --> 01:27:27,486
And then maybe some organisms matter more

1640
01:27:27,486 --> 01:27:27,486
than other organisms even if they are

1641
01:27:27,486 --> 01:27:27,486
similarly conscious.

1642
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:37,496
But maybe some animals matter more than

1643
01:27:37,496 --> 01:27:37,496
other animals because of their cognitive

1644
01:27:37,496 --> 01:27:37,496
abilities and so on.

1645
01:27:27,486 --> 01:27:49,508
And then the question is what do we have

1646
01:27:49,508 --> 01:27:49,508
to add in order to turn a moral patient,

1647
01:27:49,508 --> 01:27:49,508
as it were, into a moral agent?

1648
01:27:37,496 --> 01:28:07,520
A being that can act in ways that are not

1649
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:07,520
just in accordance with certain moral

1650
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:07,520
principles or not in accordance with them

1651
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:07,520
but that can act because of certain moral

1652
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:07,520
considerations?

1653
01:27:49,508 --> 01:28:14,527
And is it necessary to be conscious in

1654
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:14,527
order to be a moral agent?

1655
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:32,545
And what I find interesting here is to

1656
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:32,545
explore to what extent accounts that look

1657
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:32,545
for necessary conditions for

1658
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:32,545
consciousness may also yield some

1659
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:32,545
necessary conditions for being a moral

1660
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:32,545
agent.

1661
01:28:15,528 --> 01:28:46,559
So even if consciousness may not be

1662
01:28:46,559 --> 01:28:46,559
required for being a moral agent maybe

1663
01:28:46,559 --> 01:28:46,559
there are certain necessary conditions

1664
01:28:46,559 --> 01:28:46,559
for consciousness that are also necessary

1665
01:28:46,559 --> 01:28:46,559
for moral agency.

1666
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:52,565
And this can then also be applied to

1667
01:28:52,565 --> 01:28:52,565
artificial systems in principle.

1668
01:28:46,559 --> 01:29:14,581
But of course, when it comes to

1669
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:14,581
artificial systems the interesting

1670
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:14,581
question is should we even create

1671
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:14,581
artificial systems that might be

1672
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:14,581
conscious or do we have a duty to create

1673
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:14,581
conscious artificial systems?

1674
01:28:53,566 --> 01:29:25,592
And my own position would be that in the

1675
01:29:25,592 --> 01:29:25,592
case of animals it's already happened.

1676
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:31,598
We may not know with certainty which

1677
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:31,598
animals are conscious and which are not.

1678
01:29:26,593 --> 01:29:41,608
But regardless of our epistemic situation

1679
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:41,608
regardless of what we know about these

1680
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:41,608
animals they are conscious or are not

1681
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:41,608
conscious.

1682
01:29:32,599 --> 01:29:44,611
They feel pain or don't feel pain.

1683
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:46,613
They suffer or they do not suffer.

1684
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:52,619
So the most we can do is to try and

1685
01:29:52,619 --> 01:29:52,619
minimize the suffering in existing

1686
01:29:52,619 --> 01:29:52,619
animals.

1687
01:29:46,613 --> 01:30:04,625
But when it comes to artificial systems

1688
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:04,625
we can at least at the moment say that

1689
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:04,625
most artificial systems are very unlikely

1690
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:04,625
to be conscious.

1691
01:29:52,619 --> 01:30:17,638
And we have the unique opportunity now to

1692
01:30:17,638 --> 01:30:17,638
really think hard about whether we want

1693
01:30:17,638 --> 01:30:17,638
to risk creating conscious artificial

1694
01:30:17,638 --> 01:30:17,638
systems.

1695
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:31,652
And I think we learned at least two

1696
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
things two interesting things in the past

1697
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
weeks or months about artificial systems

1698
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
artificial intelligence and

1699
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
consciousness.

1700
01:30:17,638 --> 01:30:37,658
And one is that AGI may not require

1701
01:30:37,658 --> 01:30:37,658
consciousness.

1702
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:41,662
I think most people believe that anyway.

1703
01:30:39,660 --> 01:30:52,673
But there was at least a possibility that

1704
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:52,673
AGI artificial general intelligence might

1705
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:52,673
require consciousness.

1706
01:30:41,662 --> 01:31:07,682
And what we've seen with the latest

1707
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
generations of language models is that

1708
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
they at least come very close to some

1709
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
form of artificial general intelligence

1710
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
and it's very unlikely that they're

1711
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:07,682
conscious.

1712
01:30:53,674 --> 01:31:25,700
And so this gives me at least some

1713
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:25,700
confidence that future, more

1714
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:25,700
sophisticated systems that will have a

1715
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:25,700
general form of intelligence will also

1716
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:25,700
not be conscious or unlikely to be

1717
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:25,700
conscious.

1718
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:49,724
And I think that's good because it will

1719
01:31:49,724 --> 01:31:49,724
not there will be no further incentive to

1720
01:31:49,724 --> 01:31:49,724
create artificial conscious systems in

1721
01:31:49,724 --> 01:31:49,724
order to achieve AGI, because it seems

1722
01:31:49,724 --> 01:31:49,724
that you can achieve that without

1723
01:31:49,724 --> 01:31:49,724
creating conscious systems.

1724
01:31:25,700 --> 01:32:21,750
Another thing which is a bit more

1725
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,750
concerning, maybe, is that we've also

1726
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,750
seen that it's very difficult to regulate

1727
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,750
developments in AI, and big companies can

1728
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,750
just decide to put systems on the market

1729
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,750
and make them available for everyone, and

1730
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,750
they will use them for whatever purposes

1731
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:21,750
without any regulation.

1732
01:31:49,724 --> 01:32:49,778
And so if it will, in the maybe not too

1733
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:49,778
far future, be feasible to create

1734
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:49,778
conscious systems, if we do gain a better

1735
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:49,778
understanding of what it would mean for

1736
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:49,778
an artificial system to be conscious or

1737
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:49,778
maybe how to create one, people will do

1738
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:49,778
it and it will be very difficult to

1739
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:49,778
regulate this.

1740
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:57,786
So this may be a problem for the not too

1741
01:32:57,786 --> 01:32:57,786
far future.

1742
01:32:49,778 --> 01:33:02,785
Daniel: A problem for guest stream number

1743
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:02,785
40.2.

1744
01:32:59,788 --> 01:33:04,787
Wanja: Yes.

1745
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:06,789
Daniel: Thank you, Wanja.

1746
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:07,790
Very insightful.

1747
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:11,794
Best of luck with your works and hope to

1748
01:33:11,794 --> 01:33:11,794
talk to you later.

1749
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:13,796
Wanja: Thank you, Daniel.

1750
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:14,797
It's been a pleasure.

1751
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:16,799
Daniel: Very well.

1752
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:19,802
Wanja: Bye, you.
