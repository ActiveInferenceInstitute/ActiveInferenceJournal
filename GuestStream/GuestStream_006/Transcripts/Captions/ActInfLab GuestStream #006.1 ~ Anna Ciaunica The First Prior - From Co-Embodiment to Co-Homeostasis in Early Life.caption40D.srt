1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:03,303
Hello.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,305
(Let me just just start.

3
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,640
Just 1/2.

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,879
So you introduce me first, right?

5
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,283
Yep. Just wanted to make sure that
it started, and it looks like we have so.)

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,354
Hello and welcome everyone to Active Lab.

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,291
This is Active Lab Gueststream number 6.1.

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,595
And we're really happy to be here
with Dr.

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,996
Anna Ciaunica.

10
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,065
So, Anna, thanks so much for joining.

11
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,299
We really appreciate it.

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,135
And we're looking forward to this talk.

13
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,269
Please just take it away.

14
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:40,006
And if anyone in the live chat
wants to ask a question,

15
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,709
I will relay those questions to you
at the end of this talk.

16
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,112
So thanks again for coming on the stream
and we're looking forward

17
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,049
to what you have to share.

18
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,285
Thank you so much, Danielle,
and thank you so much for having me.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:53,820
Today.

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,990
I'm going to present a paper
that we worked on the past,

21
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,492
past year and just came out.

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,063
But I'm going to start very briefly

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,732
with some of my background
as a researcher.

24
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,169
So I'm trained
as an armchair philosopher.

25
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,638
So I did in

26
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,739
philosophy.

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,908
So I did my thesis on physical exam
in Qualia,

28
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,810
you know, the famous Mind-Body Problem.

29
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,544
So, exactly.

30
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,778
So some physical stuff

31
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:22,282
connects with, you know, mental stuff
and gets, you know, done.

32
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,719
It gives my students to experience
in our conscious experiences

33
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,189
like the heart problem of consciousness.

34
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,861
And I was obsessed
when I was any respectable philosopher,

35
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,362
philosopher with,

36
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,231
you know,
the high problem of consciousness

37
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,999
and whether there is something special

38
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:44,104
about the subjectivity
of our conscious experiences.

39
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:44,804
Right.

40
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,140
Because I'm coming from Burgundy. Yeah.

41
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,342
I spent a lot of time trying to,
you know,

42
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,511
say that there is something about our

43
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,247
there is something special
about our subjective conscious experience

44
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,716
because there is something
what is, is like from a sort of taste,

45
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,152
a particular wine
and coming from Burgundy,

46
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,188
I had a lot of experience in that,
an example with that.

47
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:07,060
But more recently I decided to get off
to armchair philosophy

48
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,665
and I recently started to collaborate
with people from cognitive science.

49
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,235
I actually also have a master of science

50
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,806
in developmental psychology,
and I'm recently

51
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,476
collaborating with cognitive neuroscience
at UCL in London.

52
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:27,080
And my job there is to ask the question

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,351
to scientists like,
What do you mean by perception?

54
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,852
What do you mean by social light?

55
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,321
So give us some examples.

56
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:40,426
So one of the annoying questions
I really like to ask is,

57
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,764
um, you know,
whenever I go to a conference it is,

58
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:49,169
I ask people to look around them
in the audience and realize that

59
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,571
actually there are new infants
in the audience,

60
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,007
just adults.

61
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,976
And I interpolate them on that.

62
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,212
And they look at me say,

63
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,047
you know, I don't see the point.

64
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,515
Why is this important?

65
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:07,153
Well, it is important because I mean,
when we start to investigate in mind

66
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:11,291
bodies, we already have an adult
centric theoretical lens.

67
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,528
So this means that the way we look at the
phenomena is from a certain standpoint

68
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,631
and extend that to using innovative

69
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,537
inescapably is in adult one, right?

70
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,809
So this means that we may have a sort of
like implicit bias towards certain

71
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:33,112
phenomena, a certain way of understanding
phenomena that is somehow,

72
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,382
you know, adult centric.

73
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:41,221
And we need to be careful
if we want to understand how mind and

74
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,224
how mind
and brain work in the first place.

75
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,127
So given that my initial,

76
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,232
you know, entrance point into science
and philosophy

77
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,102
was like perceptual awareness,
like the fundamental point of contact

78
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,240
was subject with the reality
of the objects of the world.

79
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,811
So this is like the fundamental way
of actually structuring an experience.

80
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,546
So we have this access,

81
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,949
we have an experience of subject
with a latent subject over there.

82
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:14,887
And typically this is this is how self
consciousness is understood, like

83
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:19,058
perceptual awareness
when one perceives oneself

84
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:22,228
as self distinct
from the world in others. And

85
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,964
how is that linked to self-recognition
in the mirror of my sister?

86
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:29,068
So for instance, like is the famous
Rorschach test, if you recognize yourself

87
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,805
numerous as a toddler and you see that
the person in the mirror is a student,

88
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:37,410
you know, take your positive reviews
from your forehead.

89
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,680
And that's supposed to give you a sign

90
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,217
that you are basically self
conscious and self aware.

91
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:49,022
But what I want to say
is that maybe by endorsing that

92
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,559
and our central perspective,
we tacitly also endorse the sort of

93
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,363
like visual spatial perspective on what
perceptual awareness needs from them.

94
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,033
From the very beginning.

95
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:03,703
So while I was doing

96
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,839
my first post-doc on In Philosophy

97
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,777
on the sensory model basis of the self,

98
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,114
I also started to do amazing
cognitive science

99
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,751
and developmental psychology,
and I started to actually address

100
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,888
the question of receptor awareness
in a slightly different angle.

101
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:27,360
And instead of asking myself
what you know, what is perceptual

102
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,432
awareness sees or what self-conscious
senses of self-awareness is?

103
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:37,103
I decided to ask the question How we do?

104
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,239
We really get in contact with the world
at most primitive level?

105
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:44,110
How do our self-awareness experience
or perceptive awareness

106
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,582
or experiences more general emerge
from the food chain in the first place?

107
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:56,089
So they unfold the lifespan,
and if you take that perspective right,

108
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,359
then you realize that actually
from the very beginning

109
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:05,465
we have that that traditional access
subject here related with an object

110
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,469
that is somehow incorrect
because in real life,

111
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:14,006
the way we start actually perceiving
the world is with the subject here

112
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,310
that relates with another subject here
in a very proximal way.

113
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,144
Right.

114
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,514
So this means that we'll probably need
to shift the perspective in

115
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,884
sort of like taking like the tacit visual

116
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,954
spatial understanding
of what the perceptual awareness sees.

117
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:32,125
We need to actually expand
it and be more exclusive. And

118
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,362
you know, pay attention to the fact
that our first experience

119
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:41,834
are basically multisensory nature
and also proximal dispute and distance.

120
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,470
Like we basically before

121
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,307
we meet other people's minds,
we meet other people's body.

122
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,544
And why is this important
is because there is a huge literature

123
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:55,815
on, you know, what does it mean for what?

124
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,483
What is a minimal self.

125
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,820
And actually, this is important
for not only for philosophy.

126
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,088
So for

127
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,425
science and robotics and many,

128
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,161
many other fields,
because it is important to

129
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,131
quickly define what
but really what we really mean

130
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,168
by a self and by minimal self and

131
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,637
is a huge literature

132
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,107
in a form that from various tradition
that, you know,

133
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:25,144
talk about minimal self-consciousness,
minimal self core self

134
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,481
print, reflective sense of self, etc..

135
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,086
And I think if we switch the perspective
and take

136
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:39,492
and almost like a more inclusive
ecological and bottom up approach

137
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:44,464
and what the meaning of self is, we avoid
a fallacy, sento conceptual fallacy.

138
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,000
So for instance, I'm trying to depict
this fallacy with this picture here.

139
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:53,973
So suppose you want to find out what is
a minimal model of a self-organizing

140
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,276
system such as a plant or a human?

141
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,145
And then if you take if you notice

142
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,881
an adult centric perspective,
then you might tempted to basically

143
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,219
take whatever structure we have
as an adult plant or an adult human.

144
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,155
And squeeze those property.

145
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,557
We'll try to, you know, extremely extract

146
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,994
the excision or disrupt
the basic structure of those property.

147
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,764
And then to say, okay,
so this is how the minimalist self model

148
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:22,535
of that self-organizing system,
it's right like a squeeze the plant

149
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,237
and make it small.

150
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,539
I say this is what the minimal model is.

151
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,142
But the reality we know very well
that actually this is not how it looks.

152
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:30,676
Right.

153
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:35,581
So for instance, if you can see here
that plant that the minimal level

154
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,851
you know, the form, the stroke structure
here is very different

155
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,722
than the ones that you have later on
in, say, the adult life.

156
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,158
So this means that we need to,
if we want to extract,

157
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,562
you know, the basic skeleton of a certain

158
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,199
system, then we need to be

159
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,736
from an ecological
and dynamic perspective.

160
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,439
We need to take into account
all the intermediary forms

161
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,775
in order
to make sure that actually understand

162
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,344
what the plant is
and what the human instrument.

163
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,181
So this is a paper

164
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,451
that we, as I say,
that we recently published this year.

165
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:16,222
So we decided to really,
really go back to the beginning

166
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,926
and to question
more carefully just ideas like

167
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,830
embodiment and cognitive stages.

168
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,832
And I want to start with a disclaimer

169
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,968
because this is very much work
in progress

170
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,737
and there is a lot of work to do
because this is, as I said, it's

171
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,607
a slow it's a shift in perspective.

172
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,510
So there is a lot of work
to do actually to shake a bit.

173
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,747
You know,
the entrance points to the problem

174
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,784
and this is not an active inference
account

175
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:49,422
of embodiment and analysis, yet
this is a work in progress.

176
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:54,860
I'm doing this on different levels from,
you know, metabolism to,

177
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,131
you know, more high level level

178
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,935
like self-awareness.

179
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:07,006
But because I need to start somewhere,
we decided with my collaborators

180
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,076
basically
to use active inference approach

181
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,677
some of the insights

182
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,680
of the active inference approach
to bring the fundamental set of core

183
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,017
embodiment of homeostasis
under the spotlight.

184
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,252
Because this is something
that we need to do

185
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,789
because it's like it's not mainstream.

186
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,727
So we decided to okay,
so let's take the sort of like meta level

187
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,163
approach, use active
in, for instance, and show that if you,

188
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:36,302
if you like the active in principle,
which is to endorse it, then you

189
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:40,272
you need to take into consideration
this kind of like very low level

190
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,643
core embodiment of approach
from the, from the very beginning.

191
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:48,180
So this is what we're going to do
in this paper.

192
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,816
So I'm going to start very briefly
with the background

193
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,052
and predict a processing framework.

194
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,689
I'm sure that you are all familiar
with this,

195
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,692
so I'm not going to spend a lot of time
explaining it,

196
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,028
but I just have two slides

197
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,396
we need to use

198
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,466
because I need to make sure
that if someone is looking watching this

199
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:11,504
and doesn't know what active influencer
pricing is, we are on the same page.

200
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,675
And then I'm going to spend actually
more time and trying to develop the

201
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:18,844
just and

202
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,113
motivate this need to actually take

203
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,917
a bottom up developmental
take on what perceptual awareness

204
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:29,321
and experiences in the first place
and define the notion of embodiment.

205
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,825
You see the services and communal spaces,
homeostasis,

206
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,828
but again,
I'm going to define them through this

207
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,032
bottom up developmental lens

208
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:45,404
and I'm going to end
with some hand-waving work in progress.

209
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:50,443
And I'm very open to suggestions
because as I said, this is like very much

210
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:55,114
an open question and we need
there is a lot more work to do.

211
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:56,782
Okay.

212
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,719
So I'm, I, I believe

213
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,755
if you are all familiar
with the predictive processing framework.

214
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:06,358
So the basic idea is that our brains
is not a passive sponge

215
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:11,530
that automatically somehow
passively receives information

216
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,967
and somehow, you know,
keeps the motor output.

217
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:19,472
But rather we should conceive the brain
as a sort of like active system

218
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:23,876
that anticipates the next sensory
input on the basis of prior inputs,

219
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:30,149
such as it actually can map the world
in a more accurate way.

220
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,887
This idea
very nicely fits with some previous idea

221
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:38,524
that having been developed in parallel
by embodied cognition,

222
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,227
a paradigm approach in cognitive science,

223
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,363
but they basically just order
like very long colleagues,

224
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:50,069
basically outlining this idea
that cognition should be understood

225
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:52,905
as nothing but

226
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,407
the world
and the mind on the basis of history

227
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:59,145
prior to a function
that the world performs in, in the sense

228
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:03,482
like we cannot really understand
cognition in isolation from the body

229
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,285
and we cannot understand
a body in isolation from the environment,

230
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,189
and we cannot understand either
the body or to know the relation

231
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,759
between the mind body and the environment
without take into account

232
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,096
the history of those like the connection
from the in the first place.

233
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,432
Right, because it's not static phenomena,
but it's more like dynamic

234
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:23,569
and follows over time
because this is what life is, right?

235
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,273
So this means that our ongoing
perception, cognitive processes

236
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:31,043
in action are influences
by prior events and prior experiences.

237
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,812
So this is something that, you know,

238
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,015
body cognition approaches and

239
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:40,486
predictive approaches somehow agree
on a different level of explanation.

240
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,356
But the basic idea is that so
you cannot consider this phenomenon

241
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:49,228
in isolation, isolation
from past events, right?

242
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:53,432
So designing
so another I think common ground

243
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:57,002
is this idea
that humans are biological agents

244
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:01,273
that emerge as like proactive survival
enable prediction machines,

245
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:05,611
which are strived to reduce uncertainty
within a highly volatile environment.

246
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,548
So basically trying to make sense
environment out there because, you know,

247
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,617
the world is bigger than our heads

248
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,553
and we try to find a way
to actually navigate this bigger world,

249
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,190
which is highly unpredictable and
partitioning, potentially threatening.

250
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,161
So one idea is that in order

251
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,498
to keep track of the survival
and reproduction, relevant body and world

252
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:30,302
information, our brain solves
that problem of uncertainty

253
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,138
by generating self and world models.

254
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,275
And it does so by certain statistical

255
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,812
patterns of information
from its own body and world interaction.

256
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,481
And there is a mathematical

257
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,618
story behind it is I'm
not a mathematician, I'm a philosopher.

258
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,088
You know,
leave that to the mathematician.

259
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,358
But I think what I need as a philosopher,

260
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,428
I need just this idea that

261
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,665
you know, our ongoing perception,
cognition and action and process

262
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,768
through the lens of prior self and work
related information.

263
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,204
So this is what I need information.

264
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,506
I need to only see it.

265
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:12,344
Now, if this is true,
then this means that

266
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,481
it becomes crucial to look at

267
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:19,551
how this experience in action perception
gets off the ground from the outset.

268
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,221
Right, because we need that balance
to be accurate, right?

269
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,357
In a dynamic and ecological way.

270
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,860
One basic, basic and overlooked aspect

271
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,630
of our embodied and predictive process

272
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,534
seeing approaches in both philosophy
and cognitive neuroscience,

273
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:40,806
is that brains in mind and human bodies
first develop within another human body.

274
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,575
And this is important point,

275
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,444
because crucially, while not

276
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,114
all humans will have the experience
of being pregnant or carrying a baby,

277
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,985
the experience of being caring, growing
within another person is universal.

278
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:57,256
So this is something that all humans
are concerned with, right?

279
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,527
So and this is something
important as well

280
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:06,532
because way before we meet
other people's minds, we literally need

281
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,102
to logically meet other people's bodies.

282
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,805
And it's something I developed
already, too.

283
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:17,910
So in 2017, when I looked at empathy
in basic for shared experience.

284
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,611
But the idea is to say it's like,

285
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,581
okay, so if we really want to understand
the relation between

286
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,151
mind, body and how,

287
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,489
you know, embodied creature
relate with other with others and well,

288
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,927
we really need to go back to this basic
idea that yeah,

289
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,664
before we meet other people's minds,
we literally meet other people's body.

290
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,633
So there is a

291
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,503
lot of work, previous work
that show that looked at

292
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,107
the homeostatic and body mechanism
operating

293
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,143
at early stage of developing in infancy.

294
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,147
So post about right

295
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,785
we decided to take a step further

296
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:05,257
and to focus on pregnancy
because this is a universal case.

297
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:10,562
Remember I I'd like to emphasize this
because typically, you know,

298
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,166
when people hear the word pregnancy,
so okay, this is a woman's stuff

299
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,137
because I mean, certain certain people,

300
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,739
certain person
give you a pregnancy, the other don't.

301
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:26,912
So but if you take the perspective,
the other perspective, then you realize

302
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:31,083
that actually all segments are concerned
with this experience, right?

303
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,654
Where to invigorate, to organize,
literally grasp and grip into each other

304
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,692
and contrary to the common view that

305
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:45,497
if a fetus is passively contained
and so is, you know,

306
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,768
sometimes is put is like solipsistic,
is trapped within the solitude,

307
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,203
in the silence of the womb,

308
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,305
we would present

309
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:58,677
evidence showing that
actually there is a lot of good nondairy.

310
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,747
Indeed there is an active
in bidirectional correlation

311
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,216
between the two living bodies
and living organism

312
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,922
and we need to start
with some basic definitions.

313
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,125
So first of all, I'm
going to talk a lot about embodiment,

314
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:17,162
but we need to make clear what exactly
we mean by embodiment in the first place.

315
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,600
There is a lot of work already
in the literature underlying the relation

316
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,070
between the body and self,
and I recommend this like

317
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:30,476
very recent review by Kim and colleagues
comes from your note of love

318
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,412
to have a rich overview of

319
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,783
the relation between the body, self
and self-awareness.

320
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,020
But here I'm going to use my analytical

321
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,791
philosophy card
and I'm going to define body

322
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,629
mind in its minimal form
to refer to the instantiation of bodily

323
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,899
properties by a given individual,
in our case, the human.

324
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,669
Now the well, it's
all talk about embodiment Kandace

325
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,540
conceptually ontologically linked
to talk about embodied beings

326
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,677
and and and they bodily properties.

327
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:10,415
Now the key starting idea here is
that brain in mind is

328
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,852
said is like fatigue and body cognition
approaching us for more recently

329
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,388
like public policy
and active inference approach.

330
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:20,959
It's like they all seem to agree that
the human brain and minds don't emerge

331
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,197
in a vacuum, but develop and evolve
as a system dedicated to controlling.

332
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,200
And so the organic survival
and reproduction.

333
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,403
So basically
if you take the classical mind body

334
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:36,708
instead of collect perceiving the body
as sort of like a vehicle or car that's,

335
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,345
you know, it's there to support
and fuel the mind.

336
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,347
Actually,
you should consider the other way

337
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,285
around, namely that the mind has evolved
to actually serve

338
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:51,123
the needs of a organism, right of a body

339
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,459
of your human body.

340
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,829
So you basically shift the perspective
which not which is actually

341
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,899
which comes first,
which one is actually more important. So

342
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,304
crucially, however,
if so, if we endorses perspective

343
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,373
and we agree with this shift,
then we need to consider the fact

344
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,109
that human bodies
do not imagine of outcome either.

345
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:11,543
Right?

346
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:16,982
So human body is basically emerge
and develop within another human body.

347
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,453
So this means that we need to adopt
an extended notion of simple

348
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:25,157
what it means to reflect
this fundamental body within a body case,

349
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:29,127
which, again, I'm going to stress again
and again, this is a universal right.

350
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:34,333
It's not just like a part
of the population.

351
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,570
So but what does it mean to say
that the two agents are embodied?

352
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:40,439
Well,

353
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,341
in biological terms?

354
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,311
This means that to see later,
very shortly is that the regular

355
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,582
nation of the two agents states
and particularly

356
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,284
they need to maintain that

357
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,020
physiological stability,
despite the fact that an

358
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,458
and unpredictable environment is actively
negotiated between the two organisms

359
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,929
that share for a given amount of time,
typically nine months, but the shorter,

360
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:08,166
a bit longer common and bodily
and environmental resources.

361
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:08,834
Right.

362
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,637
And I need to give you an example.

363
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,974
So what exactly I mean by embodiment,
because I think this is a key point.

364
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,878
So I'm going to ask you to walk with me
into a thought experiment

365
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,281
because I'm a philosopher,
so I'm going to present you

366
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,749
with this little experiment.

367
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,451
So you imagine you

368
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,888
you have a friend and you, you know,

369
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,558
you, you, you have to perform a sequence
show, right?

370
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,829
And with your friend and you have to
share this pair of trousers here.

371
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:42,034
So your friend puts you
his left leg in the left

372
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:46,238
part of the shirt of his trousers,
and you put the right leg

373
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:51,043
on the right part of the problem services
and you need to coordinate your walking

374
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,713
such as actually you can walk as fast
as you can to actually reach a target

375
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,614
right on opposite

376
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,821
no. Suppose that your friend's

377
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,991
as hitting his toe against rock stumbles

378
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,027
and falls and experience there by fear.

379
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,631
So with this happening in his body,
in his organism.

380
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,198
Right?

381
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,301
So this means that maybe your friend

382
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,004
is going to and train you in

383
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:23,375
or in which case
you can say that the two bodies,

384
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:27,045
I mean, you are the friend causally,
but you share the state of like

385
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,480
falling to get.

386
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:33,218
And you can also see that well
because this kind of like negative event,

387
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:38,623
your frames, your friend is kind of like
experiencing fear and you also

388
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,361
experiencing fear as well while falling.

389
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,195
Right?

390
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,898
So you share that state of

391
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:47,733
fear.

392
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,936
Not crucially, however, that

393
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,372
this is not necessarily so.

394
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,808
So suppose, for instance, that you know,
your friend is

395
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,011
is a master yoga teacher.

396
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:00,679
Right.

397
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,448
And while you are fully your

398
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,651
your friend is somehow manage
to keep the balance

399
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:11,123
and you know what the you know,
the tissue of the trousers thing of like,

400
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,261
you know, destroyed and, you know, one
standing at other one is falling, right?

401
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,229
It's not necessarily.

402
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,798
So you can imagine a case
that actually this is happening.

403
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,968
And also imagine a case in which,
let's say, well,

404
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,771
why your friend is falling
and experiencing fear.

405
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,039
You find entire situation or treatment

406
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,910
20% of experiencing
fear, your experience, amusement trait.

407
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,112
So the two emotional states are not

408
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,549
shared, necessarily shared.

409
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:42,788
So your friend experiencing fear, your
experience, let's say amusement, right?

410
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:47,325
So that's one example of like what
we can understand by sharing a state.

411
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,062
Now let us go back to the case
of pregnancy.

412
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:51,563
Right?

413
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,665
Not that the case of pregnancy
is very different,

414
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,403
because if you take exactly
the same example and say

415
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:03,341
that the mother is like some stems
into an opinion or something and,

416
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,846
you know, false, then there is no way
in which the fetus can say,

417
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,149
wait a minute, actually, I'm not
I don't like the situation.

418
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:11,917
I don't want to fall.

419
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,418
I don't want to fix fear

420
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,021
and I don't want to experience negative,
you know, emotion.

421
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,657
I'm going to sit stay put here you go.

422
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,791
It's all right.

423
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,295
So this means that actually
there is a way in which the two states

424
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:28,433
are the two organisms are necessarily
linked, such as the body itself.

425
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,369
Regulatory processes of one
organ is necessarily

426
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,606
is linked to the other one.

427
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,311
So it is important to distinguish
the case of pregnancy from the case

428
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,281
of two bodies like contingently happen
to share a state.

429
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:43,949
Right.

430
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:48,820
And we can this doesn't find a notion
of like embodiment and saying that two

431
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,389
or more if you have twins or

432
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,593
more than 3 to 2

433
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:58,563
of kids are quite voided
and a strong case if they are bound to

434
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:03,068
share bodily and environmental resources
for a set time period, typically

435
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:07,973
nine months for survival purposes.

436
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,708
Not that pregnancy is not the only case

437
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:13,912
where we can find instances of disciples
like stalk strong embodiments.

438
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,181
Like for instance, this is siblings,

439
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,050
but we decided to focus
on the case of pregnancy

440
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,986
because as I said,
this is universal case.

441
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,889
All humans have,
you know, experienced this.

442
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:27,692
So there is already work
on the fascinating

443
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:32,664
phenomenology of shared embodiment,
and I highly recommend to to read it

444
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,699
in what follows.

445
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,635
Basically, I'm going to very quickly

446
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,872
go to start with a very basic

447
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,642
level, actually what is happening.

448
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,746
God, you know, from single cell
going up that organism

449
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,683
and that kind of like shared, shared
embodiment.

450
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,121
Again, this is the fascinating, a huge
literature when you think about it.

451
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,590
We said was like this
tiny little round thing

452
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,560
with another person body
and then we become ourselves.

453
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,397
So again, I'm going to be very quick

454
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,899
and very sketchy on this like fascinating

455
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,703
process, but then I'll try to flag,

456
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,906
you know, the two crucial steps

457
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,275
and a crucial stages, right?

458
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,313
So the first stage
is the process of implantation.

459
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,516
So basically when there is a dialog
between the fertilized

460
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,319
egg and demand the body.

461
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,153
Right.

462
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:32,057
And this is actually
this is the crucial step of a pregnancy,

463
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,193
the successful pregnancy,
because, for instance,

464
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,630
most of the miscarriages
happen during this step.

465
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:40,765
This is a

466
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,970
like a sort of like negotiation process
going on between the two organisms saying

467
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:51,543
and like any negotiation
that things can go okay or can go wrong.

468
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,243
Right.

469
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:57,048
So this means that both the plasticity
in the baby and the endometrial tissues,

470
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:01,019
they need to actively regulate
gene expression, transcription factor

471
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,220
signaling pathways,

472
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,857
inhibiting factors and growth factors
doing that implantation process.

473
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,528
This is highly complex process
and very fragile and very delicate.

474
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,798
If something goes
wrong, can go to miscarriage or

475
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,804
did they do wrong and pull the lead

476
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,708
this stage the maternal

477
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,545
by the literally cells modify
some of through differentiation

478
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:31,116
into specific type
that support implantation right

479
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,886
so the key idea here is the embryo
and the mother's body need to coordinate

480
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:39,090
with these cells within that
very tiny implantation window.

481
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,293
Right now,
if this process, let's suppose,

482
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:46,031
is like successful,
then the coordination goes

483
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:51,336
to the next step
between week seven and 13, most movements

484
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,874
that involve self-organization can start.

485
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,277
So and and a self-organization,

486
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:05,417
interestingly, involves movement,
which is actually very important

487
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:09,187
because especially
for the active inference community,

488
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,524
because as you say, as you can see,
actually movement

489
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,529
is present very early on in our lives.

490
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,732
So these movements are initiated

491
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,867
from the so called

492
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,672
pattern generator
in the early spinal cord,

493
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:32,711
which produces around eight very abrupt
startles or the entire fetal body.

494
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,545
Quite

495
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,782
importantly, not that this photos
which are somehow automatic, right?

496
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,751
We think of like a sort of
like heartbeat.

497
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,454
I just think, you know, automatically

498
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,557
provide the minimal basis
for the most basic occasion,

499
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,259
sensory feedback
because in doing so, for instance

500
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,432
and my started to phase
in that sort of thing how my hand,

501
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:58,269
you know, would magically
or unwilling to touch my face.

502
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:02,707
And then I received a slight sensory
feedback on my face from my right hand

503
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,511
where my leg might change its position,
be flex or extended or both.

504
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:07,512
So this means that

505
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,815
I may have some meaningless sensory
feedback at this stage that that full

506
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,785
the possibility
to respond and adapt to this movement.

507
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:17,088
This means that self-organization
in fetal movement initiate

508
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:21,025
as a biomechanical process
that progressively builds sensory

509
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,560
and regulatory capacities.

510
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:26,131
So for example, as
is said, by being stimulated by startle,

511
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,800
the fetus perceives
that the hand is movable

512
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,237
and that touching the face
rather than the uterine wall with

513
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,341
and might feel different
because I'm more sensitive here

514
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,776
in the face that actually I can't

515
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,312
I can feel my I can feel my fingertips
if I touch to you doing more.

516
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,382
But if I touch my own face here,

517
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,117
have a double touch.

518
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:46,651
Right.

519
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:48,219
Okay.

520
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:53,525
So with this in hand, we can go further
to this notion of homeostasis.

521
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,560
And bear in mind
that this is all happening.

522
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,096
So we have a developing body
within another body

523
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,033
now homeostasis typically refers to
the organism

524
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,136
need to maintain and stable
organic internal environment

525
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:08,373
despite fluctuating external environments
right

526
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:12,410
and human university regulation
typically entails using feedback

527
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,214
control mechanism to keep the senses
viable of that internal environment

528
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,483
within the rages competition
for survival.

529
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,553
In this case, for compatible
human survival.

530
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,956
Now it is one established
that this control involves

531
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,992
automatic actions like motor reflexes,

532
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,062
endocrine logical autonomic processes

533
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:33,798
that are

534
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,268
driven by the feedback inputs
and the resulting prediction error,

535
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,605
which is the discrepancy
between the expected body state

536
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:45,577
at the extent set point
and its actual level

537
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,246
as signal by the sensory
inputs from the body.

538
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:54,586
And as early as 1929
it has been proposed.

539
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:58,690
That may be the control body
homeostasis closest to the primary

540
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,160
aim of the brain function right.

541
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,231
And this is, again, this underlying
assumption is that the fundamental drive

542
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,367
towards like self-preservation
to take this body to self

543
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:15,006
is essentially just restraint of acting
within the body's visual states.

544
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:15,440
Right.

545
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,478
So it has been classically proposed
to define the homeostatic symptoms

546
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,981
and expectation,
the means of prior beliefs

547
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,717
about the states
the body should inhibit, inhabit

548
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:30,088
and homeostatic range
as the variance of this operate. But

549
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:36,594
now going back to our case, right,
so let's go back to the two,

550
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,597
you know, just for one
or the primitive level, so many years,

551
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,634
it has been assumed that a fetus
has no metabolism of its own.

552
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:43,501
Right

553
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,272
now is nowadays is well established
that actually the placenta

554
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:50,508
in the fetal liver working and then

555
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,111
as a sort of coordinating
multi organ system to provide

556
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,347
in the so nutrients
serving the fetal growth.

557
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,117
And this is important because you know

558
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:02,887
if you talk about homeostasis,
we need to talk about metabolism, right.

559
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,390
Because that, of course,
is the most important fuel for

560
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,494
fetal metabolism
and ultimately for human states.

561
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,763
So this means that maintaining
an optimal balance

562
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,733
as a continuous supplies of nutrients
from the mother to the fetus is critical

563
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,603
from the development
and from the fetal status

564
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,308
standpoint is basically critical
for maintaining his own

565
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,679
homeostatic balance.

566
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,783
Now note that the fetus may be able
to control and save some energy

567
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,652
to some extent through many complex
and dynamic processes.

568
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:39,524
But importantly, however it is
oversupplied on undersupply of nutrients

569
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:44,829
by the mother, right, which are process
controlled by the pregnant person

570
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:49,867
that can permanently program
the fetal metabolism adversely.

571
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:50,568
Right.

572
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,603
So this means that

573
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:57,141
the way the mother

574
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,477
handles her own

575
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,013
metabolic processes significantly

576
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,750
impacts the way, you know, the baby's is,

577
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:10,588
you know, has his self-regulatory
process maintained

578
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,459
and there is accumulating evidence
that there is a direct link

579
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:18,062
between mothers adverse bodily
and mental health states like depression

580
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:23,001
and anxiety during pregnancy and child
medium mental and physical development.

581
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,904
But this is this is not only for
this is valid, not only for the negative

582
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:30,508
states, but also more like neutral states
such as food preferences

583
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:34,812
and flavors that are passed on
from the mother to the infant.

584
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,415
So there is a strong, strong
codependent step

585
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:45,123
now that the key entered
into the intermediate conclusion

586
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,126
at this stage is that emerging
self-organizing organism,

587
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,228
human organism,

588
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:53,264
is not only self centric,
but also crucially embodied.

589
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:57,702
It could, depending upon homeostatic
processes within do the environment.

590
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:58,503
Right.

591
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:02,640
So does the basic thesis up to know.

592
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,511
Now we need to take this a step further
because

593
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,314
we need to talk about
also action, anticipation

594
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,784
and not just like our prediction
or perception.

595
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,788
So we saw up to now

596
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:21,793
that homeostatic regulation requires
some order that many people's

597
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,695
inference, perception
and prediction absence selection.

598
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:28,499
Importantly, however, the brain
initiate regulatory responses

599
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:32,303
prior to luminosity cultivation providing
that can be anticipated.

600
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:35,373
So this means that you basically act
to go

601
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,375
to the fridge to seek food

602
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,612
because you are hungry,
but actually are not.

603
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,348
You're not to wait.

604
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:49,320
You're not waiting for the starvation
to happen to actually go to the fridge.

605
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,588
You do it away before.

606
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,156
That actually is going to happen.

607
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,791
So you anticipate that distinct.

608
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:55,426
So this means

609
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:59,197
that high level that enable perspective
control are leveraged with

610
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,635
two essential components like inference
and prediction, which I think is

611
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:09,707
and thesis which is defined
as anticipatory, almost control.

612
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,943
Basically you take action to the world

613
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,080
because you need to regulate your,
you know, almost static balance.

614
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,050
But you are doing this by taking action
into into the world.

615
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,188
And importantly, you're doing this
by anticipating that state.

616
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,091
You don't really expect
to be on the age of like,

617
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,128
you know, dying from starvation
to actually take that action

618
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:35,833
if you are optimal,
you know, surviving organism.

619
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,171
So this means that the process
whereby the agent selects action

620
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,975
that will most probably bring
about the desire since entries,

621
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,578
while explicitly
or implicitly more defined a true cause,

622
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,681
the structure of the environment
such as the guarantee direct rains

623
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:54,285
of those inputs over multiple times.

624
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,388
So this means that I can act differently
in different environments.

625
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,159
I can go to the fridge if I'm hungry,

626
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,296
but if I'm the desert,
I could, you know, if

627
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,366
if I expect to see a fridge and,

628
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,369
you know, I don't see it, then I'm

629
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,071
going to probably die.

630
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,307
Instead of looking for food
I should probably look for,

631
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,342
I don't know, banana tree or coconut
tree. Right.

632
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,913
So the environment defines
what type of expectation

633
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,149
you should have in a particular case.

634
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,852
Now, there are two points
that are important here.

635
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,421
Not that

636
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,457
in the individual organism, homeostatic,

637
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,961
I mean, we can perceptually distinguish
from acidic processes,

638
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,831
from anesthetic processes,
but in real life those go hand in

639
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,801
hand, in hand.

640
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,337
Right
to that are two phases of the same coin.

641
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:50,508
This is because we humans,
we are not static, isolated creatures,

642
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,578
we are dynamic bees depending on the rich
environment, environmental resources,

643
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:57,281
and we depend upon social interaction
to achieve survival in production.

644
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,152
And you can read like the basic example
that I really like is the like

645
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,220
breathing. Like

646
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,388
it's a perception.

647
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,691
So it's an open ended process, right?

648
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,995
We are constantly exchanging information
with environment via

649
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,931
EEG. Right?

650
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:17,201
And this is a dynamic process
because my body moves

651
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,972
right to
my automatic cage is moving all the time.

652
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,507
And this means that those type
of processes like

653
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,346
to study processes in homeostatic
processes, even though we can

654
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,483
conceptually distinguish in reality
they actually occur.

655
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:38,089
This means that perception and action,
homeostatic and anesthetic regulation are

656
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:42,760
copied, strongly copied in a dynamic loop
that keeps the organism permeable

657
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,598
to and connected with this surroundings
for better and for worse.

658
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:51,669
Because when I breathing,
I can take the air, right?

659
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,772
That is necessary oxygen for my survival.

660
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,442
But I can also continue
taking the coronavirus, you know,

661
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:02,613
and you know, eventually
you potentially die, right?

662
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:08,386
So we are open system for better
and for worse in that sense, right?

663
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:12,623
The second point is that going
back to our case here is in pregnancy,

664
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,260
is that self-regulatory
architecture is multilayered.

665
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,530
This is an interesting point here. Right?

666
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,966
It's like it's already
complicated for individual.

667
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,701
But imagine we're actually
two individuals

668
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,770
that are actually grouped
into each other. Right.

669
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,640
Because the babies regulatory processes
are complete with the mother's

670
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,741
homeostatic analysis

671
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,843
processes.

672
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,112
And this is achieved
mainly through the placenta,

673
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:40,318
which is an ephemeral
and intermediary organ, and that enables

674
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,020
vital and biological exchanges
between the two bodies.

675
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:47,158
And, for example, it allows the infant
to breathe despite a lack of proper,

676
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,161
proper lung regulation
and ensure that the infant is

677
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,064
fed despite lacking
proper eating effectors.

678
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:57,134
Not again,
that placenta is the relational

679
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,970
excellence,
but is also a universal organ.

680
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:04,508
Typically, people associate placenta
with like the female body

681
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,347
and a certain type of population
to do the certain type of persons.

682
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,616
But we all have cues

683
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,086
all humans have used successfully

684
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,556
this organ in order to survive.

685
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,591
And you know, I don't know do philosophy,

686
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,160
cognitive science and active influence
later on in their lives.

687
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,694
Right.

688
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:28,099
And this is important
to keep in mind now. And

689
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,270
I'm right, this means that the dynamic
and complex systems

690
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,273
such as the human body
needs to be able to play a double game

691
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,477
in order to survive
and potentially reproduce.

692
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:43,781
It has to successfully maintain
sensory stays within a certain

693
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:48,285
physiological bounds,
but it also has to flexibly change

694
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,821
the state in order to adapt
to constantly changing environment.

695
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,393
So if we look at the human body
through through this dynamic lens

696
00:39:55,393 --> 00:40:00,030
and become obvious that what happens in
between the organism, its environment,

697
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,868
I mean the boundaries between it to play
a key role in making sure this game

698
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:08,773
is correctly played and flexible
to actually maintained organs for life.

699
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,610
So this means that we need to find
a Christian

700
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,679
critical notional boundary
or in-between, right?

701
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,548
We need a new perceptual toolbox

702
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,084
in order to make sure
that we get that process correctly.

703
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,152
Right.

704
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,921
And this is something I'm currently
working on with some collaborators

705
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,058
and some some of you probably know that,
you know,

706
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,695
the notion of a macro blanket,
a macro blanket being

707
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:38,035
advocate as a potential candidate
to a promising way of conceptualizing

708
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,172
this key notion of the boundary,
the medium between the two.

709
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,340
And again, this is like

710
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,345
a work in progress and there is like
a lot of work to be done that's say.

711
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,849
But for all this talk, I,
I really need to

712
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:56,821
retain is like very simple idea
that homeostatic

713
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:01,592
and anticipatory self regulation depends
not only on the body states,

714
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,995
but also on the external environment

715
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,598
and more crucially on the relation
between the two.

716
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,002
So we can define cool homeostasis

717
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:16,474
by direction process of coagulation
that happens in between to combat it.

718
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,511
Organism and homeostasis involves
self regulation.

719
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:24,348
It's through others couplet
and homeostatic and prosthetic loopy

720
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,884
states not knowing

721
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:28,953
that.

722
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,721
And this is something that we had.

723
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,791
You know what could be with
a few of us on our paper.

724
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,192
And they were kind of like, right.

725
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:38,929
Bracing clarification on this point,
because it's important to bear in mind

726
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:42,099
that if we talk about
by direction, process doesn't mean

727
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,336
there is a symmetry

728
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,572
or absence of conflict
when the country actually

729
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:52,443
things can go wrong, right.

730
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,445
In the sense like

731
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,216
it can be that, you know, one

732
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:05,456
one agent actually takes the balance
too much in one sense, then other.

733
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,692
And to give you an example,
like what exactly what I mean by that.

734
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,663
So think of the highway, right?

735
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,200
So you can have it that's that's a

736
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,203
by direction
highway traveling from north to south.

737
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,539
Let's say
that you have typically more cars

738
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,776
coming from not to the south and mean
from the mother to the infants.

739
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,880
But you have these can have one single
car traveling from south to north

740
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:33,684
and that car is like
you know, I don't know, carrying bomb

741
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,888
and actually that's the relevant right
it's not the quantity

742
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,957
that matters is actually
the quality of the information

743
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,126
that is carried
between the two organisms.

744
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:46,030
You actually have many, many cases
and basically during the pregnancy,

745
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,567
I know a mother's a pregnant person
develop

746
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:54,905
diabetes or other immuno,

747
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,908
you know, logical disorders, right.

748
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,146
So it is not necessarily
a straightforward process,

749
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,950
as I said, and emphasizing this
this is a crucial negotiation

750
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,251
between the two organism.

751
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,654
It's a dynamic, open ended process
that can go okay,

752
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,058
but can also create a wrong.

753
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:18,162
Now, the big claim to radical claim
you want to make

754
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:22,967
is that given the necessary universal
keyboard in sustaining the human body

755
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:27,471
so regulation and self-organizing
processes from the outset

756
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:31,141
that early on this regulation
should be fundamentally conceived as core

757
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:35,112
regulation
and school Newman's thesis. Now

758
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,749
in a further
work we want to develop this idea

759
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,086
of when exactly

760
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,022
and how the brain

761
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,225
starts to be in the southern world
model in the womb.

762
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:49,059
Right.

763
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,695
Because it's like it's a key

764
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,531
question from for the,

765
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,369
you know, predictive processing
framework and active inference community.

766
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,705
So how exactly this is happening,
when exactly this is happening,

767
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,775
this is highly speculative

768
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:08,412
and is very much a work in progress.

769
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:12,516
So it's an open question whether
the fetus is able to generate a self

770
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:16,053
and while models
and if yes, at what stage of development.

771
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,957
Some people argue that this is
maybe be possible only after the basic

772
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,993
telomere cortical connection
are established in the fetal brain.

773
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:27,464
Around 10 to 20 weeks of gestation.

774
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:28,532
This is because

775
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,537
the main reason is because

776
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,442
after this time point, sensory
information can be transferred

777
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,444
to the fetal brain

778
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,047
before they establish of this term

779
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,684
of cortical connection to fetus just acts
honorifics automatic mode.

780
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,521
However, the people

781
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,056
argue that through the central

782
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,892
thought in generating the seemingly code

783
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:58,028
like spirit of movement, they also

784
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,733
can generate a sort of like sensory
motor coupling

785
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,137
and also very basic
primitive sensory experiences.

786
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:11,041
Again, this is like an open question

787
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,946
and this is something that I address
in a preprint.

788
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,683
Currently under review,
a two of my collaborator,

789
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,619
Adam Safran and Jonathan Delafield. But

790
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,758
we look at how exactly
self-awareness. No.

791
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:32,563
So how exactly the fact
that our first experiences are coy,

792
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,700
loaded impact
may impact the way we understand

793
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,537
current theories
of conscious experiences in general

794
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,407
and what

795
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:47,878
our provocative take is
that, you know, no consciousness study

796
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,881
focused too much on visual experiences

797
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,451
and a visual spatial way perspective.

798
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:57,821
And we're seeing a tacit, adult
centric and visual spatial perspective.

799
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:02,726
And we might say that perhaps conscious
experience are not all about seeing red

800
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:06,196
happens to, you know, a famous example.

801
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,533
So wider
implication of switching the perspective,

802
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,568
you know, from this
like what we understand

803
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:16,573
by minimum self and minimal of self
models, you know, from endorsing

804
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:20,611
more ecological bottom up perspective
other than adult centric

805
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,481
vision based perspective.

806
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:27,851
Again, this is very much a work in
progress, something that we are working

807
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:29,787
on right now.

808
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:33,357
But, you know,
just like bullet bullet points,

809
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:37,060
if we switch to perspective,
then we need to question

810
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,130
the individualistic and solipsistic
approach of understanding

811
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,599
the perceptual language
in the ancient environment.

812
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:47,037
We also need to question that US centric
species are sort of like fully fledged

813
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,175
emerging individuals
like, you know, Athena, the Greek

814
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,411
goddess
Athena coming us from the zoo head.

815
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:58,549
So rather than humans emerge
within other humans

816
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,984
and develop through close interaction
with other humans,

817
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,388
we also need to question
the idea of a self-awareness

818
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:07,624
for me myself developing
independently of other self citizens,

819
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:12,129
because as I hopefully,
you know, confused you, that we basically

820
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,465
are ontologically independent
from the others from the very beginning

821
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,368
at a very basic biological level

822
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,638
and then the question we need
to also question the idea of a perception

823
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:24,975
being a solitary, distant neighbor
like single redouble,

824
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:30,447
but rather we need to, you know,
see a perception as an active interaction

825
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:34,618
of active engagement with environment
like voice touching human being

826
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,755
or coupling down to receptive
like signaling like the breathing.

827
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:43,627
So the way I feel that inside my body
to where I take the air from outside

828
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,531
and also important
that perception of that perception,

829
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:51,335
that perception comes
before the seeing the red apple.

830
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,370
And if

831
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,506
this approach is right,
this means that that early primitive

832
00:47:56,506 --> 00:48:00,444
perception influences
the way we perceive and see the red apple

833
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,013
later on in life.

834
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:07,784
And to take home message
is that when it comes to understanding

835
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:10,187
nature of our perception,
experience in general, but

836
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,824
also have an outlet for this
in this paper.

837
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:17,427
But then we are trying to build a case
for this idea

838
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,596
as well and conscious experience as well.

839
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,600
The infant is father to the man,
to the human.

840
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,036
Sorry, it's paraphrased this

841
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,141
metaphor by the English poet Wordsworth.

842
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,777
And this is it.

843
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,846
I would like to thank my collaborators

844
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,749
for working with me
on this like radical project.

845
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:44,888
I would like to thank the organizing of
the Arctic influence now for inviting me.

846
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:49,293
And I also I would like to ask you
that if you are interested

847
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:54,531
to collaborate with me along those lines
of like paradigm shift, please

848
00:48:54,531 --> 00:49:00,103
drop me any more because I'd say open
to decide, use and to develop further.

849
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,006
And this is it and thank

850
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,977
you for your attention.

851
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,079
Excellent. That was really interesting.

852
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,449
Maybe you can share
and we'll have a little bit of time

853
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,786
to discuss. Cool.

854
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,523
So if anybody wants to post a question,
they're free to do so.

855
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:25,362
I have a bunch of thoughts in question,
but one piece that right at the beginning

856
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:29,733
you mentioned it
the historical nature of inaction.

857
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,835
And it just shows that sometimes
when people

858
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:35,072
are talking about inactive approaches,
they're, oh, you know, picking up

859
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,841
this pen, it's the snapshot in activist.

860
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,477
But actually the implications of action

861
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,480
are that we have to think about history
and development.

862
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:47,517
So I really appreciate the way
that you framed it in in these terms.

863
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,754
So maybe just to get things

864
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:53,924
started, where does active inference
come into play here?

865
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,325
That's a pretty big question.

866
00:49:55,325 --> 00:50:00,464
But where does active reference
come into play?

867
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:00,897
Yeah.

868
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:04,768
So I think that active inference
come into play in the way

869
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:09,906
we actually understand how
the minimal sound is construed, right?

870
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:14,644
So how the minimal self-organizing system
is somehow negotiated, that exchange

871
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:18,782
of information between, you know,
his own self model and the environment.

872
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:19,449
Right?

873
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,785
So the radical idea
we want to put forward

874
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:25,622
is that the closest environment
and the most primitive environment

875
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:29,893
that we have in the first place
is another human body, is not some sort

876
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:35,032
of like objective environment,
but in other subjective,

877
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,636
I mean, lived or lived,
you know, body, right?

878
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,673
So I think that's kind
of like radical idea

879
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,411
and it means that we basically
we need to not add an extra level

880
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:51,214
even more dynamic to the active influence
to say it's just not enough

881
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,550
to basically just act

882
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,887
and to make sense of that actually
in the world, in the movement.

883
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,657
But actually we need to take it
as a sort of like double way.

884
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,192
It's a call coordination

885
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:07,230
between the two organisms, right?

886
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,932
So it's not just

887
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,836
like an ace,
it's like cool action and call movement.

888
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:18,241
So it just means that it's even more
messier than we thought at the beginning.

889
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:23,080
It's like if you take, you know, the
the standard approach, right?

890
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,383
So you have two environment to agent
and then the agent

891
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,185
needs to be
in the model of that environment.

892
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:32,322
So by contrast in whatever self
internal self more that says and what it

893
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:35,092
and extracting
the mapping of the environment has right

894
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,860
now, you need to take into account

895
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,796
that that the kind of like environment
is not only just like

896
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,266
in another agent out there
that you need to interact with

897
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,637
and that the agent can be, I don't know,
another human being or a robot.

898
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:48,238
Right.

899
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:51,174
But actually you share common

900
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:55,946
resources, computational resources way
that another agent's right

901
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,218
and you need to actively negotiate
those resources on the fly

902
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:05,922
might even though
there is kind of like a asymmetry

903
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:09,059
because obviously the pregnant
person has way more power.

904
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,928
You know, she can

905
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,964
he can move around and

906
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:16,633
act in the world.

907
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,203
But that coordination

908
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:24,074
happens from from the very beginning.

909
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,310
That makes me wonder,
how is it related to niche construction?

910
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:32,082
That's something that actual constant
has, of course, worked a lot on.

911
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,951
So how do we think about niche
construction?

912
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:35,952
Is there a niche?

913
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:40,257
A shared niche is one,
the niche of the other.

914
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:40,590
Yeah.

915
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:44,928
So that's that's I mean this is like,
as I said, this is an emerging field

916
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:49,065
and I have something like a zillion
questions, an interesting question to us

917
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,635
and. One of those is like related
to the new

918
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,372
constructions process of

919
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:58,341
and it's like somebody says
so the the pregnant person, right.

920
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,912
So there is like
very nice work showing that

921
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:03,847
because also the

922
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,717
mother is embedded in a wider social
and physical environment.

923
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:11,721
So we have cultural constraints
on that pregnant person.

924
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,892
And there is work showing that,
you know, for instance, like,

925
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:21,598
you know, the, the,
the maternal, for instance, influences

926
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,868
the way the infant will later on cry

927
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,638
and feel and also even the niche.

928
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,707
So to speak, for this is baby language.

929
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,676
Well, because I don't know, the father
speaks one language

930
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:36,146
and the mother speaks another language
and also impacts the way, for instance,

931
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:40,951
the the infant later on cry or,
you know, coordinates.

932
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:41,551
Right.

933
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,888
So this but again,
this is emerging evidence.

934
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,490
We need way more work
to actually carefully

935
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,227
look at that exchanges between, you know,

936
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,330
the body subject the body

937
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,466
subject to pregnant subject
and it's like close environment.

938
00:53:56,866 --> 00:54:01,004
But what we know for
sure is that clearly I mean,

939
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,808
I mean,
the the the the social background,

940
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:08,812
the cultural background and the physical
background is really, really important.

941
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:14,618
Try to direct direct impact and accident
does that that show I can't remember

942
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:19,289
the on the top of my head
the name of the mothers but I yeah.

943
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,625
Show quite nicely that actually you know

944
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,495
I don't know
strange babies or German babies

945
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:29,332
they don't cry the same way
because the language spoken by them,

946
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,835
the mothers, has different
intonation, right?

947
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,605
So the auditory input that you can have

948
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:39,342
in the womb
actually significantly impacts strength.

949
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,379
So this means that if you change niche,
the cultural nature

950
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,548
show a change of mind,
but you also want to change the way

951
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,551
the baby later on will somehow express,

952
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:51,655
you know, this regulatory process
like crying, right?

953
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:52,389
I'm not happy.

954
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:58,228
But that
makes me think about how even as adults,

955
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:02,399
we're still bounded
by externally constructed membranes.

956
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:07,671
We rely on a broader society to bring us
glucose and to take our waste.

957
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:11,107
And so there's critical period,
just like you had with the seed.

958
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:14,511
Absolutely a critical period
where just like for any other complex

959
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:18,381
system, it's going to have bifurcation
and a lot of leverage points

960
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,251
in its development
when it's literally more fluid.

961
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:26,623
But later on, these things are different
in kind of detail, but not in type.

962
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,425
So extremely.

963
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:31,861
Yeah, and I think it's very it's
really important because we, we,

964
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,596
we tend to

965
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:33,963
we need to

966
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:37,167
I mean, I forgot to pull that slide,
but I think it's important to bear in

967
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:41,304
mind what we call the invisible
basis of the AIDS iceberg, right?

968
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,840
So certain
things really take for granted.

969
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,711
So if you go again to the department
that.

970
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:50,413
Right. So for the treatment of war.

971
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,782
So think of a tree, right?

972
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:53,983
So you walk on a stretcher.

973
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,618
So let's suppose you are a martian,

974
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:56,853
right?

975
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:01,458
And you land on the earth in a tea tree
and understand how the tree works.

976
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,059
What is a tree? Right.

977
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:08,998
So if you limit yourself to only to what
you see the surface of the earth, right?

978
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,401
Like the trunk leaves, you know,

979
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:16,840
then you might need some important bits
of information how exactly tree works.

980
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,808
Because a tree also has roots.

981
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:22,746
And basically the way this negotiate
the nutrients through

982
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,583
that basic roots, invisible lines
actually

983
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,753
you know significant impacts
how later on I know

984
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,857
the trunk or leaves are constructed right
so we really need

985
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:38,228
this is our motivation to take to endorse
like bottom up developmental

986
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:42,165
and ecological dynamical perspective
because we really need to go back

987
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:45,902
to the roots invisible
one that we take for granted because

988
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:50,206
as you said rightly point out,
maybe there is something going on

989
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:53,943
at that critical stage
that if you act upon that critical stage,

990
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:58,148
then you avoid later on bigger problems
that you can't modify.

991
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,316
So you need to

992
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:04,788
act exactly at the time t
for a very specific reason,

993
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:08,258
but also those roots are highly connected
with,

994
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,027
I don't know, the nutrients in the earth
in this case, like

995
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,732
mother's body, which the mother body
is kind of like connected again

996
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:16,900
with a closed environment.

997
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,738
I mean, the way he she is like supported
or the cultural background,

998
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:25,341
that type of support
you get from her close environment.

999
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,444
And I try and then,

1000
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,281
you know, I don't know, going higher up
and it's like policies that, you

1001
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:35,885
know, governments can have and you know,
climate change and other things, right.

1002
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:42,392
So it's everything is somehow
a very open and precarious system.

1003
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,294
And I think this is so

1004
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,064
I mean, the way I understand and this is
why I'm interested in this like entire,

1005
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:49,732
you know,

1006
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:53,503
new active infant approaches, people
as well as name shows.

1007
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,472
It's like it's an acting thing, right?

1008
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,440
It's like it's
constantly, dynamically moving.

1009
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,842
We need to make sense of it, right?

1010
00:57:58,842 --> 00:57:59,909
In very,

1011
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,278
you know, rigorous way.

1012
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,614
But still, you know,

1013
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,749
it's an open ended process and.

1014
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,287
Yep, and for the tree, visually,
the roots are there.

1015
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:15,091
But with humans, our roots are often
transient or they're cultural.

1016
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:19,596
So it also asks us to move beyond
a visual representation

1017
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:20,997
of being tangled in a web.

1018
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,400
And you can't move, but rather
to see these dynamical processes

1019
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:27,036
that go through the developing embryo.

1020
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:30,206
So here's a question from the chat.

1021
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:32,308
@Ana [Clara de Paula] asks

1022
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,378
saying that they just came
to see your talk

1023
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,680
after hearing about it
just a few minutes before it began.

1024
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,749
So that's so fun that we can connect
with people

1025
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:42,652
who are just hearing about these ideas
maybe for the first time.

1026
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:46,422
And the question is,
I would like to ask for

1027
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:49,459
background references
to start studying this theme.

1028
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:54,297
So what would be some key references
or some key questions

1029
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:57,700
or topics to look up for somebody
who's kind of wanting to follow you

1030
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:03,072
on that freeway
on research trajectory that you're on? So

1031
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,608
so there are several.

1032
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,311
So it depends on the backgrounds, right?

1033
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:12,115
So there is

1034
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:15,552
there is very nice
work on the phenomenology side.

1035
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,421
So in philosophy, right?

1036
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:24,227
So there's a nice work by Alina,

1037
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:27,931
by and also by how do you go?

1038
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,400
And I think

1039
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,636
I hope I'm not misspelling her name,

1040
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:37,607
but if you Google Annie Diego
she has a recently last year paper with

1041
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,111
I'm sorry I've really bad names

1042
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,247
so that's a very good reference
starting point

1043
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,818
I also wrote on this
so if you Google my name

1044
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,288
I started to work on this
already in 2017.

1045
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,758
I worked on a basic form

1046
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:59,195
of self-awareness, right.

1047
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:02,599
And there is nice work on

1048
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:06,936
that.

1049
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:11,841
That did the touch and affective
touch component right now by

1050
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:13,309
Maria.

1051
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:17,647
Now roughly 30 times I want to Cuccinelli
dance very nice of you people up

1052
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:22,085
and especially sugar to edited
it it's just cool so the special issue

1053
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,153
called the relational

1054
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:27,423
self basic forms of self
when they have a paper

1055
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:30,426
that and actually have quite nice papers
there as well on this topic.

1056
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:35,164
But more overall,
I wanted to say that I have

1057
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:39,736
the Twitter handle public and there is

1058
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,705
I also have my website and

1059
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,008
in an office.

1060
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:49,512
So I'm very happy to take emails
and you can basically forward

1061
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,348
and I'm all,

1062
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,486
you know complete reference
because on the top of my head,

1063
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,722
I'm pretty sure I left aside
important references.

1064
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:03,359
And I don't want to say I, you know,
I said this reference

1065
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,462
that got those references
so much diplomatically.

1066
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,666
So email me and I'm going to send you

1067
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:13,236
a reference is what's interesting.

1068
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:17,407
And it reminds me of the way
that now the Internet is allowing us

1069
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:22,979
to be in very tight feedback loops,
more like a co embodiment of knowledge.

1070
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:27,016
You're able to share your knowledge
and your perspective on things,

1071
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,652
and then somebody can ask a question.

1072
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:34,257
And now we're in a very tight
proximal communications wise cycle

1073
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:37,427
where we can actually update each other
on, oh,

1074
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:41,330
it was actually this 2017 citation
she was talking about, not the other one,

1075
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:45,101
but if that was only once in a while
conversation, we couldn't

1076
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,203
actually develop at this rate.

1077
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,271
So that's quite interesting.

1078
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,040
Again, as adults
who are co constructing each other's

1079
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:56,479
ecological niche, okay, one thought I had

1080
01:01:56,479 --> 01:02:00,583
and if anyone can write
more questions, is in most insects.

1081
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:05,722
So as an entomologist I was thinking
of insects most insects lay eggs

1082
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:09,792
and you had said that the placenta
and the co embodiment,

1083
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:12,795
the pregnancy is universal
and maybe it's mammalian.

1084
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,331
In fact, it's. Defined as within humans.

1085
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,034
Oh, yes, yeah.
Universal to. Humans. Yeah.

1086
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:19,402
Yeah.

1087
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:23,072
So the egg for the insects contains
everything

1088
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:27,176
it needs to get to the relevant
life stage, like to hatch from the egg

1089
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,378
and then b whatever stage of development
it's in,

1090
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:31,948
except for the ants.

1091
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,549
Well, there's other

1092
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,752
exceptions here, but in the ants,

1093
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,554
the larva is after the egg.

1094
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:41,524
It hatches into a lava very quickly,
and then the larva is actually in a

1095
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:42,859
two directional relationship.

1096
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:46,596
And the larvae are called the social gut,
and they have a one handed gut.

1097
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,665
And so they're being fed food
and actually digesting it.

1098
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,102
And in a
two directional hormonal relationship.

1099
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:57,607
And so it was so interesting that it's
almost like the length of the dialog,

1100
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:02,178
the length of the intergenerational
transfer.

1101
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:04,080
Is it one day, is it one year?

1102
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,515
Is it 18 years?

1103
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:06,549
Is it permanent?

1104
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:10,119
Are we always co-creating the length
of that hand off

1105
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,821
in the richness of the handoff

1106
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:14,724
seems to have something to do
with the evolution of complexity.

1107
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,025
So I was wondering
what you thought about that.

1108
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:17,360
Yeah.

1109
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,427
So this is amazing.

1110
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:22,598
I mean, I mean, when you look at nature
is like mind blowing.

1111
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:26,903
I mean, I was about to say it's like we
I mean, I'm talking

1112
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,907
from the philosophy perspective,
I can safely say that the last year

1113
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,976
has been kind of like the century and,

1114
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:38,581
you know, you know, human centered,
anthropocentric, right.

1115
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:44,120
But if you want to really,
it's like how mind and body works.

1116
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,190
And you look at the nature more general
than you realize.

1117
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,225
Well, this is really fascinating.

1118
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:53,262
And so, you know, we can learn so much.

1119
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:56,265
So you you
you are telling me about the islands.

1120
01:03:56,265 --> 01:04:00,236
But I recently read something because
I started to be fascinated by this idea

1121
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:04,707
of like placenta and I've read that
surprising some lizards, right?

1122
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:06,309
So you have

1123
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:08,477
exactly
the same species of lizard, right.

1124
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,547
And some them

1125
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:14,050
and some of them actually have babies.

1126
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,918
Right, exactly the same lizard.

1127
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,587
And you ask yourself why?

1128
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:23,492
And then you realize that actually
it depends the climate where they are

1129
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:28,231
if they are a warm climate
or a cool climate, right?

1130
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,700
So if they are in warm climate,

1131
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,502
they lay eggs
because the sun is kind of like, no,

1132
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:37,073
but if you are in the cold climate

1133
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,442
only going keep the egg inside, right

1134
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:43,212
and make the baby
keep their protective baby inside.

1135
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:43,446
Right.

1136
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:47,283
And then only after that baby kind of
they simply put it into the world.

1137
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:47,683
Right?

1138
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:51,220
So that's a very nice example of,
as you said, it's like the the

1139
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:55,625
the flexibility and adaptability
that we can have to actually know

1140
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:59,629
the man and climate happens
and carry on right?

1141
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:05,101
Because in this case,
you basically have exactly the same body.

1142
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:08,938
But the way you carry
your own life is depending on

1143
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:12,875
exactly that in between interaction
that you have with the environment.

1144
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:13,309
Right.

1145
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:17,380
You know, cooling environment in one
case, in a warm environment in another.

1146
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:22,518
And that impacts the way you basically
cool, you know, the way you

1147
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,156
self-organize and reproduce.

1148
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,324
It is really fascinating.

1149
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:31,127
I really hope that basically,

1150
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:34,597
you know, animal scientists

1151
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,935
in general,
brain scientists would work hand in hand

1152
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:43,239
because I'm pretty sure
will somehow unlock many of the so-called

1153
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,741
mystery of the human mind,
that human body,

1154
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:48,711
just by looking carefully
what is going on to our,

1155
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,381
you know, friends and neighbors
and animals.

1156
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:52,949
Right.

1157
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:54,917
It's an excellent point.

1158
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:59,255
And in animal cognition especially,
it's phrased as like the development

1159
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,924
of the cognitive capacity,
as if that was the end point.

1160
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:05,061
You know, you go from 0 to 60
and then you're at six,

1161
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,430
then you cognitive decline,
you know, tap on the brakes.

1162
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,700
But there's a richness
and it's different cognitive agents,

1163
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,536
which actually
brought me to this question, which was

1164
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:18,240
I was definitely with you, that the adult
centric perspective that you raised

1165
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,442
in your first anecdote

1166
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,611
at the conference and it's,
oh, it's all adults in the room

1167
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:26,582
so let's go with this
that it would be fallacious

1168
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,884
to have an adults only perspective

1169
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:32,688
and maybe it might be also
somewhat of an error to have like a child

1170
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,925
only philosophy, just whatever
the children appeals to them.

1171
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,393
Let's just go with it.

1172
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:41,497
So how do we structure
the intergenerational conversation

1173
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:45,368
and learn from each other?

1174
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:48,304
Yeah,
so that's that's a that's a big question.

1175
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:50,773
So I think

1176
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:54,844
what we really wanted to do in this paper
was like something very, very modest,

1177
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:58,981
namely to draw attention on the fact,

1178
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:01,484
hey, guys, pay attention.

1179
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:02,852
We have this lens.

1180
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,121
Yeah, it's kind of like to see it.

1181
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,423
Let's
clean it a bit and expand it, right?

1182
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,492
So I'm happy to basically expanded it

1183
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,460
and take that
kind of like bottom up perspective.

1184
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,231
But obviously I don't want to bring
everything to the to the root,

1185
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:16,132
so to speak. Right.

1186
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:19,502
Would be like exactly the same policy
to like focus

1187
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:22,138
just like like on the foods,
like the apple, the tree

1188
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,207
and focus just on the roots.

1189
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:25,741
Right.

1190
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,311
I think what we really need is

1191
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:32,748
an explanation of that dynamic process.

1192
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,251
Right. How that informs how that emerge.

1193
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,253
I was connected
with the wider environment

1194
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,989
and with other minds,

1195
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:43,692
other bodies, other animals is

1196
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:46,429
I don't
know if it's true, I need to check.

1197
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,297
But at some point somebody told me,

1198
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:52,201
I think I saw it on Twitter
that actually if you take a human body

1199
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:56,672
and you take the cells and the human body
numerically actually have more

1200
01:07:56,672 --> 01:08:00,843
foreign cells than actually human cells
in your body numerically,

1201
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:04,180
because all you have
most of my microbiota, I think. Right.

1202
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,783
So if you if you take
just like that quantitatively,

1203
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:11,887
then we basically are more in another
than actually in cells,

1204
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,757
which is like
I need to check that information.

1205
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:15,257
That's true.

1206
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,760
That's actually quite interesting.

1207
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,396
One one thought on that number of cells

1208
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:25,034
is actually the CO embodiment
framework moves us beyond a numbers game.

1209
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,703
For example,
there could be a very big system

1210
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,738
in a small system
like the earth in the moon,

1211
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:33,442
and yet the moon is relevant for this or,
that process on earth,

1212
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,512
and that's because they don't
have to be symmetrical.

1213
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:40,950
If it was a tug of war,
then it enforces a symmetry

1214
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:45,421
which enforces a narrowness,
but actually it doesn't really.

1215
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:48,557
What if it was really influential cells
or less influential cells

1216
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:51,827
that can be accommodated
in an active inference

1217
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:55,731
or in a dialog based framework,
but less so in a sort of.

1218
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:59,602
There's only one way to collaborate,
like tit for tat or a game theory, which

1219
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:03,939
is where a lot of the models of pregnancy
just are still scratching their head.

1220
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:04,240
Right.

1221
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:08,978
Here's
a little of a meta science question.

1222
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:12,915
If anyone else has any
they can post to is it was really cool

1223
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:15,951
how you demarcated

1224
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:20,890
your thoughts on being a philosopher
and working with a formal theory.

1225
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:25,027
So what are your thoughts
on working with formal isms

1226
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:29,632
as a philosopher or working
on these transdisciplinary teams

1227
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,000
where there might be colleagues

1228
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,904
with clinical, psychological, math
and a philosophy background?

1229
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,305
So how do we work together

1230
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:40,342
on these teams and address
these topics that are really big?

1231
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,045
Yeah, that's a that's a good question.

1232
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:47,349
And sometimes it's like Twitter
is quite good for that

1233
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:51,120
because I can just want me to get this
like the conflict in a nutshell.

1234
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,822
So I remember
somebody tweeted at some point, you know,

1235
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:57,126
when does all this computational approach
is kind of like emerging

1236
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,797
and regarding the clinical
population, they were saying

1237
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:06,168
bad news for clinicians.

1238
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:10,439
They would have to learn mathematics
and statistics.

1239
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:12,841
Right. To build computational models.

1240
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,678
And which somebody replied,

1241
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:18,914
is that bad news for mathematicians since

1242
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:22,218
additions don't have to go to hospitals
and talk to the patients?

1243
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:22,751
Right.

1244
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:28,857
So there is I like that exchange
because this is the problem that we have

1245
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:29,491
in a sense.

1246
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:32,428
We really need a dialog between,
you know, the world out there,

1247
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,598
need to go there, talk to the patient,
gather the data,

1248
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:38,968
observe the insects,
you know, observe the human right.

1249
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:41,203
You know, spent countless

1250
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,007
hours is like measuring

1251
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,643
how many eggs
they're laying and everything.

1252
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,447
And in some time, you also need something
more rigorous that will allow you

1253
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:54,984
to basically, you know, build models
that, you know, you know,

1254
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:58,320
sort of like, yeah,

1255
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:01,123
how should I put
this is like as if you you you

1256
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:05,694
you test how I test this
instead of testing in real life,

1257
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:09,531
you you let mathematics actually
take the risk of that hypothesis.

1258
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,501
And if it's wrong, that's fine
because it's not going to die,

1259
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,370
as you said, wrong hypothesis.

1260
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,739
But in real life, if you test hypothesis

1261
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:21,210
and you're wrong,
then actually you you may die.

1262
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:22,945
So I think

1263
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,914
that's should be very nice dialog
between the

1264
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:30,119
two approaches
should be seen like the sort of like dig

1265
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,421
in the same tunnel but from the opposite

1266
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:37,760
sides
and hopefully meeting in in the middle.

1267
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,831
Personally I like so I'm,
I like to even though I have a philosophy

1268
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:46,368
background, I like to consider myself
as an interdisciplinary researchers.

1269
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:50,572
So I have collaborators from all fields,

1270
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:55,077
I collaborate with clinician psychology,
I'm doing experimental science.

1271
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:58,213
So I'm running studies,
I'm collecting data.

1272
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:01,350
I also collaborate
with people on the more formal side.

1273
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,485
So it's been kind of like, you know,

1274
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,057
simulation and formal approaches
to a certain set of phenomena,

1275
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:11,960
especially connecting it
with my main interests,

1276
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:18,300
which is self-awareness, minimal
selfhood, alteration of minimal selfhood,

1277
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:22,171
the relation between the self on
the body and embodiment and

1278
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,506
so on and so forth.

1279
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,642
But, but yeah, I do.

1280
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:30,846
And this is my just swears
that to the last, the last part

1281
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:34,416
of my talk in the last slide,
that I'm very open to collaboration,

1282
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:37,853
especially on that side,
because I really need to

1283
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:42,191
and I really think we reached a point
where we basically need to have a dialog

1284
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:46,562
because it's like
we have so much information in

1285
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:51,266
and just we realize that to start
the life of the mind

1286
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,536
and body noticing it so that we cannot

1287
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:59,441
we cannot solve just like we just like
one single discipline or one single tool.

1288
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,577
We really need to join forces.

1289
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:05,381
And a dialog
is going to be a bit more messy,

1290
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:08,984
a bit more trickier because we don't have
the same conceptual toolbox.

1291
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:10,786
So we have to do a lot of work

1292
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,021
before

1293
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:18,227
we find what exactly we mean by that
right in different fields.

1294
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,562
And I think this is
where philosophy can be useful

1295
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,898
because we kind of like obsessed
with this idea.

1296
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,701
What do you mean by,
you know, give me a definition

1297
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:29,872
to make sure that actually we're
we're not all over the map in a we're

1298
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:33,175
talking the same phenomena
about the same phenomena.

1299
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:38,247
But also, I think it would be dangerous
for philosophy to to somehow develop

1300
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:42,484
this conceptual toolbox completely cut
off from whatever, you know, you know,

1301
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:47,389
to do things of that empirical world or,
you know, the mathematical models

1302
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:48,624
to actually show what's right.

1303
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,627
So we need to keep those gates open and,

1304
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:56,899
you know, exchange and dialog
and collaborate. Wow.

1305
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,101
Thanks for that awesome response.

1306
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:03,005
To call back to your beginning slides,

1307
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:06,909
you had the armchair philosopher
and that's a term that people know.

1308
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:10,078
Just like in America,
we say a monday morning quarterback,

1309
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:11,880
just like looking back at the past

1310
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,117
and the armchair
philosopher is not so different, right.

1311
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,920
And that made me think of
I think, therefore I am.

1312
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,757
And the idea that by actually getting
into some sort of altered state

1313
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:24,860
of inference, by meditating
or by doing some other

1314
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:29,865
thought ritual, it would be possible
to reach insight through thought.

1315
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,836
And the way that you just framed
the answer was like

1316
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:37,439
hypothesis testing is an action
that we take in the world.

1317
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:39,541
It's not just a thought.

1318
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,211
And when we frame hypothesis
testing as action

1319
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:45,547
about the systems that we care about,
like the next generations,

1320
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,984
then it makes us
think about working on teams

1321
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:53,489
and on accountability
and on reproducible science.

1322
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:57,659
All these things that are sort of like
on the side

1323
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:00,662
of the armchair philosopher
and the armchair philosopher might also

1324
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:04,967
care about participation in science,
but that would be a secondary conclusion.

1325
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:10,205
Whereas if hypothesis testing involves
stakeholders and it's also

1326
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,475
something it's happening in the loop,
it's a, it's a different situation.

1327
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:17,913
So it's just really like interesting,
I hope for those who are listening to

1328
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:18,614
what you're.

1329
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:23,485
Saying and actually I keep
I like to keep reminding my students

1330
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,554
that, you know,
I put a picture of Descartes

1331
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,691
because I'm thinking he's he's pictures
like to come to you.

1332
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:32,194
Right. But it could have been Aristotle.
But I don't know.

1333
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:34,429
It's like those kind
of like classic philosophers.

1334
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:35,898
We need to keep in mind that

1335
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:39,668
these people, I mean,
Aristotle was like biologists, right?

1336
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,971
He was like constantly dissecting things
and, you know, testing things

1337
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:46,141
as like as like looking at
what was going on with those organisms.

1338
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:50,312
So Aristotle and he's considered to be
a great philosopher

1339
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:55,717
and similarly with with court,
I mean, he was like a mathematician

1340
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:59,354
and he wrote a treatise on optics, right?

1341
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:01,757
So it's like and vision
and I think, yeah, so,

1342
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:06,995
so science and philosophy are kind of
like working hand-in-hand,

1343
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:10,832
I still think actually
working this back to,

1344
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,702
but I really think that actually
scientists say

1345
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,139
do it without realizing actually

1346
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:24,313
no philosophy and some would philosophers
actually keeping and I went to this

1347
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:27,883
like scientists are discovering
whatever nature is telling us right now

1348
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,920
because it's like this is that constant
information processing, right?

1349
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,957
We never get to the bottom
of any reality.

1350
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,392
Things are changing, right?

1351
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:40,963
There's like and I think
what is really fascinating with this

1352
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,766
is an example of the virus, right?

1353
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,034
Let's let's take the virus

1354
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:49,671
because this kind of like very recent
and very relevant and very timely, right?

1355
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:53,275
So if you are a classical armchair
philosopher,

1356
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:57,312
then you have a huge ontological puzzle
with this virus because it's like just

1357
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,182
loosely mutating, right,

1358
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:03,151
in function of whoever is hosting

1359
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,621
him. Right.

1360
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,024
Or, you know, whoever
the host of that viruses

1361
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:13,228
creates different types of mutation.

1362
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:17,833
And this is like not a logical puzzle
for philosophy.

1363
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:22,537
It's like, what is the virus
which is like coronavirus, which one is

1364
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,072
it's like it's like

1365
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:27,542
and you feel like saying was actually
none of them in all of them, right?

1366
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:30,879
Because it's somehow all that kind
of like share this type of information.

1367
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:34,516
But this change in function
of whichever body

1368
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,886
or number of bodies and that depends on,

1369
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,789
I don't know, the culture
and the food and just, you know,

1370
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:45,260
I don't know, different genetic
all components and the factors.

1371
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,896
And I, I can literally say that

1372
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:51,033
we can literally see that
actually this is like

1373
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:54,903
we actually have new beings coming,

1374
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:59,041
you know, new, new entities arising

1375
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:03,545
like mutants, mutant forms of like life.

1376
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:08,550
It's like constantly arising so quickly
that think that we can't even, you know,

1377
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:09,384
wait a minute.

1378
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:13,121
Let me out what is going on right now?

1379
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:16,525
So I think we have a very nice
in the humble

1380
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,560
example, example of how

1381
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:24,099
reality of their constantly
coming to us with like clues

1382
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:27,836
themselves, like emerging information,
emerging creatures

1383
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:31,973
living being, self-organizing system
and sometimes is like, well,

1384
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:35,711
we can conceive that,
but actually they kind of like dangerous.

1385
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,013
They can kill us

1386
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,348
with all our sun.

1387
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:41,883
And, you know,

1388
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:44,119
and that's I think that's

1389
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:46,321
a very important point
we need to bear in mind.

1390
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,356
Yeah. Thanks for that.

1391
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,592
It it made me think that it's

1392
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:54,062
not just emerging entities, it's
actually emerging interfaces.

1393
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:58,800
And even if the number of entities
were set, the interfaces would still be

1394
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:00,302
combinatorial.

1395
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:02,738
It would be explosions, just like words.

1396
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:06,374
Even if the word vocabulary is set, you
still have interfaces that can emerge.

1397
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:10,479
And then, as we say also here
in, the states

1398
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:14,249
putting the cart
before the horse absolutely in error.

1399
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:19,654
But then it's actually kind of something
that tells two layers of truth because.

1400
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:23,024
It's philosophy and science
that are working together

1401
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:25,360
in how we think about things
and how we operate things.

1402
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:30,665
And what do we hear right now
other than there's a disconnection

1403
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:35,070
between technology and society,
information flow, governance, decision

1404
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:38,607
making, all these things you just,
you know, spin around

1405
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,676
and pick a number and it will be related
to something like that.

1406
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:45,914
And so that suggests
that there is a requirement

1407
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:49,818
for a new kind of a conversation.

1408
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:50,986
Yes, I fully agree.

1409
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:54,523
Do you have any other thoughts otherwise?

1410
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:57,893
This was really an awesome guest stream
and we all look forward

1411
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:01,062
to hearing you in the future,
but you're always welcome.

1412
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:02,664
Yeah, come on.

1413
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:04,933
Whether you're doing it or not.

1414
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:05,333
Yeah.

1415
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:10,372
Let's hope that, you know, this was
kind of like develop more systematically.

1416
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:13,241
And when I when the situation

1417
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:17,512
allows you basically, you know,

1418
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:19,815
organize that platform

1419
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,983
perhaps in a workshop in person.

1420
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:25,987
So meetings such as we can actually,
you know, put this idea to work

1421
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:28,657
because I think that

1422
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:32,527
just kind of like

1423
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:36,298
no proximal face to face interactions
have a different

1424
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:40,535
can can have a different type
outcome that,

1425
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:43,905
you know, the ones we can have right now.

1426
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:47,042
So we can basically,

1427
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:50,111
you know,
consolidate the collaboration and dialog

1428
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:53,515
on a more

1429
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,685
concrete and pragmatic basis.

1430
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,422
What I really I realized that
during the pandemic, what was really,

1431
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:04,392
really fabulous is that, well,
now that's what's happening right now.

1432
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:06,995
It never occurred to me that basic
Oh, well, wait a minute.

1433
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:10,398
We can have like a Zoom conversation
with somebody from California

1434
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,701
talking about this. So just kind of like,

1435
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:16,771
you know, crisis,

1436
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:20,108
you know, brought up
this new way of connecting

1437
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:22,611
and make us

1438
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:25,080
reach out in a way.

1439
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:27,883
But I also think it's important to that,
you know,

1440
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:33,355
range of put victims in place in the
first place to keep the balance right now

1441
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:36,625
because we have evolved
going back to the human nature

1442
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:39,661
and organism, we have evolved
to basically move and interact.

1443
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,797
If you don't move,
we don't interact with simply die.

1444
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:47,202
And we need to, you know,
keep moving and interacting each other.

1445
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:49,604
And I think that's that's also

1446
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,807
valid for different disciplines.

1447
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:56,378
That's what we basically need
to adapt and interact

1448
01:21:56,378 --> 01:22:00,849
with each other as disciplines.

1449
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:04,953
As active lab in online
participatory lab,

1450
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,056
we will co embody that events in person

1451
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:11,793
when your region is available
and when the personnel are there,

1452
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:17,132
then we'll scaffold it in a new way
because previously it was all in-person.

1453
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:18,833
There was never seen a need
to live stream

1454
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:22,504
or never seen a need to document,
to translate, to make it accessible,

1455
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:26,641
to make it available,
and will be able to organize in a new way

1456
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:30,879
and be able to help each other in ways
that we wouldn't have expected before.

1457
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,714
So I look forward to it.

1458
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,282
Yeah, me too.

1459
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:35,750
Great times.

1460
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:40,522
See you again by bye. Bye.

1461
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:44,793
Oh, nice, awesome stream.

1462
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:53,535
Thanks, Ana.
