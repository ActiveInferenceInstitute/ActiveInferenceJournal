so much for having me

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,960
um today i'm going to present a paper

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,079
that we worked

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,000
on the past past year and just came out

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
um but i'm going to start very briefly

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,879
with some of my background as a

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,040
researcher

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,320
so i'm trained as an armchair

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,920
philosopher so i did um in analytics

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,680
philosophy so i did my thesis on

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,960
physicalism in qualia

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,799
you know the famous mind body problem so

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,640
how exactly so some physical stuff

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,759
connects with

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,920
you know mental stuff and gets you know

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,280
the uh

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,119
gives rise to the subjective experience

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,960
of our conscious experiences like the

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,840
heart

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,840
problem of consciousness um

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,159
and i was obsessed as any respectable

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,240
philosopher i reality philosophy with

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,280
you know the whole problem of

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
consciousness and whether there is

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,439
something

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,079
special about the subjectivity of our

50
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,000
conscious

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,840
experiences right and because i'm coming

52
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,960
from burgundy

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,280
i spent a lot of time trying to you know

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
say that there is something about our

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
there is something special about our

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,399
subjective conscious experience because

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,840
there is something what is this like for

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,640
instance to taste

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
a particular wine and coming from

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,079
burgundy i had a lot of

61
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,399
experience and natural example with that

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,920
but more recently i

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
decided to get off the armchair of

64
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,040
philosophy

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,399
and i'm recently started to collaborate

66
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,760
with people from

67
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,080
quantum science i actually also have a

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
master in cognitive science

69
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,040
in development of psychology and uh

70
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,720
i'm recently collaborated with the

71
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,319
institute of community of neuroscience

72
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,920
as ucl in london

73
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,640
and my job there is to ask annoying

74
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,360
questions to

75
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,120
uh scientists like what do you mean by

76
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,480
perception what do you mean by social

77
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,200
right

78
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
um just to give us some examples so uh

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
one of the annoying questions i really i

80
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,840
like to ask

81
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,800
is um you know whenever i go to a

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000
conference

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,440
is uh i ask people to look around them

84
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
in the audience and realize that

85
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,959
actually there are no infants in the

86
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,160
audience

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,280
uh just adults and uh

88
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
i interpolate them on that and they look

89
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,040
at me say

90
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
you know why i don't see the point why

91
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
is this important

92
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,599
well it is important because i mean when

93
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,760
we start investigating mind and bodies

94
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
we already have another centric

95
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,920
um theoretical lens so this means that

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,599
the way we look at the phenomena

97
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,159
is from a certain standpoint and the

98
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,720
standard

99
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,239
point that you're using inverted

100
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,080
um inescapably is an adult one

101
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,560
right so this means that we might have a

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
sort of like

103
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,159
implicit bias towards certain phenomena

104
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,959
a certain way of

105
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,840
understanding phenomena that is somehow

106
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,560
you know

107
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
um adult centric and uh we need to

108
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
be careful if we want to understand her

109
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,760
mind and

110
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
uh how mind and brain work in the first

111
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
place so

112
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,959
um given that my initial uh

113
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,519
you know entrance point into the science

114
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,959
and philosophy was like

115
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,560
uh perceptual awareness like the

116
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,159
fundamental point of contact

117
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
of a subject with the reality of the

118
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,159
objects out there in the world

119
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,799
so um this is like the fundamental way

120
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,120
of actually structuring an experience

121
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,799
so you have this axis you have an

122
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,480
experience of subject with relations

123
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
object over there

124
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,319
and typically for instance this is how

125
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,599
self-consciousness

126
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,320
is understood like uh perceptual

127
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,519
awareness when

128
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,560
one perceives oneself as self-distinct

129
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,839
from the world and others

130
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,960
and how is that linked to

131
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
self-recognition in the mirror for

132
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,199
instance right

133
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,440
so for instance like is the famous rouge

134
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,040
test if you recognize yourself in the

135
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
mirrors as a toddler

136
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,759
and you see that the person in the

137
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,680
mirrors is you then you you know take

138
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
your

139
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
post-it or rouge from your uh forehead

140
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
and that's supposed to

141
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
give you a sign that you are basically

142
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,360
self-conscious

143
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
and self-aware but what i want to say is

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,400
that

145
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,360
maybe by at an um and dorsey that

146
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
adult-centric perspective we

147
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
tacitly also endorse a sort of like

148
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
visual spatial perspective on what

149
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,680
perceptual awareness is from the

150
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,440
um from the very beginning so

151
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,479
um while i i was doing my first post

152
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,039
talk

153
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,320
on in philosophy on

154
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,400
uh the sensory motor basis of the self

155
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
i also started to do a mastering

156
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,520
cognitive science and

157
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,759
development of psychology and i started

158
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,880
to actually address

159
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,479
the question of perceptive awareness in

160
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,479
a slightly different angle

161
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,960
and instead of asking myself what you

162
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,840
know

163
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
what does perceptive awareness is or

164
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
what self-consciousness is or what

165
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,800
self-awareness is

166
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
i i decided to ask the question

167
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,320
how would you really get in contact with

168
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,759
the world at most primitive

169
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,080
level how do our self-awareness

170
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,240
experience or perceptual awareness

171
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,600
or experience is more general um emerge

172
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
from the in in the first place right so

173
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,960
are they involved

174
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,880
with their lifespan and if you take that

175
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,600
perspective

176
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
right then you realize that actually

177
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,600
from the very beginning

178
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,960
uh we have that that traditional axis

179
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
a subject here relates to with an object

180
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,120
there is somehow

181
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,160
incorrect because in real life the way

182
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
we start actually perceiving the world

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,720
is with the subject here that relates

184
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,479
with another subject here in a very

185
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,759
proximal way

186
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,919
right so this means that we'll probably

187
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,600
need to shift the perspective in

188
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
instead of like taking like a tacit

189
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,479
visual spatial understanding of what the

190
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,080
perceptual awareness is

191
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,479
we need to actually expand it and be

192
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,600
more exclusive

193
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
and uh you know pay attention to the

194
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,560
fact that our first experience are

195
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
basically multi-sensory nature and they

196
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,000
also

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,479
proximal this in a sense like way

198
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,759
basically

199
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,039
before we meet other people's minds we

200
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,360
meet

201
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,199
other people's body and why is this

202
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,800
important is because there is a huge

203
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,599
literature

204
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,800
on uh you know what does it mean for

205
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,680
uh what what is a minimal self and

206
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,360
actually this is important for

207
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,240
not only for philosophy but also for um

208
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,639
for

209
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,520
science and robotics and um many many

210
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,479
other fields

211
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,120
because it is important to you know

212
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
correctly define what but really

213
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,759
what we really mean by a self and by a

214
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,800
minimal self

215
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
and there's a huge literature um

216
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
in from from various traditions that you

217
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,560
know um talk about minimal

218
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
self-consciousness minimal self

219
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,880
core self uh pre-reflective sense of

220
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,440
self

221
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,120
um etc and

222
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,599
i think if we switch the perspective and

223
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,160
take

224
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
on doors like a more inclusive

225
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,560
ecological and bottom-up

226
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,800
um approach and what the minimal self is

227
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,599
we avoid

228
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,800
a fallacy a center conceptual fallacy

229
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,319
so for instance i'm trying to depict

230
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,240
this fallacy with this picture here

231
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,479
so suppose you want to to find out what

232
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,680
is a minimal

233
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
model of a self-organizing

234
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
system such as a plant or a human and

235
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,000
then if you

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,759
take if you endorse an adult centric

237
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,199
perspective then you might tempt it to

238
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,080
basically

239
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
take whatever structure we have as an

240
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
adult plant or an

241
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,039
adult human and squeeze those property

242
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,599
or try to you know extra extract the

243
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,240
elixir

244
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,759
know the structure the basic structure

245
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,080
of those property and then you say okay

246
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,280
so this is how

247
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
the minimal self model of that self

248
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,599
organizing system is right like you ski

249
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,319
squeeze the plant make it smaller and

250
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,639
say

251
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,720
this is what the minimum model is but in

252
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,240
reality we know very well that actually

253
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
this is not how

254
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,159
it looks right so uh for instance if you

255
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,200
can see here

256
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,679
that a plant at the minimal level you

257
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
know the the form the stroke

258
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,039
structure here is very different that

259
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,559
the ones that you have later on

260
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,440
in let's say the other life so this

261
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
means that we need to

262
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
if we want to extract like you know the

263
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,240
basic the skeleton of a certain you know

264
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,240
um system then we need a from

265
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,959
an ecological and dynamic perspective we

266
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,320
need to take into account

267
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,040
all these intermediary forms in order to

268
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,720
make sure that actually understand

269
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
what the plant is and what a human is

270
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,839
right

271
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,920
so this is a paper that we

272
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,080
as i said we recently uh published this

273
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
year so we decided to

274
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
really really go back to um the

275
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,519
beginning and to

276
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,519
question more carefully this idea of

277
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,720
like um

278
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,320
um combo treatment and homeostasis

279
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
uh and i want to start with the

280
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
disclaimer because this is very much

281
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,880
work in progress

282
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
and there is a lot of work to do because

283
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,160
this is as i said is

284
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,200
slow it's a shift in perspective so

285
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,880
there is a lot of work to do actually to

286
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,320
shake a bit you know the

287
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,800
the you know the entrance point to the

288
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,680
problem

289
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,160
and uh this is not an active inference

290
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,120
account

291
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
of co-embodiment and co-homeostasis yet

292
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,000
this is work in progress i'm doing this

293
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,519
on different levels

294
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,279
from you know um metabolism to

295
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,120
you know um more high level level

296
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,800
um like self-awareness

297
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,279
but because i need to start somewhere we

298
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,760
decided with my collaborators basically

299
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,560
to use the active inference approach

300
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,160
some of the insights of the active

301
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,519
inference approach to bring the

302
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,959
fundamental state of combat

303
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,200
and the co-homeostasis under the

304
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,360
spotlight because this is something that

305
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
we need to do

306
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,160
because it's like a snap mainstream so

307
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
we decided to okay so let's take a sort

308
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,279
of like meta

309
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,519
level approach use the active inference

310
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,519
lens and show that if you

311
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,399
if you um like the active inference

312
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,560
approach if you endorse it then you we

313
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,079
you need to take carefully into

314
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,839
consideration this kind of like very low

315
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,640
level

316
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,040
co-embodiment approach from the from the

317
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,920
very beginning

318
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
so this is what we're going to do in

319
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
this paper

320
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,920
so i'm going to start very briefly with

321
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,279
the background and

322
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,360
predictive processing framework i'm sure

323
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
that you are all

324
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
uh familiar with this uh so i'm not

325
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,920
going to spend

326
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,640
a lot of time explaining it but i just

327
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,200
have

328
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
two slides on it just because i need to

329
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,399
make sure that if someone is looking you

330
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:06,720
know

331
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
watching this and doesn't know what

332
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,279
active influence or predictive

333
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,320
processing is

334
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
we are on the same page and then i'm

335
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
going to spend actually more time

336
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,839
and trying to develop the um

337
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,720
this and motivate this need to actually

338
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,600
take a

339
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,680
bottom-up developmental take on what

340
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,920
perceptual awareness and experiences in

341
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,200
the first place

342
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
and define the notion of embodiment you

343
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,000
know stages of stays in common stasis

344
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,680
homeostasis but again i'm going to

345
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,279
define them through

346
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,920
this um bottom-up developmental lens

347
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,720
and i'm going to end with some um hand

348
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,440
waving

349
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,800
work in progress uh and i'm very open to

350
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,680
suggestions

351
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,000
uh because as i said this is like very

352
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
much an open question

353
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
and we need there is a lot uh more work

354
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,800
to do okay

355
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,480
so um i'm i i believe if you are all

356
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
familiar with the predictive processing

357
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
framework so the basic idea is that our

358
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,360
brains is is not a

359
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
passive sponge that you know

360
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,360
automatically somehow you know

361
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,240
passively receives information somehow

362
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,720
he

363
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,040
you know gives the motor output but

364
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
rather we should conceive the brain as a

365
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,959
sort of like active

366
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,600
system that anticipates the next sensor

367
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,000
input

368
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
on the basis of prior inputs such as

369
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,600
that actually can

370
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,399
map the world in a more accurate way

371
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,079
this idea very nicely fits with some

372
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,760
previous idea that having been developed

373
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,959
in parallel by uh the embodied cognition

374
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,440
paradigm approaching cognitive science

375
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,560
where they basically

376
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,200
this author like verily colleagues

377
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,560
basically

378
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,120
outline this idea that cognition should

379
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,839
be understood

380
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,519
as the enactment of the world and the

381
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,760
mind on the basis of history a variety

382
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,120
of action that the being in the world

383
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,000
performs

384
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,160
and in the sense like we cannot really

385
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,720
understand cognition in isolation from

386
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
the body and we cannot understand the

387
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,320
body in isolation from the environment

388
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
and we cannot understand either the body

389
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
or you know the relation between the

390
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,920
mind body and the environment

391
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,160
without taking into account the history

392
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,040
of those like

393
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,639
uh connection from the in the first

394
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,480
place right because this is not static

395
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
phenomena but it's more like

396
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,079
dynamic unfolded for good time because

397
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,920
this is what life is right

398
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
so this means that our ongoing

399
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
perception and cognitive processes and

400
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,600
action are influences by prior events

401
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,360
and prior experiences so this is

402
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,320
something that

403
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,639
you know um embodied cognition

404
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,600
approaches and

405
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,120
uh predictive processing approaches

406
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,800
somehow agree

407
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
and a different level of explanation but

408
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,920
the basic idea is that

409
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
so you cannot consider this phenomenon

410
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
in ice in isolation from

411
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,000
past events right um so this means

412
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
so and another i think common ground is

413
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,320
this idea that

414
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,680
humans are biological agents that emerge

415
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,399
as like

416
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,560
proactive survival enabled prediction

417
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,399
machines which are strive to

418
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,639
reduce uncertainty within a highly

419
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,639
volatile environment so we basically try

420
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,600
to make sense

421
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,279
of the environment out there because you

422
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
know the world is bigger than our heads

423
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
and we try to find a way to actually

424
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,800
navigate this bigger world

425
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
which is highly unpredictable and

426
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,800
potentially potentially threatening

427
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,399
so one idea is that in order to keep

428
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,920
track of this survival

429
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,079
and reproduction relevant bodily and

430
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,600
wealthy information

431
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,519
our brain solves that problem of

432
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,959
uncertainty by

433
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,000
generating self and world models and

434
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,240
it does so by extracting statistical

435
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,480
patterns of information from its embody

436
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,959
and worldly interaction

437
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
and there is a mathematical story behind

438
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,959
is i'm i'm not a mathematician i'm a

439
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,160
philosopher some

440
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,320
you know um leave that to the

441
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,440
mathematician but

442
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,959
i think what i need as a philosopher

443
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,320
i need just this idea that

444
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,079
you know our ongoing perception

445
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,760
cognition and action and process through

446
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,279
the lines of prior self

447
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,360
and well-related information right so

448
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
this is what i need the only information

449
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,920
i need

450
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,360
the only thesis i need now if

451
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,279
this is true then this means that

452
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,760
uh it becomes crucial to look at how

453
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
this experiences an action perception

454
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
gets off the ground from the outset

455
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,199
right because we need that lens to be

456
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:21,839
accurate

457
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,279
right in a dynamic and ecological way

458
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
one basic basic and overlooked aspect of

459
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,399
our

460
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
um embodied and predictive processing

461
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
approaches in both philosophy and

462
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
cognitive neuroscience is that brains

463
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
and minds and human bodies

464
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,079
first develop within another human body

465
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,320
uh and this is important point because

466
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,360
crucially while not

467
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
all humans will have the experience of

468
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,440
being pregnant or carrying a baby

469
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
the experience of being caring and

470
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,240
growing within another person is

471
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,880
universal so this is something that all

472
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,560
humans are concerned with right so

473
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,040
and this this is something important as

474
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,639
well because

475
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,519
way before we meet other people's minds

476
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,880
we literally meet on to logically meet

477
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
other people's bodies and there's

478
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,040
something i developed um already into

479
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,639
2017 where i looked at empathy and basic

480
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,320
form of shared experience but the idea

481
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,120
is the same

482
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,959
it's like okay so if we really want to

483
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,040
understand the relation between

484
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,240
uh mind body um and how

485
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,160
um you know embodied creature relate

486
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,759
with other with others

487
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,920
and the world we really need to go back

488
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,480
to this basic idea that

489
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,800
yeah before we meet other people's minds

490
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
we literally meet other people's body

491
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,040
so there is a lot of work previous work

492
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,680
that show

493
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,560
that looked at the homeostatic and

494
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,240
bodily mechanism operating

495
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,240
at early stage of developing in infancy

496
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,519
uh so uh post a birth right

497
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,639
uh we decided to take uh

498
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,920
a step further and to focus on pregnancy

499
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,079
uh because these are uh this is a

500
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,679
universal case remember

501
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,799
i i i i'd like to emphasize this

502
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,439
because typically you know when people

503
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,280
hear the word pregnancy say okay this is

504
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,119
a woman's stuff

505
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,679
uh because well i i mean certain certain

506
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,520
people certain person can get pregnant

507
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:19,760
that

508
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,199
other don't so but if you take

509
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,079
the perspective the other perspective

510
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,679
then you realize that actually all

511
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,960
humans

512
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
are concerned with this experience right

513
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,799
where two individual organists

514
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,400
literally grasp and grip into each other

515
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,480
and um contrary to the common view that

516
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,919
the

517
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,440
fetus is passively contained and sort

518
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,960
sometimes just put us like

519
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
solipsistically trapped within the

520
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,600
solitude and the silence of the womb

521
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,240
uh we will present evidence showing that

522
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
actually

523
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,360
uh there's a lot of going on there

524
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,960
there is an active in bi-directional

525
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,480
co-regulation between the two living

526
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,080
bodies and to live in organism

527
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
um and we need to start with some basic

528
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
definitions so first of all we're going

529
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,520
to

530
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
talk a lot about combodiment but we need

531
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
to make clear what exactly we made by

532
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,600
embodiment in the first place

533
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
uh there is a lot of work already in the

534
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,039
literature under

535
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,360
the relation between the body itself um

536
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,640
i highly recommend this

537
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,240
like um very recent uh review by keenan

538
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,400
colleagues coming from

539
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,240
yorknottoflove they have a very rich um

540
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
overview of

541
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,360
you know the relation between the body

542
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,160
itself and self-awareness

543
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,200
uh but here i'm going to use um my

544
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
analytical

545
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,280
philosophy card and i'm going to define

546
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,320
embodiment

547
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,960
in its minimal form to refer to the

548
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,600
instantiation of body properties by a

549
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,320
given individual in our case a human

550
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,039
in other words old talk about embodiment

551
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,919
candice

552
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,760
conceptually ontologically linked to

553
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,520
talk about embodied beings

554
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,600
and then and their bodily properties

555
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,640
now the key starting idea here is that

556
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,280
brain and minds as i said it's like if

557
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,400
you're taking the body cognition

558
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,320
approach and also more recently like the

559
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,919
predict process inactive inference

560
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,360
approach it's like

561
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,919
they all seem to agree that the brain

562
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,840
and minds don't emerge in a vacuum but

563
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,320
develop and evolve as a system dedicated

564
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,360
to controlling and

565
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,440
observe the organic survival and

566
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,360
reproduction so basically

567
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
if you take the classical mind-body

568
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
problem instead of collect conceiving

569
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,880
the body as a sort of like

570
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,919
a vehicle or car that you know is it's

571
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,840
there to you know support and fuel the

572
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,559
mind

573
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,240
actually you should consider that way

574
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,160
around namely that the mind has

575
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,360
evolved to actually subserve the needs

576
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,400
of a uh organism right uh

577
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,919
of a body um of your human

578
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,520
body so you basically shift the

579
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,360
perspective which one which is

580
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,120
actually which comes first which one is

581
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,400
actually more important

582
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,440
so crucially however if

583
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,600
so if we endorse this perspective and we

584
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,520
agree with this shift then we need to

585
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
consider the fact that human bodies

586
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,440
do not emerge in a vacuum either right

587
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,080
so human bodies basically

588
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,559
emerge and develop within another human

589
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,600
body

590
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,919
so this means that we need to adapt and

591
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,760
extend the notion of

592
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
audimen to reflect this fundamental body

593
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,039
within a body case

594
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,880
which again i'm going to stress again

595
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
and again this is universal right it's

596
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,000
not constant just

597
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,320
like a part of the population

598
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,559
so but what does it mean to say that the

599
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,440
two agents

600
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,559
are co-voted well

601
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,880
uh in biological terms this means that

602
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,440
uh as we'll see later very shortly

603
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,120
is that the regulatory of the two agent

604
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,840
states

605
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
and particularly the need to maintain

606
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
that by physiological stability despite

607
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,919
the fluctuating and unpredictable

608
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,880
environment

609
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,799
is actively negotiated between the two

610
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,919
organisms that

611
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,760
share for a given amount of time

612
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,280
typically nine months but could be

613
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,440
you know shorter a bit longer common and

614
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,080
bodily and environmental uh resources

615
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,039
right and i'm i need to give you an

616
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,039
example so what exactly i mean by going

617
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,840
embodiment

618
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,919
um because i think this is a key point

619
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,320
so i'm going to ask you to walk with me

620
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,559
into a thought experiment because i'm

621
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,159
philosopher so i'm going to present you

622
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,679
with the thought experiment

623
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,520
so you imagine you um you have a friend

624
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,720
and you uh you know you you

625
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,000
you have to perform a sequel show right

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,919
and with your friend and you have to

627
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,080
share this pair of trousers here

628
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,520
so your friend puts his his left leg in

629
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
the left part of the show of the

630
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,360
trousers and you put the

631
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,760
right leg on the right part of the

632
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
throttle uh throughout this

633
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,960
and you need to coordinate your walking

634
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
such as actually you can walk as fast

635
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,720
as you can to actually reach a target

636
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
right an apple stay

637
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,480
um now uh

638
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,240
suppose that your friends as hitting his

639
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,960
toe against

640
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,080
rock stumbles and falls and experienced

641
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,000
them by fear so what

642
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,559
is happening in his body in his organism

643
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,440
right

644
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,159
so um this means that maybe your friend

645
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,559
is going to untrain you

646
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,679
in full in which case you can

647
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,000
say that the two bodies i mean you the

648
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
friends are called fully or you shared a

649
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,640
state of like falling together

650
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120
and you can also say that well because

651
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,000
it's kind of like

652
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,120
negative events your friends your friend

653
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,840
is kind of like

654
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,600
experiencing fear and you also

655
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,400
experiencing fear as well while falling

656
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,200
right

657
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,880
so you share that state of um you know

658
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,799
fear not crucially however that

659
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,919
this is not necessarily so so suppose

660
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,960
for instance that

661
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,480
you know your friend is uh is a

662
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,679
master yoga teacher right uh and

663
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,000
while you are following you your friend

664
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,799
is somehow

665
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,760
you know managed to keep the balance and

666
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,320
you know

667
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,919
or the you know the tissue of the

668
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,679
trousers kind of like

669
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,320
you know destroyed and you know one is

670
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,240
standing at other one is falling right

671
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
it's not necessary so you can imagine in

672
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
case that actually this is happening

673
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,919
and also imagine a case in which let's

674
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,960
say well

675
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,559
why your friend is falling and

676
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,880
experiencing fear you find the entire

677
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,640
situation actually pretty funny

678
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
and instead of experiencing fear you

679
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,080
experience amusement right

680
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,400
so the two emotional states are not

681
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,159
necessarily shared so your friend is

682
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,600
experiencing fear or

683
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,400
your um experience like say amusement

684
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,799
right

685
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,960
so that's one example of like what we

686
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,320
can understand by

687
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,760
sharing a state now let us go back to

688
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,520
the case of pregnancy right

689
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,120
not that the case of pregnancy is very

690
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,559
different

691
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,400
because if you take exactly the same

692
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,080
example uh and

693
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,720
say that the mother is like some stumps

694
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,279
under

695
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,279
on a penis something and you know false

696
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,279
then there is no way in which defeaters

697
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,640
can say wait a minute

698
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,480
actually i'm not i don't like the

699
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,000
situation i don't want to fall i don't

700
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,320
want to

701
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,840
experience fear and i don't want to

702
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,440
experience negative you know

703
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,279
emotion i'm going to sit you know stay

704
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,120
put here you go ahead for

705
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
right so this means that actually there

706
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,600
is a way in which the two states are the

707
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,480
two organisms

708
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,320
necessarily such as the body itself

709
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,840
regulatory processes of one organism

710
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,000
necessarily

711
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,760
is linked to the um the other one

712
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,520
so it is important to distinguish the

713
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,760
case of pregnancy from the case of two

714
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,159
bodies like contingently happen and to

715
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,200
share a state

716
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,080
right and we can just define the notion

717
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
of like co-embodiment and saying that

718
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,520
two or more if you have twins or

719
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,720
uh more more than three to two

720
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
uh kids are co-avoided in this strong

721
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,960
case if they are bound to share

722
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,440
bodily and environmental resources for a

723
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
set time period typically nine months

724
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
for survival

725
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,039
purposes uh note that pregnancy is not

726
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,120
only a case where we can find instances

727
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,640
of this type of like stroke or

728
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,480
strong embodiment like foreign siblings

729
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
but we decided to focus on the case of

730
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,000
pregnancy because as a status is

731
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
universal case all humans have

732
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,679
you know experienced this so

733
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,919
there is already work on the fascinating

734
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,559
phenomenology of shared embodiment

735
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,840
and i highly recommend to to read it in

736
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,000
what follows basically i'm going to very

737
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,120
quickly

738
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,240
uh go to start with a very basic level

739
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,480
of

740
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,159
actually what is happening at the you

741
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,240
know from single cell

742
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,440
going up to the organism and that kind

743
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,320
of like shared

744
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,039
um shared embodiment again this is

745
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,279
fascinating a huge literature when you

746
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,200
think about it we start with like this

747
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,120
tiny little round thing with another

748
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,640
person's body and then we you know

749
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
become ourselves

750
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,960
um so uh again i'm going to be very

751
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
quick and very sketchy on this like

752
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,559
fascinating pro

753
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,200
you know process but i'll i'll try to

754
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,559
flag you know the

755
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,840
the crucial steps and the crucial

756
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,039
stages right uh so the first stage

757
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,360
is the process of implantation so

758
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,480
basically when

759
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,840
there is a dialogue between the

760
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,760
fertilized egg and

761
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,120
the mother body right and this is

762
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,200
actually this is the crucial step of a

763
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,159
pregnancy

764
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,720
a successful pregnancy um because for

765
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,200
instance

766
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,360
most of the miscarriages happen during

767
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,120
this step

768
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,520
um this is a like a sort of like

769
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
negotiation process going on between the

770
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:43,919
two

771
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,559
organisms saying uh and like any

772
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,600
negotiation

773
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,640
things can go okay or

774
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,600
can go wrong right so this means that

775
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,520
both the blast to see the baby and the

776
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,760
endometrial tissues they need to

777
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,840
actively regulate gene expression

778
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,080
transcription factors signal pathways

779
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,159
inhibiting factors and growth factors

780
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,159
during that implantation process

781
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,559
this is highly complex process and very

782
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,360
fragile

783
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,279
and very delicate if something goes

784
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,360
wrong it can go to miscarriage

785
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,039
or um later on

786
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,559
and it pulls

787
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,919
at this stage the maternal body

788
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,240
literally self modifies some of

789
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
through differentiation into specific

790
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,440
type that support

791
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,399
implantation right so the key idea here

792
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,000
is that embryo and the mother's body

793
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,159
need to coordinate with this cells

794
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,120
within that

795
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,320
very tiny implantation window right

796
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,720
now if this process let's suppose is

797
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,840
like successful

798
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,640
then the coordination goes uh to the

799
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,520
next step

800
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,720
between week seven and thirteen more

801
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,919
movements um it involves

802
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,840
self-organization can start

803
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,200
so and um and the self-organization

804
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,679
um uh interestingly involves movement

805
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,559
which is actually very important because

806
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,080
especially for the active

807
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,640
inference community because as you say

808
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,520
as you can see

809
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,679
actually movement is present

810
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,720
very early on in our lives so

811
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,960
these movements are initiated from the

812
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,760
so-called

813
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,480
uh central pattern generator in the

814
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,120
early spinal cord which produces around

815
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,520
with eight very abrupt startles or the

816
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,720
entire fetal body

817
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,760
right importantly note that this

818
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
throttles which is somehow automatic

819
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
right as we think of like a sort of like

820
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,559
heartbeat right it's going you know

821
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,760
automatically

822
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,399
uh provide the minimal basis for the

823
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,399
most basic occasion of sensory feedback

824
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,279
because in doing so for instance

825
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,480
and might start to touch the face

826
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,559
and that's softly how you have my hand

827
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,600
you know autumn

828
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,840
automatically or unwilling to attach my

829
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,000
face and then i received this like

830
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,840
sensory feedback on my face from my

831
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,080
right hand or my leg might change

832
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
its position be flexed or extended or

833
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,000
both so this means that i might have

834
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,679
some minimal sensory feedback at the

835
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,520
stage that that fools the possibility to

836
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,320
respond

837
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,480
and adapt to these movements this means

838
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,000
that self-organization and fetal

839
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,279
movement initiate

840
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,440
as a biomechanical process that

841
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,960
progressively builds sensory and

842
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,520
regulatory capacities

843
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,039
so for example as i said by being

844
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,880
stimulated by startup the fetus

845
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,120
perceives that the hand is movable and

846
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,640
that touching the face rather than the

847
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,840
uterine wall

848
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,559
with hands uh might feel different

849
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,039
because

850
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,880
i'm more sensitive here on the face that

851
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,960
actually i can i can feel my i can feel

852
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,880
my fingertips so if i touch the uterine

853
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,440
wall

854
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,720
but if i touch my own face i have

855
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,240
a double touch right okay

856
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,440
so with this at hand we can go further

857
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,760
to this notion of homeostasis and bear

858
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,520
in mind that this is all happening

859
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
so we have a developing body within

860
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,200
another body

861
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,360
now homeostasis typically refers to the

862
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,279
organism's need to maintain unstable

863
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:03,919
organic

864
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,080
internal environment despite to

865
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,000
fluctuate in external environment

866
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,559
right and the homeostatic regulation

867
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,640
typically entails using feedback control

868
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,799
mechanisms to keep the senses viable

869
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,480
of that internal environment within the

870
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,720
rages compatible for the survival

871
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,960
in this case for compatible human

872
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,080
survival

873
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,600
now it is well established that this

874
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,440
control involves uh

875
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,840
automatic actions like motor reflexes

876
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,760
endocrine immuno immunological and

877
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,520
autonomic processes

878
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,120
um that are driven by the feedback

879
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
inputs and the resulting prediction

880
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,360
error

881
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,039
which is the discrepancy between the

882
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,960
expected bodily states

883
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,080
uh at a homeostatic set point

884
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,480
and its actual level as signaled by the

885
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,520
sensory inputs

886
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,480
from the body uh and as early as 1929

887
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,279
uh it has been you know proposed that uh

888
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,240
maybe the control

889
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,640
body homostasis consists to the primary

890
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,519
aim of

891
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,880
a brain function right and this is

892
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,960
again this uh underlying exception is

893
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,720
that the fundamental drive towards like

894
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,399
self-preservation to take care of this

895
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,320
body this self

896
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
is essentially linked with constraints

897
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,480
of acting within the body's visual

898
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,679
states right

899
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,799
so it has been classically proposed to

900
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,640
define the homeostatic set points at the

901
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,919
expectation the means

902
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,760
of prior belief about the states the

903
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,039
body should inhibit

904
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,159
inhabit uh and or homeostatic range as

905
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,279
the variants of this

906
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,600
are prior beliefs now

907
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,679
going back to our case right so let's go

908
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,519
back to the to you know just for one or

909
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,720
the primitive level

910
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,320
so many years it has been assumed that

911
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
the fetus has no metabolism of his own

912
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,679
right uh now is nowadays is well

913
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,360
established that actually the placental

914
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,399
and the fetal liver working on them

915
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,240
as a sort of coordinating multi-organ

916
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,320
system to provide unnecessary nutrients

917
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,559
serving the fetal metabolism and growth

918
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,080
and this is important because

919
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,039
you know if you talk about homeostasis

920
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,039
we need to talk about metabolite

921
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,720
because glucose is the most important

922
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,919
fuel for feta metabolism and ultimately

923
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,360
for homeostasis

924
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,880
so this means that maintaining an

925
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,880
optimal balance as a continuous supplies

926
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,399
of nutrients from the mother to the

927
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,039
fetus is critical from the development

928
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,760
and from the fetus standpoint is

929
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,279
basically critical

930
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,240
for maintaining his own um you know

931
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,360
homeostatic balance

932
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,159
now note that the fetus may be able to

933
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,080
control and save some energy to some

934
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,919
extent through many complex and dynamic

935
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,039
processes but

936
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,080
importantly however it is oversupply and

937
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
under supplied of nutrients by the

938
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,440
mother right

939
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,600
uh which are process controlled by the

940
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,960
pregnant person

941
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,840
that can permanently uh program the

942
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,480
fetal

943
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,279
metabolism adversely right so this means

944
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,799
that

945
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,080
um um the the way the mother

946
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,360
um and handles her own um

947
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,000
metabolic processes significantly

948
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,120
impacts the way

949
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,159
you know uh the babies um

950
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,840
you know has his uh self-regulatory

951
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
process maintained

952
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,120
and there is accumulating evidence that

953
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,279
there is a direct link between mother's

954
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,279
adverse bodily and mental health states

955
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,799
like depression and anxiety during

956
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,840
pregnancy

957
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,000
and child medium mental and physical

958
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,440
development but this is

959
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,840
this is not only for this is valid not

960
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,519
only for the negative states but also

961
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,080
more like

962
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,640
neutral states such as food preferences

963
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,679
and flavors

964
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,240
that are passed on uh from the mother to

965
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,159
the infant so there is a strong strong

966
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,240
codependence there

967
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,279
now the the

968
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,559
key into the into the intermediary

969
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,000
conclusion at the stage is that the

970
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,519
emerging self-organizing

971
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,799
organism uh human organism is not only

972
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,000
self-centered but also

973
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,559
crucially co-embodied and co-depending

974
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,039
upon homeostatic processes within the

975
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,240
environment right so that's the basic um

976
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,519
thesis up now now

977
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,519
we need to take this a step further

978
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,880
because

979
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,440
we need to talk about also action

980
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,199
anticipation and not just like

981
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,320
our prediction or perception

982
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,599
so we saw up to now that homeostatic

983
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,800
regulation

984
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,560
requires a model that enables inference

985
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,079
perception and prediction action

986
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,000
selection importantly however

987
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,480
the brain initiates regulatory responses

988
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,560
prior to romeo city alteration

989
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,560
provided it can be anticipated so this

990
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,679
means that you

991
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,480
basically act to go to the fridge to

992
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,679
seek food

993
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,000
uh because you are hungry but actually

994
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,040
you aren't

995
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,239
you're not you you're not uh wait

996
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,839
you're not waiting for the starvation to

997
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,000
happen

998
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,760
to actually go to the fridge you do it

999
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,679
well before that actually is going to

1000
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,639
happen so you anticipate to that state

1001
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,480
so this means that higher level that

1002
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,720
enable prospective control are leveraged

1003
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,520
with

1004
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,839
two essential components like inference

1005
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,520
and prediction

1006
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,560
which brings us to allosthesis which is

1007
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,599
defined as anticipatory omnicity control

1008
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,839
basically you take action into the world

1009
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,240
because you need to regulate your inner

1010
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,119
homostatic

1011
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,040
you know balance but you're doing this

1012
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,200
by taking action into into the world

1013
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,839
and importantly you're doing this by um

1014
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,880
anticipating

1015
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,280
you know that state you don't really

1016
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,200
expect to be on the age of like

1017
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,040
you know dying from starvation to

1018
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,720
actually take that action

1019
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,920
if you are optimal you know um

1020
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,880
surviving um organism so this means that

1021
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,160
the process whereby

1022
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,280
the agent selects action that will most

1023
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,359
probably bring about the desired sensory

1024
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,160
entries

1025
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,720
while explicitly or implicitly modifying

1026
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,160
the true causal structure of the

1027
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,960
environment

1028
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,720
switch to the guaranteed recurrence of

1029
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,560
those inputs over multiple

1030
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,359
time steps um so this means that i can

1031
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,640
act differently in different

1032
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,000
environments

1033
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,359
i can go uh to a fridge if i'm hungry

1034
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,560
uh but if i'm the desert i could

1035
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,839
you know if if i expect to see fridge uh

1036
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,560
and you know i don't see it uh then i'm

1037
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,640
going to probably die instead of looking

1038
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,160
for a fridge i should probably look for

1039
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,079
i don't know banana tree or coconut tree

1040
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,480
right so the environment defines what

1041
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,640
type of expectations you should have in

1042
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,119
a particular case

1043
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,040
now there are two points that are

1044
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,560
important here

1045
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,079
note that uh for the individual living

1046
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,599
organisms homeostatic

1047
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,599
i mean we can conceptually distinguish

1048
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,680
homeostatic processes from allostatic

1049
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,599
processes but in real life

1050
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,720
those go handy uh

1051
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,880
hand in hand right to the other two

1052
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
faces of the same coin

1053
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,800
this is because we uh humans we are not

1054
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,119
static isolated creatures we are dynamic

1055
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,320
beings depending on the rich

1056
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,680
environmental resources

1057
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
and we depend upon social interaction to

1058
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,359
achieve survival and reproduction

1059
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,280
and to give it like the basic example

1060
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,400
that i really like

1061
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,359
is that like the breathing like um it's

1062
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,880
it's a perception so it's an

1063
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,119
open-ended process right we are

1064
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,760
constantly exchanging information

1065
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,440
with environment via breathing right

1066
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,079
uh and this is a dynamic process because

1067
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,119
my body moves

1068
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,160
right my thoracic cage is moving all the

1069
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,800
time

1070
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
and this means that those type of

1071
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
processes like um allostatic pro

1072
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,640
allostatic processes and homeostatic

1073
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,200
processes even though we can

1074
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
conceptually distinguish it in reality

1075
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,359
they are actually coca

1076
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,960
this means that perception in action

1077
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
homeostatic and allostatic

1078
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
self-regulation are coupled

1079
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,119
strongly coupled in a dynamic load that

1080
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,040
keeps the organism permeable

1081
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,240
to and connected with this surroundings

1082
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,640
for better and for worse because when i

1083
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,000
breathe in i can take

1084
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,280
in the air right uh that is necessary

1085
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,599
oxygen for my survivor but i can also

1086
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,480
get in i

1087
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,960
take in the coronavirus you know and you

1088
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,359
know

1089
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:03,280
eventually potentially die right so we

1090
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,119
are open system for the better and for

1091
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,079
us in that sense

1092
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,000
right um the second point is that

1093
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,920
uh going back to the our case here is in

1094
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,560
pregnancy is that self-regulatory

1095
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,280
architecture is multi-layered this is an

1096
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,480
interesting

1097
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,640
point here right it's like it's already

1098
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,400
complicated for individual but imagine

1099
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,079
for actually two individuals that are

1100
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,079
literally gripped into each other right

1101
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,320
because the baby's regulatory processes

1102
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,440
are coupled with the mother's

1103
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,760
homeostatic and anaesthetic

1104
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,000
processes and this is achieved mainly

1105
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,680
through the placenta

1106
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,440
which is an fmo and intermediary or

1107
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,359
that enables vital and biological

1108
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,760
exchanges between the two bodies

1109
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,440
for example it allows the infant to

1110
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,280
breathe despite the lack of proper

1111
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,440
proper lung regulation and ensure that

1112
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,359
the infants is fed despite lacking

1113
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,680
proper eating effectors

1114
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,320
not again that placenta is the

1115
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,720
relational organ excellence but is also

1116
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,640
a universal organ

1117
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,640
whereas typically people associate the

1118
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,200
center with like the female body

1119
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,280
and a certain type of population to say

1120
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,640
to a certain type of

1121
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,839
persons but we all

1122
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,000
have use all humans have used

1123
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,920
successfully

1124
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,880
this organ in order to survive and you

1125
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,920
know i don't know do

1126
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,599
philosophy cognitive science and active

1127
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,640
influence later on in their lives right

1128
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,800
and this is important to keep in mind

1129
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,520
now

1130
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,240
if i'm right this means that a dynamic

1131
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,839
and complex system such as the human

1132
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,920
body needs to be able to play a double

1133
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,280
game

1134
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,720
in order to survive and potentially

1135
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,040
reproduce it has to successfully

1136
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,680
maintain

1137
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,480
sensory states within a certain

1138
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,079
physiological balance

1139
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,240
but it also has to flexibly change the

1140
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,760
state in order to adapt a constantly

1141
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,920
changing environment

1142
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,079
so if we look at the human body through

1143
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,760
through this dynamic lens it becomes

1144
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,040
obvious that

1145
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,200
what happens in between the organisms

1146
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,800
environment i mean the boundaries

1147
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,480
between the two play a key role

1148
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,560
in making sure this game is correctly

1149
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,520
played

1150
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,359
and flexible enough to actually maintain

1151
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,520
the organ is alive

1152
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,359
uh so this means that we need to define

1153
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,359
the krishna uh critical notion of

1154
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,200
boundary or in between

1155
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,440
right we need a new conceptual toolbox

1156
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,119
in order to make sure that we get that

1157
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,480
process correctly

1158
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,920
right and this is something i'm

1159
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,119
currently working on with some

1160
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,280
collaborators

1161
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,680
and some some of you probably know that

1162
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,960
you know the notion of

1163
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,880
marco blanton uh marco blanc has been

1164
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,800
uh you know advocate as potential

1165
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,040
candidates to you know promising way of

1166
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,480
conceptualizing this

1167
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,400
key notion of the boundary the medium

1168
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,480
between the two and again this is like

1169
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,079
uh uh working progress and there is like

1170
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,640
um a lot of work to be done on that side

1171
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,359
but for

1172
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,880
for this talk i i really need to retain

1173
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,760
this like

1174
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,800
very simple idea that homeostatic

1175
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,200
and anticipatory self-regulation depends

1176
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,599
not only on the body states

1177
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,839
uh and but also on the external

1178
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,880
environment

1179
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,800
and more crucially on the relation

1180
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
between the two

1181
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,160
so we can just define co-homeostasis as

1182
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,599
the bi-directional process of

1183
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,599
co-regulation that happens in between

1184
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,599
two combated organisms

1185
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,560
and homeostasis involves self-regulation

1186
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:20,960
through

1187
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,280
others couplet and homeostatic and

1188
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,800
aerostatic loopy

1189
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,319
states not

1190
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,839
that and this is something that we have

1191
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,079
to you know um you know work a bit with

1192
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,000
the reviewers on our paper and they were

1193
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,119
kind of like right

1194
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,119
pressing clarification on this point

1195
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,800
because it's important to bear in mind

1196
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,280
that

1197
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,520
if we talk about bi-directional process

1198
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,800
doesn't mean there is a

1199
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,119
asymmetry there or absence of conflict

1200
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,680
on the country actually things can go

1201
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,319
wrong

1202
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,760
right um in the sense like

1203
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,119
uh it can be

1204
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,319
that you know one uh

1205
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,599
one agent actually takes the balance too

1206
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,280
much in one sense than other

1207
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,960
and to give you an example like what

1208
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
exactly what i mean by that

1209
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,240
so think of a uh highway

1210
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,440
right uh so you can have

1211
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,599
that's that's a bi-directional highway

1212
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,359
traveling from north to south

1213
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,040
let's say that you have typically more

1214
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,560
cars coming from north

1215
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,200
to the south from the mother to the

1216
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,000
infant

1217
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,839
but you have if you can have one single

1218
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,400
car traveling from south north

1219
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,640
uh and that car is like you know i don't

1220
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,040
know carrying bomb

1221
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,880
then actually that's irrelevant right

1222
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,400
it's not the quantity that matters that

1223
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,760
actually the quality of the information

1224
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,440
that is carried between the two

1225
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,520
organisms actually have many many cases

1226
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,880
and basically

1227
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,000
during the pregnancy you know mothers

1228
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,680
our pregnant person develop um diabetes

1229
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,400
or other

1230
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,440
um immuno

1231
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,480
immune immunological disorders right uh

1232
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,240
so that's not necessarily

1233
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,720
uh a straightforward process as i said

1234
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,480
and i'm emphasizing this this is a

1235
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,560
constant negotiation between the two

1236
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,119
organisms

1237
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,359
it's a dynamic open-ended process that

1238
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,880
can go okay

1239
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,000
but can also get go wrong

1240
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,440
now the big claim the radical claim we

1241
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,560
want to make is that

1242
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,720
given the necessary and universal

1243
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,200
coinboardman sustaining the human body's

1244
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,839
self-regulation and self-organizatory

1245
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,599
processes from the outset

1246
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,520
the early homeostatic regulation should

1247
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,880
be fundamentally considered as

1248
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,760
co-regulation

1249
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,440
hence communist thesis now

1250
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,839
uh in a further work we want to develop

1251
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,200
this idea

1252
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,480
of uh when exactly

1253
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,240
and how the brain starts to build a self

1254
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,599
and world model

1255
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,800
in the womb right uh because it's like

1256
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,000
it's a key question from uh for

1257
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,160
the you know predictive processing

1258
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,319
framework and active inference community

1259
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:58,880
so

1260
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,480
how exactly this is happening when

1261
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,240
exactly this is happening

1262
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,200
this is highly speculative um and very

1263
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,839
much work in progress

1264
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,319
um so it's it's an open question whether

1265
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,079
the fetus is able to generate

1266
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,800
self and oil models and if yes at what

1267
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,240
stage of development

1268
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,000
some people argue that this might be

1269
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,319
possible only after the basic talmud

1270
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,000
cortical connection are established

1271
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,520
in the fetal brain around 20 weeks of

1272
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,800
gestation this is because

1273
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,680
so the the main reason is because

1274
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
after this time point sensory

1275
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,640
information can be transferred to the

1276
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,240
fetal brain

1277
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,640
uh before they establish of this uh

1278
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,319
telomere cortical connection the fetus

1279
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,040
just acts

1280
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,160
on reflex automatic mode however

1281
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,599
other people uh argue that through the

1282
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,200
central part

1283
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,079
generating seemingly chaotic

1284
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,319
exploitative movements they also

1285
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,760
um can generate a sort of like a sensory

1286
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,599
motor coupling

1287
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,160
and or some very basic primitive sensory

1288
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,520
experiences

1289
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,480
um again this is like an open uh

1290
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,520
question

1291
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,960
and this is something that i address um

1292
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,240
in a preprint currently under review we

1293
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,720
are two of my collaborator uh adam

1294
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,520
safron and jonathan delafield

1295
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,440
uh we look at how exactly self-awareness

1296
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,079
no so how exactly the fact that our

1297
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,359
first experiences

1298
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,560
are co-embodied impact

1299
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,520
may impact the way we understand current

1300
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,160
theories

1301
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,760
of conscious experiences in general

1302
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,280
and what we our provocative take is that

1303
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,160
you know our consciousness study focused

1304
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,720
too much

1305
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,319
on visual experiences uh and a visual

1306
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,960
spatial way uh perspective endorsing a

1307
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,119
tacit adult centric and visual spatial

1308
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,240
perspective

1309
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,240
and we want to say that perhaps

1310
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,160
conscious experience are not all about

1311
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,440
seeing red apples

1312
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,800
to do you know famous example

1313
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,240
so what are the implications of

1314
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,000
switching the perspective you know from

1315
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,480
this like what we understand by minimum

1316
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,720
self and minimal self models you know

1317
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,760
from

1318
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,000
endorsing more ecological bottom up

1319
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,119
perspective

1320
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,240
rather than adult centric and um

1321
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,280
vision-based perspective again this is

1322
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,480
very much work in progress

1323
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,880
something that we are working uh on

1324
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,760
right now

1325
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,680
but you know just like bullet points

1326
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,000
uh if we switch to perspective then we

1327
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,079
need to question the individually static

1328
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,359
and solipsistic approach of

1329
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,040
understanding of the perceptual link

1330
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,960
between the ancient environment

1331
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,160
we also need to question the

1332
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,079
adult-centric thesis of sort of like

1333
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,040
fully-fledged

1334
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,040
emerging individuals like you know

1335
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,560
athena

1336
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,599
greek god or this athena coming out from

1337
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,960
zeus head

1338
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,680
so rather than humans emerge within

1339
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,520
other humans and develop through close

1340
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,680
interaction with other humans

1341
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,440
uh we also need to question the idea of

1342
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,119
a self-awareness for minimal self

1343
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,119
developing independently of other cells

1344
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,920
this is because as i hopefully you know

1345
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,400
uh convinced you that we basically were

1346
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,319
ontologically depending from the others

1347
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,160
from the very beginning

1348
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,880
at the very basic biological level and

1349
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,240
then the question we need to also

1350
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,760
question the idea of a perception being

1351
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,680
a solitary and distant deva

1352
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,319
like seeing a red apple uh but rather we

1353
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:26,800
need to

1354
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,760
you know see a perception as an active

1355
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,400
interaction

1356
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,079
active engagement with environment like

1357
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,200
for instance touching human being

1358
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,119
or coupling the interceptive like

1359
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,280
signaling like the breathing so the way

1360
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,440
i feel the air inside my body the where

1361
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,920
i

1362
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,960
take the air from outside um and also

1363
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,920
important that

1364
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
perception of that perception you know

1365
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,839
that perception comes before the seeing

1366
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:50,480
the red

1367
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,680
um apple and if this

1368
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,599
approach is right this means that that

1369
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,119
early primitive perception

1370
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,520
influences the way we perceive and see

1371
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,720
the red apple

1372
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,400
later on in life and to take home

1373
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,319
messages that uh

1374
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,160
when it comes to understanding nature of

1375
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,880
our perceptual experience in general i

1376
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,359
also have an argument for this in this

1377
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,559
paper but um

1378
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,640
you know we are trying to build a case

1379
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,079
for this idea as well

1380
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,800
and conscious experience as well um the

1381
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,640
infant is father to the men

1382
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,599
uh to the human sorry uh to paraphrase

1383
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,000
this

1384
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,520
um metaphor by

1385
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,040
the english poet waltwood and

1386
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,880
this is it i would like to thank my

1387
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,880
collaborators for working with me on

1388
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,599
this like

1389
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,480
radical project uh i would like to thank

1390
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,359
the

1391
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,599
uh organizing of the active inference

1392
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,280
lab for inviting me

1393
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,160
uh i also i would like to ask you that

1394
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,920
if you are interested to collaborate

1395
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,559
with me

1396
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,079
along those lines of like paradigm shift

1397
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,559
please drop me an email because i'm um

1398
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,440
very open

1399
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,480
to these ideas and to develop further

1400
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,440
um and yeah this is it and thank you for

1401
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,240
your attention

1402
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,359
thanks ana that was really interesting

1403
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:10,640
maybe you can unshare

1404
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,400
and we'll have a little bit of time to

1405
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,800
discuss

1406
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,040
cool so if anybody wants to post a

1407
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,559
question they're free

1408
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,480
to do so i have a bunch of thoughts in

1409
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,280
question but

1410
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,200
one piece that right at the beginning

1411
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,319
you mentioned that

1412
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,240
the historical nature of inaction and it

1413
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,680
just shows that sometimes when people

1414
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,359
are talking about inactive

1415
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,800
approaches they're oh you know picking

1416
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,960
up this pen it's the snapshot

1417
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,520
inactivist but actually the implications

1418
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,800
of action

1419
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,640
are that we have to think about history

1420
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,480
and development so i really appreciate

1421
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,920
the way that you framed it in

1422
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,359
in these terms um so

1423
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,599
maybe just to get things started where

1424
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,599
does active inference come into play

1425
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,079
here

1426
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,440
that's pretty big question but where

1427
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,839
does active reference come into play

1428
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,640
yeah so i think active influence come

1429
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,079
into play in

1430
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,559
the way we actually understand how the

1431
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,760
minimal

1432
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,319
self is constrained right so how the

1433
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,240
minimal self organizing system

1434
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,640
is somehow negotiate that exchange of

1435
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,400
information between you know

1436
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,720
his own self model and the environment

1437
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,440
right

1438
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,359
so the radical idea we want to put

1439
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,960
forward there is that the

1440
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,640
closest environment and the most

1441
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,000
primitive environment that we have in

1442
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,119
the first place

1443
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,760
is another human body is not some sort

1444
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,480
of like

1445
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,000
objective environment but another

1446
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,680
subjective i mean lived up lived

1447
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,720
you know uh body right uh so i think

1448
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,200
that's

1449
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,559
kind of like radical idea and this means

1450
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,000
that we basically we need to not

1451
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,480
add an extra level even more dynamic to

1452
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,240
the active inference to say

1453
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,400
it's just not enough to basically just

1454
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,520
act

1455
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,599
and to make sense of that action in the

1456
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,599
world and the movement but actually

1457
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,760
we need to take it as a sort of like

1458
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,720
double way it's a core coordination

1459
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,720
uh between the two organisms right

1460
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,559
so it's not just like function

1461
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,240
it's just like co-action and core

1462
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,839
movement

1463
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,760
uh so this means that it's even more

1464
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,440
messier than we thought at the

1465
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,680
very beginning it's like if you take you

1466
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,720
know the

1467
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,280
the standard uh approach right so you

1468
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,599
have the environment the agent and then

1469
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,200
the agent needs to build the model of

1470
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,400
that environment basically by

1471
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,839
contrasting you know whatever the

1472
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,680
self internal self mother says and

1473
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,760
whatever extracting the mapping of the

1474
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,720
environment has

1475
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,720
right now you need to take into account

1476
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,160
that that's a kind of like environment

1477
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,200
it's not only

1478
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,839
just like and a another agent out there

1479
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,920
that you need to interact with

1480
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,440
and that agent can be i don't know

1481
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,240
another human being or a robot right

1482
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,839
but actually you share common

1483
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,319
resources computational resources with

1484
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,720
that another agent right

1485
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,880
and you need to actively negotiate those

1486
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,319
resources

1487
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:03,200
on the fly right even though there is

1488
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,119
kind of like a um

1489
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,520
asymmetry because obviously the pregnant

1490
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,599
person has way more power

1491
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,559
uh you know she can uh he can move

1492
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,359
around

1493
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,559
and um you know act in the world

1494
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,880
but uh that co-coordination happens from

1495
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,760
from the very beginning

1496
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,839
that makes me wonder how is it related

1497
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,920
to niche construction that's something

1498
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,480
that

1499
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,599
axel constant has of course worked a lot

1500
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:32,160
on

1501
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,920
so how do we think about niche

1502
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,240
construction is there a niche a shared

1503
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,919
niche is one the niche of the other

1504
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,119
yeah so that's that's i mean this is

1505
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,800
like as i said this is an emerging field

1506
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,359
and i have

1507
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,920
something like a zillion questions an

1508
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,280
interesting question to us

1509
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,359
and one of those is like related to the

1510
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,119
niche

1511
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,839
constructions for instance of this like

1512
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,640
homebody

1513
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,880
so the the pregnant person right so

1514
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,920
there is like

1515
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,359
very nice work showing that uh because

1516
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,760
also the mother is embedded in a wider

1517
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,680
you know social and physical environment

1518
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,119
so we have cultural

1519
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,200
right constraints on that pregnant

1520
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,920
person and there is work showing that

1521
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,440
you know for instance

1522
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,040
like um you know the the the maternal

1523
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,680
language

1524
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,240
for instance influences you know the the

1525
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:22,800
way

1526
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,400
the infant will later on cry and if and

1527
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,240
also if the

1528
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,079
niche so to speak for instance is

1529
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,520
bilingual because i don't know the

1530
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,720
father speaks one language and the

1531
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,319
mother speaks another language and also

1532
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,520
impacts the way

1533
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,640
for instance the the infant later on

1534
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,400
cries or you know coordinates right so

1535
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,720
this but again this is emerging evidence

1536
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,440
we need

1537
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,920
way more work to actually carefully look

1538
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,480
at

1539
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,520
that exchanges between you know uh the

1540
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,599
embodied subject the corn body subject

1541
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,880
the pregnant subject

1542
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,200
and it's like close environment but what

1543
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,400
we know for sure

1544
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,319
is that clearly i mean um

1545
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,720
i mean the the the the social background

1546
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,400
the cultural background and

1547
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,240
the physical background is really really

1548
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,079
important right has direct direct

1549
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,400
impact right and actually there are

1550
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,119
there are

1551
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,280
studies that show i can't remember the

1552
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,319
on the top of my head

1553
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,200
the name of the authors but i yeah they

1554
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,040
show quite nicely that actually

1555
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,000
you know uh uh i don't know french

1556
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,359
babies or german babies

1557
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,760
they don't cry the same way because the

1558
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,000
language spoken by them the mothers

1559
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,280
has different intonation right uh

1560
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,760
so the auditory input that you can have

1561
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,440
uh in the room actually

1562
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,520
significantly impacts right so this

1563
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,559
means that if you change

1564
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,960
niche the cultural nature change

1565
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,839
environment you're also

1566
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,480
going to change the way the baby later

1567
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,200
on will

1568
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,240
somehow express you know this regulatory

1569
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,440
process like crying right i'm not happy

1570
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,040
right that makes me think about how even

1571
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,520
as

1572
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,880
adults we're still bounded by externally

1573
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,040
constructed membranes we rely

1574
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,319
on a broader society to bring us glucose

1575
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,920
and to take our waste

1576
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,839
and so there's a critical period just

1577
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,280
like you had with the seed

1578
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,200
absolutely a critical period where just

1579
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,040
like for any other complex system

1580
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,119
it's going to have bifurcations and a

1581
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,880
lot of leverage points early in its

1582
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,400
development when it's literally

1583
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,040
more fluid but later on these things are

1584
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,240
different in kind of

1585
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,319
uh detail but not in type so extremely

1586
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,760
yeah and i think it's it's really

1587
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,319
important because we

1588
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,799
we tend to we need to i mean i i forgot

1589
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,079
for that slide but i think

1590
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,680
it's important to bear in mind what we

1591
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,920
call the invisible basis of the

1592
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,640
aids ice bank right so certain things we

1593
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,400
really take for granted so

1594
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,839
if you go go again to the plant metaphor

1595
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:48,319
right

1596
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:51,839
so um or the tree metaphor so think of a

1597
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:52,640
tree right

1598
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,720
so you walk on a street so let's suppose

1599
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,480
you're a martian

1600
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,119
right and you land on the earth and you

1601
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,960
see a tree and understand how the tree

1602
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,240
works what is a tree

1603
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,680
right so if you limit yourself to

1604
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,760
only to what you see above the surface

1605
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,960
of the earth right

1606
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,480
like the trunk the leaves you know um

1607
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,720
then you might miss some important bits

1608
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,720
of information of how exactly tree works

1609
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,079
because the tree also has

1610
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,119
roots and basically the way is negotiate

1611
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,240
the nutrients

1612
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,079
through that basic roots invisible ones

1613
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:26,799
actually

1614
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,200
you know significantly impacts how later

1615
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,480
on i don't know the trunk or

1616
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,200
the leaves are constructed right so we

1617
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
really need to this is our motivation to

1618
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:35,920
take

1619
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,359
to endorse this like bottom-up

1620
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,359
developmental and ecological dynamical

1621
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,799
perspective because

1622
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,119
we really need to go back to the roots

1623
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,000
invisible one

1624
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,400
that we take for granted because as we

1625
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,040
said

1626
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,119
rightly point out maybe there is

1627
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,960
something going on at that critical

1628
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,319
stage that if you know

1629
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,079
act upon that critical stage then you

1630
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,559
avoid later on bigger problems

1631
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,440
right that you can't modify um so you

1632
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,720
need to you know act

1633
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,839
exactly at the time t for a very

1634
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,040
specific reason

1635
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,119
but also those roots are highly

1636
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,160
connected with

1637
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,920
i don't know the nutrients in the earth

1638
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,280
in this case like

1639
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,680
i know mother's body which the mother

1640
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,880
body is kind of like

1641
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,319
connected again with the closest

1642
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,559
environment i mean the way he is like

1643
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,680
supported or the cultural background

1644
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,160
that the type of support she gets from

1645
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,280
her close environment

1646
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,240
later on and then you know i don't know

1647
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,520
going higher up

1648
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,359
and it's like policies that you know

1649
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,720
governments can have

1650
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,200
and you know climate change and other

1651
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,240
things right

1652
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,200
so it's everything is somehow a very

1653
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,559
open and

1654
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,000
uh precarious system and i think this is

1655
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,920
i mean the way i understand and this is

1656
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,359
why i'm interested in this like

1657
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,960
entire you know new active inference

1658
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,040
approaches because well as the name

1659
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,280
shows is like it's an active thing right

1660
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,799
it's like it's constantly dynamically

1661
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,480
moving then we need to make sense of it

1662
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,520
right in a very um you know

1663
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,720
rigorous way but still you know um it's

1664
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,400
it's an open-ended process

1665
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,839
right yep and for the tree visually the

1666
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,119
roots are there

1667
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,440
but with humans our roots are often

1668
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,599
transient or they're cultural so

1669
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,799
it also asks us to move beyond a visual

1670
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,880
representation of being tangled in a web

1671
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,799
and you can't move but rather to see

1672
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,480
these dynamical processes

1673
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,359
that um go through the developing embryo

1674
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:28,480
so here's a question

1675
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,240
from the chat um anna asks

1676
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,960
saying that they just came to see your

1677
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,400
talk after hearing about it just a few

1678
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,319
minutes before it began so that's so fun

1679
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,839
that we can connect with people who are

1680
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,839
just hearing about these ideas maybe for

1681
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,200
the first time

1682
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,760
and the question is um i would like to

1683
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,520
ask for background references

1684
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,079
to start studying this theme so what

1685
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:50,640
would be

1686
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,680
some key references or some key

1687
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,359
questions or topics to look up for

1688
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,040
somebody who's kind of wanting to

1689
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,880
follow you on that freeway on that

1690
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,400
research trajectory that you're on

1691
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,520
so um so there are several

1692
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,799
so it depends on the background right so

1693
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,000
uh uh there is

1694
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,119
there is very nice work on the phenology

1695
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:15,920
side

1696
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,760
so in philosophy right

1697
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,440
so there is a nice work by um

1698
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,559
alaina by and also

1699
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,760
by honeydew and um

1700
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,960
i think i i i hope i'm not misspelling

1701
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,000
her name

1702
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,760
but if you google hannibal she has a

1703
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,960
recently last year paper with

1704
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,920
i'm sorry i'm really bad with names um

1705
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,680
so that's a very good reference starting

1706
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,240
point

1707
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,839
uh i also wrote on this uh so if you

1708
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,799
google my name

1709
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,000
i started to work on this already in

1710
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,240
2017

1711
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,839
i i worked on a basic form of

1712
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:56,960
self-awareness

1713
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,240
right um and also

1714
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,119
there is nice work on um

1715
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,200
um the the the touch and effective touch

1716
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:09,839
component

1717
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:14,559
right by uh maria laura philippe

1718
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,480
and laura cuccinelli they have a very

1719
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,400
nice review paper and a special issue

1720
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:18,720
that

1721
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,680
i edited it is called such a special

1722
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,280
issue

1723
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,000
called the relationship basic forms of

1724
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,280
self awareness and they have a paper

1725
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,640
there and actually there are quite nice

1726
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,040
papers there as well on this topic

1727
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,319
uh but more overall i wanted to say that

1728
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,280
you know i have

1729
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,640
um the twitter handle uh public

1730
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,079
and there is um i also have my website

1731
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,359
and uh the email address so i'm very

1732
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:46,160
happy to take

1733
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,760
uh emails and i can basically afford

1734
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,920
um a normal um you know complete

1735
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,319
reference because on the top of my head

1736
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,920
i'm pretty sure i left aside

1737
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,880
important references and i don't want to

1738
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,079
you know say i i

1739
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,599
you know i said this references i forgot

1740
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,359
those references i want to you know keep

1741
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,799
diplomatically so email me and i'm going

1742
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,000
to send you

1743
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,200
references what's interesting uh

1744
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,680
and it reminds me of the way that now

1745
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,640
the internet

1746
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,480
is allowing us to be in very tight

1747
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,680
feedback loops

1748
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,880
more like a co-embodiment of knowledge

1749
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,960
you're able to share your knowledge and

1750
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,160
your perspective

1751
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,200
on things and then somebody can ask a

1752
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,880
question and now we're in a very

1753
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,480
tight proximal communications wise cycle

1754
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,559
where we can actually uh update each

1755
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,880
other on oh it was actually this 2017

1756
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,480
citation she was talking about

1757
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,960
not the other one but if that was only

1758
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,640
uh once in a while conversation we

1759
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,160
couldn't actually develop

1760
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,079
at this rate so that's quite interesting

1761
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,240
again as adults who are co-constructing

1762
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,200
each other's

1763
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,039
ecological niche um

1764
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,359
okay one thought i had and if anyone can

1765
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,559
write more questions

1766
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,839
is in most insects so as an entomologist

1767
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:02,319
i

1768
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:05,200
was thinking of insects most insects lay

1769
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,240
eggs

1770
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,640
and you had said that um the placenta

1771
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,400
and the co-embodiment of pregnancy is

1772
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,280
universal

1773
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,520
and maybe it's mammalian in fact it's

1774
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,640
defined

1775
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,200
in humans oh yes yeah yeah universal to

1776
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,359
humans yeah

1777
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,559
so the egg for the insect contains

1778
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:23,520
everything it needs

1779
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,520
to get to the relevant life stage like

1780
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,440
to hatch from the egg and then be

1781
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,000
whatever

1782
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,799
stage of development it's in um except

1783
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:31,760
for the ants

1784
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,400
well there's other um exceptions here

1785
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,599
but in the ants

1786
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:38,799
the larva is um after the egg it hatches

1787
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,160
into a larva very quickly

1788
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,440
and then the larva is actually in a

1789
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,880
two-directional relationship and the

1790
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,720
larva are called the social gut

1791
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,119
and they have a one-ended gut and so

1792
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,160
they're being fed

1793
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,160
food and actually digesting it and in a

1794
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,839
two-directional hormonal

1795
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,680
relationship and so it was so

1796
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,680
interesting that it's almost like

1797
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,119
the length of the dialogue that the

1798
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,200
the length of the intergenerational

1799
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,160
transfer

1800
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,640
is it one day is it one year is it 18

1801
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,440
years

1802
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,599
is it permanent are we always

1803
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:08,799
co-creating

1804
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,160
the length of that handoff and the

1805
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,240
richness of the handoff seems to have

1806
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,280
something to do with

1807
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,799
the evolution of complexity so i was

1808
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:16,960
wondering what you thought about that

1809
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,359
yeah so this is amazing i mean i i mean

1810
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:20,799
when you look at nature it's like

1811
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,480
mind-blowing

1812
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,039
i mean i i i was about to say it's like

1813
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,319
we i mean

1814
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,760
i'm talking from a philosophy

1815
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,000
perspective i can safely say that you

1816
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,240
know

1817
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,559
philosophy has been kind of like

1818
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,680
adult-centric

1819
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,200
and you know uh you know human-centered

1820
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,160
anthropocentric right um uh but if you

1821
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,559
want to

1822
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,799
really understand this like how you know

1823
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,000
mind and body works

1824
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and you look at the the nature more

1825
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,119
general then you realize

1826
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,240
wow this is really fascinating and so

1827
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,079
um you know we can learn so much so

1828
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:55,760
you you you are telling me about the

1829
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,920
ants but i i recently read something

1830
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,599
because i started to be fascinated by

1831
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,200
this idea of like placenta

1832
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,359
right and i've read that for instance

1833
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,319
some lizards

1834
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,880
right so if you have exactly the same

1835
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,079
species of blizzard

1836
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,440
right and some of them lay eggs

1837
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,920
and some of them actually have babies

1838
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,480
right

1839
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,240
exactly the same lizard and you ask

1840
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,480
yourself why and then you realize that

1841
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,079
actually it depends

1842
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,680
on the climate where they are

1843
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,280
if they are warm climate or a cold

1844
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,079
climate right so if they are in warm

1845
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,480
climate they lay eggs because the sun is

1846
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,240
kind of like you know

1847
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,119
but if you are in a cold climate then

1848
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,960
you're going to keep the egg inside

1849
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,079
right

1850
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,559
and make the baby protect the baby

1851
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,160
inside right and then

1852
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,160
only after that baby kind of they safely

1853
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,760
put it into the world right

1854
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,839
so that's a very nice example of as you

1855
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:50,960
said it's like the

1856
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,920
the the flexibility and adaptability

1857
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,160
that we can have to actually know the

1858
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,520
make life happen and carry on right

1859
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,440
because in this case you basically have

1860
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,599
exactly the same body

1861
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,280
um but the way you carry

1862
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,000
on life is depending on exactly that in

1863
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,440
between interaction that you have with

1864
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,160
the

1865
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,799
environment right in a cold environment

1866
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:15,520
in one case

1867
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,160
and warm environment another another and

1868
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,880
that impacts the way you basically call

1869
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,000
you know the way you you know um

1870
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,039
self-organize and reproduce

1871
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,280
it is really fascinating i really hope

1872
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,960
that basically

1873
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,799
you know um animal scientists and you

1874
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:35,440
know

1875
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,400
human brain scientists would work hand

1876
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,480
in hand because i'm pretty sure will

1877
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,119
somehow unlock many of the so-called

1878
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,400
mystery of the

1879
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,160
human mind and human body just by

1880
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,319
looking carefully what is going on to

1881
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,200
our

1882
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,760
you know uh friends and neighbors right

1883
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,599
animals right

1884
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,599
it's an excellent point and in animal

1885
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,119
cognition especially

1886
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,200
it's phrased as like the development of

1887
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,559
the cognitive capacity

1888
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,240
as if that was the end point you know

1889
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,079
you go from zero to 60

1890
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,359
and then you're at 60 and then you

1891
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:06,960
cognitive decline you know tap on the

1892
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,520
brakes

1893
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,280
but there's a richness and it's

1894
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,960
different cognitive agents

1895
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,559
which actually brought me to this

1896
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,079
question which was um

1897
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,920
i was definitely with you that the adult

1898
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,119
centric perspective

1899
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,440
that you raised in your first anecdote

1900
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,400
at the um

1901
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,079
conference and it's oh it's all adults

1902
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,079
in the room so let's go

1903
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,720
with this that it would be fallacious to

1904
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,280
have a

1905
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,760
adults-only perspective and maybe it

1906
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,559
might be also

1907
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,000
somewhat of an error to have like a

1908
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,799
child only philosophy just whatever the

1909
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:35,200
child

1910
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,520
appeals to them let's just go with it so

1911
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,960
how do we structure

1912
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,440
in the intergenerational conversation

1913
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,480
and learn from each other

1914
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,839
yeah so that's that's a that's a big

1915
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,359
question

1916
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,760
so i i think for what we really wanted

1917
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,880
to do in this paper

1918
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,599
was like something very very modest

1919
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,960
namely to draw attention on the fact

1920
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,799
hey guys pay attention we have this lens

1921
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,440
yeah it's kind of like tacit let's clean

1922
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,280
it a bit and expand it right

1923
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,359
so i'm happy to basically expanded it

1924
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,799
and take that kind of like bottom-up

1925
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,240
perspective but obviously

1926
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,559
i don't want to bring everything to the

1927
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,400
to the root so to speak right would be

1928
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,280
like

1929
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,359
exactly the same fallacy to like focus

1930
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:20,960
just like like on the fruits like the

1931
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,440
apple

1932
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,799
in the tree and to focus on just on the

1933
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:29,200
roots right i think what really needs is

1934
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,640
an explanation of that dynamic process

1935
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,039
right

1936
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,359
how that unfolds how that emerged how is

1937
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,680
connected with the wider environment

1938
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,520
and with other minds other

1939
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,640
bodies other animals um

1940
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,000
i don't know if it's true i need to

1941
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,839
check but at certain point somebody told

1942
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,240
me

1943
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,319
i think i saw it on twitter that

1944
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:52,559
actually if you take a human body

1945
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,240
and you take the cells and the human

1946
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,599
body numerically

1947
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,160
actually have more foreign cells than

1948
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,000
actually human cells in your body

1949
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,400
numerically because all you have was my

1950
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,400
microbiota anything right

1951
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,599
so if you if you take just like the

1952
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:08,559
quantitatively

1953
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,480
then we basically are more than another

1954
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,000
than actually myself

1955
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,079
which is like i i need to check that

1956
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,359
information if that's true that's

1957
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,679
actually quite interesting

1958
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,839
one one thought on that um number of

1959
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,238
cells is actually the co-embodiment

1960
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:23,120
framework

1961
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,679
moves us beyond a numbers game for

1962
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:26,238
example

1963
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:27,759
there could be a very big system and a

1964
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,679
small system like the earth and the moon

1965
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,319
and yet the moon is relevant for this or

1966
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,679
that process on earth

1967
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,759
and that's because they don't have to be

1968
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,198
symmetrical if it was a

1969
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,960
tug of war then it enforces a symmetry

1970
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,920
which enforces a narrowness but actually

1971
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,238
it

1972
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:46,000
it doesn't really what if it was really

1973
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
influential cells or less influential

1974
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,880
cells

1975
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,198
that can be accommodated in an active

1976
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,880
inference um or in a

1977
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,198
dialogue based framework but less so in

1978
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:56,479
a sort of there's only one way to

1979
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,158
collaborate like tit for tat

1980
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:00,238
or game theory which is where a lot of

1981
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:02,158
the models of pregnancy

1982
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:03,839
uh just are still scratching their head

1983
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,600
right um

1984
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,399
here's a little of a meta science

1985
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,040
question

1986
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,198
if anyone else has any they can post to

1987
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,799
is it was really cool

1988
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,319
how you um demarcated

1989
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,399
your thoughts on being a philosopher and

1990
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,799
working with a formal theory

1991
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,679
so what are your thoughts on working

1992
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,279
with formalisms

1993
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,158
as a philosopher or working on these

1994
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:29,679
transdisciplinary teams

1995
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,359
where there might be colleagues with

1996
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,040
clinical psychological

1997
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,359
math and a philosophy background so how

1998
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,120
do we work together on these teams and

1999
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,640
address these topics that are really

2000
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,560
big yeah that's that's a that's a good

2001
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,560
question and

2002
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,719
sometimes it's like twitter is quite

2003
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,238
good for that because it's like he just

2004
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:49,679
wants me to get this like the

2005
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,839
this conflict in the nutshell so i

2006
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,439
remember somebody tweeted at some point

2007
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,400
you know when there's all this

2008
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,280
computational

2009
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,480
approach is kind of like emerging uh and

2010
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,400
uh regarding like the clinical

2011
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,880
population they were saying

2012
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,719
bad news for clinicians they would have

2013
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,159
to

2014
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,640
learn mathematics and statistics right

2015
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,719
to build computational models right

2016
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,560
and which somebody replied i said

2017
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,640
bad news for mathematicians and

2018
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,400
statisticians they will have to go to

2019
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,800
hospitals and talk to the patients right

2020
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,920
uh so there is i i like that

2021
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,600
kind of exchange because this is the

2022
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,360
problem that we have in the sense like

2023
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,000
we really need

2024
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,920
a dialogue between you know the world

2025
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,760
out there you need to go

2026
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,199
there talk to the patient gather the

2027
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,520
data observe the insects you know

2028
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,080
observe the human right you know um

2029
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,600
spend countless you know

2030
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,159
um hours is like measuring how many eggs

2031
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,199
you know what they're laying and

2032
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,280
everything uh and in the same time you

2033
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,719
also need something more rigorous that

2034
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,719
will allow you to basically you know

2035
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,280
build models that you know you know

2036
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,400
instead of like

2037
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,320
how should i put this is like as if you

2038
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,199
you you you test

2039
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,120
hypothesis instead of a testimony in

2040
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,360
real life you you let mathematics

2041
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,719
actually take the risk of that

2042
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,560
hypothesis and if it's strong that's

2043
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,000
fine because it's not going to

2044
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,719
die it's just a wrong hypothesis but in

2045
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,880
real life if you test hypothesis

2046
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,560
and you're wrong then actually you

2047
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,760
you may die right so i think that's

2048
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,600
should be a very nice dialogue between

2049
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,920
the two uh two approaches

2050
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,760
um should be seen like a sort of like

2051
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,679
dig in the same tunnel but from the toe

2052
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,840
opposites

2053
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,159
sides and hopefully meeting in in the

2054
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:36,960
middle

2055
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,040
uh personally i like so i'm i like to

2056
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,719
even though i have a philosophy

2057
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,719
background i like to consider myself as

2058
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:46,719
an interdisciplinary researchers

2059
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,920
so i have collaborators from all

2060
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,960
fields i collaborate with clinicians i

2061
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,280
call

2062
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,760
i'm doing experimental science so i'm

2063
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,960
running studies

2064
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,360
i'm collecting data i also collaborate

2065
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,280
with people on the more formal side

2066
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,080
so we're building kind of like you know

2067
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,400
um

2068
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,480
simulation and formal approaches to a

2069
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,960
certain certain phenomena

2070
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,440
especially connected with my main

2071
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,640
interests which is

2072
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,800
self-awareness minimal self-worth

2073
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,040
alteration of minimal self-worth

2074
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,600
um the relationship between the self and

2075
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,239
the

2076
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:23,600
body and co-embodiment and um so on and

2077
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,400
so forth

2078
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,280
but uh but yeah i i do and this is why

2079
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,320
this is where i

2080
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,199
said to the last in the last part of my

2081
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,880
talk in the last slide that i'm very

2082
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,040
open to collaboration

2083
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,880
uh especially on that side because i

2084
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,400
really need to i don't

2085
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,480
really think we reached a point where we

2086
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,880
basically need to have a dialogue

2087
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,520
because it's like uh we have so much

2088
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,560
information

2089
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,760
and we realized that this

2090
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,320
life out there the mind and the body and

2091
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,679
everything is so rich

2092
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,239
that we cannot we cannot solve it just

2093
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,159
like we just like one single discipline

2094
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,320
or one single tool we really need to

2095
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,360
you know join forces and um a dialogue

2096
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,520
it's going to be a bit more messier a

2097
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,560
bit more trickier

2098
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,760
because we don't have the same

2099
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,840
conceptual toolbox so we'll have to do a

2100
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,320
lot of

2101
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,640
work beforehand so to clarify

2102
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,280
what exactly we mean by that right in

2103
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,400
different fields

2104
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,920
and i think this is where philosophy can

2105
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,600
be useful because we kind of like

2106
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,960
obsessed with this idea

2107
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,960
what do you mean by you know give me a

2108
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,960
definition to make sure that actually

2109
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,679
we're

2110
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:29,520
we're not all over the map you know

2111
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,000
we're talking the same phenomena

2112
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,719
about the same phenomena but also i

2113
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,159
think it would be dangerous for

2114
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:36,960
philosophy to

2115
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,800
to somehow develop this conceptual

2116
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,199
toolbox completely cut off from

2117
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,760
whatever you know you know the the

2118
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,920
things out there the empirical world or

2119
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,360
you know the mathematical models

2120
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,440
actually showed us right so we need to

2121
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,560
keep those gates open and um you know

2122
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,080
exchange and dialogue and collaborate

2123
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,600
wow thanks for that awesome response

2124
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,960
um to call back to your beginning slides

2125
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,360
you had the armchair philosopher and

2126
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,800
that's a term that people know

2127
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,880
just like uh in america we say monday

2128
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,000
morning quarterback

2129
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,080
just like looking back at the past and

2130
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,000
um the armchair philosopher is not so

2131
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,560
different right and that made me think

2132
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,159
of i think therefore i am

2133
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,239
and the idea that by actually getting

2134
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,760
into some sort of altered state of

2135
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,560
inference

2136
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,520
by meditating or by doing some other um

2137
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,239
thought

2138
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:28,880
ritual it would be possible to reach

2139
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,400
insight through thought

2140
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,400
and the way that you just framed the

2141
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,760
answer was like

2142
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,560
hypothesis testing is an action that we

2143
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,679
take in the world

2144
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,920
it's not just a thought and when we

2145
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,679
frame hypothesis testing as

2146
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:43,360
action about the systems that we care

2147
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,840
about like the next generations

2148
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,480
then it makes us think about working on

2149
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,120
teams

2150
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,000
and on accountability and on

2151
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,920
reproducible science

2152
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,560
all these things that are sort of like

2153
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,600
on the side

2154
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,280
of the armchair philosopher and the

2155
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,800
armchair philosopher might also care

2156
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,360
about

2157
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,440
participation in science but that would

2158
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,120
be a secondary conclusion

2159
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,960
whereas if hypothesis testing involves

2160
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,480
stakeholders

2161
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,440
and it's also uh something that's

2162
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,640
happening in the loop it's a it's a

2163
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,719
different situation so it's just really

2164
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,120
like interesting i hope for those who

2165
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,000
are listening to

2166
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,320
hear what you're saying uh and actually

2167
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,280
i keep

2168
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,360
i i like to keep reminding my students

2169
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,120
that you know i i put a picture of the

2170
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,320
card

2171
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,239
because i'm french and he's the his

2172
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,360
friend just like the counter

2173
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,360
anyway but i could have been aristotle

2174
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,199
but i i don't know it's like those kind

2175
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:34,640
of like classic philosophy we need to

2176
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,760
keep in mind that

2177
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,159
these people are i mean aristotle was

2178
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,280
like biologists

2179
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,040
right he was like constantly dissecting

2180
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,040
things and you know testing things just

2181
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:43,520
like

2182
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,120
was like looking at what was going on

2183
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,520
with the organism so aristotle and he's

2184
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,040
considered to be

2185
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,840
a great philosopher and similarly with

2186
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,239
uh

2187
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,880
with the god i mean he was like a

2188
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,760
mathematician

2189
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,960
right and he wrote a treaty on optics

2190
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,800
right so it's like a vision and

2191
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,320
everything else so

2192
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,199
so um science and philosophy were kind

2193
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,400
of like working hand in hand and i still

2194
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,239
think they're actually working they

2195
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:11,760
factor like i

2196
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,280
really think that actually scientists

2197
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,120
they

2198
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,080
doing without realizing actually uh

2199
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:18,880
philosophy

2200
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,239
and uh some good philosophers actually

2201
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:23,440
they're keeping an eye

2202
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,880
or whatever is like scientists are

2203
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,480
discovering whatever nature is telling

2204
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,520
us right

2205
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,480
um because it's like this is a constant

2206
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,320
information processing writer we never

2207
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,159
get to the bottom rock of the

2208
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,640
reality right things are changing right

2209
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,199
uh

2210
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,679
it's like and i think what is really

2211
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:40,960
fascinating with this

2212
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,040
um example of the virus right let us

2213
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,480
let's take the virus because this is

2214
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,000
kind of like very recent and very

2215
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,520
rarely invented and very timely right

2216
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,000
now so if you are a classical

2217
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,760
armchair philosopher then you have a

2218
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,199
huge ontological puzzle

2219
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,199
with virus because it's like this is

2220
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:58,960
where it's keeping keep constantly

2221
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,080
mutating right

2222
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,320
and function of whoever is hosting

2223
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,280
him right uh or you know whoever the

2224
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,280
host of that virus is

2225
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,800
creates different type of mutation right

2226
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,280
uh and this is like it's an ontological

2227
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,800
puzzle for

2228
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,320
uh philosophies like what is the virus

2229
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,800
which is like coronavirus which one is

2230
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,920
like it's like

2231
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,760
and you you feel like saying was

2232
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,199
actually none of them and all of them

2233
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:27,840
right because

2234
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,840
somehow all that kind of like share this

2235
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,280
type of information but it's

2236
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,960
changing in function of whichever body

2237
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,760
of number of bodies and that depends on

2238
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,360
i don't know the culture and the food

2239
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,800
they're ingesting or

2240
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,960
i don't know different genetical

2241
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,440
components and so many other factors

2242
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,480
and i i i can literally say that we can

2243
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,280
literally see

2244
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,719
that actually this is like we literally

2245
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:53,040
have

2246
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:57,199
new beings coming you know new new

2247
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,400
entities arising like

2248
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,679
mutants mutant forms of like life

2249
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,719
it's like constantly arising so quickly

2250
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:07,520
right that

2251
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,480
we can't even you know wait a minute let

2252
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:10,960
me

2253
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,760
figure out what is going on right uh so

2254
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,520
i think we have a very nice

2255
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:19,600
and humble example example of how

2256
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,159
reality out there constantly is coming

2257
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:22,719
to us

2258
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,920
with like constant flow of like emerging

2259
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,480
information emerging creatures

2260
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,719
living being self-organizing systems and

2261
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,880
sometimes it's like well we can't seem

2262
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,440
that but

2263
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,080
actually they kind of like dangerous

2264
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,760
they can kill us

2265
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,360
uh with all our science you know

2266
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,320
um and that's i think that's a very

2267
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,199
important point

2268
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,000
we need to bear in mind yeah thanks for

2269
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,560
that it

2270
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,880
it made me think that it's not just

2271
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:51,600
emerging

2272
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,040
entities it's actually emerging

2273
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,719
interfaces and

2274
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,040
even if the number of entities were set

2275
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,360
the interfaces would still be

2276
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,760
combinatorial it would be explosions

2277
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,800
just like words

2278
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,719
even if the word vocabulary is set you

2279
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,640
still have interfaces that can emerge

2280
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,920
and then um as we say also here in the

2281
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,640
states

2282
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,960
putting descartes before the horse

2283
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,480
absolutely an error

2284
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,719
um but then it's actually kind of

2285
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:17,679
something that tells

2286
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,159
two layers of truth because it's

2287
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:22,560
philosophy and science that are working

2288
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,920
together and how we think about things

2289
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,560
and how we

2290
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,920
operate things and what do we hear

2291
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,920
right now other than that there's a

2292
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,760
disconnection between technology

2293
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,560
and society information flow governance

2294
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,760
decision making

2295
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,159
all these things you just you know spin

2296
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:39,600
around and pick a number

2297
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,199
and it will be related to something like

2298
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:42,800
that and so

2299
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,280
that suggests that there is a

2300
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,480
requirement for a new kind of a

2301
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,120
conversation

2302
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,640
yes i fully agree

2303
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,400
do you have any other thoughts otherwise

2304
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,800
this was really an awesome guest stream

2305
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,320
and we all look forward to hearing from

2306
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,480
you in the future but yeah you're always

2307
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,679
welcome

2308
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,120
you can come on whether you're the

2309
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,880
author or not

2310
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,960
yeah let's hope that you know uh this

2311
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,719
will kind of like develop more

2312
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,320
uh systematically and uh when i when the

2313
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,840
situation

2314
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,120
allows to basically you know

2315
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,880
uh organize a platform or perhaps uh

2316
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,360
a workshop in person meeting such as we

2317
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,320
can actually

2318
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,520
you know put this idea to work because i

2319
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,639
think that um uh

2320
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,600
just kind of like uh proximal

2321
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,280
face-to-face interactions

2322
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,760
have a different can can have a

2323
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,400
different

2324
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,159
type of outcome that you know the ones

2325
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:45,280
we can have right now uh so we can

2326
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,880
basically

2327
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,520
you know consolidate the collaboration

2328
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,400
dialogue on um

2329
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,120
on a more uh uh you know concrete and

2330
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,080
pragmatic

2331
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,040
basis uh what i really i realized that

2332
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,320
during the pandemic which was really

2333
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,679
really fabulous is that

2334
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:04,480
well uh as what's happening right now it

2335
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,159
never occurred to me that basically well

2336
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:07,920
well wait a minute we can have like a

2337
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,440
zoom conversation with somebody from

2338
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,920
california talking about this so just

2339
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,280
kind of like

2340
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,880
um you know crisis um

2341
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,280
you know brought up the surface new way

2342
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,320
of connecting

2343
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,960
right and make us um richer in a way

2344
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,800
but i also think that it's important to

2345
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,280
have that you know range of problems in

2346
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:29,840
place

2347
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,280
in the first place to keep the balance

2348
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,520
right right uh

2349
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,520
because we have evolved going back to

2350
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,520
the human nature and human organisms we

2351
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,040
have evolved to basically move and

2352
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,159
interact

2353
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:41,600
if we don't move we don't interact we

2354
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,600
simply die

2355
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,600
and uh we need to you know keep moving

2356
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,520
and interacting with each other and

2357
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,800
uh i think that's that's also um

2358
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,880
valid for different disciplines that's

2359
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,320
what we basically need to

2360
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,960
you know adapt and interact with each

2361
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:57,679
other

2362
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,560
as disciplines

2363
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,480
as active lab in online participatory

2364
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,199
lab

2365
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:08,000
we will co-embody that event in person

2366
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,120
when your region

2367
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,360
is available and when the personnel are

2368
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,159
there

2369
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:14,639
then we'll scaffold it in a new way

2370
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,239
because previously it was

2371
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:17,760
all in person there was never seen a

2372
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,360
need to live stream or never seen

2373
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,520
a need to document to translate to make

2374
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,560
it accessible

2375
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,040
to make it available and we'll be able

2376
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,040
to organize in a new way

2377
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,440
and be able to help each other in ways

2378
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,880
that we wouldn't have expected before so

2379
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,639
i look forward to it

2380
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:36,080
yeah me too great times

2381
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:40,320

2382
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,639
