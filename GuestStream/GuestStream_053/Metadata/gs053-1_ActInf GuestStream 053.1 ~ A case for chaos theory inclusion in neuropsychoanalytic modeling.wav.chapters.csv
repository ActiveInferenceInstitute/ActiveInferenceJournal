3750	100710	00:03	Presentation followed by discussion around the recent work of Alexei Tolchinski, a case for chaos theory inclusion in Neuro psychoanalytic modeling. If you're watching live, please feel free to add any questions into the live chat.	Alexei Tolchinski will discuss chaos theory inclusion in psychoanalytic modeling	Guest Stream
101370	553960	01:41	Mark Levin: New Project for a Scientific Psychology General Scheme is a revival of Freud's famous paper Project for Scientific Psychology. Levin: I think it may be beneficial for some of the harder conditions we work with to consider, including nonlinear framework. He hopes to open a dialogue between disciplines such as psychoanalysis and neurosciences.	Mark Levin: Nonlinear framework influences clinical work, diagnosis and psychotherapy	Project for a Scientific Psychology: Nonlinear Psychology
554410	851650	09:14	Freud said in the psychopathology of everyday life that there is nothing arbitrary or undetermined in the psychic life. It has been repeated by generations of psychoanalysts over a hundred years. But what you will not hear in psychodynamic culture is that that was an accident, that it was due to chance.	Daniel Marks: Freud's psychic determinism is deeply embedded in psychoanalysis	Sigmund Freud's psychic determinism
851730	1424046	14:11	The general theory of relativity would not have existed without these other geometries. You could have different spatial scales and convergence on one scale and divergence on another. What we could be looking at is a landscape with attractors and repellers that is very complex. But that landscape is dynamic. It moves.	FAP is compatible with chaos because you could have different spatial scales	Confusing Chaos and Active Inference
1424148	1507210	23:44	Researchers conclude diversity and variability of the EHE was the predictor of survival. Chaos and linear processes can be present concurrently at different scales of the brain mind. The operations required to compute prediction error from expectation are nonlinear. Higher entropy means life.	Diversity and variability of EHE predict survival, study finds	Inferring the brain's complexity
1508590	1579098	25:08	I'd like to talk a little bit about reduction. The second most popular term is oversimplify. They're necessary tools to simplify and to reduce. The map that equals the territory exactly is useless.	Daniel Dennett talks about reduction and oversimplification	In the World of Simplification and Reduction
1579274	1751960	26:19	Mark O'Brien: The predictive hierarchy composed of billions of homeostats is a powerful model. If homeostat is present at every single scale, then we have this homogeneity of mechanisms throughout the scales. How you do message passing, what is the common language is not a trivial question.	You talk about a predictive hierarchy composed of billions of homeostats	Predictive Hierarchy of Brain Systems
1752730	1871470	29:12	Acute trauma has a symptom of hyperarousal, suggesting possibly higher level of chaoticity. An onset of mania can be seen as a transition into a higher energy state. Just enough chaos imbalance could be perfectly fine.	The clinical applications, the landscape that I've mentioned before would be absolutely lovely	Causes of chaoticity in trauma
1871970	1896930	31:11	And I think my 30 minutes are up. Great presentation. Well, looking forward to this discussion. First, Mark, please feel free to add your reflections. Then Andrea, then we'll continue on.	And I think my 30 minutes are up. Thank you so much for your attention. Great presentation	A 30 Minute Discussion
1898900	2465624	31:38	Stuart: I know next to nothing about chaos theory. Chaos is not synonymous with randomness. It's rather synonymous with unpredictability. One tiny little error in your estimation of the initial conditions can lead to massive consequences. This is why it's so hard to predict chaotic systems.	Stuart: I know next to nothing about chaos theory	Predicting the brain's events
2465822	2677830	41:05	Mark: In order to survive and reproduce, we have to have a mathematical system to reduce chaos. Can we still hold the point of Freud's about psychic determinism? And I think if you apply not to the physics of just materialism, but to the living organism, I think we do.	Andrea: I'm fascinated by Alexia's work on chaos theory	Neuropsychology and Chaos Theory
2678570	3049950	44:38	Mark Bell: How we diagnose and think about what's happening is still a deterministic language. Bell: If we embrace the chaos theory, we can use appropriate mechanisms to diagnose and classify that fits the nature of the model. One paper says that we think like storytellers.	Mark: I think what's at stake is still unclear in psychiatric diagnosis	Determinism in psychotherapy
3050020	3275640	50:50	Mark: I have difficulties because when you see a psychotic patient, I don't see chaos or total unpredictability. I see adaptation, their disruptions. We cannot think probabilistically because it overloads the work in memory. We need tools to do that.	Daniel: I think we are missing or missing phenomenon by using deterministic tools	Psychic determinism and psychosis
3276410	3504560	54:36	Alexei: Not everything in psychoanalysis stands or falls by whether or not we accept this or that tenet of Freud's. In neuropsychoanalysis, we try to draw upon all of the traditions within psychoanalysis. We are hoping to resolve some of these theoretical disagreements.	Albert: We must remember that psychoanalysis is not synonymous with Freud	Neuropsychoanalysis and the Beyond
3504980	3644190	58:24	There are certain things that we see with regularity. The deeper layers are the unconscious ones. Their things are pretty stereotyped, pretty predictable, in fact, too predictable. As we head toward the pre conscious and conscious there, things are much less predictable.	I think psychical determinism comes down to how predictable things are	On Psychical Deterministicism
3645540	3929736	1:00:45	Alexi: How do you help somebody who is in a state, who comes in disheveled? And how does one go about helping aiding somebody in that state? Alexi: I think there is a strong case to be made for a mathematical way of processing the world.	Alexi: I'm perhaps the least qualified here to comment on your paper	Neuropsychology: The Chaos of Patients
3929918	4135320	1:05:29	Bryn Brin: I see Alexi making a real stable of concepts or portfolio of topics. What if that inference were able to be understood in the context of an attractor landscape? Could we take it beyond the diagnosis and maybe even beyond the clinician's concept, directly into the hands of the patient?	Bryn: I see Alexi making a stable of concepts in his paper	Inference and the neuroscience of epilepsy
4136030	4462240	1:08:56	In psychoanalysis, we've long ago moved away from DSM and ICD type diagnosis. We use systems, you say that there's a certain number of drives and you use those to pass what you're seeing clinically. Daniel: Alexi is offering us a language, an additional language, which we might find useful.	Daniel: When I asked Alexi what was at stake, his main answer was diagnosis	Alexi on the DSM-5 and psychoanalysis
4463410	4777830	1:14:23	It is much easier for us to think in categories, even in the psychoanalytic world. To some degree, it's a human condition to put things in categories. The whole process is premised on chaos, but in bite sized doses.	Daniel Friedman: It's human condition to put things in categories	Non-Categorization in Psychoanalytic Studies
4778570	5085660	1:19:38	In our last minutes, if each would like to give some thoughts, where do we go? So maybe Albert, Brynn, Mark and then Alexey, what are your overall thoughts, reflections? And then where are we heading?	In our last minutes, if each would like to give some thoughts where do we go	A Psychoanalytic Meeting
5087650	5167118	1:24:47	Alexi, final words. I want to thank everybody and Mark and Brynn and Albert and Daniel, Andrea, thank you. One of the other reasons is kind of the time we live in Yuval harari made that comment that the rate of change is accelerating. We must minimize uncertainty in everything.	Alexi: We tolerate uncertainty better now than when hunter gatherers existed	A Taste of Change
