3750	4300	1	A	0.75794	00:03	1	You.
6350	34622	2	B	0.99997	00:06	64	Hello and welcome, everyone. This is guest stream number 53.1 at the Active Inference Institute. It's August 23, 2023. We are going to be having a presentation followed by a discussion around the recent work of Alexei Tolchinski, a case for chaos theory inclusion in Neuro psychoanalytic modeling. So if you're watching live, please feel free to add any questions into the live chat.
34766	46070	3	B	0.60406	00:34	28	Otherwise, we will now have the presentation followed by a discussion with our excellent panelists. So thank you everybody for joining. And Alexi, to you for the presentation.
49130	63882	4	A	0.99767	00:49	31	Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Mark, for finding the time. I'm very grateful and excited to talk about this. Thank you, Andrea Brynn Albert. I hope maybe Mike will join us.
63936	76880	5	A	0.94	01:03	25	And thank you, Daniel And, active inference institute, for organizing this meeting. So, can you see the slides? Yep. Okay, so I'll just proceed then.
79190	107754	6	A	0.99379	01:19	76	This is the outline of the talk. I'll share some preliminary comments and talk briefly about assumptions in the current models, summarize the data, talk about free energy principle formulations as compatible with chaos, and talk about some future developments. And hopefully we can discuss that. I'm very much looking forward to have more questions than answers. I'd like to start with what Michael Levin taught me, I guess, is just why it's important to me.
107792	141162	7	A	1.0	01:47	83	The most important thing is the clinical applications. I think that with your work, Mark, and with Pang SIP's work, we have been moving away from dualism over the course of some time. But I think the other big d determinism is still highly prevalent and dominant. And I do think it influences our clinical work, diagnosis and psychotherapy and assessments. And I think that it may be beneficial for some of the harder conditions we work with to consider, including nonlinear framework.
141326	184914	8	A	0.91562	02:21	100	That's my main focus. This is the link to the preprint. And the paper is published fully in Neuropsychoanalysis Journal. Some of it is discussion with this foundational paper that you, Mark, wrote, the new Project for a Scientific Psychology General Scheme, which is a perhaps revision, a revival of Freud's famous paper Project for Scientific Psychology. And I'd like to give you credit, Mark, that you have been opening conversations between disciplines that hadn't been talking to each other prior to your efforts, such as psychoanalysis and neurosciences, you've been doing for more than 20 years with great success.
185112	215494	9	A	0.99999	03:05	78	In the same spirit, I wanted to mention that Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology exists since 91, which is when their first conference happened, about less than 20 years. Then the first conference on chaos in Lake, Italy, around Lake Italy, lake Como in Italy in 76, which was mostly physicists at that time. And then psychologists joined. And I've attended the recent conference in Toronto, which was absolutely wonderful. And I've met extraordinary clinicians and scientists.
215542	223920	10	A	0.99	03:35	28	And I think that it would be beneficial to open that dialogue as well. And maybe if there is a wall between us to consider demolishing the wall.
227490	264810	11	A	0.99991	03:47	104	In terms of intent for the paper, you, Mark, pointed out to me that you've had an exchange with Robert Gallitzer Levy. For those of you who may not know him. He's a psychoanalyst from Chicago, a psychoanalytic writer and teacher who wrote a book on non linear psychoanalysis and deserves a lot of credit for his advocacy and he's sharing his thoughts. He posed a question to you, Mark, of possibly considering nonlinear components in that seminal paper, your Project for Scientific Psychology. And to which he responded that the key point in such discussion was whether the mental apparatus was indeed nonlinear.
265150	297426	12	A	0.99912	04:25	94	So I took your comment as a task, as a challenge, if you wish and decided to write a paper about it. I don't know if the data presented is sufficient, but I tried, and very clearly I don't intend to contradict or criticize. That would be funny of me to do. I'm hopeful maybe to add a branch on this tree that you're growing, clinical and theoretical tree. And should you consider it worthwhile to go in this direction we wouldn't have to change very much because this is the paper by Friston.
297458	321374	13	A	0.43266	04:57	63	Lancelot de Costa and others called Stochastic. Chaos and Marker blankets. Free energy principle is compatible with the chaotic attracting set. What I thought was not present just yet was a formulation where the attracting set experiences a phase transition. And I took liberty to ask Karl about it and he shared some very nice thoughts that I will, with his permission, share.
321412	349186	14	A	1.0	05:21	63	At the end of the talk, I'd like to cite Maxwell Ramstead, whom you know, and his colleagues from the paper and Bayesian mechanics of physics, often by beliefs where they talk about dynamics, mechanics and principles. And in physics, Kepler's work is descriptive. It shows what the orbits of heavenly bodies are. Mechanics are the how of the dynamics. This is Newton's.
349218	371214	15	A	0.9924	05:49	64	Laws and principles are prescriptive. They are about why things work this way. There's a certain hierarchy in physics where you could derive the second law of Newton from principle of least action. And then if you have initial conditions, you could calculate the dynamics. The reason I'm mentioning that is, I think, Mark, your new project for scientific psychology is a high road.
371412	407690	16	A	0.95696	06:11	117	It seems to start from first principles such as the free energy principle and then you seem to derive things down from there. So I thought, why not try to see how the low road may look like? If in addition to these derivations and deductions and declaration of what entropy should be in the brain what if we measure it in Animal Studies and Human Studies in Health and Pathology and see what the data shows and whether or not the low road meets the high road in the middle? Or perhaps something may need to be added. I also like to clarify why I spend time in the paper talking about obvious things for everybody.
407760	446854	17	A	0.99871	06:47	98	Here the axioms and postulates. And I'm quoting here Edward Frankel, who is a mathematician at you know, Michael will forgive me, but viewpoint is that one can say that some parts of biology can be seen as based on chemistry, which can be seen as based on physics, which can be seen as based on mathematics. So how do things work in mathematics? We know that Karl Frieston likes to translate nearly everything he works on into the language of mathematics. Classically there's something called a formal system which we can metaphorically compare to building a house.
446972	465702	18	A	0.9901	07:26	54	So the foundation of the house is a set of axioms that has certain qualities. And then we build things up using the logic of Aristotle. And we derive things like theorems. An example would be Euclidean geometry, which is on the plane that is based on five axioms of Euclid. That's the foundation.
465846	500230	19	A	1.0	07:45	101	And then you could derive things like Pythagorean theorem. Now, if we were to change just one of the axioms in the foundation, the entire house changes. An example would be the fifth axiom of Euclid that parallel lines essentially don't intersect. If you change that then we could have a house on the sphere which is Lobozevsky Riemann geometry and meridians on the earth are parallel and they intersect or you could have parabolic shape where parallel lines also intersect. So we'll have an entirely different framework and it may be naive to expect the theorem to look the same.
500300	553960	20	A	0.96	08:20	132	The Figurian theorem, if we put it on the sphere is different, the formula is different. I'm mentioning that is because I love multidisciplinarity and I think that's the way of the future with that sometimes when we cross over into another discipline such as psychologists taking mathematicals or physics ideas then we may occasionally forget this formal system thing. For example, when we say things like human beings resist or violate the second law of thermodynamics then the second law was formulated for closed systems in the state of equilibrium such as a sealed chamber of gas and human beings are neither closed nor in the state of equilibrium so it doesn't quite apply. It's a different formal system. One needs physics of open systems to make a statement like that.
554410	597814	21	A	0.99773	09:14	113	So again, in mathematics because you mark seem to have taken us deeply in the main of mathematics in your project you have differential equations for action, perception, precision you have mark of blankets, random dynamical systems equivalences, partial derivatives. Then in mathematics people fix the set of axioms, they fix the definitions and then they build a theory, right? So I want to be clear, I want to clarify what are the axioms in the theory that is built? What is the foundation? And in the effort of time, maybe I'll talk about just one of them which is Freud's psychic determinism and this is a question for me, not an answer.
597932	624750	22	A	1.0	09:57	73	I wanted to ask you because I'm assuming whether you kept this axiom or you changed it. So Freud said in the psychopathology of everyday life that there is nothing arbitrary or undetermined in the psychic life. There's different versions of this statement and it has been repeated by generations of psychoanalysts over a hundred years. And it became very entrenched. It's sort of a cultural meme and a major tenet of psychoanalysis.
625970	657398	23	A	0.67269	10:25	69	If I were to give an illustration, perhaps those of us who are not in psychoanalytic therapy, then let's imagine an analytic therapist hearing a patient who intends to say same with an S, but they use the word shame, right? So such a phenomenon. First of all, I think psychodynamic, psychopathic therapists would probably say that's not an accident. Okay? Accident is not a used term in psychoanalysis.
657494	689970	24	A	0.54	10:57	82	And secondly, they will probably infer of what it might mean, for example, infer along the lines of unconscious or emotional dynamics, emotional conflict. Somebody else may infer that it may have neuropsychological reasons. Somebody else may infer that it probably is a migraine. But what you might will not hear in psychodynamic culture is that that was an accident, that it was due to chance. I think that chance accidents, randomness stochasticity chaos are not used, they're bad form in psychoanalysis.
690550	709078	25	A	1.0	11:30	51	And that is the illustration of, I think, for its assumption. Ultimately it's an axiom. It's a belief that is not questioned. If we were to translate that assumption in the pristine language, this is the long givan equation from which pristine starts, which has notations by Daniel. Thank you, Daniel.
709174	745798	26	A	0.92	11:49	103	And we have the change in the state of x equals the flow plus the omega. Omega is the Stochastic know, in Daniel's metaphor we have a wave and then we have ripple. So we would have to change the Stochastic component if we were to go with the Freud's axiom. And then if we do that, we would find ourselves squarely in the domain of cold physics, Newtonian physics, Laplace's demon. LaPlace famously said, give me a position and momentum of every particle and I'll tell you exactly where they have been before and exactly where they will be in the future.
745964	760780	27	A	1.0	12:25	51	Now, Freud didn't make statements like that, but this is what would happen if you kill the Stochastic component. I want to be clear that it's not Freud's fault at all. Well, first of all, you need axioms to build a theory. He chose that axiom. That's the theory he built.
761150	798710	28	A	1.0	12:41	93	Second of all, it wasn't exactly mathematics. And finally, the zeitgeist of the time was deterministic. Perhaps there were initial derivations of Stochastic mechanics and quantum mechanics. But Freud, when he was learning the world of deterministic physics, was dominant. And there's an important nuance in this discussion pointed out to me by the first peer reviewer of the paper who said, listen, if you have something that changes like a Stochastic thing and then you apply statistics to it, such as variance, then the variance of a changing variable will be deterministic.
799210	815420	29	A	1.0	13:19	53	And then if we look at things like words which are used a lot in talk therapy like apple. An apple is a semantic memory. It's a category. It's a coarse grading already from green apples and red apples and all other kinds of apples. So in that regard, words are deterministic things.
815790	865610	30	A	0.9982	13:35	138	So perhaps when we have a dream analysis session and the patient shares with an analyst the movie that they saw the messy irrational thing with images and tunes and anything and maybe words, even if they narrate it, then they slow things down, they average things out and they put it in deterministic tools, which is words. So with some objects we can apply deterministic tools. But I want to point out that the foundation that everything and anything in the psychic life that all the munications have no stochasticity randomness is a very strong assumption. And I'm curious what would happen if we were to allow ourselves to see things on the sphere, on the parabola shape. It's not a bad exercise because the general theory of relativity would not have existed without these other geometries.
866350	895622	31	A	0.99956	14:26	89	In terms of definitions, this is a familiar formula that you mark use of Shannon's entropy. He originally wrote about telegraph and sender and receiver in a fixed alphabet. But here if we draw an attracting set which happens to be Lorenz attractor in phase space and we look at these I don't know if you can see them, they're small. The white know that's the initial condition and then they spread out and evolve as time goes by. But you can see the density of the attracting set.
895676	922286	32	A	0.64877	14:55	68	It is higher density and lower density. So we could calculate probability distribution. A slightly different question is this what would happen if you were to change the initial condition a little bit 1 mm in phase space, different things can happen. And one of them is shown in this diagram that would be divergence. And the formula here is initial condition multiplied by exponent of lambda T.
922388	951634	33	A	0.99958	15:22	78	So when lambda is positive, you have divergence and it's called lapin of exponent. And that's one of the criteria for chaos. When it is negative, we have convergence and when it is zero we have equidistant trajectories, we have Newtonian mechanics. This is an illustration of a chaotic system which is a great red spot on Jupiter. And it fits perfectly the Friston's paper about the mark of blankets and stochastic chaos because that thing is stable.
951682	987758	34	A	0.99998	15:51	124	We have been observing it for 300 years and one could say that this elliptical shape is the mark of blanket around the chaos that maintains its integrity. It's not a contradiction because in one spatial scale you have mark of blanket and on another spatial scale you have a chaos within the marker blanket. This is a convergent system that is a bit trivial to all of you. This is a hole in the ground and then surrounded by hills on all sides and if you were to put a ball on the hill, it's going to roll down in the potential. Well, and typically in phase space, we'll call the bottom of the hole an attractor and we call the hills repeller.
987854	1016394	35	A	0.98529	16:27	85	Repeller is a term less frequently used, but it's the highly unstable point in phase space from which things move away from and they move toward the attractor. Now, that's just one attractor. The interesting things start happening. If you've got two of them, imagine a second hole immediately to the right and the boundary between them may very quickly become chaotic. Here's another illustration on a convergent system from the active inference textbook that I hadn't read when I was working on the paper.
1016432	1034370	36	A	1.0	16:56	59	I discovered it later. The chart on the left is the density. And again we see high density in the center and we hate lower density in the periphery. And the chart on the right is surprise. We're very not surprised to find a ball in the center, and we're very much surprised if it stays on the hill.
1034710	1080670	37	A	0.86	17:14	123	And I'll read you a citation. Active inference is restricted to systems like that one on the left, which counter random fluctuations with their average flow and thereby retain their form over time. It may sound like the statement contradicts what I said earlier, that FAP is compatible with chaos, but it doesn't because you could have different spatial scales and convergence on one scale and divergence on another. I also historically think that we have been studying converging systems mostly so far. Now, if we move from things like that, which is very simple, to a mind or consciousness, then I think that what we could be looking at is this that's a landscape with attractors and repellers that is very complex.
1080830	1112950	38	A	1.0	18:00	91	And I'm going to quote the former president of the Chaos Society for Psychology is that that landscape is dynamic. It moves. Perhaps some things on it are stable. If we were imagine a clinical scenario where there's a patient who is very prone to shame and very averse to express anger, then we could say that shame is an attractor and anger is a repeller. But we work with pattern things in dynamic therapy so they could be relatively stable until the work in therapy makes them more shallow distributions.
1113030	1135410	39	A	0.99561	18:33	68	But certain things change overnight. Some things change in a week or during the course of therapy. So I mean, strictly speaking, that's a dynamic landscape, and I don't think we model things this way. I'd like to also quote Maxwell Rammstead from the same paper that free energy principle is a tale of two densities. It would be incomplete to say that we just minimize one variable.
1136790	1172720	40	A	0.99953	18:56	79	What happens is we minimize the Shannon's entropy of probability distribution over sensory states, while at the same time we maximize entropy of internal beliefs, which is very important. That's adaptation. If somebody has rigid internal beliefs with sharp probabilities and then COVID happens, they will have lower probability of survival. They're not adaptable. So adaptability means maximization of entropy of internal beliefs while maintaining the forum means the minimization of Shannon's entropy of probability distribution over sensory states.
1173810	1207702	41	A	0.57594	19:33	82	Here's another term, Kolmogorov Sinai entropy that is not intuitive and it's from topology. The picture you see is the photograph of the statue called Intuition outside the Fields Institute of Mathematics in Toronto. Here's a graphical illustration. If you were to draw the trajectories in phase space and surround it by a certain volume, say a circle with the radius epsilon, and ask yourself what happens to this volume as they evolve? Well, when it expands, then you can have chaoticity.
1207846	1232100	42	A	0.99232	20:07	70	When it becomes more compact, you can have convergence. When it stays the same, you have periodic system, which is indicated on the chart on the right, where you have a correlate of the colmorphs in entropy on the y axis. And you have this epsilon on the x axis. So the flat line at the bottom where the circle doesn't change is the periodic system. Omogorovsina entropy stays zero.
1232470	1248850	43	A	1.0	20:32	49	The curved line in the center that converges on a K is the proper chaos. This is theoretical chaos. And the upshoot from it is what Friston calls stochastic chaos. This is chaos plus noise. And then you can have pure noise and then you can have pure linearity.
1248930	1273662	44	A	0.99001	20:48	70	So all of these things exist, they're all on the table. You can have geometry on the plane, geometry on the sphere, geometry in the parabolic shape. So what does the data show? And when we look at EEG entropy, people use approximate entropy, permutation entropy and spectrum entropy, which are all derivations of colmorefsini. And the first two are in different phase space from the last one, I believe.
1273716	1311082	45	A	1.0	21:13	90	Mark, correct me if I'm wrong. You cite Go serious study in your book Hidden Spring when you talk about entropy and phases of sleep. And they use spectrum entropy, which is a derivation of colmorov Sinai in the frequency domain analysis phase space. So the data shows that systems as small as the axon of a squid isolated in the lab to single neurons to coupled neurons to EEG, we have evidence of positive lap enough exponents in some regimes of operation with EEG. We can be more specific.
1311216	1362758	46	A	0.99987	21:51	135	That algorithm seems to be weakly nonlinear, while things below alpha like delta seem to be more periodic with noise. And things above alpha such as gamma and high gamma seem to be chaotic. So if we were to summarize this data, then we can say that comogorous entropy appears to increase as generalized arousal increases from delta to gamma rhythm, comogorous and entropy seems to be higher in healthy, alert, brain mind functioning than in the states of coma, seizure, deep sleep. And it can stay close to zero in a coma or deep sleep. The interesting anecdote here is that a simple act of closing your eyes when you're alert decreases Comography entropy clinical applications are vast and developing fast, for example, except for clinical psychology, I must say, in psychiatry and psychotherapy.
1362854	1389294	47	A	0.99874	22:42	70	But in neurology, the seizure detection on the EEG right now can be done with AI with about the same accuracy as a human neurologist. And that algorithm does use chaoticity assessment. There's models for Parkinson's, neuropathic, pain, and I have other examples that I'll skip for right now. This is a graphical illustration of phases of sleep. And again, it has colmob Sinai entropy as a phase of sleep.
1389422	1411510	48	A	0.99007	23:09	62	It shows wakefulness and then shallow sleep, progressively deeper sleep and REM. And that's the time evolution. If you move REM in frequency to where it belongs to wakefulness, then you'll see the same progression that comographs and entropy appears to increase as a function of generalized arousal. This is seizure onset at about second four. Seizure is a reduction in chaoticity.
1411590	1425360	49	A	0.99988	23:31	38	Healthy functioning is higher chaoticity than a seizure. This is a coma, which is relatively invariant theta and delta frequency. This is a nearly periodic system with some noise. And death is a linear system. It doesn't change.
1425730	1472058	50	A	0.99934	23:45	116	This is persistent vegetative state, minimally conscious state, where researchers were asking a question on prognosis of survival and they've concluded that diversity and variability of the EHE was the predictor of survival. Higher entropy means life. So the hypothesis is that chaotic stochastic and linear processes as well as hybrid ones, such as primarily chaotic functioning with noise can be present concurrently at different scales of the brain mind or at the same scale, but in different places or at different times. I realize it's a mouthful, but it fits the data presented in the paper. This is again a picture from the textbook enough to inference by Thomas Parr, Karl Friston, and Giovanni Pizzoulo.
1472154	1507210	51	A	0.9509	24:32	90	It's a cortical column. And the errors you see here, ascending and descending connections, if by chance you're not familiar with the framework they correspond to, the ascending errors are prediction errors and descending ones are predictions. This is what they say in the book, that there's an asymmetry in message passing. And the reason for that is that the operations required to compute prediction error from expectation are nonlinear. This nonlinearity is due to computation of predictions using nonlinear functions that tend to increase the frequency of the signal.
1508590	1520102	52	A	0.99948	25:08	36	I'd like to talk a little bit about reduction. It became very fashionable and sometimes silly to use this like, oh, you're reductionist. No, you're reductionist. And the second most popular term is oversimplify. You oversimplify.
1520166	1532402	53	A	0.74	25:20	32	Now you oversimplify. And to me, they're not bad words. They're necessary tools to simplify and to reduce. The map that equals the territory exactly is useless. Nobody's going to use it.
1532456	1559130	54	A	0.99111	25:32	79	It must kind of I'm quoting James Quick simplify and, you know, I'll illustrate the specific term. If the car is moving with a fixed velocity on a straight line and if I know exactly where it is right now, I can tell with certainty where it has been an hour before. That is a reduction in time. And I can do that because the formula is linear. It's distance equals velocity multiplied by time and velocity is constant.
1559550	1589054	55	A	0.99922	25:59	81	If the watch is broken and I disassemble it and I find a faulty part and then I put it back together and it works, then it's a reduction in space. And I can do that because watch is not an end colony to use Daniel's terms. Watch is equal to the collection of its parts. So I wanted to talk about, Mark, your mention of the predictive hierarchy composed of billions of homeostats in your work. This is approximate picture.
1589102	1615530	56	A	0.99995	26:29	79	This is not the exact picture of what you talk about in the new project. And this is from your hidden spring. It's a predictive hierarchy where predictions flow from left to right and prediction errors from right to left. And one of the statements in the book in the Hidden Spring you say that brain's many complex functions really can ultimately be reduced to a few simple mechanisms like this. So it appears that you call it reduction.
1616030	1633986	57	A	0.99996	26:56	54	But it is a powerful model. It is a flexible model. I wanted to describe some features of it. Well, first of all, if homeostat is present at every single scale, then we have this homogeneity of mechanisms throughout the scales. And I want to say that in physics things don't look this way.
1634088	1644402	58	A	0.99963	27:14	26	Quantum mechanics is the microphysics. Statistical mechanics is molecular level. Newtonian mechanics is heavenly bodies. And then we have general theory of relativity. There's qualitative shifts.
1644466	1675520	59	A	0.8918	27:24	92	There isn't a homogeneity of mechanism all the way throughout. In fact, when people say take entanglement and they apply to human beings, that's sort of a misunderstanding of entanglement. The second comment is from Mike Eleven who talks about these scales. And if his comment is that you could have different functional spaces at every scale where you could solve the genetic task on one scale, electrochemical on another, morphological on the third one. And then how you do message passing, what is the common language is not a trivial question.
1676210	1707660	60	A	0.99999	27:56	92	Along the same lines, I've already mentioned that a message between the scales can be nonlinear if you do prediction errors. Now if you take one nonlinear message and then you multiply it by billions, you're going to have a full on turbulence, which is a chaotic system, it's a dynamical system and turbulence you cannot reduce to homeostat or anything else. Saying that water consists of H 20 does not explain turbulence. So I don't know, that's an open question. But I wanted to maybe share some perceptions of this model.
1708190	1741726	61	A	0.99719	28:28	101	This I talked about and this is the Friston's thought about phase transition and the attracting set. He said that if you have a hierarchy of Lorenzo tractors, a slower one and a faster one and a slower one governing the transitions of the faster Lorenzo tractor, then you could have a FEP formulation with an attracting set experiencing changes and transitions. And that's brilliant, I think. And it matches the anatomy because the brainstem and the subcortical structures appear to be slower. Lorenzo tractor that could be seen as governing the transitions of the cortex, which is astral Lorenzo tractor.
1741918	1768098	62	A	1.0	29:01	82	I know I'm oversimplifying things a great deal, but it sort of misses his thoughts. I think him and Lancelor de Costa are working on that. Perhaps Maxwell Ramstead's group is working on that as well. The clinical applications, the landscape that I've mentioned before would be absolutely lovely to see if we were to consider going there borderline personality disorder or another term for that could be complex trauma. The metaphor that we use for these patients is they're predictably unpredictable.
1768214	1803926	63	A	0.97668	29:28	115	That the only thing we know on Wednesday that we don't know what's going to come up. Suggesting chaoticity acute trauma has a symptom of hyperarousal, suggesting possibly higher level of chaoticity. An onset of mania can be seen as a transition into a higher energy state and addictions, particularly with stimulants, can be seen as phase transitions into a chaotic state. It may sound like what I said now is contradictory to what I said before when I suggested that lower chaoticity could be a problem, such as an onset of a seizure. And here I'm saying higher chaoticity can be a problem, but that would only be a contradiction in the linear world.
1804108	1828890	64	A	0.99964	30:04	78	In the real world, where linear is very small percentage of what's happening, I'm saying both that too little and too much chaos could be a problem. Just enough chaos imbalance could be perfectly fine. This is a graphical illustration of what can be done. This is from my colleague and friend David Pinkus, who is a professor in Sheppin University and I think also former president of the Society for Chaos and Psychology Society. These are trees.
1828970	1875278	65	A	0.58205	30:28	129	It may sound like completely unrelated to what we do, except if you look at a human lung or dendrites in a neuron and you can see a healthy tree on the right from me and a nearly dead tree on the left. And if you do the fractal assessment, fractal dimension assessment on them by counting the thickness of branches and count the number of branches at each level, then you can quantify and then you can have approximate quantification of health and resilience versus pathology. And again, as exotic as it may sound, this is very similar to what people do when they detect a seizure on the AG. They measure CD correlational dimension, which is approximately fractal dimension. And I think my 30 minutes are up.
1875364	1876990	66	A	0.99994	31:15	7	Thank you so much for your attention.
1880260	1893970	67	B	0.99897	31:20	26	Thank you, Lexi. Great presentation. Well, looking forward to this discussion. First, Mark, please feel free to add your reflections. Then Andrea, then we'll continue on.
1895540	1929788	68	C	0.99911	31:35	71	Thanks very much. When Alexi asked me if I would join this panel, the first thing that I said to him was yes, coupled with. The second thing being, but please be aware that I know next to nothing about chaos theory. So I'm not sure how much of a contribution I can make to a technical discussion of this kind. So I'm just repeating that before I say anything else.
1929874	1974844	69	C	1.0	32:09	103	If I say anything that sounds amateur, that sounds as if this guy doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to chaos theory. It's because I'm an amateur and I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to chaos theory. That said, the second thing I want to say is I'm not entirely sure what is at stake here. It seems as if Alexei feels that it's really important that I and our colleagues get our head around chaos theory and bring some of what it has to offer into our field. Because I don't know much about it.
1974882	2014036	70	C	1.0	32:54	86	I don't know what's at stake, you see. I don't know why that's important. So perhaps somewhere along the line in the next just less than an hour that we have, perhaps, Alexi, you can clarify that for us. The third thing I wanted to say is, and perhaps in order to illustrate the first thing is that as Alexei was talking now, it seemed as if he was talking about chaos, as if it were synonymous with stochasticity or randomness. And that's not my understanding.
2014228	2059444	71	C	0.99958	33:34	88	My very limited understanding of chaos theory was that it's not synonymous. Chaos, as used in that science or in that theory, is not synonymous with randomness. It's rather synonymous with unpredictability. Because we don't know the initial conditions of the system, or we can't specify all the variables with sufficient precision in their initial conditions, it becomes impossible to predict. And because of the nature of the interrelationships of the variables, one tiny little error in your estimation of the initial conditions can lead to massive consequences.
2059572	2104500	72	C	1.0	34:19	97	And this is why it's so hard to predict chaotic systems. So if that is what is meant, then I would say, Stuart, of course this applies to the way that the mind works and the way that the brain works. But that leads me back to my second point. I'm not sure what's at stake, but I would say, if that's what you're asking, if that's what you're claiming, rather, Alexey, then I would say that surely must be so, that it is exceedingly difficult to predict mental and neural events at any level of complexity.
2106540	2147110	73	C	0.98	35:06	88	Now, I think I've said three things. Let me now say a fourth thing. I think that a crucial well, let me put it this way. Of course, what the brain and mind are trying to do, it's a matter of trying to predict what's going to happen. So what I've just said about how difficult it is to predict what's going to happen in the brain or mind it's almost the same thing as to say that the mind and brain are trying to model the world.
2148200	2211912	74	C	0.99998	35:48	124	That's the main thing that we are trying to do is have a good model of the world so that we can get some sort of grip on this chaos, so that we can act rationally in the sense that we can act in order to preserve ourselves that we do not dissipate by just exploring all possible states and no longer existing as a system. Because we, as systems, need to remain within certain bounds across a great many variables. As you said, we can't afford to just let shit happen and throw ourselves to its fates. We need to try to predict in a very unpredictable world. What must I do in order to meet this need, given how the world works?
2212046	2240768	75	C	0.96467	36:52	58	So the brain is trying to model the world. Our predictive model is trying to synchronize itself with the world. And for that reason it's going to be very chaotic. But the crucial point is it's trying to reduce the unpredictability. With that said, I'll make a fifth point, or maybe it's another part of my fourth point.
2240854	2282688	76	C	0.98845	37:20	99	No, I think it's a fifth point, which is that the way that I conceptualize the predictive model and it's not me alone who does this is that it is a hierarchical model. And I think that's very important. And perhaps here's where things do start, where it starts to at least in my mind, I start to see some of what's at stake. I think that the more peripheral layers of the predictive model I see the predictive model not as a triangle, but rather as an onion. So the core is the deepest layers of the model.
2282854	2342356	77	C	0.80264	38:02	113	That is to say, the layers that have the greatest spatial and temporal generalizability and they're the most stable layers of the model. And as we move toward the periphery, which coincides with the periphery of the nervous system, in other words, the encounter with the outside world, so it becomes more chaotic, we can tolerate more unpredictability at the periphery and that also allows for greater accuracy because the world is so unpredictable. We have a more chaotic outer layer of our predictive model where things also there's less that's at stake. Is that car going to turn left or right? Well, I thought it was going to turn left, turn right.
2342378	2373752	78	C	0.57783	39:02	58	So what? Doesn't matter. But is the car going to obey the laws of gravity that matters more? That's a much more consequential surprise if it does not. And perhaps that's a silly analogy, but at least it illustrates the general point, our most heartfelt beliefs, and that is to say, the deepest layers of our predictive hierarchy.
2373896	2407850	79	C	0.99987	39:33	71	There we find the same patterns over and again and we are more certain of our predictions and we act more stereotypically in accordance with them, whereas at the periphery that does not apply. So I think at one point in your presentation, Alexi, you were saying something like one size doesn't fit all. It's not all, just one mechanism. All the way down. Of course, I completely agree with that.
2409260	2436192	80	C	0.99915	40:09	70	It's not just one mechanism. The different homeostats that you were referring to on there different scales are also serving different needs and there's not a common currency. I think that's a very important part of how consciousness works. Why we have qualia at all is because we can't reduce things to a common currency. We're dealing with categorical variables, at the very least, in relation to our bodily needs.
2436246	2465624	81	C	0.97351	40:36	74	They are categorically distinct needs and they need to be treated as such. And this is why we have different feelings in relation to these different categories of free energy. So those are some of the main things I wanted to say just to get the ball rolling. I'm mindful of the fact that Andrea Clarici only has 15 more minutes with us. So maybe I can pick up on some other points later.
2465822	2470830	82	C	0.99996	41:05	12	But at this stage, let me hand over to Andrea. Thank you.
2483390	2500030	83	D	0.99635	41:23	36	Can you hear me now? Yes, sorry. I will try also to articulate something of the very fascinating paper of Alexia. I must confess, since I'm also a psychoanalytic psychotherapist, a psychiatrist. It's not my field.
2500100	2559470	84	D	0.99709	41:40	110	I'm not a physicist, so I can really say few words. Some is of, as I said already, fascination, because in general, I hate to stick to rigid theories. So if there is a paper like Alexia who can chaoticize my theories, even in psychoanalysis, in the workings of the mind and the brain, I'm happy to dive into it. At the same time, I don't have the skills to discuss the math part of his papers or even the physical formulas and so on. But I was reminded of a very early and I think you all know that book Jacques Monot Chance and Necessity, which is a classic.
2559630	2604042	85	D	0.99	42:39	74	And I think it's a book in which you can from scratch. I mean, here that our aim in the world. And I know I'm sounding theological, but we have theological aims. In order to stay alive, we have to face chance and chaos. So I think this is in order to survive and reproduce, we have to have a mathematical system to reduce chaos and to bring up again determinism or psychic determinism.
2604186	2638394	86	D	0.99924	43:24	60	Since one of the points that Lexie, I think, raised is can we still hold the point of Freud's about psychic determinism? And I think if you apply not to the physics of just materialism. Of. Things, actually, but to the living organism, I think we do. This is my point, and I would like to hear what Alexia says.
2638512	2665780	87	D	0.99984	43:58	48	In the end, the chaos theory. Mathematics, as far as I understand it, must be a mathematics who reduce chance or chaos to a linearity, at least in the living organism. And I wonder if and what Alexia thinks about it, because he seems to disagree with that.
2669530	2682970	88	B	0.96417	44:29	39	Want to give a direct response, lexi or then Brynn and Albert be awesome to hear your takes as well, some of the thoughts from Mark and from Andrea. Should I start by responding to Andrea's points or marks?
2686430	2735898	89	A	0.99994	44:46	154	Maybe I'll start by because I think the key point that Mark you brought up is what's at stake is still unclear. My impression is, and please correct me if I'm wrong I was very influenced, Mark, by your paper. I forgot exactly, the journal where you talked about psychiatry world, how these sort of convention based diagnosis of here is a major depressive disorder, here's a bipolar disorder, nothing of which has to do with etiology convention and statistics. And then you brought up this revolutionary thing with effective neuroscience where you talked about the manic state and the depression state and tied into the punk subsystem, I think is extraordinary. But what I wanted to say is if we look at how we diagnose and think about what's happening, and we look at the language of how we do it, it is still a deterministic language at the end of the day.
2736064	2755738	90	A	0.99961	45:36	58	So when we moved from DSM Four to DSM Five, we brilliantly discovered that continuous variables exist. We used to have buckets. Everything was in a separate bucket. And then we said autism is a spectrum, and everybody applauded, but mathematicians were quietly laughing in the corner. Because, of course, continuous variables exist, but we don't do dynamics.
2755834	2773186	91	A	0.98388	45:55	55	We're still very static. Here's this clear cut thing. And this is the clear cut continuous thing, right? And my impression I may be wrong, is that even in our neuropsychoanalytic developments, we still do things deterministically. We assess which bucket things belong to, or maybe two buckets at the same time, or three buckets.
2773298	2800682	92	A	0.99313	46:13	67	But we don't do things like how the chaotic systems are qualitatively different from static things. I'm quoting William Solis. They have transients, they have contextuality, and they have emergence. We don't do know. And I think that if we embrace the chaos theory, if we do things like correlational dimension assessment or fractal dimension assessment, starting from the system of classification of emotions, they're still buckets.
2800746	2818834	93	A	0.99838	46:40	47	Here is a clear cut thing called fear. That's a clear cut thing called rage. Buckets determinism, okay? And they look differently in the dynamical systems world. And then the system of psychopathology could look like correlational dimension changed and not that somebody fell into a bucket.
2818962	2844074	94	A	0.51561	46:58	76	If we look at this complex landscape of attractors and repellers and examine psychodynamic things like please forgive me if I'm incorrect, but one of the possible definitions of repression could be seen as not letting things into consciousness. Maybe we can call it suppression. But what I'm trying to say is I don't want to think that right now. It hurts. It's a painful thing that in the terminology that I shared, is a repeller.
2844202	2869362	95	A	1.0	47:24	71	And perhaps when you work through things in a psychodynamic, psychotherapy, perhaps you put a scar tissue on the wound, it becomes less of a sharp repeller, and it smooths out. We don't diagnose like that. We don't treat like that. We don't think like that. One paper that I'm working on that is in peer review right now and I can't share too much, says that we think like storytellers.
2869426	2888826	96	A	0.99959	47:49	61	I'm quoting Daniel Kahneman. Our thinking mind of a clinician is not a statistician. We don't think in probabilities, we think in labels and we think in stories. And I know you had this powerful quote, Mark, from Freud who said that that's the nature of the mind. And I most respectfully disagree that that's the entire nature of the mind.
2888928	2922962	97	A	1.0	48:08	89	I do think that we have things on the mind that are not stories and not words. So if the nature of the phenomenon is chaotic and stochastic and periodic, then we can use appropriate mechanisms to diagnose and classify that fits the nature of the model. The second thing you said chaos and stochasticity, I absolutely agree with you that they're different. On the chart that I've shown, if you converge to a stable, chaos is deterministic, forward deterministic. So if initial conditions are changing, they will diverge.
2923026	2935434	98	A	0.99997	48:43	40	But you can predict things forward, not back. But there is no formula in a stochastic thing, you throw the coin. You don't know. You have no predictability whatsoever, short term or third or long term. So they are different.
2935552	2970342	99	A	1.0	48:55	118	And in the sense that you're talking to sensitivity, to initial conditions, this is music to my heart to hear you to say that you acknowledge that curioticity clearly is present in the brain, on which level of the hierarchy in your model is a very important thing. But again, when we draw this picture, whether it's a triangle or an onion with a core and layers, it's a static model. And when you acknowledge that there's higher unpredictability toward the periphery, it could be, but there could be dynamics about the structure of the model. And perhaps what you're saying is survival. Like I must breathe and I must breathe air and I'm not in the water.
2970396	2997002	100	A	1.0	49:30	75	And that is a very stable prediction. Absolutely. But when we deal with psychopathology and we deal with things like shame and pride and awe and other things, then I wonder if we should continue to use this metaphor of a homeostat. I really don't see how homeostat applies to gamma written in the brain or to shame. And homeostat is the convergent systems so that you minimize entropy by keeping things in the range.
2997066	3008050	101	A	0.99967	49:57	33	However, if you dive inside the homeostat, if you look at the temperature variation inside a narrow range, you may see chaos, which is exactly the picture that I saw, that I showed.
3011030	3034214	102	A	0.99	50:11	55	And to Andrea's point about the Freud's principle of psychic determinism yes, I honestly think that we haven't said goodbye to that. We haven't tried to say that chance exists in the mental life. Accidents exist. We don't do that. There's a firm tradition in psychoanalytic, psychotherapy, to say there's no accidents it's all determined.
3034342	3039260	103	A	0.99778	50:34	16	That's a major key point of the discussion. I don't know if I said too much.
3041870	3064558	104	B	0.99985	50:41	63	Maybe, andrea, if you want to give any thoughts or how do you want things to continue in the coming minutes and years? Okay, thank you. Thank you, Daniel. Just adding a word that I didn't use because I think it's very important about trying to defend the point about psychic determinism, which I'm very fond of. I mean, the word is adaptation.
3064734	3126280	105	D	0.52	51:04	104	I have difficulties because when you see a psychotic patient, when you see a borderline patient, well, I don't see chaos or total unpredictability. I see adaptation, their disruptions. I try to understand what are the even the part behind that, in my opinion, has to have a tendency toward an order, which is adaptive. In this way, I see the mathematical part of chaos may be of use, but bringing to an explanation maybe not to an order or to a determinism, but to a point in which there must be this adaptive reason even in the chaos. Do you see my point?
3127930	3143514	106	A	0.99	52:07	47	I do. But I think there's a deeper issue about how we know. Say there's a clinician psychoanalytic psychotherapist. We have a working memory. And the Miller's law that, Mark, you quote a lot about the seven units of information in the audio verbal work in memory.
3143562	3168866	107	A	1.0	52:23	85	I think in the Miller's paper, he actually said seven chunks. So I'm sharing something from the paper in Review right now. We cannot think probabilistically because it overloads the work in memory. This is why when I'm a clinician, I think about psychosis, I come up with a story, a formulation that fits in the work in memory, and this influences our work. We don't have the mathematics in here to think in the terms of probabilistic things and chaos theory and other things.
3168968	3181958	108	A	0.99996	52:48	48	We need tools to do that. And in mainstream neurology, they use tools. They do talk to the patient that examine the patient. But they have MRI, they have EHE, they have Pescan and all the other things. In psychoanalytic psychotherapy, we say, we don't need any tools.
3182054	3205578	109	A	0.9945	53:02	72	We just talk to a person, and that is sufficient for everything we do. But that's not necessarily true. Beatrice Bibi, who is a psychoanalyst, works with mother infant diet, and there's zero words exchanged zilch. But she looks at this movie that she records on a video camera, and then she shows it in a slow motion. So she takes a flow, which is dynamic flow, not words, not discrete things.
3205684	3225974	110	A	0.99	53:25	63	And then she slows it down and she shows the level of attunement between the mother and the child. We don't do things like that. We talk and we use these deterministic things to understand the psychopathology of the patient, saying that's psychosis and that's schizophrenia, and that is bipolar one. This is panic system and this is seeking system. We determine everything.
3226172	3236310	111	A	1.0	53:46	34	And that is a limitation because inside, I believe what is a fear cascade? How does fear stop? It's a flow. It's a turbulent thing. And we put one label on it, say fear.
3236470	3257534	112	A	0.99514	53:56	55	We've classified it. So for some things it's appropriate, but for some things, it may not be, as Einstein said, as Mark. You quoted Einstein as simple as possible, but more simpler than that. So at which point we are missing or missing the phenomenon by using deterministic tools in our work. Thank you, Alex.
3257662	3262274	113	D	0.99169	54:17	15	Thank you. Thank you, Daniel and Mark. To everyone. Thank you. I have to go.
3262472	3269670	114	B	0.99957	54:22	12	Awesome. So Albert and then Brynn and we'll continue on this topic.
3271690	3279900	115	E	0.99142	54:31	21	Yeah, thank you for the presentation and a very interesting discussion so far. One thing that comes to mind is. The.
3283470	3302160	116	E	0.93285	54:43	42	Well, the thing we're talking about right now, the psychic determinism as depicted as being a foundational law in psychoanalysis. Well, I'm thinking about the authors, the psychoanalytic authors who came the prominent ones who came after Freud, who seem to. Have.
3305730	3346410	117	E	0.54755	55:05	98	Room for this chaos. Maybe they didn't use this term explicitly, but I'm thinking, for example, Wilfred Bjong, who's got the notion of the O layer, which has connotations of well, the thing that cannot be known or categorized, who has, like, indeterminate elements of the mind. And that's one of his major contributions to psychoanalysis. On the other hand, more the French schools. I'm thinking of Jacques Lacan, who's got the notion of the real, which is also one of his major contributions to psychoanalysis, where notions of rupture, of absence, or of lack are very prominent.
3346850	3361890	118	E	0.99233	55:46	34	I'm not sure I'm not an expert here, but I think Lacan explicitly challenges the notion of Freud's mechanistic worldview in one of his seminars. So I'm wondering what you think about this, Alexei.
3364470	3384134	119	A	0.95971	56:04	44	I'm not an expert in Lacan at all, and I know Wilfred beyond in a limited fashion. So perhaps Mark is a better person to talk. And I like Freud. Particularly mark's interpretations and translations. But maybe Mark can comment on Lacan and beyond.
3384262	3388220	120	A	0.8763	56:24	7	I'm not sufficiently knowledgeable about their work.
3394000	3431776	121	B	0.99972	56:34	70	If you want to Mark or Bren, you can share some thoughts. Yeah, please. Well, I think that the point that Albert's making is we must remember that psychoanalysis is not synonymous with Freud. That not everything in psychoanalysis stands or falls by whether or not we accept this or that tenet of Freud's. And in neuropsychoanalysis, we try very much to draw upon all of the traditions within psychoanalysis.
3431908	3495170	122	C	1.0	57:11	119	And we sort of fondly believe that we'll be able to find more common ground because there are greater empirical tools available in neuropsychoanalysis than in psychoanalysis by itself. We are hoping to resolve some of these theoretical disagreements, trying to move beyond just different systems of belief, trying to move more toward a psychoanalysis in which we can decide questions in an ordinary scientific way. But it will always be very difficult for exactly the reason that Alexei's whole talk is about, I suppose, which is the extreme complexity and therefore unpredictability of the phenomena that we are dealing with. So I think Albert's points are valid. That the beyond's approach, Lacan's approach, they add a great deal.
3497300	3535096	123	C	0.98907	58:17	89	They don't have as much to lose if we throw out the principle of psychical determinism. But having said that, let me just quickly say a word about psychical determinism, because this has been a big part of what Andrea picked up on in what Alexey said. I think it comes down to the question that I asked at the outset. It's not a matter of is the behavior of the mind random or it's a question of how predictable. It's not a matter of is there no determinism?
3535208	3564288	124	C	0.63899	58:55	82	It's a matter of how easily can we trace effects back to their causes. So the fact that there's a great deal that goes on where we can't do that. There are many things our patients say, whether they be slips of the tongue or anything else of that kind, and not only to do with parapraxes, but anything that they do. There are certain things that we see with regularity. I mean, the very phenomenon of transference is all about regularities.
3564464	3599840	125	C	0.99993	59:24	75	That there are certain things that we see. Yes, I can understand this happens repeatedly. I think I can explain that with reference to certain aspects of the patient's inner world and their past, but there's a great deal else that we can't. So I don't think that it's a kind of either there's determinism or there's stochasticity. I think that this is why I was talking also about the layers of the predictive hierarchy.
3600340	3630872	126	C	1.0	1:00:00	53	The deeper layers are the unconscious ones. Their things are pretty stereotyped, pretty predictable, in fact, too predictable. I mean, in other words, it over generalizes, it's too confident about its beliefs. But as we head toward the pre conscious and conscious there, things are much less predictable. So I won't say more.
3631006	3696364	127	C	0.62	1:00:31	135	A couple of things in what Alexei said in his comments after mine, that if we have time, I'll come back to but I think let's rather hear from Brin before I say anything more. Thank you so much. I'm perhaps the least qualified here to comment on your paper, Alexi, but I do have one or two thoughts, and they come from a place of being very fortunate thus far in my life to have been a patient for many, many hours, sometimes on the couch, and also to be a clinical psychologist. I failed to mention that in my introduction. So I'm a was until recently, when my foray began into more research based areas, and via the Active Inference Institute and Mark's work and Cole Friston's work, I was a pure clinician.
3696412	3744930	128	F	1.0	1:01:36	89	I had it in my mind that I was going to treat psychopathology to the best of my ability. But really it was being a patient first and foremost that brought me into closer contact with the theme of your paper and certainly the themes of Mark's work. And I think I've encountered it from both areas. And certainly to my mind, it matters less the inner workings of the degree to which chaos stochastic, all these big wonderful terms that I'm only beginning to even think about. But.
3748580	3823464	129	F	0.9998	1:02:28	136	What matters to me is that how do you help somebody who is in a state, who comes in disheveled? And how does one go about helping aiding somebody in that state? I fell out of love with psychoanalysis for personal reasons, but it was in returning to it, I've become more kind of better acquainted with its strengths and its limitations. And I'm realizing that when you help somebody and manage to reduce the noise, to reduce the chaos in somebody's mind, when they become the greater degrees of health start returning to them, that they do rely far more, whether they know it or not, on probabilistic reasoning in their daily kind of functioning. And so I think there is a strong case to be made for a mathematical way of processing the world.
3823582	3895184	130	F	0.50824	1:03:43	157	It doesn't have to necessarily be made conscious to the person. It can be a bit overwhelming to try and impart that on somebody. But I think a brain that is not working properly, regardless of the degree to which there is chaos, that can be measured or quantifiably measured in that brain, somebody is tripping over themselves because they are unable to predict what might happen. And that is a terrifying prospect because I think there is some reliance and some staunch dependability on the fact that the sun is going to rise and that it's going to set and that I can then focus on other things. So that's just my comments more from kind of a personal front of being a patient and encountering the limitations of psychotherapy and what I would have done in those moments of need to have not, as you say, had a more deterministic view of what was happening.
3895382	3937832	131	F	1.0	1:04:55	84	And I've tried to transfer that or carry that over, rightly or wrongly, into my own therapy as a psychotherapist. So a more personal thing of what it means to be feel chaotic and what I see, regardless of how confirmed it is or not, but chaos reigns and to try and not compound that is certainly something that I'm interested. Yeah. Thank you, Bryn. I'll also give my thought on what's at stake and what's on the table as a total non clinician.
3937896	4007376	132	B	0.99709	1:05:37	169	But what I saw in Alexi's paper and also what I see people coming towards I see the paper as Alexi making a real stable of concepts or portfolio of topics ranging from the first principles of active inference like surprise bounding, to dynamic stochastic chaotic, which not the same thing, but they sometimes cohabitate. So bringing a set of concepts into play, making it matter for the field so that it can matter for the clinician, so that it can matter for the patient, which is where you totally brought it home to Brin. And in my totally simplified model, I was seeing all this diagnostic machinery from personalized data, EEG recordings, all these surveys and samples, all the different conversation therapy itself, all these different measurements, inference. And then it passes through the Markov blanket of the diagnosis, and it's like, well, now we know that that person is X or they have X. And then here's where we now branch back out with modalities of treatment.
4007408	4058320	133	B	1.0	1:06:47	115	And so that bottlenecking has obvious relevance in terms of getting a categorical grip on what we basically all agree are wetware complex systems, they're sensitive to initial conditions, all of that. And what if, though, like you brought up the example with the scar tissue, maybe it's literal bodily scar tissue, maybe it's conceptual scar tissue. What if that inference were able to be understood in the context of an attractor landscape? And it's not just a singular attractor, so we have multiple attractors, we have a chaotic landscape. And so what if we were able to perforate that blanket, speaking super loosely, to bring in what we have already recognized as diagnostically relevant?
4058400	4077560	134	B	0.99998	1:07:38	48	Like the fact that patients who have differential entropy have this or that epileptic outcome or coma outcome, bring in that machinery that led to the diagnosis, but now take it beyond the diagnosis and maybe even beyond the clinician's concept, directly into the hands of the patient?
4085690	4093900	135	A	0.99903	1:08:05	29	Thank you so much. Perhaps we can hear from Mark and yeah, I'm not eager to talk. If there is time, I'll say something, but if not, that's OK.
4095950	4119220	136	C	0.99965	1:08:15	60	Well, let me first of all say something about my might. Some of you have noticed that suddenly everything went black behind me. That's because I'm in South Africa where they have power problems. And then a kind person in my household thought that they would help. And they've put this huge spotlight here which is shining in my eyes.
4123910	4156138	137	C	0.99704	1:08:43	78	If I look as if I'm in a rabbit in headlights, it's because I am. I sent a text message saying, please come and remove this big lamp you put here. But they don't seem to have received the message. Now back to our actual topic. To the extent that I'm able to not be distracted from it, I think that when I asked Alexi what was at stake, his main answer was to do with a diagnosis.
4156234	4208554	138	C	1.0	1:09:16	102	Now, I don't mean that he's saying that that's all that's at stake, but I think he's saying this illustrates what's at stake. So I want to first of all make sure that because I'm not sure who our audience is and who's going to be watching this in case anybody misunderstands, I want to make clear that in psychoanalysis, we've long ago moved away from DSM and ICD type diagnosis. We always thought that the psychiatric nozology was wholly artificial and created divisions where they don't exist in nature. And we replaced it with a far more dynamic. Approach to diagnosis.
4208602	4242346	139	C	1.0	1:10:08	73	And it's not just a matter of labeling. It's a matter also of what kind of thought process lies behind the diagnosis. In other words, conceptualizing what's going on here, rather than saying, this is an instance of personality disorder, and I'll specify which type, we don't think like that in psychoanalysis, and really, we never have in neuropsychoanalysis. We build in that same tradition. I think that what Alexei was worrying about.
4242528	4279542	140	C	0.77296	1:10:42	95	He's saying, yeah, but you use systems, you say that there's a certain number of drives and you use those to pass what you're seeing clinically. And yes, we do, and we have to, because you can't just say, what I'm seeing is chaos. What you've got to say is, well, what I'm seeing is chaos, but let me try my best to find the deeper structure of this. And so what we do is much the same as what I was saying earlier about how brain and mind work. Likewise, the clinician's mind works.
4279596	4320020	141	C	0.99999	1:11:19	101	That way we have some deeper concepts that organize what we see, and then more on the surface, we see the complexity. In other words, we don't think that we can reduce a patient just to one saying, this patient has problems with this drive, or something. It's not as simple as that, of course, but we do start with saying, well, these are the drives, these are the attractors. To put it in terms of the attractor landscape that you're talking about, these are the preferred states of the human phenotype. And in mental life too, they are preferred states.
4320630	4342906	142	C	0.99916	1:12:00	46	There are certain attractors that we're trying to stay in. Those like, for example, fear. We want to be safe, we don't want to feel fear. With respect to attachment bonding, we want to stay close to our attachment figures. We don't want to lose them.
4343008	4381718	143	C	0.70187	1:12:23	94	With respect to rage, we don't want to be frustrated and have things standing in our way. We want to be able to have free access to the objects of our needs and so on. Those are these attractors, and we have great difficulty staying in those homeostatic bounds. It is a dynamic picture. And then over the question of the different drives, there's the highly individualized predictive model that each one of us comes up with in relation to those drives and in relation to the conflicts between those drives and so on.
4381804	4435400	144	C	0.95653	1:13:01	134	So I think that this way of thinking that we use in psychoanalysis and neuropsychoanalysis is already of the kind that Alex is calling for. So I think that what Daniel's just said is therefore perhaps very important to make clear it's that he's offering us a language, an additional language, an additional I don't just mean language, I should say an additional set of concepts and a highly developed one, which we might find useful. And so we should take this on board. That sounds very convincing to me, if that's what's at stake here. That Alexei is saying this is a language that lends itself to the phenomena that you study and to the way in which you go about studying it, then it sounds to me as if Alexi is right.
4436110	4480214	145	C	0.98798	1:13:56	110	So that's the main thing I wanted to say in response to his comments in relation to what I said. So if anyone else wants to say anything else, that's good with me. But Alexi, if I've misunderstood and if there's something else that you think is at stake that I'm not getting, now's your chance to say it. Well, I just wanted to end the conversation when you said that if this language might be of any even to consider this language in our future models, I'm a happy man and there's nothing else I need to say. And I just wanted to say that these are human things.
4480252	4507710	146	A	0.90511	1:14:40	63	They're occupational hazards. Some of the things I'm talking about, this paper I'm working on about narrative stuff, is that, of course, it is much easier for us to think in categories, even in the psychoanalytic world. What we do let's take the Macquillium system and the previous one. We used to say three levels of functioning neurotic, borderline psychotic. These are categories.
4508130	4517762	147	A	0.99001	1:15:08	26	They're not DSM categories. They're not bipolar one, but they're categories nonetheless. Then we have character styles, obsessive character style, histrionic character style. They're categories. Okay?
4517896	4542198	148	A	0.70193	1:15:17	79	So to some degree, it's a human condition to put things in categories. And I do think that this is a very strong historical reasons that we think this way. We have generations of thinking this way in categories. And yes, at the end of the day, when we paint a portrait of a patient, it's developed, and it's like a tapestry. All of these things weave into one another, and it's complex, but we start from basic categories.
4542294	4576674	149	A	1.0	1:15:42	81	And certainly if we consider that some things can be transient, there can be emergence, they're like that. Certain behavior in one context is a compulsion, but it's not a compulsion in another context. And perhaps I'm saying trivial things to clinicians and also what dream you said just to comment when you said as a patient to reduce the noise and reduce the chaos. I detect the bias in the language. You see how we call psychopathology in DSM disorders.
4576802	4589414	150	A	0.77702	1:16:16	44	Disorder is a bad word for us. And I'm trying to say chaos is healthy. I spend most of my day in gamma functioning, which is a chaotic state. It's not a bad thing. So in the folk language, chaos is a bad word.
4589452	4636934	151	A	0.71172	1:16:29	133	Disorder is a bad I want to put things in order, and then perhaps we're missing something. What comes to mind is, I think, Mark, you had meetings with Michael Levin and Ian McGilchrist, who know big on talking about the mechanistic, logical, linear, straight and narrow left hemisphere type. Of course it's not left hemisphere, but that's the model versus holistic sensorial kind of right hemisphere artistic type. And we're missing the second part, like Daniel's background is surrounded by art where we spend less time in the right hemisphere, maybe appropriately so, but I think that there's some things that lend themselves to that level of understanding and we break things. We look at psychopathology and a human suffering like it's a carburetor sometimes, where we again put it in buckets.
4636982	4645980	152	A	0.99976	1:17:16	22	That's my impression. But what you said is wonderful and I don't contradict with anything. I agree with everything you said, Mark.
4648610	4651230	153	F	0.52758	1:17:28	6	Alexi, if I can just comment.
4654210	4698154	154	C	0.97476	1:17:34	88	It'S. Almost like an arc. The pot of gold at the end of the arc is the reduced chaos, the reduced noise in terms of the patients from the patient's perspective. But how you get there, ironically, is actually by inducing states of tolerable chaos and then kind of reformulating that, reconsolidating that chaos. So it's not that from the healing or growth or whatever the patient might present to you for it has everything to do with minimal or marginal chaos induction and then reintegration of that.
4698192	4731606	155	F	0.99257	1:18:18	77	So the whole process is premised on chaos, but in bite sized doses, maybe one could say, right, and just to. Finish up and then I'll stop talking. Jonathan Schadler, who all know and know, widely respected as a psychoanalytic practitioner and teacher and writer, he recently said that take a patient X with an analyst Y together the diet has emergent properties. That is not the same thing as patient X with the analyst Z. Right?
4731708	4746038	156	A	1.0	1:18:51	43	And show me one study where we take that into account. We don't. We just do random clinical trial, then we do metaanalysis of random clinical trial. What technique did the therapist use? They used, you know, whatever four letter therapy they applied.
4746134	4761858	157	A	0.90543	1:19:06	42	Nobody looks at the emerging properties in a diet. This matrix between the two, and that's the language of dynamical systems. This is Daniel Friedman ant colony. A single ant doesn't build bridges and grow mushrooms. Ant colony does all those things.
4761944	4777830	158	A	0.99984	1:19:21	38	We don't talk about emergence in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, do we? It's true. It's also a fundamental challenge. After all, you can't replicate within one Dyad or across Dyads in a finite world. So it does point to fundamentals.
4778570	4800190	159	B	0.99909	1:19:38	50	In our last minutes, if each would like to give some thoughts, where do we go as we now the opponent of exponent away from each other in our paths? So maybe Albert, Brynn, Mark and then Alexey, what are your overall thoughts, reflections? And then where are we heading?
4804290	4817730	160	B	0.9971	1:20:04	26	Go for it, Albert. Yeah, I was about to comment on Alexey about the emergent properties thing. It's kind of the same point I made earlier.
4820310	4828360	161	E	0.96421	1:20:20	18	Later psychoanalytic theories do talk about emergent properties. But yes, I think as what Professor Salvage just mentioned.
4831530	4859838	162	C	0.99243	1:20:31	57	This new set of. Concepts makes it very practical for us to communicate with each other because psychoanalysis has a bad habit of reinventing new concepts every new decade. So there's a lot of chaos to use that word within psychoanalytic discourse. But overall, I thought I'm very grateful. I think this was a very interesting talk.
4860004	4861700	163	E	0.92069	1:21:00	4	So yeah. Thank you.
4863830	4884680	164	B	0.99956	1:21:03	34	Thank you. Yes. By way of closing remarks, I agree with actually, it seems to me that there's an abundance of agreement in this meeting. I don't see any big controversy. So that's nice.
4886250	4941430	165	C	1.0	1:21:26	101	I think what Brynn said really captures it. I liked it because what he said was so experience near. He was just describing what it feels like to be a patient, to be in a state of not knowing and uncertainty as opposed to a more stable kind of tranquility. And then the ability to allow yourself to return to uncertainty if you've found answers that are too simple and that are too static to allow ourselves to go back into this state of not really knowing. That, I think, really does describe what we try to do for our patients.
4941510	4978390	166	C	1.0	1:22:21	86	What we have to remember applies to ourselves not only because we are ultimately patients too, but because it applies to how the mind works. It applies to science, how science works, that we do need to find order, but there is disorder out there. And so we're always at risk of coming prematurely to a rigid system of belief and we have to return back to the coalface and back to the chaos. But ultimately, where we want to be is back in that valley.
4980490	5045302	167	C	0.96	1:23:00	125	And so, as much as Alex is right to remind us that the highest levels of brain activity in many senses of the word are entropic and that deep sleep and seizures are bad things, as much as that's true. Nevertheless, I think that the great trend of the mind it's one of its fundamental working principles is we are wanting to be more certain. We want life to be more predictable. We don't like to be in chaos. And I think that that's an important thing to remember while we are acknowledging the importance of chaos and of the highly unpredictable nature of the world and of the phenomena we study in our field, nevertheless, we retreat from it, and for very good reasons.
5045446	5049120	168	C	0.99742	1:24:05	8	So those are my closing remarks. And thank.
5052310	5084262	169	F	0.84	1:24:12	78	And I'll be very brief. Alexia, just thank you for the paper and for having such a strong focus on the patient and on psychopath well, on the human condition. I think that's so nice to have that come out of the paper when at first glance it doesn't seem to be there. So thanks for making it so human and then just Daniel for organizing and to spend time with Mark and Albert. It's a great pleasure.
5084326	5112302	170	F	0.97942	1:24:44	66	So thank you very much. Alexi, final words. I want to thank everybody and Mark and Brynn and Albert and Daniel, Andrea, thank you. I had a great fun and I'm very grateful, honestly, for your help and openness and flexibility. One of the other reasons is kind of the time we live in Yuval harari made that comment that the rate of change is accelerating.
5112446	5122534	171	A	0.99959	1:25:12	35	When we were hunter gatherers, uncertainty was norm. You wake up, there's nothing in the fridge. You have to go hunt. And we tolerated uncertainty better. We could put our worldly possessions on the back.
5122652	5142762	172	A	0.99	1:25:22	62	And then we started living in the world of iPads. iPhones were bombarded with information. And we must minimize uncertainty. We must have predictability in everything, which is not the natural world for mammals. And now we live our life and then bang, COVID hits, and then bang, certain person becomes the President of the United States and everything goes upside down.
5142816	5156898	173	A	0.8649	1:25:42	41	So the black swans are hitting us more frequently. So I think having the theory of that at our fingerprint and applying it to our work is probably beneficial. But again, thank you all so much. I really appreciate it. Awesome.
5156984	5166594	174	B	0.52773	1:25:56	20	Well, thank you all for joining. The conversation continues, so till next time. Thank you. Bye bye. Thanks a lot.
5166792	5167118	175	A	0.97617	1:26:06	1	Bye.
