6350	7930	2	B	0.99997	Hello and welcome, everyone.
8080	13238	3	B	0.74056	This is guest stream number 53.1 at the Active Inference Institute.
13414	16538	4	B	0.99698	It's August 23, 2023.
16704	29758	5	B	0.57582	We are going to be having a presentation followed by a discussion around the recent work of Alexey Tolchinsky, “A case for chaos theory inclusion in neuropsychoanalytic modeling.”
29854	34622	6	B	0.99052	So if you're watching live, please feel free to add any questions into the live chat.
34766	42114	7	B	0.60406	Otherwise, we will now have the presentation followed by a discussion with our excellent panelists.
42162	43746	8	B	0.9878	So thank you everybody for joining.
43778	46070	9	B	0.61	And Alexey, to you for the presentation.
49130	51830	10	A	0.99767	Thank you, Daniel.
53450	55082	11	A	0.99994	Thank you, Mark, for finding the time.
55136	58266	12	A	0.99573	I'm very grateful and excited to talk about this.
58368	61654	13	A	0.99989	Thank you, Andrea Bryn Albert.
61702	63882	14	A	0.85	I hope maybe Mike will join us.
63936	69550	15	A	0.94	And thank you, Daniel And, active inference institute, for organizing this meeting.
69890	72110	16	A	0.96511	So, can you see the slides?
73250	73802	17	A	0.72977	Yep.
73866	76880	18	A	0.57633	Okay, so I'll just proceed then.
79190	80802	19	A	0.99379	This is the outline of the talk.
80856	94802	20	A	0.99909	I'll share some preliminary comments and talk briefly about assumptions in the current models, summarize the data, talk about free energy principle formulations as compatible with chaos, and talk about some future developments.
94866	96966	21	A	0.94	And hopefully we can discuss that.
96988	100710	22	A	0.99688	I'm very much looking forward to have more questions than answers.
101370	107754	23	A	0.99611	I'd like to start with what Michael Levin taught me, I guess, is just why it's important to me.
107792	110998	24	A	1	The most important thing is the clinical applications.
111174	122462	25	A	0.96	I think that with your work, Mark, and with Pang SIP's work, we have been moving away from dualism over the course of some time.
122516	127034	26	A	0.99998	But I think the other big d determinism is still highly prevalent and dominant.
127162	133630	27	A	1	And I do think it influences our clinical work, diagnosis and psychotherapy and assessments.
133790	141162	28	A	1	And I think that it may be beneficial for some of the harder conditions we work with to consider, including nonlinear framework.
141326	142840	29	A	0.91562	That's my main focus.
143450	145522	30	A	0.99965	This is the link to the preprint.
145586	148950	31	A	1	And the paper is published fully in Neuropsychoanalysis Journal.
150330	165050	32	A	0.99998	Some of it is discussion with this foundational paper that you, Mark, wrote, the new Project for a Scientific Psychology General Scheme, which is a perhaps revision, a revival of Freud's famous paper Project for Scientific Psychology.
166270	184914	33	A	0.78	And I'd like to give you credit, Mark, that you have been opening conversations between disciplines that hadn't been talking to each other prior to your efforts, such as psychoanalysis and neurosciences, you've been doing for more than 20 years with great success.
185112	197158	34	A	0.99999	In the same spirit, I wanted to mention that Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology exists since 91, which is when their first conference happened, about less than 20 years.
197244	206906	35	A	0.64317	Then the first conference on chaos in Lake, Italy, around Lake Italy, lake Como in Italy in 76, which was mostly physicists at that time.
206928	208678	36	A	0.92	And then psychologists joined.
208854	212902	37	A	1	And I've attended the recent conference in Toronto, which was absolutely wonderful.
212966	215494	38	A	1	And I've met extraordinary clinicians and scientists.
215542	219486	39	A	0.99	And I think that it would be beneficial to open that dialogue as well.
219508	223920	40	A	0.99	And maybe if there is a wall between us to consider demolishing the wall.
227490	233758	41	A	0.99991	In terms of intent for the paper, you, Mark, pointed out to me that you've had an exchange with Robert Gallitzer Levy.
233934	235586	42	A	0.99994	For those of you who may not know him.
235608	248230	43	A	0.98802	He's a psychoanalyst from Chicago, a psychoanalytic writer and teacher who wrote a book on non linear psychoanalysis and deserves a lot of credit for his advocacy and he's sharing his thoughts.
248810	257906	44	A	0.99444	He posed a question to you, Mark, of possibly considering nonlinear components in that seminal paper, your Project for Scientific Psychology.
258098	264810	45	A	0.91	And to which he responded that the key point in such discussion was whether the mental apparatus was indeed nonlinear.
265150	271630	46	A	0.99912	So I took your comment as a task, as a challenge, if you wish and decided to write a paper about it.
271780	280110	47	A	1	I don't know if the data presented is sufficient, but I tried, and very clearly I don't intend to contradict or criticize.
280550	282226	48	A	0.87172	That would be funny of me to do.
282328	289326	49	A	0.92876	I'm hopeful maybe to add a branch on this tree that you're growing, clinical and theoretical tree.
289358	297426	50	A	0.97	And should you consider it worthwhile to go in this direction we wouldn't have to change very much because this is the paper by Friston.
297458	299666	51	A	0.43266	Lancelot de Costa and others called Stochastic.
299698	301270	52	A	0.99686	Chaos and Marker blankets.
301610	307002	53	A	0.97756	Free energy principle is compatible with the chaotic attracting set.
307136	313770	54	A	0.64277	What I thought was not present just yet was a formulation where the attracting set experiences a phase transition.
314110	321374	55	A	0.99	And I took liberty to ask Karl about it and he shared some very nice thoughts that I will, with his permission, share.
321412	336446	56	A	1	At the end of the talk, I'd like to cite Maxwell Ramstead, whom you know, and his colleagues from the paper and Bayesian mechanics of physics, often by beliefs where they talk about dynamics, mechanics and principles.
336638	341194	57	A	0.98	And in physics, Kepler's work is descriptive.
341262	344486	58	A	0.71324	It shows what the orbits of heavenly bodies are.
344668	348210	59	A	0.99968	Mechanics are the how of the dynamics.
348290	349186	60	A	0.99859	This is Newton's.
349218	351698	61	A	0.9924	Laws and principles are prescriptive.
351794	354166	62	A	0.99931	They are about why things work this way.
354268	360726	63	A	0.99878	There's a certain hierarchy in physics where you could derive the second law of Newton from principle of least action.
360838	364730	64	A	0.99	And then if you have initial conditions, you could calculate the dynamics.
365470	371214	65	A	1	The reason I'm mentioning that is, I think, Mark, your new project for scientific psychology is a high road.
371412	378640	66	A	0.95696	It seems to start from first principles such as the free energy principle and then you seem to derive things down from there.
379090	383538	67	A	0.99616	So I thought, why not try to see how the low road may look like?
383704	398630	68	A	0.99837	If in addition to these derivations and deductions and declaration of what entropy should be in the brain what if we measure it in Animal Studies and Human Studies in Health and Pathology and see what the data shows and whether or not the low road meets the high road in the middle?
398700	400950	69	A	0.99749	Or perhaps something may need to be added.
402810	407690	70	A	1	I also like to clarify why I spend time in the paper talking about obvious things for everybody.
407760	409846	71	A	0.99871	Here the axioms and postulates.
410038	431214	72	A	0.97	And I'm quoting here Edward Frankel, who is a mathematician at you know, Michael will forgive me, but viewpoint is that one can say that some parts of biology can be seen as based on chemistry, which can be seen as based on physics, which can be seen as based on mathematics.
431342	433374	73	A	0.98816	So how do things work in mathematics?
433502	439806	74	A	0.99943	We know that Karl Frieston likes to translate nearly everything he works on into the language of mathematics.
439998	446854	75	A	0.99912	Classically there's something called a formal system which we can metaphorically compare to building a house.
446972	451346	76	A	0.9901	So the foundation of the house is a set of axioms that has certain qualities.
451458	455398	77	A	0.98	And then we build things up using the logic of Aristotle.
455414	457450	78	A	1	And we derive things like theorems.
457950	464502	79	A	0.99822	An example would be Euclidean geometry, which is on the plane that is based on five axioms of Euclid.
464566	465702	80	A	0.99985	That's the foundation.
465846	468830	81	A	1	And then you could derive things like Pythagorean theorem.
469250	474480	82	A	1	Now, if we were to change just one of the axioms in the foundation, the entire house changes.
475090	480330	83	A	0.65491	An example would be the fifth axiom of Euclid that parallel lines essentially don't intersect.
480410	493714	84	A	0.99974	If you change that then we could have a house on the sphere which is Lobozevsky Riemann geometry and meridians on the earth are parallel and they intersect or you could have parabolic shape where parallel lines also intersect.
493842	500230	85	A	0.74933	So we'll have an entirely different framework and it may be naive to expect the theorem to look the same.
500300	506060	86	A	0.96	The Figurian theorem, if we put it on the sphere is different, the formula is different.
507390	527998	87	A	0.98844	I'm mentioning that is because I love multidisciplinarity and I think that's the way of the future with that sometimes when we cross over into another discipline such as psychologists taking mathematicals or physics ideas then we may occasionally forget this formal system thing.
528164	548822	88	A	0.99999	For example, when we say things like human beings resist or violate the second law of thermodynamics then the second law was formulated for closed systems in the state of equilibrium such as a sealed chamber of gas and human beings are neither closed nor in the state of equilibrium so it doesn't quite apply.
548876	550342	89	A	0.67928	It's a different formal system.
550476	553960	90	A	1	One needs physics of open systems to make a statement like that.
554410	571114	91	A	0.99773	So again, in mathematics because you mark seem to have taken us deeply in the main of mathematics in your project you have differential equations for action, perception, precision you have mark of blankets, random dynamical systems equivalences, partial derivatives.
571162	579520	92	A	0.99747	Then in mathematics people fix the set of axioms, they fix the definitions and then they build a theory, right?
580770	586002	93	A	0.80296	So I want to be clear, I want to clarify what are the axioms in the theory that is built?
586136	587490	94	A	0.99994	What is the foundation?
587990	597814	95	A	0.99	And in the effort of time, maybe I'll talk about just one of them which is Freud's psychic determinism and this is a question for me, not an answer.
597932	605298	96	A	1	I wanted to ask you because I'm assuming whether you kept this axiom or you changed it.
605484	613018	97	A	0.76865	So Freud said in the psychopathology of everyday life that there is nothing arbitrary or undetermined in the psychic life.
613184	619182	98	A	0.99383	There's different versions of this statement and it has been repeated by generations of psychoanalysts over a hundred years.
619236	620666	99	A	1	And it became very entrenched.
620698	624750	100	A	0.9991	It's sort of a cultural meme and a major tenet of psychoanalysis.
625970	642840	101	A	0.67269	If I were to give an illustration, perhaps those of us who are not in psychoanalytic therapy, then let's imagine an analytic therapist hearing a patient who intends to say same with an S, but they use the word shame, right?
643290	645030	102	A	0.99992	So such a phenomenon.
645690	650710	103	A	1	First of all, I think psychodynamic, psychopathic therapists would probably say that's not an accident.
651130	651830	104	A	0.90989	Okay?
651980	657398	105	A	0.91812	Accident is not a used term in psychoanalysis.
657494	667314	106	A	0.54	And secondly, they will probably infer of what it might mean, for example, infer along the lines of unconscious or emotional dynamics, emotional conflict.
667462	671386	107	A	0.99996	Somebody else may infer that it may have neuropsychological reasons.
671498	674362	108	A	0.99993	Somebody else may infer that it probably is a migraine.
674506	682340	109	A	0.99998	But what you might will not hear in psychodynamic culture is that that was an accident, that it was due to chance.
682710	689970	110	A	1	I think that chance accidents, randomness stochasticity chaos are not used, they're bad form in psychoanalysis.
690550	694114	111	A	1	And that is the illustration of, I think, for its assumption.
694162	695538	112	A	0.92888	Ultimately it's an axiom.
695554	697590	113	A	0.9995	It's a belief that is not questioned.
697930	708182	114	A	0.99893	If we were to translate that assumption in the pristine language, this is the long givan equation from which pristine starts, which has notations by Daniel.
708246	709078	115	A	0.9998	Thank you, Daniel.
709174	715190	116	A	0.92	And we have the change in the state of x equals the flow plus the omega.
715270	723866	117	A	0.99744	Omega is the Stochastic know, in Daniel's metaphor we have a wave and then we have ripple.
724058	729850	118	A	0.91929	So we would have to change the Stochastic component if we were to go with the Freud's axiom.
730010	737134	119	A	1	And then if we do that, we would find ourselves squarely in the domain of cold physics, Newtonian physics, Laplace's demon.
737262	745798	120	A	0.80839	LaPlace famously said, give me a position and momentum of every particle and I'll tell you exactly where they have been before and exactly where they will be in the future.
745964	752070	121	A	1	Now, Freud didn't make statements like that, but this is what would happen if you kill the Stochastic component.
753050	755766	122	A	1	I want to be clear that it's not Freud's fault at all.
755868	758214	123	A	0.84901	Well, first of all, you need axioms to build a theory.
758262	759366	124	A	0.99685	He chose that axiom.
759398	760780	125	A	0.99947	That's the theory he built.
761150	763850	126	A	1	Second of all, it wasn't exactly mathematics.
764350	768282	127	A	0.99	And finally, the zeitgeist of the time was deterministic.
768426	774794	128	A	0.99235	Perhaps there were initial derivations of Stochastic mechanics and quantum mechanics.
774842	780270	129	A	0.99978	But Freud, when he was learning the world of deterministic physics, was dominant.
781270	798710	130	A	1	And there's an important nuance in this discussion pointed out to me by the first peer reviewer of the paper who said, listen, if you have something that changes like a Stochastic thing and then you apply statistics to it, such as variance, then the variance of a changing variable will be deterministic.
799210	804338	131	A	1	And then if we look at things like words which are used a lot in talk therapy like apple.
804514	806226	132	A	0.95319	An apple is a semantic memory.
806258	807090	133	A	0.99965	It's a category.
807170	811974	134	A	0.99912	It's a coarse grading already from green apples and red apples and all other kinds of apples.
812102	815420	135	A	0.99903	So in that regard, words are deterministic things.
815790	838340	136	A	0.9982	So perhaps when we have a dream analysis session and the patient shares with an analyst the movie that they saw the messy irrational thing with images and tunes and anything and maybe words, even if they narrate it, then they slow things down, they average things out and they put it in deterministic tools, which is words.
838710	842334	137	A	0.9999	So with some objects we can apply deterministic tools.
842382	851650	138	A	0.99999	But I want to point out that the foundation that everything and anything in the psychic life that all the munications have no stochasticity randomness is a very strong assumption.
851730	858086	139	A	1	And I'm curious what would happen if we were to allow ourselves to see things on the sphere, on the parabola shape.
858198	865610	140	A	0.69105	It's not a bad exercise because the general theory of relativity would not have existed without these other geometries.
866350	871962	141	A	0.99956	In terms of definitions, this is a familiar formula that you mark use of Shannon's entropy.
872026	876394	142	A	0.99946	He originally wrote about telegraph and sender and receiver in a fixed alphabet.
876522	885602	143	A	0.99773	But here if we draw an attracting set which happens to be Lorenz attractor in phase space and we look at these I don't know if you can see them, they're small.
885656	892598	144	A	0.99	The white know that's the initial condition and then they spread out and evolve as time goes by.
892764	895622	145	A	0.96933	But you can see the density of the attracting set.
895676	898242	146	A	0.64877	It is higher density and lower density.
898306	902150	147	A	0.99999	So we could calculate probability distribution.
903290	913514	148	A	0.8	A slightly different question is this what would happen if you were to change the initial condition a little bit 1 mm in phase space, different things can happen.
913552	917390	149	A	0.56	And one of them is shown in this diagram that would be divergence.
917890	922286	150	A	0.82	And the formula here is initial condition multiplied by exponent of lambda T.
922388	928598	151	A	0.99958	So when lambda is positive, you have divergence and it's called lapin of exponent.
928634	931010	152	A	1	And that's one of the criteria for chaos.
931350	937730	153	A	0.99999	When it is negative, we have convergence and when it is zero we have equidistant trajectories, we have Newtonian mechanics.
939510	944070	154	A	0.99041	This is an illustration of a chaotic system which is a great red spot on Jupiter.
944490	951634	155	A	1	And it fits perfectly the Friston's paper about the mark of blankets and stochastic chaos because that thing is stable.
951682	959930	156	A	0.99998	We have been observing it for 300 years and one could say that this elliptical shape is the mark of blanket around the chaos that maintains its integrity.
960270	968330	157	A	0.86633	It's not a contradiction because in one spatial scale you have mark of blanket and on another spatial scale you have a chaos within the marker blanket.
968830	972334	158	A	0.99997	This is a convergent system that is a bit trivial to all of you.
972372	980974	159	A	0.99998	This is a hole in the ground and then surrounded by hills on all sides and if you were to put a ball on the hill, it's going to roll down in the potential.
981022	987758	160	A	0.52662	Well, and typically in phase space, we'll call the bottom of the hole an attractor and we call the hills repeller.
987854	998242	161	A	0.98529	Repeller is a term less frequently used, but it's the highly unstable point in phase space from which things move away from and they move toward the attractor.
998386	1000002	162	A	1	Now, that's just one attractor.
1000066	1001494	163	A	0.99	The interesting things start happening.
1001532	1009210	164	A	0.99897	If you've got two of them, imagine a second hole immediately to the right and the boundary between them may very quickly become chaotic.
1010270	1016394	165	A	0.989	Here's another illustration on a convergent system from the active inference textbook that I hadn't read when I was working on the paper.
1016432	1017740	166	A	1	I discovered it later.
1018910	1022310	167	A	1	The chart on the left is the density.
1022390	1026906	168	A	0.83	And again we see high density in the center and we hate lower density in the periphery.
1027018	1029370	169	A	0.82	And the chart on the right is surprise.
1029450	1034370	170	A	0.9944	We're very not surprised to find a ball in the center, and we're very much surprised if it stays on the hill.
1034710	1037070	171	A	0.86	And I'll read you a citation.
1037230	1047080	172	A	0.99941	Active inference is restricted to systems like that one on the left, which counter random fluctuations with their average flow and thereby retain their form over time.
1047690	1058410	173	A	0.99985	It may sound like the statement contradicts what I said earlier, that FAP is compatible with chaos, but it doesn't because you could have different spatial scales and convergence on one scale and divergence on another.
1058560	1063660	174	A	1	I also historically think that we have been studying converging systems mostly so far.
1064830	1080670	175	A	1	Now, if we move from things like that, which is very simple, to a mind or consciousness, then I think that what we could be looking at is this that's a landscape with attractors and repellers that is very complex.
1080830	1087390	176	A	1	And I'm going to quote the former president of the Chaos Society for Psychology is that that landscape is dynamic.
1087470	1088450	177	A	0.99937	It moves.
1089430	1091838	178	A	0.97044	Perhaps some things on it are stable.
1091934	1103858	179	A	0.99962	If we were imagine a clinical scenario where there's a patient who is very prone to shame and very averse to express anger, then we could say that shame is an attractor and anger is a repeller.
1104034	1112950	180	A	0.63431	But we work with pattern things in dynamic therapy so they could be relatively stable until the work in therapy makes them more shallow distributions.
1113030	1114790	181	A	0.99561	But certain things change overnight.
1114870	1117514	182	A	0.999	Some things change in a week or during the course of therapy.
1117562	1122960	183	A	0.98381	So I mean, strictly speaking, that's a dynamic landscape, and I don't think we model things this way.
1124130	1131646	184	A	0.97144	I'd like to also quote Maxwell Rammstead from the same paper that free energy principle is a tale of two densities.
1131838	1135410	185	A	0.99929	It would be incomplete to say that we just minimize one variable.
1136790	1147926	186	A	0.99953	What happens is we minimize the Shannon's entropy of probability distribution over sensory states, while at the same time we maximize entropy of internal beliefs, which is very important.
1148028	1149330	187	A	0.99977	That's adaptation.
1149490	1158490	188	A	0.99972	If somebody has rigid internal beliefs with sharp probabilities and then COVID happens, they will have lower probability of survival.
1159390	1160502	189	A	0.9947	They're not adaptable.
1160566	1172720	190	A	0.96005	So adaptability means maximization of entropy of internal beliefs while maintaining the forum means the minimization of Shannon's entropy of probability distribution over sensory states.
1173810	1180290	191	A	0.57594	Here's another term, Kolmogorov Sinai entropy that is not intuitive and it's from topology.
1180790	1187650	192	A	1	The picture you see is the photograph of the statue called Intuition outside the Fields Institute of Mathematics in Toronto.
1187990	1189742	193	A	0.75352	Here's a graphical illustration.
1189886	1202630	194	A	0.9992	If you were to draw the trajectories in phase space and surround it by a certain volume, say a circle with the radius epsilon, and ask yourself what happens to this volume as they evolve?
1203310	1207702	195	A	0.87633	Well, when it expands, then you can have chaoticity.
1207846	1212262	196	A	0.99232	When it becomes more compact, you can have convergence.
1212406	1222074	197	A	0.99982	When it stays the same, you have periodic system, which is indicated on the chart on the right, where you have a correlate of the colmorphs in entropy on the y axis.
1222122	1224922	198	A	0.61	And you have this epsilon on the x axis.
1225066	1229678	199	A	0.99569	So the flat line at the bottom where the circle doesn't change is the periodic system.
1229764	1232100	200	A	0.09085	Omogorovsina entropy stays zero.
1232470	1237022	201	A	1	The curved line in the center that converges on a K is the proper chaos.
1237086	1239198	202	A	0.99165	This is theoretical chaos.
1239294	1243854	203	A	0.99	And the upshoot from it is what Friston calls stochastic chaos.
1243902	1245374	204	A	0.99973	This is chaos plus noise.
1245502	1248850	205	A	0.9	And then you can have pure noise and then you can have pure linearity.
1248930	1251522	206	A	0.99001	So all of these things exist, they're all on the table.
1251586	1256278	207	A	0.99974	You can have geometry on the plane, geometry on the sphere, geometry in the parabolic shape.
1256374	1258060	208	A	0.99365	So what does the data show?
1258430	1269650	209	A	0.98	And when we look at EEG entropy, people use approximate entropy, permutation entropy and spectrum entropy, which are all derivations of colmorefsini.
1269830	1273662	210	A	0.99	And the first two are in different phase space from the last one, I believe.
1273716	1275374	211	A	1	Mark, correct me if I'm wrong.
1275492	1282062	212	A	0.98092	You cite Go serious study in your book Hidden Spring when you talk about entropy and phases of sleep.
1282206	1290306	213	A	0.99	And they use spectrum entropy, which is a derivation of colmorov Sinai in the frequency domain analysis phase space.
1290488	1309814	214	A	0.96851	So the data shows that systems as small as the axon of a squid isolated in the lab to single neurons to coupled neurons to EEG, we have evidence of positive lap enough exponents in some regimes of operation with EEG.
1309862	1311082	215	A	0.99994	We can be more specific.
1311216	1319002	216	A	0.99987	That algorithm seems to be weakly nonlinear, while things below alpha like delta seem to be more periodic with noise.
1319066	1323390	217	A	1	And things above alpha such as gamma and high gamma seem to be chaotic.
1323730	1342558	218	A	0.9887	So if we were to summarize this data, then we can say that comogorous entropy appears to increase as generalized arousal increases from delta to gamma rhythm, comogorous and entropy seems to be higher in healthy, alert, brain mind functioning than in the states of coma, seizure, deep sleep.
1342654	1345762	219	A	1	And it can stay close to zero in a coma or deep sleep.
1345906	1362758	220	A	0.9	The interesting anecdote here is that a simple act of closing your eyes when you're alert decreases Comography entropy clinical applications are vast and developing fast, for example, except for clinical psychology, I must say, in psychiatry and psychotherapy.
1362854	1371370	221	A	0.99874	But in neurology, the seizure detection on the EEG right now can be done with AI with about the same accuracy as a human neurologist.
1371450	1374938	222	A	0.88	And that algorithm does use chaoticity assessment.
1375034	1380770	223	A	0.50944	There's models for Parkinson's, neuropathic, pain, and I have other examples that I'll skip for right now.
1380920	1383890	224	A	0.99989	This is a graphical illustration of phases of sleep.
1384310	1389294	225	A	0.97	And again, it has colmob Sinai entropy as a phase of sleep.
1389422	1393794	226	A	0.99007	It shows wakefulness and then shallow sleep, progressively deeper sleep and REM.
1393912	1395458	227	A	0.99	And that's the time evolution.
1395554	1405050	228	A	0.99986	If you move REM in frequency to where it belongs to wakefulness, then you'll see the same progression that comographs and entropy appears to increase as a function of generalized arousal.
1405390	1409178	229	A	0.99997	This is seizure onset at about second four.
1409344	1411510	230	A	0.9998	Seizure is a reduction in chaoticity.
1411590	1414730	231	A	0.99988	Healthy functioning is higher chaoticity than a seizure.
1415230	1419338	232	A	0.99995	This is a coma, which is relatively invariant theta and delta frequency.
1419434	1421946	233	A	0.89921	This is a nearly periodic system with some noise.
1422058	1424046	234	A	1	And death is a linear system.
1424148	1425360	235	A	0.99316	It doesn't change.
1425730	1439198	236	A	0.99934	This is persistent vegetative state, minimally conscious state, where researchers were asking a question on prognosis of survival and they've concluded that diversity and variability of the EHE was the predictor of survival.
1439294	1441220	237	A	0.99948	Higher entropy means life.
1442730	1459066	238	A	0.99971	So the hypothesis is that chaotic stochastic and linear processes as well as hybrid ones, such as primarily chaotic functioning with noise can be present concurrently at different scales of the brain mind or at the same scale, but in different places or at different times.
1459248	1463660	239	A	1	I realize it's a mouthful, but it fits the data presented in the paper.
1464670	1472058	240	A	0.99997	This is again a picture from the textbook enough to inference by Thomas Parr, Karl Friston, and Giovanni Pizzoulo.
1472154	1473818	241	A	0.9509	It's a cortical column.
1473994	1488606	242	A	0.97	And the errors you see here, ascending and descending connections, if by chance you're not familiar with the framework they correspond to, the ascending errors are prediction errors and descending ones are predictions.
1488718	1493026	243	A	0.99995	This is what they say in the book, that there's an asymmetry in message passing.
1493138	1499874	244	A	1	And the reason for that is that the operations required to compute prediction error from expectation are nonlinear.
1500002	1507210	245	A	0.99993	This nonlinearity is due to computation of predictions using nonlinear functions that tend to increase the frequency of the signal.
1508590	1510870	246	A	0.99948	I'd like to talk a little bit about reduction.
1510950	1515446	247	A	0.99933	It became very fashionable and sometimes silly to use this like, oh, you're reductionist.
1515478	1516454	248	A	0.76602	No, you're reductionist.
1516502	1519254	249	A	0.95	And the second most popular term is oversimplify.
1519302	1520102	250	A	0.99981	You oversimplify.
1520166	1521142	251	A	0.74	Now you oversimplify.
1521206	1523518	252	A	0.98	And to me, they're not bad words.
1523684	1526910	253	A	0.92132	They're necessary tools to simplify and to reduce.
1528050	1531214	254	A	1	The map that equals the territory exactly is useless.
1531262	1532402	255	A	0.99595	Nobody's going to use it.
1532456	1540530	256	A	0.99111	It must kind of I'm quoting James Quick simplify and, you know, I'll illustrate the specific term.
1540950	1549174	257	A	0.99943	If the car is moving with a fixed velocity on a straight line and if I know exactly where it is right now, I can tell with certainty where it has been an hour before.
1549292	1550966	258	A	0.99999	That is a reduction in time.
1551068	1553858	259	A	1	And I can do that because the formula is linear.
1553954	1559130	260	A	0.97598	It's distance equals velocity multiplied by time and velocity is constant.
1559550	1569758	261	A	0.99922	If the watch is broken and I disassemble it and I find a faulty part and then I put it back together and it works, then it's a reduction in space.
1569844	1575070	262	A	1	And I can do that because watch is not an end colony to use Daniel's terms.
1575220	1579098	263	A	0.99742	Watch is equal to the collection of its parts.
1579274	1586660	264	A	0.99287	So I wanted to talk about, Mark, your mention of the predictive hierarchy composed of billions of homeostats in your work.
1587270	1589054	265	A	0.99938	This is approximate picture.
1589102	1591742	266	A	0.99995	This is not the exact picture of what you talk about in the new project.
1591816	1593778	267	A	1	And this is from your hidden spring.
1593954	1600360	268	A	0.99958	It's a predictive hierarchy where predictions flow from left to right and prediction errors from right to left.
1601530	1611386	269	A	1	And one of the statements in the book in the Hidden Spring you say that brain's many complex functions really can ultimately be reduced to a few simple mechanisms like this.
1611488	1615530	270	A	0.9999	So it appears that you call it reduction.
1616030	1618534	271	A	0.99996	But it is a powerful model.
1618592	1619822	272	A	0.99997	It is a flexible model.
1619876	1622142	273	A	1	I wanted to describe some features of it.
1622276	1630830	274	A	0.97838	Well, first of all, if homeostat is present at every single scale, then we have this homogeneity of mechanisms throughout the scales.
1630990	1633986	275	A	1	And I want to say that in physics things don't look this way.
1634088	1636238	276	A	0.99963	Quantum mechanics is the microphysics.
1636334	1638786	277	A	0.99394	Statistical mechanics is molecular level.
1638888	1641006	278	A	0.84083	Newtonian mechanics is heavenly bodies.
1641038	1642878	279	A	1	And then we have general theory of relativity.
1642974	1644402	280	A	0.53457	There's qualitative shifts.
1644466	1647410	281	A	0.8918	There isn't a homogeneity of mechanism all the way throughout.
1647570	1654310	282	A	0.99801	In fact, when people say take entanglement and they apply to human beings, that's sort of a misunderstanding of entanglement.
1655290	1659302	283	A	1	The second comment is from Mike Eleven who talks about these scales.
1659366	1670958	284	A	0.95	And if his comment is that you could have different functional spaces at every scale where you could solve the genetic task on one scale, electrochemical on another, morphological on the third one.
1671044	1675520	285	A	0.59	And then how you do message passing, what is the common language is not a trivial question.
1676210	1683726	286	A	0.99999	Along the same lines, I've already mentioned that a message between the scales can be nonlinear if you do prediction errors.
1683838	1697174	287	A	1	Now if you take one nonlinear message and then you multiply it by billions, you're going to have a full on turbulence, which is a chaotic system, it's a dynamical system and turbulence you cannot reduce to homeostat or anything else.
1697372	1701218	288	A	0.99997	Saying that water consists of H 20 does not explain turbulence.
1701394	1703414	289	A	0.70422	So I don't know, that's an open question.
1703452	1707660	290	A	0.99998	But I wanted to maybe share some perceptions of this model.
1708190	1714460	291	A	0.99719	This I talked about and this is the Friston's thought about phase transition and the attracting set.
1714830	1728590	292	A	0.99992	He said that if you have a hierarchy of Lorenzo tractors, a slower one and a faster one and a slower one governing the transitions of the faster Lorenzo tractor, then you could have a FEP formulation with an attracting set experiencing changes and transitions.
1729010	1730606	293	A	0.99	And that's brilliant, I think.
1730628	1735294	294	A	1	And it matches the anatomy because the brainstem and the subcortical structures appear to be slower.
1735342	1741726	295	A	0.1776	Lorenzo tractor that could be seen as governing the transitions of the cortex, which is astral Lorenzo tractor.
1741918	1746226	296	A	1	I know I'm oversimplifying things a great deal, but it sort of misses his thoughts.
1746258	1748710	297	A	1	I think him and Lancelor de Costa are working on that.
1748780	1751960	298	A	0.9993	Perhaps Maxwell Ramstead's group is working on that as well.
1752730	1763958	299	A	0.64	The clinical applications, the landscape that I've mentioned before would be absolutely lovely to see if we were to consider going there borderline personality disorder or another term for that could be complex trauma.
1764054	1768098	300	A	0.83	The metaphor that we use for these patients is they're predictably unpredictable.
1768214	1772302	301	A	0.97668	That the only thing we know on Wednesday that we don't know what's going to come up.
1772356	1779338	302	A	0.99568	Suggesting chaoticity acute trauma has a symptom of hyperarousal, suggesting possibly higher level of chaoticity.
1779434	1788260	303	A	0.87121	An onset of mania can be seen as a transition into a higher energy state and addictions, particularly with stimulants, can be seen as phase transitions into a chaotic state.
1788630	1797762	304	A	1	It may sound like what I said now is contradictory to what I said before when I suggested that lower chaoticity could be a problem, such as an onset of a seizure.
1797826	1803926	305	A	1	And here I'm saying higher chaoticity can be a problem, but that would only be a contradiction in the linear world.
1804108	1812460	306	A	0.99964	In the real world, where linear is very small percentage of what's happening, I'm saying both that too little and too much chaos could be a problem.
1812830	1815740	307	A	0.99987	Just enough chaos imbalance could be perfectly fine.
1816190	1818810	308	A	0.99988	This is a graphical illustration of what can be done.
1818880	1827630	309	A	0.99991	This is from my colleague and friend David Pinkus, who is a professor in Sheppin University and I think also former president of the Society for Chaos and Psychology Society.
1827970	1828890	310	A	0.99983	These are trees.
1828970	1842260	311	A	0.58205	It may sound like completely unrelated to what we do, except if you look at a human lung or dendrites in a neuron and you can see a healthy tree on the right from me and a nearly dead tree on the left.
1842630	1859930	312	A	1	And if you do the fractal assessment, fractal dimension assessment on them by counting the thickness of branches and count the number of branches at each level, then you can quantify and then you can have approximate quantification of health and resilience versus pathology.
1860270	1866846	313	A	1	And again, as exotic as it may sound, this is very similar to what people do when they detect a seizure on the AG.
1866948	1871470	314	A	0.99998	They measure CD correlational dimension, which is approximately fractal dimension.
1871970	1875278	315	A	1	And I think my 30 minutes are up.
1875364	1876990	316	A	0.99994	Thank you so much for your attention.
1880260	1881212	317	B	0.99897	Thank you, Lexi.
1881276	1882956	318	B	0.99826	Great presentation.
1883148	1886508	319	B	0.92583	Well, looking forward to this discussion.
1886604	1890908	320	B	1	First, Mark, please feel free to add your reflections.
1891084	1893970	321	B	0.99819	Then Andrea, then we'll continue on.
1895540	1896930	322	C	0.99911	Thanks very much.
1898900	1907096	323	C	0.9998	When Alexey asked me if I would join this panel, the first thing that I said to him was yes, coupled with.
1907118	1912132	324	C	1	The second thing being, but please be aware that I know next to nothing about chaos theory.
1912196	1923710	325	C	0.99912	So I'm not sure how much of a contribution I can make to a technical discussion of this kind.
1924960	1929788	326	C	0.99957	So I'm just repeating that before I say anything else.
1929874	1937084	327	C	1	If I say anything that sounds amateur, that sounds as if this guy doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to chaos theory.
1937132	1942240	328	C	0.99931	It's because I'm an amateur and I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to chaos theory.
1943400	1952196	329	C	0.99533	That said, the second thing I want to say is I'm not entirely sure what is at stake here.
1952378	1970830	330	C	0.9999	It seems as if Alexey feels that it's really important that I and our colleagues get our head around chaos theory and bring some of what it has to offer into our field.
1971520	1974844	331	C	0.999	Because I don't know much about it.
1974882	1976684	332	C	1	I don't know what's at stake, you see.
1976722	1979484	333	C	1	I don't know why that's important.
1979682	1989810	334	C	0.98842	So perhaps somewhere along the line in the next just less than an hour that we have, perhaps, Alexey, you can clarify that for us.
1991140	2010360	335	C	1	The third thing I wanted to say is, and perhaps in order to illustrate the first thing is that as Alexey was talking now, it seemed as if he was talking about chaos, as if it were synonymous with stochasticity or randomness.
2011100	2014036	336	C	0.76	And that's not my understanding.
2014228	2020424	337	C	0.99958	My very limited understanding of chaos theory was that it's not synonymous.
2020552	2029892	338	C	0.99901	Chaos, as used in that science or in that theory, is not synonymous with randomness.
2029976	2032880	339	C	0.98086	It's rather synonymous with unpredictability.
2034260	2046980	340	C	0.99997	Because we don't know the initial conditions of the system, or we can't specify all the variables with sufficient precision in their initial conditions, it becomes impossible to predict.
2047960	2059444	341	C	0.84	And because of the nature of the interrelationships of the variables, one tiny little error in your estimation of the initial conditions can lead to massive consequences.
2059572	2066760	342	C	1	And this is why it's so hard to predict chaotic systems.
2067180	2080030	343	C	0.99894	So if that is what is meant, then I would say, Stuart, of course this applies to the way that the mind works and the way that the brain works.
2080720	2083072	344	C	0.99911	But that leads me back to my second point.
2083126	2104500	345	C	0.99483	I'm not sure what's at stake, but I would say, if that's what you're asking, if that's what you're claiming, rather, Alexey, then I would say that surely must be so, that it is exceedingly difficult to predict mental and neural events at any level of complexity.
2106540	2110424	346	C	0.98	Now, I think I've said three things.
2110622	2112650	347	C	0.99998	Let me now say a fourth thing.
2113660	2119150	348	C	0.99	I think that a crucial well, let me put it this way.
2119680	2130496	349	C	0.51	Of course, what the brain and mind are trying to do, it's a matter of trying to predict what's going to happen.
2130598	2147110	350	C	0.98218	So what I've just said about how difficult it is to predict what's going to happen in the brain or mind it's almost the same thing as to say that the mind and brain are trying to model the world.
2148200	2182048	351	C	0.99998	That's the main thing that we are trying to do is have a good model of the world so that we can get some sort of grip on this chaos, so that we can act rationally in the sense that we can act in order to preserve ourselves that we do not dissipate by just exploring all possible states and no longer existing as a system.
2182134	2188924	352	C	0.99999	Because we, as systems, need to remain within certain bounds across a great many variables.
2188972	2202032	353	C	0.99999	As you said, we can't afford to just let shit happen and throw ourselves to its fates.
2202176	2206330	354	C	0.99998	We need to try to predict in a very unpredictable world.
2206940	2211912	355	C	0.99998	What must I do in order to meet this need, given how the world works?
2212046	2215848	356	C	0.96467	So the brain is trying to model the world.
2216014	2222972	357	C	0.86742	Our predictive model is trying to synchronize itself with the world.
2223026	2227020	358	C	1	And for that reason it's going to be very chaotic.
2228240	2233360	359	C	0.99999	But the crucial point is it's trying to reduce the unpredictability.
2235140	2240768	360	C	0.99994	With that said, I'll make a fifth point, or maybe it's another part of my fourth point.
2240854	2253190	361	C	0.98845	No, I think it's a fifth point, which is that the way that I conceptualize the predictive model and it's not me alone who does this is that it is a hierarchical model.
2253880	2255816	362	C	1	And I think that's very important.
2255918	2265320	363	C	1	And perhaps here's where things do start, where it starts to at least in my mind, I start to see some of what's at stake.
2266300	2277480	364	C	0.99	I think that the more peripheral layers of the predictive model I see the predictive model not as a triangle, but rather as an onion.
2277640	2282688	365	C	0.99934	So the core is the deepest layers of the model.
2282854	2296884	366	C	0.80264	That is to say, the layers that have the greatest spatial and temporal generalizability and they're the most stable layers of the model.
2297002	2328904	367	C	1	And as we move toward the periphery, which coincides with the periphery of the nervous system, in other words, the encounter with the outside world, so it becomes more chaotic, we can tolerate more unpredictability at the periphery and that also allows for greater accuracy because the world is so unpredictable.
2328952	2338668	368	C	0.99998	We have a more chaotic outer layer of our predictive model where things also there's less that's at stake.
2338764	2340432	369	C	0.99998	Is that car going to turn left or right?
2340486	2342356	370	C	1	Well, I thought it was going to turn left, turn right.
2342378	2342900	371	C	0.57783	So what?
2342970	2343908	372	C	0.99978	Doesn't matter.
2344074	2350950	373	C	0.9997	But is the car going to obey the laws of gravity that matters more?
2352760	2357976	374	C	0.61081	That's a much more consequential surprise if it does not.
2358158	2373752	375	C	1	And perhaps that's a silly analogy, but at least it illustrates the general point, our most heartfelt beliefs, and that is to say, the deepest layers of our predictive hierarchy.
2373896	2393876	376	C	0.99987	There we find the same patterns over and again and we are more certain of our predictions and we act more stereotypically in accordance with them, whereas at the periphery that does not apply.
2394058	2402324	377	C	0.99263	So I think at one point in your presentation, Alexey, you were saying something like one size doesn't fit all.
2402362	2404192	378	C	0.9998	It's not all, just one mechanism.
2404256	2405320	379	C	0.99999	All the way down.
2405470	2407850	380	C	1	Of course, I completely agree with that.
2409260	2411252	381	C	0.99915	It's not just one mechanism.
2411396	2420060	382	C	1	The different homeostats that you were referring to on there different scales are also serving different needs and there's not a common currency.
2420480	2425452	383	C	0.97	I think that's a very important part of how consciousness works.
2425506	2430232	384	C	0.99976	Why we have qualia at all is because we can't reduce things to a common currency.
2430296	2436192	385	C	0.9993	We're dealing with categorical variables, at the very least, in relation to our bodily needs.
2436246	2440544	386	C	0.97351	They are categorically distinct needs and they need to be treated as such.
2440582	2446804	387	C	1	And this is why we have different feelings in relation to these different categories of free energy.
2447002	2454348	388	C	0.73796	So those are some of the main things I wanted to say just to get the ball rolling.
2454464	2460664	389	C	0.74545	I'm mindful of the fact that Andrea Clarici only has 15 more minutes with us.
2460782	2465624	390	C	0.99834	So maybe I can pick up on some other points later.
2465822	2469720	391	C	0.99996	But at this stage, let me hand over to Andrea.
2469880	2470830	392	C	0.99961	Thank you.
2483390	2484860	393	D	0.99635	Can you hear me now?
2485310	2486554	394	D	0.99956	Yes, sorry.
2486672	2493210	395	D	1	I will try also to articulate something of the very fascinating paper of Alexey .
2493370	2498714	396	D	1	I must confess, since I'm also a psychoanalytic psychotherapist, a psychiatrist.
2498842	2500030	397	D	0.90147	It's not my field.
2500100	2504900	398	D	0.99709	I'm not a physicist, so I can really say few words.
2505910	2515730	399	D	0.7376	Some is of, as I said already, fascination, because in general, I hate to stick to rigid theories.
2516070	2532940	400	D	0.99233	So if there is a paper like Alexey who can chaoticize my theories, even in psychoanalysis, in the workings of the mind and the brain, I'm happy to dive into it.
2533550	2546880	401	D	0.6	At the same time, I don't have the skills to discuss the math part of his papers or even the physical formulas and so on.
2547570	2559470	402	D	0.65153	But I was reminded of a very early and I think you all know that book Jacques Monot Chance and Necessity, which is a classic.
2559630	2565706	403	D	0.99	And I think it's a book in which you can from scratch.
2565758	2569206	404	D	0.99	I mean, here that our aim in the world.
2569308	2581862	405	D	1	And I know I'm sounding theological, but we have theological aims.
2582006	2586550	406	D	0.99999	In order to stay alive, we have to face chance and chaos.
2586710	2604042	407	D	0.99998	So I think this is in order to survive and reproduce, we have to have a mathematical system to reduce chaos and to bring up again determinism or psychic determinism.
2604186	2617190	408	D	0.99924	Since one of the points that Lexie, I think, raised is can we still hold the point of Freud's about psychic determinism?
2617770	2624630	409	D	0.99	And I think if you apply not to the physics of just materialism.
2626330	2626694	410	A	1	Of.
2626732	2631578	411	D	0.99975	Things, actually, but to the living organism, I think we do.
2631744	2638394	412	D	0.99997	This is my point, and I would like to hear what Alexey says.
2638512	2641950	413	D	0.99984	In the end, the chaos theory.
2642690	2656610	414	D	0.54701	Mathematics, as far as I understand it, must be a mathematics who reduce chance or chaos to a linearity, at least in the living organism.
2657430	2665780	415	D	0.69	And I wonder if and what Alexey thinks about it, because he seems to disagree with that.
2669530	2677830	416	B	0.96417	Want to give a direct response, Alexey, or then Bryn and Albert be awesome to hear your takes as well, some of the thoughts from Mark and from Andrea.
2678570	2682970	417	A	0.9969	Should I start by responding to Andrea's points or marks?
2686430	2692502	418	A	0.99994	Maybe I'll start by because I think the key point that Mark you brought up is what's at stake is still unclear.
2692646	2697470	419	A	0.99997	My impression is, and please correct me if I'm wrong I was very influenced, Mark, by your paper.
2697540	2713006	420	A	1	I forgot exactly, the journal where you talked about psychiatry world, how these sort of convention based diagnosis of here is a major depressive disorder, here's a bipolar disorder, nothing of which has to do with etiology convention and statistics.
2713198	2725362	421	A	1	And then you brought up this revolutionary thing with effective neuroscience where you talked about the manic state and the depression state and tied into the punk subsystem, I think is extraordinary.
2725506	2735898	422	A	0.51892	But what I wanted to say is if we look at how we diagnose and think about what's happening, and we look at the language of how we do it, it is still a deterministic language at the end of the day.
2736064	2741862	423	A	0.99961	So when we moved from DSM Four to DSM Five, we brilliantly discovered that continuous variables exist.
2741926	2743218	424	A	0.99999	We used to have buckets.
2743334	2744890	425	A	0.99998	Everything was in a separate bucket.
2744970	2751194	426	A	1	And then we said autism is a spectrum, and everybody applauded, but mathematicians were quietly laughing in the corner.
2751322	2755738	427	A	0.99989	Because, of course, continuous variables exist, but we don't do dynamics.
2755834	2757326	428	A	0.98388	We're still very static.
2757438	2758978	429	A	0.72267	Here's this clear cut thing.
2759064	2761634	430	A	1	And this is the clear cut continuous thing, right?
2761752	2768574	431	A	1	And my impression I may be wrong, is that even in our neuropsychoanalytic developments, we still do things deterministically.
2768702	2773186	432	A	1	We assess which bucket things belong to, or maybe two buckets at the same time, or three buckets.
2773298	2779802	433	A	0.99313	But we don't do things like how the chaotic systems are qualitatively different from static things.
2779856	2781574	434	A	0.9994	I'm quoting William Solis.
2781702	2785930	435	A	0.9994	They have transients, they have contextuality, and they have emergence.
2786510	2788650	436	A	0.99891	We don't do know.
2788800	2800682	437	A	0.99	And I think that if we embrace the chaos theory, if we do things like correlational dimension assessment or fractal dimension assessment, starting from the system of classification of emotions, they're still buckets.
2800746	2802710	438	A	0.99838	Here is a clear cut thing called fear.
2802810	2804590	439	A	0.76889	That's a clear cut thing called rage.
2804670	2806914	440	A	0.99941	Buckets determinism, okay?
2807112	2810610	441	A	1	And they look differently in the dynamical systems world.
2810760	2818834	442	A	1	And then the system of psychopathology could look like correlational dimension changed and not that somebody fell into a bucket.
2818962	2833814	443	A	0.51561	If we look at this complex landscape of attractors and repellers and examine psychodynamic things like please forgive me if I'm incorrect, but one of the possible definitions of repression could be seen as not letting things into consciousness.
2833942	2835446	444	A	0.99997	Maybe we can call it suppression.
2835478	2838554	445	A	0.99999	But what I'm trying to say is I don't want to think that right now.
2838592	2839142	446	A	0.96891	It hurts.
2839206	2844074	447	A	0.99995	It's a painful thing that in the terminology that I shared, is a repeller.
2844202	2855680	448	A	1	And perhaps when you work through things in a psychodynamic, psychotherapy, perhaps you put a scar tissue on the wound, it becomes less of a sharp repeller, and it smooths out.
2857650	2859186	449	A	0.99998	We don't diagnose like that.
2859208	2860066	450	A	0.99981	We don't treat like that.
2860088	2861460	451	A	0.99979	We don't think like that.
2861990	2869362	452	A	1	One paper that I'm working on that is in peer review right now and I can't share too much, says that we think like storytellers.
2869426	2871170	453	A	0.99959	I'm quoting Daniel Kahneman.
2871330	2875186	454	A	0.9024	Our thinking mind of a clinician is not a statistician.
2875378	2880258	455	A	0.99956	We don't think in probabilities, we think in labels and we think in stories.
2880434	2885018	456	A	0.99	And I know you had this powerful quote, Mark, from Freud who said that that's the nature of the mind.
2885104	2888826	457	A	1	And I most respectfully disagree that that's the entire nature of the mind.
2888928	2893374	458	A	1	I do think that we have things on the mind that are not stories and not words.
2893492	2905700	459	A	0.96987	So if the nature of the phenomenon is chaotic and stochastic and periodic, then we can use appropriate mechanisms to diagnose and classify that fits the nature of the model.
2906550	2911266	460	A	1	The second thing you said chaos and stochasticity, I absolutely agree with you that they're different.
2911448	2919474	461	A	0.86	On the chart that I've shown, if you converge to a stable, chaos is deterministic, forward deterministic.
2919522	2922962	462	A	0.99992	So if initial conditions are changing, they will diverge.
2923026	2925622	463	A	0.99997	But you can predict things forward, not back.
2925756	2929826	464	A	0.99995	But there is no formula in a stochastic thing, you throw the coin.
2929858	2930374	465	A	0.99996	You don't know.
2930412	2934374	466	A	0.99999	You have no predictability whatsoever, short term or third or long term.
2934422	2935434	467	A	0.99999	So they are different.
2935552	2948958	468	A	1	And in the sense that you're talking to sensitivity, to initial conditions, this is music to my heart to hear you to say that you acknowledge that curioticity clearly is present in the brain, on which level of the hierarchy in your model is a very important thing.
2949044	2955598	469	A	0.51442	But again, when we draw this picture, whether it's a triangle or an onion with a core and layers, it's a static model.
2955764	2963042	470	A	0.63	And when you acknowledge that there's higher unpredictability toward the periphery, it could be, but there could be dynamics about the structure of the model.
2963176	2965470	471	A	1	And perhaps what you're saying is survival.
2965630	2970342	472	A	0.99982	Like I must breathe and I must breathe air and I'm not in the water.
2970396	2972354	473	A	1	And that is a very stable prediction.
2972482	2973110	474	A	0.99998	Absolutely.
2973260	2984246	475	A	0.98759	But when we deal with psychopathology and we deal with things like shame and pride and awe and other things, then I wonder if we should continue to use this metaphor of a homeostat.
2984278	2989370	476	A	1	I really don't see how homeostat applies to gamma written in the brain or to shame.
2990510	2997002	477	A	0.59	And homeostat is the convergent systems so that you minimize entropy by keeping things in the range.
2997066	3008050	478	A	0.99967	However, if you dive inside the homeostat, if you look at the temperature variation inside a narrow range, you may see chaos, which is exactly the picture that I saw, that I showed.
3011030	3019862	479	A	0.99	And to Andrea's point about the Freud's principle of psychic determinism yes, I honestly think that we haven't said goodbye to that.
3019996	3024646	480	A	0.99995	We haven't tried to say that chance exists in the mental life.
3024828	3026230	481	A	0.98764	Accidents exist.
3026730	3028086	482	A	0.99999	We don't do that.
3028268	3034214	483	A	0.99958	There's a firm tradition in psychoanalytic, psychotherapy, to say there's no accidents it's all determined.
3034342	3036918	484	A	0.99778	That's a major key point of the discussion.
3037094	3039260	485	A	0.94	I don't know if I said too much.
3041870	3048480	486	B	0.99985	Maybe, andrea, if you want to give any thoughts or how do you want things to continue in the coming minutes and years?
3048850	3049950	487	D	0.53991	Okay, thank you.
3050020	3051146	488	D	0.97641	Thank you, Daniel.
3051338	3062210	489	D	0.99989	Just adding a word that I didn't use because I think it's very important about trying to defend the point about psychic determinism, which I'm very fond of.
3062280	3064558	490	D	0.93	I mean, the word is adaptation.
3064734	3076790	491	D	0.52	I have difficulties because when you see a psychotic patient, when you see a borderline patient, well, I don't see chaos or total unpredictability.
3077130	3082230	492	D	0.88	I see adaptation, their disruptions.
3084090	3101578	493	D	1	I try to understand what are the even the part behind that, in my opinion, has to have a tendency toward an order, which is adaptive.
3101754	3124310	494	D	1	In this way, I see the mathematical part of chaos may be of use, but bringing to an explanation maybe not to an order or to a determinism, but to a point in which there must be this adaptive reason even in the chaos.
3124810	3126280	495	D	0.99934	Do you see my point?
3127930	3128710	496	A	0.99	I do.
3128780	3131914	497	A	0.99992	But I think there's a deeper issue about how we know.
3131952	3134662	498	A	0.99967	Say there's a clinician psychoanalytic psychotherapist.
3134806	3136374	499	A	0.99995	We have a working memory.
3136502	3143514	500	A	0.99	And the Miller's law that, Mark, you quote a lot about the seven units of information in the audio verbal work in memory.
3143562	3146506	501	A	1	I think in the Miller's paper, he actually said seven chunks.
3146698	3150302	502	A	0.8695	So I'm sharing something from the paper in Review right now.
3150436	3154186	503	A	0.99973	We cannot think probabilistically because it overloads the work in memory.
3154298	3163074	504	A	0.99984	This is why when I'm a clinician, I think about psychosis, I come up with a story, a formulation that fits in the work in memory, and this influences our work.
3163192	3168866	505	A	0.99999	We don't have the mathematics in here to think in the terms of probabilistic things and chaos theory and other things.
3168968	3170390	506	A	0.99996	We need tools to do that.
3170460	3172610	507	A	0.99	And in mainstream neurology, they use tools.
3172690	3174882	508	A	0.99993	They do talk to the patient that examine the patient.
3174946	3178806	509	A	0.99925	But they have MRI, they have EHE, they have Pescan and all the other things.
3178908	3181958	510	A	0.99905	In psychoanalytic psychotherapy, we say, we don't need any tools.
3182054	3185514	511	A	0.9945	We just talk to a person, and that is sufficient for everything we do.
3185632	3187162	512	A	0.99932	But that's not necessarily true.
3187216	3194186	513	A	0.94097	Beatrice Bibi, who is a psychoanalyst, works with mother infant diet, and there's zero words exchanged zilch.
3194298	3200750	514	A	0.51676	But she looks at this movie that she records on a video camera, and then she shows it in a slow motion.
3201170	3205578	515	A	0.99844	So she takes a flow, which is dynamic flow, not words, not discrete things.
3205684	3210900	516	A	0.99	And then she slows it down and she shows the level of attunement between the mother and the child.
3211510	3213426	517	A	1	We don't do things like that.
3213608	3222390	518	A	0.99999	We talk and we use these deterministic things to understand the psychopathology of the patient, saying that's psychosis and that's schizophrenia, and that is bipolar one.
3222460	3224422	519	A	0.99989	This is panic system and this is seeking system.
3224476	3225974	520	A	0.99992	We determine everything.
3226172	3230418	521	A	1	And that is a limitation because inside, I believe what is a fear cascade?
3230434	3231234	522	A	1	How does fear stop?
3231292	3232102	523	A	0.99842	It's a flow.
3232166	3233594	524	A	0.93651	It's a turbulent thing.
3233712	3236310	525	A	0.9	And we put one label on it, say fear.
3236470	3237914	526	A	0.99514	We've classified it.
3238032	3245182	527	A	0.9957	So for some things it's appropriate, but for some things, it may not be, as Einstein said, as Mark.
3245236	3248718	528	A	0.99864	You quoted Einstein as simple as possible, but more simpler than that.
3248884	3255460	529	A	0.85924	So at which point we are missing or missing the phenomenon by using deterministic tools in our work.
3256470	3257534	530	B	0.97896	Thank you, Alexey.
3257662	3258162	531	D	0.99169	Thank you.
3258216	3259730	532	D	0.99876	Thank you, Daniel and Mark.
3259800	3260562	533	D	0.6	To everyone.
3260696	3261186	534	D	0.99981	Thank you.
3261208	3262274	535	D	0.85	I have to go.
3262472	3263220	536	B	0.99957	Awesome.
3263670	3269670	537	B	0.99407	So Albert and then Bryn and we'll continue on this topic.
3271690	3275640	538	E	0.99142	Yeah, thank you for the presentation and a very interesting discussion so far.
3276410	3278700	539	E	1	One thing that comes to mind is.
3279150	3279900	540	A	0.84	The.
3283470	3292430	541	E	0.93285	Well, the thing we're talking about right now, the psychic determinism as depicted as being a foundational law in psychoanalysis.
3294050	3301534	542	E	0.97762	Well, I'm thinking about the authors, the psychoanalytic authors who came the prominent ones who came after Freud, who seem to
3301572	3302160	543	E	0.77272	have
3305730	3308926	544	E	0.54755	room for this chaos.
3309038	3328310	545	E	0.99988	Maybe they didn't use this term explicitly, but I'm thinking, for example, Wilfred Bjong, who's got the notion of the O layer, which has connotations of well, the thing that cannot be known or categorized, who has, like, indeterminate elements of the mind.
3328460	3332238	546	E	0.98	And that's one of his major contributions to psychoanalysis.
3332354	3334166	547	E	1	On the other hand, more the French schools.
3334198	3346410	548	E	0.91873	I'm thinking of Jacques Lacan, who's got the notion of the real, which is also one of his major contributions to psychoanalysis, where notions of rupture, of absence, or of lack are very prominent.
3346850	3357570	549	E	0.99233	I'm not sure I'm not an expert here, but I think Lacan explicitly challenges the notion of Freud's mechanistic worldview in one of his seminars.
3358070	3361890	550	E	0.95149	So I'm wondering what you think about this, Alexey .
3364470	3370594	551	A	0.95971	I'm not an expert in Lacan at all, and I know Wilfred beyond in a limited fashion.
3370642	3376230	552	A	0.9937	So perhaps Mark is a better person to talk.
3376300	3378438	553	A	0.95	And I like Freud.
3378534	3381302	554	A	0.98876	Particularly mark's interpretations and translations.
3381366	3384134	555	A	0.98979	But maybe Mark can comment on Lacan and beyond.
3384262	3388220	556	A	0.8763	I'm not sufficiently knowledgeable about their work.
3394000	3398524	557	B	0.99972	If you want to Mark or Bren, you can share some thoughts.
3398572	3399330	558	B	0.99102	Yeah, please.
3400900	3412020	559	C	0.98332	Well, I think that the point that Albert's making is we must remember that psychoanalysis is not synonymous with Freud.
3412600	3420920	560	C	0.99948	That not everything in psychoanalysis stands or falls by whether or not we accept this or that tenet of Freud's.
3421580	3431776	561	C	0.86	And in neuropsychoanalysis, we try very much to draw upon all of the traditions within psychoanalysis.
3431908	3446450	562	C	1	And we sort of fondly believe that we'll be able to find more common ground because there are greater empirical tools available in neuropsychoanalysis than in psychoanalysis by itself.
3447220	3463444	563	C	0.99992	We are hoping to resolve some of these theoretical disagreements, trying to move beyond just different systems of belief, trying to move more toward a psychoanalysis in which we can decide questions in an ordinary scientific way.
3463562	3482170	564	C	0.99935	But it will always be very difficult for exactly the reason that Alexey 's whole talk is about, I suppose, which is the extreme complexity and therefore unpredictability of the phenomena that we are dealing with.
3482960	3486312	565	C	0.99515	So I think Albert's points are valid.
3486456	3495170	566	C	0.99739	That the beyond's approach, Lacan's approach, they add a great deal.
3497300	3504560	567	C	0.98907	They don't have as much to lose if we throw out the principle of psychical determinism.
3504980	3516390	568	C	0.99883	But having said that, let me just quickly say a word about psychical determinism, because this has been a big part of what Andrea picked up on in what Alexey said.
3517320	3522868	569	C	1	I think it comes down to the question that I asked at the outset.
3522964	3531800	570	C	0.78155	It's not a matter of is the behavior of the mind random or it's a question of how predictable.
3532300	3535096	571	C	0.93655	It's not a matter of is there no determinism?
3535208	3541020	572	C	0.63899	It's a matter of how easily can we trace effects back to their causes.
3541360	3546140	573	C	0.76115	So the fact that there's a great deal that goes on where we can't do that.
3546290	3556368	574	C	0.99998	There are many things our patients say, whether they be slips of the tongue or anything else of that kind, and not only to do with parapraxes, but anything that they do.
3556534	3559872	575	C	0.99945	There are certain things that we see with regularity.
3560016	3564288	576	C	0.9	I mean, the very phenomenon of transference is all about regularities.
3564464	3566276	577	C	0.99993	That there are certain things that we see.
3566298	3573880	578	C	0.54002	Yes, I can understand this happens repeatedly.
3574940	3584424	579	C	1	I think I can explain that with reference to certain aspects of the patient's inner world and their past, but there's a great deal else that we can't.
3584552	3593496	580	C	0.99997	So I don't think that it's a kind of either there's determinism or there's stochasticity.
3593608	3599840	581	C	0.65	I think that this is why I was talking also about the layers of the predictive hierarchy.
3600340	3602896	582	C	1	The deeper layers are the unconscious ones.
3602998	3612412	583	C	0.80221	Their things are pretty stereotyped, pretty predictable, in fact, too predictable.
3612476	3619120	584	C	0.97	I mean, in other words, it over generalizes, it's too confident about its beliefs.
3619420	3626440	585	C	0.99562	But as we head toward the pre conscious and conscious there, things are much less predictable.
3627900	3630872	586	C	0.79152	So I won't say more.
3631006	3644190	587	C	0.62	A couple of things in what Alexey said in his comments after mine, that if we have time, I'll come back to but I think let's rather hear from Brin before I say anything more.
3645540	3646770	588	F	0.99986	Thank you so much.
3648100	3673540	589	F	0.9298	I'm perhaps the least qualified here to comment on your paper, Alexey, but I do have one or two thoughts, and they come from a place of being very fortunate thus far in my life to have been a patient for many, many hours, sometimes on the couch, and also to be a clinical psychologist.
3673620	3676516	590	F	1	I failed to mention that in my introduction.
3676628	3696364	591	F	0.95709	So I'm a was until recently, when my foray began into more research based areas, and via the Active Inference Institute and Mark's work and Cole Friston's work, I was a pure clinician.
3696412	3702000	592	F	1	I had it in my mind that I was going to treat psychopathology to the best of my ability.
3702580	3715350	593	F	0.99771	But really it was being a patient first and foremost that brought me into closer contact with the theme of your paper and certainly the themes of Mark's work.
3716200	3721800	594	F	0.75	And I think I've encountered it from both areas.
3722140	3744040	595	F	1	And certainly to my mind, it matters less the inner workings of the degree to which chaos stochastic, all these big wonderful terms that I'm only beginning to even think about.
3744210	3744930	596	A	0.99696	But.
3748580	3759700	597	F	0.9998	What matters to me is that how do you help somebody who is in a state, who comes in disheveled?
3760040	3766070	598	F	0.84	And how does one go about helping aiding somebody in that state?
3766760	3783736	599	F	1	I fell out of love with psychoanalysis for personal reasons, but it was in returning to it, I've become more kind of better acquainted with its strengths and its limitations.
3783928	3814260	600	F	0.52	And I'm realizing that when you help somebody and manage to reduce the noise, to reduce the chaos in somebody's mind, when they become the greater degrees of health start returning to them, that they do rely far more, whether they know it or not, on probabilistic reasoning in their daily kind of functioning.
3814920	3823464	601	F	1	And so I think there is a strong case to be made for a mathematical way of processing the world.
3823582	3827530	602	F	0.50824	It doesn't have to necessarily be made conscious to the person.
3827900	3834188	603	F	0.99993	It can be a bit overwhelming to try and impart that on somebody.
3834354	3856608	604	F	0.99999	But I think a brain that is not working properly, regardless of the degree to which there is chaos, that can be measured or quantifiably measured in that brain, somebody is tripping over themselves because they are unable to predict what might happen.
3856774	3870170	605	F	1	And that is a terrifying prospect because I think there is some reliance and some staunch dependability on the fact that the sun is going to rise and that it's going to set and that I can then focus on other things.
3872060	3895184	606	F	0.99903	So that's just my comments more from kind of a personal front of being a patient and encountering the limitations of psychotherapy and what I would have done in those moments of need to have not, as you say, had a more deterministic view of what was happening.
3895382	3904400	607	F	1	And I've tried to transfer that or carry that over, rightly or wrongly, into my own therapy as a psychotherapist.
3905940	3927930	608	F	0.99642	So a more personal thing of what it means to be feel chaotic and what I see, regardless of how confirmed it is or not, but chaos reigns and to try and not compound that is certainly something that I'm interested.
3928940	3929736	609	A	0.99452	Yeah.
3929918	3931160	610	B	0.99992	Thank you, Bryn.
3931740	3937832	611	B	0.99953	I'll also give my thought on what's at stake and what's on the table as a total non clinician.
3937896	3962288	612	B	0.99709	But what I saw in Alexi's paper and also what I see people coming towards I see the paper as Alexey making a real stable of concepts or portfolio of topics ranging from the first principles of active inference like surprise bounding, to dynamic stochastic chaotic, which not the same thing, but they sometimes cohabitate.
3962384	3974868	613	B	0.98693	So bringing a set of concepts into play, making it matter for the field so that it can matter for the clinician, so that it can matter for the patient, which is where you totally brought it home to Brin.
3974964	3992888	614	B	0.98	And in my totally simplified model, I was seeing all this diagnostic machinery from personalized data, EEG recordings, all these surveys and samples, all the different conversation therapy itself, all these different measurements, inference.
3993064	4001824	615	B	0.93	And then it passes through the Markov blanket of the diagnosis, and it's like, well, now we know that that person is X or they have X.
4002022	4007376	616	B	1	And then here's where we now branch back out with modalities of treatment.
4007408	4020488	617	B	1	And so that bottlenecking has obvious relevance in terms of getting a categorical grip on what we basically all agree are wetware complex systems, they're sensitive to initial conditions, all of that.
4020654	4030036	618	B	1	And what if, though, like you brought up the example with the scar tissue, maybe it's literal bodily scar tissue, maybe it's conceptual scar tissue.
4030148	4037016	619	B	1	What if that inference were able to be understood in the context of an attractor landscape?
4037128	4044740	620	B	1	And it's not just a singular attractor, so we have multiple attractors, we have a chaotic landscape.
4044920	4058320	621	B	1	And so what if we were able to perforate that blanket, speaking super loosely, to bring in what we have already recognized as diagnostically relevant?
4058400	4077560	622	B	0.99998	Like the fact that patients who have differential entropy have this or that epileptic outcome or coma outcome, bring in that machinery that led to the diagnosis, but now take it beyond the diagnosis and maybe even beyond the clinician's concept, directly into the hands of the patient?
4085690	4086662	623	A	0.99903	Thank you so much.
4086716	4090954	624	A	0.61733	Perhaps we can hear from Mark and yeah, I'm not eager to talk.
4091072	4093900	625	A	0.9998	If there is time, I'll say something, but if not, that's OK.
4095950	4101862	626	C	0.99965	Well, let me first of all say something about my might.
4101936	4105534	627	C	0.7448	Some of you have noticed that suddenly everything went black behind me.
4105652	4109680	628	C	0.9998	That's because I'm in South Africa where they have power problems.
4110050	4114786	629	C	0.99	And then a kind person in my household thought that they would help.
4114888	4119220	630	C	1	And they've put this huge spotlight here which is shining in my eyes.
4123910	4128550	631	C	0.99704	If I look as if I'm in a rabbit in headlights, it's because I am.
4128620	4133014	632	C	1	I sent a text message saying, please come and remove this big lamp you put here.
4133052	4135320	633	C	1	But they don't seem to have received the message.
4136030	4139610	634	C	0.99	Now back to our actual topic.
4141150	4156138	635	C	1	To the extent that I'm able to not be distracted from it, I think that when I asked Alexey what was at stake, his main answer was to do with a diagnosis.
4156234	4162610	636	C	1	Now, I don't mean that he's saying that that's all that's at stake, but I think he's saying this illustrates what's at stake.
4163350	4185510	637	C	0.99778	So I want to first of all make sure that because I'm not sure who our audience is and who's going to be watching this in case anybody misunderstands, I want to make clear that in psychoanalysis, we've long ago moved away from DSM and ICD type diagnosis.
4187050	4202906	638	C	0.99996	We always thought that the psychiatric nozology was wholly artificial and created divisions where they don't exist in nature.
4203098	4206378	639	C	1	And we replaced it with a far more dynamic.
4206554	4208554	640	C	0.64306	Approach to diagnosis.
4208602	4210714	641	C	1	And it's not just a matter of labeling.
4210842	4214814	642	C	0.9999	It's a matter also of what kind of thought process lies behind the diagnosis.
4214862	4233030	643	C	1	In other words, conceptualizing what's going on here, rather than saying, this is an instance of personality disorder, and I'll specify which type, we don't think like that in psychoanalysis, and really, we never have in neuropsychoanalysis.
4234570	4236790	644	C	0.99994	We build in that same tradition.
4237450	4242346	645	C	1	I think that what Alexey was worrying about.
4242528	4256830	646	C	0.77296	He's saying, yeah, but you use systems, you say that there's a certain number of drives and you use those to pass what you're seeing clinically.
4257330	4264050	647	C	1	And yes, we do, and we have to, because you can't just say, what I'm seeing is chaos.
4264550	4271938	648	C	0.99998	What you've got to say is, well, what I'm seeing is chaos, but let me try my best to find the deeper structure of this.
4272104	4277126	649	C	1	And so what we do is much the same as what I was saying earlier about how brain and mind work.
4277228	4279542	650	C	0.9694	Likewise, the clinician's mind works.
4279596	4290886	651	C	0.99999	That way we have some deeper concepts that organize what we see, and then more on the surface, we see the complexity.
4290998	4298826	652	C	0.99999	In other words, we don't think that we can reduce a patient just to one saying, this patient has problems with this drive, or something.
4298928	4305418	653	C	0.99999	It's not as simple as that, of course, but we do start with saying, well, these are the drives, these are the attractors.
4305594	4316770	654	C	1	To put it in terms of the attractor landscape that you're talking about, these are the preferred states of the human phenotype.
4317190	4320020	655	C	1	And in mental life too, they are preferred states.
4320630	4328514	656	C	0.99916	There are certain attractors that we're trying to stay in.
4328552	4332050	657	C	0.99197	Those like, for example, fear.
4332130	4334710	658	C	1	We want to be safe, we don't want to feel fear.
4335370	4341606	659	C	0.99999	With respect to attachment bonding, we want to stay close to our attachment figures.
4341638	4342906	660	C	0.99999	We don't want to lose them.
4343008	4349120	661	C	0.70187	With respect to rage, we don't want to be frustrated and have things standing in our way.
4349570	4354430	662	C	0.99993	We want to be able to have free access to the objects of our needs and so on.
4354580	4362770	663	C	0.99939	Those are these attractors, and we have great difficulty staying in those homeostatic bounds.
4364390	4366734	664	C	0.99985	It is a dynamic picture.
4366862	4381718	665	C	1	And then over the question of the different drives, there's the highly individualized predictive model that each one of us comes up with in relation to those drives and in relation to the conflicts between those drives and so on.
4381804	4395434	666	C	0.95653	So I think that this way of thinking that we use in psychoanalysis and neuropsychoanalysis is already of the kind that Alex is calling for.
4395552	4418222	667	C	0.99514	So I think that what Daniel's just said is therefore perhaps very important to make clear it's that he's offering us a language, an additional language, an additional I don't just mean language, I should say an additional set of concepts and a highly developed one, which we might find useful.
4418286	4420482	668	C	1	And so we should take this on board.
4420616	4425426	669	C	0.9993	That sounds very convincing to me, if that's what's at stake here.
4425528	4435400	670	C	0.99879	That Alexey is saying this is a language that lends itself to the phenomena that you study and to the way in which you go about studying it, then it sounds to me as if Alexey is right.
4436110	4444700	671	C	0.98798	So that's the main thing I wanted to say in response to his comments in relation to what I said.
4445630	4451614	672	C	0.68976	So if anyone else wants to say anything else, that's good with me.
4451652	4462240	673	C	0.99207	But Alexey, if I've misunderstood and if there's something else that you think is at stake that I'm not getting, now's your chance to say it.
4463410	4475560	674	A	0.99578	Well, I just wanted to end the conversation when you said that if this language might be of any even to consider this language in our future models, I'm a happy man and there's nothing else I need to say.
4476010	4480214	675	A	1	And I just wanted to say that these are human things.
4480252	4481586	676	A	0.90511	They're occupational hazards.
4481618	4495434	677	A	0.99999	Some of the things I'm talking about, this paper I'm working on about narrative stuff, is that, of course, it is much easier for us to think in categories, even in the psychoanalytic world.
4495632	4501198	678	A	0.95037	What we do let's take the Macquillium system and the previous one.
4501284	4506522	679	A	0.57552	We used to say three levels of functioning neurotic, borderline psychotic.
4506586	4507710	680	A	0.99996	These are categories.
4508130	4509562	681	A	0.99001	They're not DSM categories.
4509626	4512106	682	A	0.99638	They're not bipolar one, but they're categories nonetheless.
4512218	4516126	683	A	0.96951	Then we have character styles, obsessive character style, histrionic character style.
4516158	4517086	684	A	0.91083	They're categories.
4517198	4517762	685	A	0.99456	Okay?
4517896	4521102	686	A	0.70193	So to some degree, it's a human condition to put things in categories.
4521166	4526260	687	A	1	And I do think that this is a very strong historical reasons that we think this way.
4528010	4531154	688	A	0.99999	We have generations of thinking this way in categories.
4531282	4536598	689	A	1	And yes, at the end of the day, when we paint a portrait of a patient, it's developed, and it's like a tapestry.
4536694	4542198	690	A	1	All of these things weave into one another, and it's complex, but we start from basic categories.
4542294	4551110	691	A	1	And certainly if we consider that some things can be transient, there can be emergence, they're like that.
4551280	4557482	692	A	0.99992	Certain behavior in one context is a compulsion, but it's not a compulsion in another context.
4557626	4569838	693	A	0.99	And perhaps I'm saying trivial things to clinicians and also what dream you said just to comment when you said as a patient to reduce the noise and reduce the chaos.
4569934	4571934	694	A	1	I detect the bias in the language.
4572062	4576674	695	A	0.99956	You see how we call psychopathology in DSM disorders.
4576802	4578630	696	A	0.77702	Disorder is a bad word for us.
4578700	4581270	697	A	1	And I'm trying to say chaos is healthy.
4581770	4585574	698	A	1	I spend most of my day in gamma functioning, which is a chaotic state.
4585692	4587062	699	A	0.99944	It's not a bad thing.
4587196	4589414	700	A	0.9981	So in the folk language, chaos is a bad word.
4589452	4593290	701	A	0.71172	Disorder is a bad I want to put things in order, and then perhaps we're missing something.
4593360	4605662	702	A	0.99979	What comes to mind is, I think, Mark, you had meetings with Michael Levin and Ian McGilchrist, who know big on talking about the mechanistic, logical, linear, straight and narrow left hemisphere type.
4605716	4612946	703	A	1	Of course it's not left hemisphere, but that's the model versus holistic sensorial kind of right hemisphere artistic type.
4613048	4629974	704	A	0.99	And we're missing the second part, like Daniel's background is surrounded by art where we spend less time in the right hemisphere, maybe appropriately so, but I think that there's some things that lend themselves to that level of understanding and we break things.
4630172	4636934	705	A	0.68344	We look at psychopathology and a human suffering like it's a carburetor sometimes, where we again put it in buckets.
4636982	4637862	706	A	0.99976	That's my impression.
4637926	4643898	707	A	0.987	But what you said is wonderful and I don't contradict with anything.
4643984	4645980	708	A	1	I agree with everything you said, Mark.
4648610	4651230	709	F	0.52758	Alexey, if I can just comment.
4654210	4654586	710	C	0.97476	It'S.
4654618	4655950	711	F	0.99991	Almost like an arc.
4656930	4665326	712	F	0.99	The pot of gold at the end of the arc is the reduced chaos, the reduced noise in terms of the patients from the patient's perspective.
4665438	4679350	713	F	0.99993	But how you get there, ironically, is actually by inducing states of tolerable chaos and then kind of reformulating that, reconsolidating that chaos.
4680010	4698154	714	F	0.99986	So it's not that from the healing or growth or whatever the patient might present to you for it has everything to do with minimal or marginal chaos induction and then reintegration of that.
4698192	4707854	715	F	0.99257	So the whole process is premised on chaos, but in bite sized doses, maybe one could say, right, and just to.
4707892	4709726	716	A	0.99999	Finish up and then I'll stop talking.
4709828	4726710	717	A	0.99748	Jonathan Schadler, who all know and know, widely respected as a psychoanalytic practitioner and teacher and writer, he recently said that take a patient X with an analyst Y together the diet has emergent properties.
4727210	4730680	718	A	0.92911	That is not the same thing as patient X with the analyst Z.
4731050	4731606	719	A	0.99441	Right?
4731708	4734790	720	A	1	And show me one study where we take that into account.
4734860	4735750	721	A	0.99991	We don't.
4736650	4741254	722	A	0.93239	We just do random clinical trial, then we do metaanalysis of random clinical trial.
4741302	4742970	723	A	0.9999	What technique did the therapist use?
4743040	4746038	724	A	0.58237	They used, you know, whatever four letter therapy they applied.
4746134	4749138	725	A	0.90543	Nobody looks at the emerging properties in a diet.
4749334	4754234	726	A	0.99405	This matrix between the two, and that's the language of dynamical systems.
4754282	4756906	727	A	0.99898	This is Daniel Friedman ant colony.
4757098	4760314	728	A	1	A single ant doesn't build bridges and grow mushrooms.
4760362	4761858	729	A	0.94035	Ant colony does all those things.
4761944	4765474	730	A	0.99984	We don't talk about emergence in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, do we?
4765592	4766354	731	B	0.99997	It's true.
4766472	4768718	732	B	0.99976	It's also a fundamental challenge.
4768894	4775654	733	B	1	After all, you can't replicate within one Dyad or across Dyads in a finite world.
4775772	4777830	734	B	0.99576	So it does point to fundamentals.
4778570	4791382	735	B	0.99909	In our last minutes, if each would like to give some thoughts, where do we go as we now the opponent of exponent away from each other in our paths?
4791446	4798102	736	B	0.99172	So maybe Albert, Bryn, Mark and then Alexey, what are your overall thoughts, reflections?
4798166	4800190	737	B	1	And then where are we heading?
4804290	4805790	738	B	0.9971	Go for it, Albert.
4806930	4813780	739	E	0.98467	Yeah, I was about to comment on Alexey about the emergent properties thing.
4815350	4817730	740	E	0.99957	It's kind of the same point I made earlier.
4820310	4823650	741	E	0.96421	Later psychoanalytic theories do talk about emergent properties.
4824550	4828360	742	E	0.99629	But yes, I think as what Professor Salvage just mentioned.
4831530	4832486	743	C	0.99243	This new set of.
4832508	4846134	744	E	0.99937	Concepts makes it very practical for us to communicate with each other because psychoanalysis has a bad habit of reinventing new concepts every new decade.
4846182	4853790	745	E	0.99261	So there's a lot of chaos to use that word within psychoanalytic discourse.
4854690	4857450	746	E	1	But overall, I thought I'm very grateful.
4857530	4859838	747	E	1	I think this was a very interesting talk.
4860004	4860794	748	E	0.92069	So yeah.
4860852	4861700	749	E	0.9986	Thank you.
4863830	4864450	750	B	0.99956	Thank you.
4864520	4865140	751	C	0.99285	Yes.
4866390	4878258	752	C	0.99987	By way of closing remarks, I agree with actually, it seems to me that there's an abundance of agreement in this meeting.
4878434	4881510	753	C	1	I don't see any big controversy.
4882330	4884680	754	C	0.9925	So that's nice.
4886250	4890602	755	C	1	I think what Bryn said really captures it.
4890656	4894746	756	C	1	I liked it because what he said was so experience near.
4894848	4910630	757	C	0.93957	He was just describing what it feels like to be a patient, to be in a state of not knowing and uncertainty as opposed to a more stable kind of tranquility.
4910730	4934710	758	C	1	And then the ability to allow yourself to return to uncertainty if you've found answers that are too simple and that are too static to allow ourselves to go back into this state of not really knowing.
4935870	4941430	759	C	0.7165	That, I think, really does describe what we try to do for our patients.
4941510	4950862	760	C	1	What we have to remember applies to ourselves not only because we are ultimately patients too, but because it applies to how the mind works.
4950916	4960718	761	C	0.99999	It applies to science, how science works, that we do need to find order, but there is disorder out there.
4960804	4972158	762	C	1	And so we're always at risk of coming prematurely to a rigid system of belief and we have to return back to the coalface and back to the chaos.
4972334	4978390	763	C	0.9985	But ultimately, where we want to be is back in that valley.
4980490	5007710	764	C	0.96	And so, as much as Alex is right to remind us that the highest levels of brain activity in many senses of the word are entropic and that deep sleep and seizures are bad things, as much as that's true.
5007860	5018306	765	C	0.99495	Nevertheless, I think that the great trend of the mind it's one of its fundamental working principles is we are wanting to be more certain.
5018488	5021102	766	C	0.83858	We want life to be more predictable.
5021166	5023258	767	C	0.99997	We don't like to be in chaos.
5023454	5045302	768	C	1	And I think that that's an important thing to remember while we are acknowledging the importance of chaos and of the highly unpredictable nature of the world and of the phenomena we study in our field, nevertheless, we retreat from it, and for very good reasons.
5045446	5047970	769	C	0.99742	So those are my closing remarks.
5048150	5049120	770	C	0.67	And thank.
5052310	5054766	771	F	0.84	And I'll be very brief.
5054958	5067058	772	F	0.55582	Alexey , just thank you for the paper and for having such a strong focus on the patient and on psychopath well, on the human condition.
5067154	5075234	773	F	1	I think that's so nice to have that come out of the paper when at first glance it doesn't seem to be there.
5075292	5083158	774	F	0.98662	So thanks for making it so human and then just Daniel for organizing and to spend time with Mark and Albert.
5083334	5084262	775	F	0.99827	It's a great pleasure.
5084326	5085660	776	F	0.97942	So thank you very much.
5087650	5089360	777	B	0.25677	Alexey, final words.
5090530	5095918	778	A	1	I want to thank everybody and Mark and Bryn and Albert and Daniel, Andrea, thank you.
5096004	5102930	779	A	0.93	I had a great fun and I'm very grateful, honestly, for your help and openness and flexibility.
5103510	5112302	780	A	1	One of the other reasons is kind of the time we live in Yuval harari made that comment that the rate of change is accelerating.
5112446	5115090	781	A	0.99959	When we were hunter gatherers, uncertainty was norm.
5115160	5116834	782	A	0.99913	You wake up, there's nothing in the fridge.
5116882	5117986	783	A	0.99992	You have to go hunt.
5118098	5120054	784	A	0.91	And we tolerated uncertainty better.
5120092	5122534	785	A	0.99992	We could put our worldly possessions on the back.
5122652	5124786	786	A	0.99	And then we started living in the world of iPads.
5124818	5126370	787	A	0.99671	iPhones were bombarded with information.
5126460	5128054	788	A	1	And we must minimize uncertainty.
5128102	5133398	789	A	0.98878	We must have predictability in everything, which is not the natural world for mammals.
5133574	5142762	790	A	0.97	And now we live our life and then bang, COVID hits, and then bang, certain person becomes the President of the United States and everything goes upside down.
5142816	5146614	791	A	0.8649	So the black swans are hitting us more frequently.
5146742	5152862	792	A	0.99224	So I think having the theory of that at our fingerprint and applying it to our work is probably beneficial.
5152926	5154514	793	A	0.99836	But again, thank you all so much.
5154552	5155940	794	A	0.99	I really appreciate it.
5156390	5156898	795	B	0.99994	Awesome.
5156984	5158926	796	B	0.52773	Well, thank you all for joining.
5158958	5162914	797	B	1	The conversation continues, so till next time.
5163112	5164100	798	A	0.98811	Thank you.
5164630	5165346	799	A	0.69282	Bye bye.
5165448	5166594	800	A	0.99871	Thanks a lot.
5166792	5167118	801	A	0.97617	Bye.
