3750	4300	A	0.546256959438324	You.
6350	7930	B	0.9103710651397705	Hello and welcome, everyone.
8080	13238	B	0.9294026494026184	This is guest stream number 53.1 at the Active Inference Institute.
13414	16538	B	0.8586926460266113	It's August 23, 2023.
16704	29758	B	0.9007564783096313	We are going to be having a presentation followed by a discussion around the recent work of Alexei Tolchinski, a case for chaos theory inclusion in Neuro psychoanalytic modeling.
29854	34622	B	0.7106543183326721	So if you're watching live, please feel free to add any questions into the live chat.
34766	42114	B	0.8188351988792419	Otherwise, we will now have the presentation followed by a discussion with our excellent panelists.
42162	43746	B	0.9794867038726807	So thank you everybody for joining.
43778	46070	B	0.5389801263809204	And Alexi, to you for the presentation.
49130	51830	A	0.8880262970924377	Thank you, Daniel.
53450	55082	A	0.9515293836593628	Thank you, Mark, for finding the time.
55136	58266	A	0.9922742247581482	I'm very grateful and excited to talk about this.
58368	61654	A	0.9377983212471008	Thank you, Andrea Brynn Albert.
61702	63882	A	0.7999787330627441	I hope maybe Mike will join us.
63936	69550	A	0.9267297983169556	And thank you, Daniel And, active inference institute, for organizing this meeting.
69890	72110	A	0.8637229800224304	So, can you see the slides?
73250	73802	A	0.560655415058136	Yep.
73866	76880	A	0.745133638381958	Okay, so I'll just proceed then.
79190	80802	A	0.8787856101989746	This is the outline of the talk.
80856	94802	A	0.8711114525794983	I'll share some preliminary comments and talk briefly about assumptions in the current models, summarize the data, talk about free energy principle formulations as compatible with chaos, and talk about some future developments.
94866	96966	A	0.5040674805641174	And hopefully we can discuss that.
96988	100710	A	0.7973819375038147	I'm very much looking forward to have more questions than answers.
101370	107754	A	0.5732014775276184	I'd like to start with what Michael Levin taught me, I guess, is just why it's important to me.
107792	110998	A	0.5451773405075073	The most important thing is the clinical applications.
111174	122462	A	0.6575126051902771	I think that with your work, Mark, and with Pang SIP's work, we have been moving away from dualism over the course of some time.
122516	127034	A	0.6689791083335876	But I think the other big d determinism is still highly prevalent and dominant.
127162	133630	A	0.8123121857643127	And I do think it influences our clinical work, diagnosis and psychotherapy and assessments.
133790	141162	A	0.842167854309082	And I think that it may be beneficial for some of the harder conditions we work with to consider, including nonlinear framework.
141326	142840	A	0.5014426708221436	That's my main focus.
143450	145522	A	0.8590988516807556	This is the link to the preprint.
145586	148950	A	0.5959327816963196	And the paper is published fully in Neuropsychoanalysis Journal.
150330	165050	A	0.8787180185317993	Some of it is discussion with this foundational paper that you, Mark, wrote, the new Project for a Scientific Psychology General Scheme, which is a perhaps revision, a revival of Freud's famous paper Project for Scientific Psychology.
166270	184914	A	0.9388854503631592	And I'd like to give you credit, Mark, that you have been opening conversations between disciplines that hadn't been talking to each other prior to your efforts, such as psychoanalysis and neurosciences, you've been doing for more than 20 years with great success.
185112	197158	A	0.8089988827705383	In the same spirit, I wanted to mention that Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology exists since 91, which is when their first conference happened, about less than 20 years.
197244	206906	A	0.8124256134033203	Then the first conference on chaos in Lake, Italy, around Lake Italy, lake Como in Italy in 76, which was mostly physicists at that time.
206928	208678	A	0.7186986804008484	And then psychologists joined.
208854	212902	A	0.9898715615272522	And I've attended the recent conference in Toronto, which was absolutely wonderful.
212966	215494	A	0.8283952474594116	And I've met extraordinary clinicians and scientists.
215542	219486	A	0.664395809173584	And I think that it would be beneficial to open that dialogue as well.
219508	223920	A	0.6566744446754456	And maybe if there is a wall between us to consider demolishing the wall.
227490	233758	A	0.9204797148704529	In terms of intent for the paper, you, Mark, pointed out to me that you've had an exchange with Robert Gallitzer Levy.
233934	235586	A	0.7492050528526306	For those of you who may not know him.
235608	248230	A	0.8822749853134155	He's a psychoanalyst from Chicago, a psychoanalytic writer and teacher who wrote a book on non linear psychoanalysis and deserves a lot of credit for his advocacy and he's sharing his thoughts.
248810	257906	A	0.9240822792053223	He posed a question to you, Mark, of possibly considering nonlinear components in that seminal paper, your Project for Scientific Psychology.
258098	264810	A	0.8711200952529907	And to which he responded that the key point in such discussion was whether the mental apparatus was indeed nonlinear.
265150	271630	A	0.7800756096839905	So I took your comment as a task, as a challenge, if you wish and decided to write a paper about it.
271780	280110	A	0.6420904397964478	I don't know if the data presented is sufficient, but I tried, and very clearly I don't intend to contradict or criticize.
280550	282226	A	0.722495973110199	That would be funny of me to do.
282328	289326	A	0.8049947619438171	I'm hopeful maybe to add a branch on this tree that you're growing, clinical and theoretical tree.
289358	297426	A	0.7468032836914062	And should you consider it worthwhile to go in this direction we wouldn't have to change very much because this is the paper by Friston.
297458	299666	A	0.875340461730957	Lancelot de Costa and others called Stochastic.
299698	301270	A	0.7438004016876221	Chaos and Marker blankets.
301610	307002	A	0.5437312722206116	Free energy principle is compatible with the chaotic attracting set.
307136	313770	A	0.8082139492034912	What I thought was not present just yet was a formulation where the attracting set experiences a phase transition.
314110	321374	A	0.9538527131080627	And I took liberty to ask Karl about it and he shared some very nice thoughts that I will, with his permission, share.
321412	336446	A	0.6862930655479431	At the end of the talk, I'd like to cite Maxwell Ramstead, whom you know, and his colleagues from the paper and Bayesian mechanics of physics, often by beliefs where they talk about dynamics, mechanics and principles.
336638	341194	A	0.7686991691589355	And in physics, Kepler's work is descriptive.
341262	344486	A	0.8358907699584961	It shows what the orbits of heavenly bodies are.
344668	348210	A	0.7339990139007568	Mechanics are the how of the dynamics.
348290	349186	A	0.7248848080635071	This is Newton's.
349218	351698	A	0.7152916789054871	Laws and principles are prescriptive.
351794	354166	A	0.724098265171051	They are about why things work this way.
354268	360726	A	0.8897222280502319	There's a certain hierarchy in physics where you could derive the second law of Newton from principle of least action.
360838	364730	A	0.8620194792747498	And then if you have initial conditions, you could calculate the dynamics.
365470	371214	A	0.5981845259666443	The reason I'm mentioning that is, I think, Mark, your new project for scientific psychology is a high road.
371412	378640	A	0.8858765959739685	It seems to start from first principles such as the free energy principle and then you seem to derive things down from there.
379090	383538	A	0.8475034832954407	So I thought, why not try to see how the low road may look like?
383704	398630	A	0.8483034372329712	If in addition to these derivations and deductions and declaration of what entropy should be in the brain what if we measure it in Animal Studies and Human Studies in Health and Pathology and see what the data shows and whether or not the low road meets the high road in the middle?
398700	400950	A	0.8807713985443115	Or perhaps something may need to be added.
402810	407690	A	0.615975022315979	I also like to clarify why I spend time in the paper talking about obvious things for everybody.
407760	409846	A	0.7570886611938477	Here the axioms and postulates.
410038	431214	A	0.8352701663970947	And I'm quoting here Edward Frankel, who is a mathematician at you know, Michael will forgive me, but viewpoint is that one can say that some parts of biology can be seen as based on chemistry, which can be seen as based on physics, which can be seen as based on mathematics.
431342	433374	A	0.8355258107185364	So how do things work in mathematics?
433502	439806	A	0.7327920794487	We know that Karl Frieston likes to translate nearly everything he works on into the language of mathematics.
439998	446854	A	0.8658793568611145	Classically there's something called a formal system which we can metaphorically compare to building a house.
446972	451346	A	0.8935810327529907	So the foundation of the house is a set of axioms that has certain qualities.
451458	455398	A	0.7905251383781433	And then we build things up using the logic of Aristotle.
455414	457450	A	0.696694552898407	And we derive things like theorems.
457950	464502	A	0.8667218089103699	An example would be Euclidean geometry, which is on the plane that is based on five axioms of Euclid.
464566	465702	A	0.6609464883804321	That's the foundation.
465846	468830	A	0.8504488468170166	And then you could derive things like Pythagorean theorem.
469250	474480	A	0.7907564043998718	Now, if we were to change just one of the axioms in the foundation, the entire house changes.
475090	480330	A	0.6808912754058838	An example would be the fifth axiom of Euclid that parallel lines essentially don't intersect.
480410	493714	A	0.8948044180870056	If you change that then we could have a house on the sphere which is Lobozevsky Riemann geometry and meridians on the earth are parallel and they intersect or you could have parabolic shape where parallel lines also intersect.
493842	500230	A	0.6036774516105652	So we'll have an entirely different framework and it may be naive to expect the theorem to look the same.
500300	506060	A	0.843647837638855	The Figurian theorem, if we put it on the sphere is different, the formula is different.
507390	527998	A	0.8373674154281616	I'm mentioning that is because I love multidisciplinarity and I think that's the way of the future with that sometimes when we cross over into another discipline such as psychologists taking mathematicals or physics ideas then we may occasionally forget this formal system thing.
528164	548822	A	0.5885663032531738	For example, when we say things like human beings resist or violate the second law of thermodynamics then the second law was formulated for closed systems in the state of equilibrium such as a sealed chamber of gas and human beings are neither closed nor in the state of equilibrium so it doesn't quite apply.
548876	550342	A	0.7987232208251953	It's a different formal system.
550476	553960	A	0.7898719906806946	One needs physics of open systems to make a statement like that.
554410	571114	A	0.8321277499198914	So again, in mathematics because you mark seem to have taken us deeply in the main of mathematics in your project you have differential equations for action, perception, precision you have mark of blankets, random dynamical systems equivalences, partial derivatives.
571162	579520	A	0.7777312994003296	Then in mathematics people fix the set of axioms, they fix the definitions and then they build a theory, right?
580770	586002	A	0.8807213306427002	So I want to be clear, I want to clarify what are the axioms in the theory that is built?
586136	587490	A	0.8133608102798462	What is the foundation?
587990	597814	A	0.7853238582611084	And in the effort of time, maybe I'll talk about just one of them which is Freud's psychic determinism and this is a question for me, not an answer.
597932	605298	A	0.8288232684135437	I wanted to ask you because I'm assuming whether you kept this axiom or you changed it.
605484	613018	A	0.7228649258613586	So Freud said in the psychopathology of everyday life that there is nothing arbitrary or undetermined in the psychic life.
613184	619182	A	0.666110634803772	There's different versions of this statement and it has been repeated by generations of psychoanalysts over a hundred years.
619236	620666	A	0.6430734992027283	And it became very entrenched.
620698	624750	A	0.6220617890357971	It's sort of a cultural meme and a major tenet of psychoanalysis.
625970	642840	A	0.569726288318634	If I were to give an illustration, perhaps those of us who are not in psychoanalytic therapy, then let's imagine an analytic therapist hearing a patient who intends to say same with an S, but they use the word shame, right?
643290	645030	A	0.766818642616272	So such a phenomenon.
645690	650710	A	0.5932310819625854	First of all, I think psychodynamic, psychopathic therapists would probably say that's not an accident.
651130	651830	A	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
651980	657398	A	0.5668319463729858	Accident is not a used term in psychoanalysis.
657494	667314	A	0.7504006624221802	And secondly, they will probably infer of what it might mean, for example, infer along the lines of unconscious or emotional dynamics, emotional conflict.
667462	671386	A	0.7549467086791992	Somebody else may infer that it may have neuropsychological reasons.
671498	674362	A	0.6681690216064453	Somebody else may infer that it probably is a migraine.
674506	682340	A	0.6347561478614807	But what you might will not hear in psychodynamic culture is that that was an accident, that it was due to chance.
682710	689970	A	0.9053342342376709	I think that chance accidents, randomness stochasticity chaos are not used, they're bad form in psychoanalysis.
690550	694114	A	0.815159797668457	And that is the illustration of, I think, for its assumption.
694162	695538	A	0.7422017455101013	Ultimately it's an axiom.
695554	697590	A	0.7468854188919067	It's a belief that is not questioned.
697930	708182	A	0.8746083378791809	If we were to translate that assumption in the pristine language, this is the long givan equation from which pristine starts, which has notations by Daniel.
708246	709078	A	0.8880262970924377	Thank you, Daniel.
709174	715190	A	0.8717384934425354	And we have the change in the state of x equals the flow plus the omega.
715270	723866	A	0.8996829390525818	Omega is the Stochastic know, in Daniel's metaphor we have a wave and then we have ripple.
724058	729850	A	0.8823099136352539	So we would have to change the Stochastic component if we were to go with the Freud's axiom.
730010	737134	A	0.7098773717880249	And then if we do that, we would find ourselves squarely in the domain of cold physics, Newtonian physics, Laplace's demon.
737262	745798	A	0.8047724366188049	LaPlace famously said, give me a position and momentum of every particle and I'll tell you exactly where they have been before and exactly where they will be in the future.
745964	752070	A	0.6816391944885254	Now, Freud didn't make statements like that, but this is what would happen if you kill the Stochastic component.
753050	755766	A	0.7017856240272522	I want to be clear that it's not Freud's fault at all.
755868	758214	A	0.7105855941772461	Well, first of all, you need axioms to build a theory.
758262	759366	A	0.7196636199951172	He chose that axiom.
759398	760780	A	0.6609059572219849	That's the theory he built.
761150	763850	A	0.695301353931427	Second of all, it wasn't exactly mathematics.
764350	768282	A	0.7431082129478455	And finally, the zeitgeist of the time was deterministic.
768426	774794	A	0.9000694751739502	Perhaps there were initial derivations of Stochastic mechanics and quantum mechanics.
774842	780270	A	0.7984400391578674	But Freud, when he was learning the world of deterministic physics, was dominant.
781270	798710	A	0.8163013458251953	And there's an important nuance in this discussion pointed out to me by the first peer reviewer of the paper who said, listen, if you have something that changes like a Stochastic thing and then you apply statistics to it, such as variance, then the variance of a changing variable will be deterministic.
799210	804338	A	0.8776800632476807	And then if we look at things like words which are used a lot in talk therapy like apple.
804514	806226	A	0.751325249671936	An apple is a semantic memory.
806258	807090	A	0.6643351912498474	It's a category.
807170	811974	A	0.8614116311073303	It's a coarse grading already from green apples and red apples and all other kinds of apples.
812102	815420	A	0.7099756002426147	So in that regard, words are deterministic things.
815790	838340	A	0.6931343674659729	So perhaps when we have a dream analysis session and the patient shares with an analyst the movie that they saw the messy irrational thing with images and tunes and anything and maybe words, even if they narrate it, then they slow things down, they average things out and they put it in deterministic tools, which is words.
838710	842334	A	0.8198949694633484	So with some objects we can apply deterministic tools.
842382	851650	A	0.7856916189193726	But I want to point out that the foundation that everything and anything in the psychic life that all the munications have no stochasticity randomness is a very strong assumption.
851730	858086	A	0.8554481863975525	And I'm curious what would happen if we were to allow ourselves to see things on the sphere, on the parabola shape.
858198	865610	A	0.6117240786552429	It's not a bad exercise because the general theory of relativity would not have existed without these other geometries.
866350	871962	A	0.845734179019928	In terms of definitions, this is a familiar formula that you mark use of Shannon's entropy.
872026	876394	A	0.8840392827987671	He originally wrote about telegraph and sender and receiver in a fixed alphabet.
876522	885602	A	0.7802860736846924	But here if we draw an attracting set which happens to be Lorenz attractor in phase space and we look at these I don't know if you can see them, they're small.
885656	892598	A	0.8437948822975159	The white know that's the initial condition and then they spread out and evolve as time goes by.
892764	895622	A	0.8328148126602173	But you can see the density of the attracting set.
895676	898242	A	0.7387477159500122	It is higher density and lower density.
898306	902150	A	0.8770691156387329	So we could calculate probability distribution.
903290	913514	A	0.8517561554908752	A slightly different question is this what would happen if you were to change the initial condition a little bit 1 mm in phase space, different things can happen.
913552	917390	A	0.8570601344108582	And one of them is shown in this diagram that would be divergence.
917890	922286	A	0.892728865146637	And the formula here is initial condition multiplied by exponent of lambda T.
922388	928598	A	0.6974782943725586	So when lambda is positive, you have divergence and it's called lapin of exponent.
928634	931010	A	0.6797723770141602	And that's one of the criteria for chaos.
931350	937730	A	0.8107470273971558	When it is negative, we have convergence and when it is zero we have equidistant trajectories, we have Newtonian mechanics.
939510	944070	A	0.507718563079834	This is an illustration of a chaotic system which is a great red spot on Jupiter.
944490	951634	A	0.5922235250473022	And it fits perfectly the Friston's paper about the mark of blankets and stochastic chaos because that thing is stable.
951682	959930	A	0.8016859292984009	We have been observing it for 300 years and one could say that this elliptical shape is the mark of blanket around the chaos that maintains its integrity.
960270	968330	A	0.766425371170044	It's not a contradiction because in one spatial scale you have mark of blanket and on another spatial scale you have a chaos within the marker blanket.
968830	972334	A	0.5422491431236267	This is a convergent system that is a bit trivial to all of you.
972372	980974	A	0.5927307605743408	This is a hole in the ground and then surrounded by hills on all sides and if you were to put a ball on the hill, it's going to roll down in the potential.
981022	987758	A	0.8851853609085083	Well, and typically in phase space, we'll call the bottom of the hole an attractor and we call the hills repeller.
987854	998242	A	0.6360012888908386	Repeller is a term less frequently used, but it's the highly unstable point in phase space from which things move away from and they move toward the attractor.
998386	1000002	A	0.5523883104324341	Now, that's just one attractor.
1000066	1001494	A	0.9099917411804199	The interesting things start happening.
1001532	1009210	A	0.5514357089996338	If you've got two of them, imagine a second hole immediately to the right and the boundary between them may very quickly become chaotic.
1010270	1016394	A	0.7584546804428101	Here's another illustration on a convergent system from the active inference textbook that I hadn't read when I was working on the paper.
1016432	1017740	A	0.7758999466896057	I discovered it later.
1018910	1022310	A	0.8378622531890869	The chart on the left is the density.
1022390	1026906	A	0.7536590695381165	And again we see high density in the center and we hate lower density in the periphery.
1027018	1029370	A	0.6446065306663513	And the chart on the right is surprise.
1029450	1034370	A	0.5849194526672363	We're very not surprised to find a ball in the center, and we're very much surprised if it stays on the hill.
1034710	1037070	A	0.8136303424835205	And I'll read you a citation.
1037230	1047080	A	0.864253044128418	Active inference is restricted to systems like that one on the left, which counter random fluctuations with their average flow and thereby retain their form over time.
1047690	1058410	A	0.5765257477760315	It may sound like the statement contradicts what I said earlier, that FAP is compatible with chaos, but it doesn't because you could have different spatial scales and convergence on one scale and divergence on another.
1058560	1063660	A	0.8908147215843201	I also historically think that we have been studying converging systems mostly so far.
1064830	1080670	A	0.7486147284507751	Now, if we move from things like that, which is very simple, to a mind or consciousness, then I think that what we could be looking at is this that's a landscape with attractors and repellers that is very complex.
1080830	1087390	A	0.8073278665542603	And I'm going to quote the former president of the Chaos Society for Psychology is that that landscape is dynamic.
1087470	1088450	A	0.7222501635551453	It moves.
1089430	1091838	A	0.5545560121536255	Perhaps some things on it are stable.
1091934	1103858	A	0.6788477897644043	If we were imagine a clinical scenario where there's a patient who is very prone to shame and very averse to express anger, then we could say that shame is an attractor and anger is a repeller.
1104034	1112950	A	0.6283997893333435	But we work with pattern things in dynamic therapy so they could be relatively stable until the work in therapy makes them more shallow distributions.
1113030	1114790	A	0.7177627682685852	But certain things change overnight.
1114870	1117514	A	0.869641125202179	Some things change in a week or during the course of therapy.
1117562	1122960	A	0.5881801843643188	So I mean, strictly speaking, that's a dynamic landscape, and I don't think we model things this way.
1124130	1131646	A	0.8182349801063538	I'd like to also quote Maxwell Rammstead from the same paper that free energy principle is a tale of two densities.
1131838	1135410	A	0.5525791049003601	It would be incomplete to say that we just minimize one variable.
1136790	1147926	A	0.49926555156707764	What happens is we minimize the Shannon's entropy of probability distribution over sensory states, while at the same time we maximize entropy of internal beliefs, which is very important.
1148028	1149330	A	0.6697793006896973	That's adaptation.
1149490	1158490	A	0.7319356203079224	If somebody has rigid internal beliefs with sharp probabilities and then COVID happens, they will have lower probability of survival.
1159390	1160502	A	0.848301351070404	They're not adaptable.
1160566	1172720	A	0.7966412901878357	So adaptability means maximization of entropy of internal beliefs while maintaining the forum means the minimization of Shannon's entropy of probability distribution over sensory states.
1173810	1180290	A	0.704696536064148	Here's another term, Kolmogorov Sinai entropy that is not intuitive and it's from topology.
1180790	1187650	A	0.9423568248748779	The picture you see is the photograph of the statue called Intuition outside the Fields Institute of Mathematics in Toronto.
1187990	1189742	A	0.7595367431640625	Here's a graphical illustration.
1189886	1202630	A	0.9080802202224731	If you were to draw the trajectories in phase space and surround it by a certain volume, say a circle with the radius epsilon, and ask yourself what happens to this volume as they evolve?
1203310	1207702	A	0.7675896286964417	Well, when it expands, then you can have chaoticity.
1207846	1212262	A	0.5500134229660034	When it becomes more compact, you can have convergence.
1212406	1222074	A	0.8835101127624512	When it stays the same, you have periodic system, which is indicated on the chart on the right, where you have a correlate of the colmorphs in entropy on the y axis.
1222122	1224922	A	0.8549209833145142	And you have this epsilon on the x axis.
1225066	1229678	A	0.8154574036598206	So the flat line at the bottom where the circle doesn't change is the periodic system.
1229764	1232100	A	0.6701899766921997	Omogorovsina entropy stays zero.
1232470	1237022	A	0.8130539655685425	The curved line in the center that converges on a K is the proper chaos.
1237086	1239198	A	0.7213473916053772	This is theoretical chaos.
1239294	1243854	A	0.5192148089408875	And the upshoot from it is what Friston calls stochastic chaos.
1243902	1245374	A	0.867235541343689	This is chaos plus noise.
1245502	1248850	A	0.7911999225616455	And then you can have pure noise and then you can have pure linearity.
1248930	1251522	A	0.7860700488090515	So all of these things exist, they're all on the table.
1251586	1256278	A	0.8578960299491882	You can have geometry on the plane, geometry on the sphere, geometry in the parabolic shape.
1256374	1258060	A	0.8161733150482178	So what does the data show?
1258430	1269650	A	0.8151434659957886	And when we look at EEG entropy, people use approximate entropy, permutation entropy and spectrum entropy, which are all derivations of colmorefsini.
1269830	1273662	A	0.895179033279419	And the first two are in different phase space from the last one, I believe.
1273716	1275374	A	0.7104150652885437	Mark, correct me if I'm wrong.
1275492	1282062	A	0.7942928671836853	You cite Go serious study in your book Hidden Spring when you talk about entropy and phases of sleep.
1282206	1290306	A	0.8335707783699036	And they use spectrum entropy, which is a derivation of colmorov Sinai in the frequency domain analysis phase space.
1290488	1309814	A	0.6389600038528442	So the data shows that systems as small as the axon of a squid isolated in the lab to single neurons to coupled neurons to EEG, we have evidence of positive lap enough exponents in some regimes of operation with EEG.
1309862	1311082	A	0.8335713148117065	We can be more specific.
1311216	1319002	A	0.6785614490509033	That algorithm seems to be weakly nonlinear, while things below alpha like delta seem to be more periodic with noise.
1319066	1323390	A	0.5978455543518066	And things above alpha such as gamma and high gamma seem to be chaotic.
1323730	1342558	A	0.6670103073120117	So if we were to summarize this data, then we can say that comogorous entropy appears to increase as generalized arousal increases from delta to gamma rhythm, comogorous and entropy seems to be higher in healthy, alert, brain mind functioning than in the states of coma, seizure, deep sleep.
1342654	1345762	A	0.7847841382026672	And it can stay close to zero in a coma or deep sleep.
1345906	1362758	A	0.604771077632904	The interesting anecdote here is that a simple act of closing your eyes when you're alert decreases Comography entropy clinical applications are vast and developing fast, for example, except for clinical psychology, I must say, in psychiatry and psychotherapy.
1362854	1371370	A	0.8101416230201721	But in neurology, the seizure detection on the EEG right now can be done with AI with about the same accuracy as a human neurologist.
1371450	1374938	A	0.8001837730407715	And that algorithm does use chaoticity assessment.
1375034	1380770	A	0.49936214089393616	There's models for Parkinson's, neuropathic, pain, and I have other examples that I'll skip for right now.
1380920	1383890	A	0.8491600751876831	This is a graphical illustration of phases of sleep.
1384310	1389294	A	0.6315969228744507	And again, it has colmob Sinai entropy as a phase of sleep.
1389422	1393794	A	0.8415873646736145	It shows wakefulness and then shallow sleep, progressively deeper sleep and REM.
1393912	1395458	A	0.7827948927879333	And that's the time evolution.
1395554	1405050	A	0.7926163673400879	If you move REM in frequency to where it belongs to wakefulness, then you'll see the same progression that comographs and entropy appears to increase as a function of generalized arousal.
1405390	1409178	A	0.6145298480987549	This is seizure onset at about second four.
1409344	1411510	A	0.7584512829780579	Seizure is a reduction in chaoticity.
1411590	1414730	A	0.6118282079696655	Healthy functioning is higher chaoticity than a seizure.
1415230	1419338	A	0.8593555688858032	This is a coma, which is relatively invariant theta and delta frequency.
1419434	1421946	A	0.7861617803573608	This is a nearly periodic system with some noise.
1422058	1424046	A	0.5873661041259766	And death is a linear system.
1424148	1425360	A	0.6107654571533203	It doesn't change.
1425730	1439198	A	0.8153674602508545	This is persistent vegetative state, minimally conscious state, where researchers were asking a question on prognosis of survival and they've concluded that diversity and variability of the EHE was the predictor of survival.
1439294	1441220	A	0.6294296383857727	Higher entropy means life.
1442730	1459066	A	0.8233145475387573	So the hypothesis is that chaotic stochastic and linear processes as well as hybrid ones, such as primarily chaotic functioning with noise can be present concurrently at different scales of the brain mind or at the same scale, but in different places or at different times.
1459248	1463660	A	0.7779081463813782	I realize it's a mouthful, but it fits the data presented in the paper.
1464670	1472058	A	0.8394289016723633	This is again a picture from the textbook enough to inference by Thomas Parr, Karl Friston, and Giovanni Pizzoulo.
1472154	1473818	A	0.787251889705658	It's a cortical column.
1473994	1488606	A	0.5659164786338806	And the errors you see here, ascending and descending connections, if by chance you're not familiar with the framework they correspond to, the ascending errors are prediction errors and descending ones are predictions.
1488718	1493026	A	0.6512846946716309	This is what they say in the book, that there's an asymmetry in message passing.
1493138	1499874	A	0.6063739657402039	And the reason for that is that the operations required to compute prediction error from expectation are nonlinear.
1500002	1507210	A	0.722527801990509	This nonlinearity is due to computation of predictions using nonlinear functions that tend to increase the frequency of the signal.
1508590	1510870	A	0.8188426494598389	I'd like to talk a little bit about reduction.
1510950	1515446	A	0.455489844083786	It became very fashionable and sometimes silly to use this like, oh, you're reductionist.
1515478	1516454	A	0.7616840600967407	No, you're reductionist.
1516502	1519254	A	0.4864886701107025	And the second most popular term is oversimplify.
1519302	1520102	A	0.796057939529419	You oversimplify.
1520166	1521142	A	0.7858898639678955	Now you oversimplify.
1521206	1523518	A	0.5671048164367676	And to me, they're not bad words.
1523684	1526910	A	0.6472027897834778	They're necessary tools to simplify and to reduce.
1528050	1531214	A	0.7912957072257996	The map that equals the territory exactly is useless.
1531262	1532402	A	0.6701057553291321	Nobody's going to use it.
1532456	1540530	A	0.8398140072822571	It must kind of I'm quoting James Quick simplify and, you know, I'll illustrate the specific term.
1540950	1549174	A	0.8349417448043823	If the car is moving with a fixed velocity on a straight line and if I know exactly where it is right now, I can tell with certainty where it has been an hour before.
1549292	1550966	A	0.7706828713417053	That is a reduction in time.
1551068	1553858	A	0.5061424970626831	And I can do that because the formula is linear.
1553954	1559130	A	0.8549516797065735	It's distance equals velocity multiplied by time and velocity is constant.
1559550	1569758	A	0.6969800591468811	If the watch is broken and I disassemble it and I find a faulty part and then I put it back together and it works, then it's a reduction in space.
1569844	1575070	A	0.7084394097328186	And I can do that because watch is not an end colony to use Daniel's terms.
1575220	1579098	A	0.7208547592163086	Watch is equal to the collection of its parts.
1579274	1586660	A	0.8215981125831604	So I wanted to talk about, Mark, your mention of the predictive hierarchy composed of billions of homeostats in your work.
1587270	1589054	A	0.743889331817627	This is approximate picture.

1591816	1593778	A	0.7843572497367859	And this is from your hidden spring.
1593954	1600360	A	0.5690492987632751	It's a predictive hierarchy where predictions flow from left to right and prediction errors from right to left.
1601530	1611386	A	0.7435611486434937	And one of the statements in the book in the Hidden Spring you say that brain's many complex functions really can ultimately be reduced to a few simple mechanisms like this.
1611488	1615530	A	0.7199074029922485	So it appears that you call it reduction.
1616030	1618534	A	0.6341134309768677	But it is a powerful model.
1618592	1619822	A	0.6876748204231262	It is a flexible model.
1619876	1622142	A	0.8569530248641968	I wanted to describe some features of it.

1634088	1636238	A	0.7379123568534851	Quantum mechanics is the microphysics.
1636334	1638786	A	0.7224503755569458	Statistical mechanics is molecular level.

1647570	1654310	A	0.6052351593971252	In fact, when people say take entanglement and they apply to human beings, that's sort of a misunderstanding of entanglement.
1655290	1659302	A	0.8945808410644531	The second comment is from Mike Eleven who talks about these scales.
1659366	1670958	A	0.8628444075584412	And if his comment is that you could have different functional spaces at every scale where you could solve the genetic task on one scale, electrochemical on another, morphological on the third one.
1671044	1675520	A	0.791313886642456	And then how you do message passing, what is the common language is not a trivial question.
1676210	1683726	A	0.6033147573471069	Along the same lines, I've already mentioned that a message between the scales can be nonlinear if you do prediction errors.
1683838	1697174	A	0.5755274295806885	Now if you take one nonlinear message and then you multiply it by billions, you're going to have a full on turbulence, which is a chaotic system, it's a dynamical system and turbulence you cannot reduce to homeostat or anything else.
1697372	1701218	A	0.514978289604187	Saying that water consists of H 20 does not explain turbulence.
1701394	1703414	A	0.749725341796875	So I don't know, that's an open question.
1703452	1707660	A	0.8792831897735596	But I wanted to maybe share some perceptions of this model.
1708190	1714460	A	0.9242877960205078	This I talked about and this is the Friston's thought about phase transition and the attracting set.
1714830	1728590	A	0.8285974860191345	He said that if you have a hierarchy of Lorenzo tractors, a slower one and a faster one and a slower one governing the transitions of the faster Lorenzo tractor, then you could have a FEP formulation with an attracting set experiencing changes and transitions.
1729010	1730606	A	0.8822506666183472	And that's brilliant, I think.
1730628	1735294	A	0.8011539578437805	And it matches the anatomy because the brainstem and the subcortical structures appear to be slower.
1735342	1741726	A	0.9085453152656555	Lorenzo tractor that could be seen as governing the transitions of the cortex, which is astral Lorenzo tractor.
1741918	1746226	A	0.7277793288230896	I know I'm oversimplifying things a great deal, but it sort of misses his thoughts.
1746258	1748710	A	0.8658866882324219	I think him and Lancelor de Costa are working on that.
1748780	1751960	A	0.8574721217155457	Perhaps Maxwell Ramstead's group is working on that as well.
1752730	1763958	A	0.7270997762680054	The clinical applications, the landscape that I've mentioned before would be absolutely lovely to see if we were to consider going there borderline personality disorder or another term for that could be complex trauma.
1764054	1768098	A	0.5981001853942871	The metaphor that we use for these patients is they're predictably unpredictable.
1768214	1772302	A	0.7698693871498108	That the only thing we know on Wednesday that we don't know what's going to come up.
1772356	1779338	A	0.6400983333587646	Suggesting chaoticity acute trauma has a symptom of hyperarousal, suggesting possibly higher level of chaoticity.
1779434	1788260	A	0.557956874370575	An onset of mania can be seen as a transition into a higher energy state and addictions, particularly with stimulants, can be seen as phase transitions into a chaotic state.
1788630	1797762	A	0.6428654193878174	It may sound like what I said now is contradictory to what I said before when I suggested that lower chaoticity could be a problem, such as an onset of a seizure.
1797826	1803926	A	0.6111827492713928	And here I'm saying higher chaoticity can be a problem, but that would only be a contradiction in the linear world.
1804108	1812460	A	0.6263962984085083	In the real world, where linear is very small percentage of what's happening, I'm saying both that too little and too much chaos could be a problem.
1812830	1815740	A	0.5706318616867065	Just enough chaos imbalance could be perfectly fine.
1816190	1818810	A	0.6271347403526306	This is a graphical illustration of what can be done.
1818880	1827630	A	0.8752902150154114	This is from my colleague and friend David Pinkus, who is a professor in Sheppin University and I think also former president of the Society for Chaos and Psychology Society.
1827970	1828890	A	0.7994292974472046	These are trees.
1828970	1842260	A	0.6247150301933289	It may sound like completely unrelated to what we do, except if you look at a human lung or dendrites in a neuron and you can see a healthy tree on the right from me and a nearly dead tree on the left.
1842630	1859930	A	0.8891323208808899	And if you do the fractal assessment, fractal dimension assessment on them by counting the thickness of branches and count the number of branches at each level, then you can quantify and then you can have approximate quantification of health and resilience versus pathology.
1860270	1866846	A	0.5728134512901306	And again, as exotic as it may sound, this is very similar to what people do when they detect a seizure on the AG.

1875364	1876990	A	0.9891228079795837	Thank you so much for your attention.
1880260	1881212	B	0.9390280246734619	Thank you, Lexi.
1881276	1882956	B	0.9483615756034851	Great presentation.
1883148	1886508	B	0.9315162301063538	Well, looking forward to this discussion.
1886604	1890908	B	0.8171331286430359	First, Mark, please feel free to add your reflections.
1891084	1893970	B	0.8284654021263123	Then Andrea, then we'll continue on.
1895540	1896930	C	0.9063448905944824	Thanks very much.
1898900	1907096	C	0.6366176605224609	When Alexi asked me if I would join this panel, the first thing that I said to him was yes, coupled with.
1907118	1912132	C	0.6424945592880249	The second thing being, but please be aware that I know next to nothing about chaos theory.
1912196	1923710	C	0.4959816336631775	So I'm not sure how much of a contribution I can make to a technical discussion of this kind.
1924960	1929788	C	0.6582914590835571	So I'm just repeating that before I say anything else.
1929874	1937084	C	0.8694311380386353	If I say anything that sounds amateur, that sounds as if this guy doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to chaos theory.
1937132	1942240	C	0.7107833027839661	It's because I'm an amateur and I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to chaos theory.
1943400	1952196	C	0.6302334666252136	That said, the second thing I want to say is I'm not entirely sure what is at stake here.
1952378	1970830	C	0.7358589172363281	It seems as if Alexei feels that it's really important that I and our colleagues get our head around chaos theory and bring some of what it has to offer into our field.
1971520	1974844	C	0.549740195274353	Because I don't know much about it.
1974882	1976684	C	0.531112015247345	I don't know what's at stake, you see.
1976722	1979484	C	0.5572993159294128	I don't know why that's important.
1979682	1989810	C	0.8059876561164856	So perhaps somewhere along the line in the next just less than an hour that we have, perhaps, Alexi, you can clarify that for us.
1991140	2010360	C	0.6465713977813721	The third thing I wanted to say is, and perhaps in order to illustrate the first thing is that as Alexei was talking now, it seemed as if he was talking about chaos, as if it were synonymous with stochasticity or randomness.
2011100	2014036	C	0.7968937158584595	And that's not my understanding.
2014228	2020424	C	0.5802508592605591	My very limited understanding of chaos theory was that it's not synonymous.
2020552	2029892	C	0.638822078704834	Chaos, as used in that science or in that theory, is not synonymous with randomness.
2029976	2032880	C	0.6511965394020081	It's rather synonymous with unpredictability.
2034260	2046980	C	0.5934484601020813	Because we don't know the initial conditions of the system, or we can't specify all the variables with sufficient precision in their initial conditions, it becomes impossible to predict.
2047960	2059444	C	0.5228409767150879	And because of the nature of the interrelationships of the variables, one tiny little error in your estimation of the initial conditions can lead to massive consequences.
2059572	2066760	C	0.7581667900085449	And this is why it's so hard to predict chaotic systems.
2067180	2080030	C	0.8362593650817871	So if that is what is meant, then I would say, Stuart, of course this applies to the way that the mind works and the way that the brain works.
2080720	2083072	C	0.8192427158355713	But that leads me back to my second point.
2083126	2104500	C	0.5451160669326782	I'm not sure what's at stake, but I would say, if that's what you're asking, if that's what you're claiming, rather, Alexey, then I would say that surely must be so, that it is exceedingly difficult to predict mental and neural events at any level of complexity.
2106540	2110424	C	0.743353009223938	Now, I think I've said three things.
2110622	2112650	C	0.8139355182647705	Let me now say a fourth thing.
2113660	2119150	C	0.8228489756584167	I think that a crucial well, let me put it this way.
2119680	2130496	C	0.655570924282074	Of course, what the brain and mind are trying to do, it's a matter of trying to predict what's going to happen.
2130598	2147110	C	0.6082344055175781	So what I've just said about how difficult it is to predict what's going to happen in the brain or mind it's almost the same thing as to say that the mind and brain are trying to model the world.
2148200	2182048	C	0.6290206909179688	That's the main thing that we are trying to do is have a good model of the world so that we can get some sort of grip on this chaos, so that we can act rationally in the sense that we can act in order to preserve ourselves that we do not dissipate by just exploring all possible states and no longer existing as a system.
2182134	2188924	C	0.8432058691978455	Because we, as systems, need to remain within certain bounds across a great many variables.
2188972	2202032	C	0.9329783320426941	As you said, we can't afford to just let shit happen and throw ourselves to its fates.
2202176	2206330	C	0.7124546766281128	We need to try to predict in a very unpredictable world.
2206940	2211912	C	0.6918283700942993	What must I do in order to meet this need, given how the world works?
2212046	2215848	C	0.6694240570068359	So the brain is trying to model the world.
2216014	2222972	C	0.8075796365737915	Our predictive model is trying to synchronize itself with the world.
2223026	2227020	C	0.6552658081054688	And for that reason it's going to be very chaotic.
2228240	2233360	C	0.8069471120834351	But the crucial point is it's trying to reduce the unpredictability.
2235140	2240768	C	0.8950409293174744	With that said, I'll make a fifth point, or maybe it's another part of my fourth point.
2240854	2253190	C	0.8409814834594727	No, I think it's a fifth point, which is that the way that I conceptualize the predictive model and it's not me alone who does this is that it is a hierarchical model.
2253880	2255816	C	0.8476797342300415	And I think that's very important.
2255918	2265320	C	0.8328413367271423	And perhaps here's where things do start, where it starts to at least in my mind, I start to see some of what's at stake.
2266300	2277480	C	0.7426380515098572	I think that the more peripheral layers of the predictive model I see the predictive model not as a triangle, but rather as an onion.
2277640	2282688	C	0.8314464688301086	So the core is the deepest layers of the model.
2282854	2296884	C	0.8131698369979858	That is to say, the layers that have the greatest spatial and temporal generalizability and they're the most stable layers of the model.
2297002	2328904	C	0.6413866877555847	And as we move toward the periphery, which coincides with the periphery of the nervous system, in other words, the encounter with the outside world, so it becomes more chaotic, we can tolerate more unpredictability at the periphery and that also allows for greater accuracy because the world is so unpredictable.
2328952	2338668	C	0.6804018616676331	We have a more chaotic outer layer of our predictive model where things also there's less that's at stake.
2338764	2340432	C	0.8760522603988647	Is that car going to turn left or right?
2340486	2342356	C	0.7260514497756958	Well, I thought it was going to turn left, turn right.
2342378	2342900	C	0.6822987794876099	So what?
2342970	2343908	C	0.6405050158500671	Doesn't matter.
2344074	2350950	C	0.7552844285964966	But is the car going to obey the laws of gravity that matters more?
2352760	2357976	C	0.5645426511764526	That's a much more consequential surprise if it does not.
2358158	2373752	C	0.6834688186645508	And perhaps that's a silly analogy, but at least it illustrates the general point, our most heartfelt beliefs, and that is to say, the deepest layers of our predictive hierarchy.
2373896	2393876	C	0.6388790011405945	There we find the same patterns over and again and we are more certain of our predictions and we act more stereotypically in accordance with them, whereas at the periphery that does not apply.
2394058	2402324	C	0.6186885237693787	So I think at one point in your presentation, Alexi, you were saying something like one size doesn't fit all.
2402362	2404192	C	0.770844578742981	It's not all, just one mechanism.
2404256	2405320	C	0.5483351945877075	All the way down.
2405470	2407850	C	0.800333559513092	Of course, I completely agree with that.
2409260	2411252	C	0.7815963625907898	It's not just one mechanism.
2411396	2420060	C	0.6771101355552673	The different homeostats that you were referring to on there different scales are also serving different needs and there's not a common currency.
2420480	2425452	C	0.7726812958717346	I think that's a very important part of how consciousness works.
2425506	2430232	C	0.5361422896385193	Why we have qualia at all is because we can't reduce things to a common currency.
2430296	2436192	C	0.8426557779312134	We're dealing with categorical variables, at the very least, in relation to our bodily needs.
2436246	2440544	C	0.7825412154197693	They are categorically distinct needs and they need to be treated as such.
2440582	2446804	C	0.8538438081741333	And this is why we have different feelings in relation to these different categories of free energy.
2447002	2454348	C	0.6362641453742981	So those are some of the main things I wanted to say just to get the ball rolling.
2454464	2460664	C	0.49546173214912415	I'm mindful of the fact that Andrea Clarici only has 15 more minutes with us.
2460782	2465624	C	0.6469592452049255	So maybe I can pick up on some other points later.
2465822	2469720	C	0.8817670345306396	But at this stage, let me hand over to Andrea.
2469880	2470830	C	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
2483390	2484860	D	0.7909836769104004	Can you hear me now?
2485310	2486554	D	0.5205464959144592	Yes, sorry.
2486672	2493210	D	0.9049996137619019	I will try also to articulate something of the very fascinating paper of Alexia.
2493370	2498714	D	0.8111186623573303	I must confess, since I'm also a psychoanalytic psychotherapist, a psychiatrist.
2498842	2500030	D	0.543210506439209	It's not my field.
2500100	2504900	D	0.5765348672866821	I'm not a physicist, so I can really say few words.
2505910	2515730	D	0.492133229970932	Some is of, as I said already, fascination, because in general, I hate to stick to rigid theories.
2516070	2532940	D	0.8553494811058044	So if there is a paper like Alexia who can chaoticize my theories, even in psychoanalysis, in the workings of the mind and the brain, I'm happy to dive into it.
2533550	2546880	D	0.7173711061477661	At the same time, I don't have the skills to discuss the math part of his papers or even the physical formulas and so on.
2547570	2559470	D	0.5818400382995605	But I was reminded of a very early and I think you all know that book Jacques Monot Chance and Necessity, which is a classic.
2559630	2565706	D	0.7117737531661987	And I think it's a book in which you can from scratch.
2565758	2569206	D	0.8017675280570984	I mean, here that our aim in the world.
2569308	2581862	D	0.7898284196853638	And I know I'm sounding theological, but we have theological aims.
2582006	2586550	D	0.7252118587493896	In order to stay alive, we have to face chance and chaos.
2586710	2604042	D	0.8459744453430176	So I think this is in order to survive and reproduce, we have to have a mathematical system to reduce chaos and to bring up again determinism or psychic determinism.
2604186	2617190	D	0.8882841467857361	Since one of the points that Lexie, I think, raised is can we still hold the point of Freud's about psychic determinism?
2617770	2624630	D	0.6604198217391968	And I think if you apply not to the physics of just materialism.
2626330	2626694	A	0.5345407128334045	Of.
2626732	2631578	D	0.8178795576095581	Things, actually, but to the living organism, I think we do.
2631744	2638394	D	0.7506554126739502	This is my point, and I would like to hear what Alexia says.
2638512	2641950	D	0.590537428855896	In the end, the chaos theory.
2642690	2656610	D	0.8092551827430725	Mathematics, as far as I understand it, must be a mathematics who reduce chance or chaos to a linearity, at least in the living organism.
2657430	2665780	D	0.6847039461135864	And I wonder if and what Alexia thinks about it, because he seems to disagree with that.
2669530	2677830	B	0.8136042952537537	Want to give a direct response, lexi or then Brynn and Albert be awesome to hear your takes as well, some of the thoughts from Mark and from Andrea.
2678570	2682970	A	0.9169033765792847	Should I start by responding to Andrea's points or marks?
2686430	2692502	A	0.7552761435508728	Maybe I'll start by because I think the key point that Mark you brought up is what's at stake is still unclear.
2692646	2697470	A	0.7995123267173767	My impression is, and please correct me if I'm wrong I was very influenced, Mark, by your paper.
2697540	2713006	A	0.48954012989997864	I forgot exactly, the journal where you talked about psychiatry world, how these sort of convention based diagnosis of here is a major depressive disorder, here's a bipolar disorder, nothing of which has to do with etiology convention and statistics.
2713198	2725362	A	0.7742646932601929	And then you brought up this revolutionary thing with effective neuroscience where you talked about the manic state and the depression state and tied into the punk subsystem, I think is extraordinary.
2725506	2735898	A	0.7992106080055237	But what I wanted to say is if we look at how we diagnose and think about what's happening, and we look at the language of how we do it, it is still a deterministic language at the end of the day.
2736064	2741862	A	0.711665153503418	So when we moved from DSM Four to DSM Five, we brilliantly discovered that continuous variables exist.
2741926	2743218	A	0.7368466854095459	We used to have buckets.
2743334	2744890	A	0.7539255619049072	Everything was in a separate bucket.
2744970	2751194	A	0.5514694452285767	And then we said autism is a spectrum, and everybody applauded, but mathematicians were quietly laughing in the corner.
2751322	2755738	A	0.639127254486084	Because, of course, continuous variables exist, but we don't do dynamics.
2755834	2757326	A	0.5292850136756897	We're still very static.
2757438	2758978	A	0.6789683699607849	Here's this clear cut thing.
2759064	2761634	A	0.7485957145690918	And this is the clear cut continuous thing, right?
2761752	2768574	A	0.607510507106781	And my impression I may be wrong, is that even in our neuropsychoanalytic developments, we still do things deterministically.
2768702	2773186	A	0.9084412455558777	We assess which bucket things belong to, or maybe two buckets at the same time, or three buckets.
2773298	2779802	A	0.6005011200904846	But we don't do things like how the chaotic systems are qualitatively different from static things.
2779856	2781574	A	0.850380539894104	I'm quoting William Solis.
2781702	2785930	A	0.7793652415275574	They have transients, they have contextuality, and they have emergence.
2786510	2788650	A	0.6365085244178772	We don't do know.
2788800	2800682	A	0.7386181950569153	And I think that if we embrace the chaos theory, if we do things like correlational dimension assessment or fractal dimension assessment, starting from the system of classification of emotions, they're still buckets.
2800746	2802710	A	0.6596459746360779	Here is a clear cut thing called fear.
2802810	2804590	A	0.6755319237709045	That's a clear cut thing called rage.
2804670	2806914	A	0.8096734285354614	Buckets determinism, okay?
2807112	2810610	A	0.7970863580703735	And they look differently in the dynamical systems world.
2810760	2818834	A	0.5897500514984131	And then the system of psychopathology could look like correlational dimension changed and not that somebody fell into a bucket.
2818962	2833814	A	0.6226293444633484	If we look at this complex landscape of attractors and repellers and examine psychodynamic things like please forgive me if I'm incorrect, but one of the possible definitions of repression could be seen as not letting things into consciousness.
2833942	2835446	A	0.6132789254188538	Maybe we can call it suppression.
2835478	2838554	A	0.5192229151725769	But what I'm trying to say is I don't want to think that right now.
2838592	2839142	A	0.7924594283103943	It hurts.
2839206	2844074	A	0.9116631150245667	It's a painful thing that in the terminology that I shared, is a repeller.
2844202	2855680	A	0.7944544553756714	And perhaps when you work through things in a psychodynamic, psychotherapy, perhaps you put a scar tissue on the wound, it becomes less of a sharp repeller, and it smooths out.
2857650	2859186	A	0.7299566864967346	We don't diagnose like that.
2859208	2860066	A	0.7258040308952332	We don't treat like that.
2860088	2861460	A	0.5266107320785522	We don't think like that.
2861990	2869362	A	0.7940245866775513	One paper that I'm working on that is in peer review right now and I can't share too much, says that we think like storytellers.
2869426	2871170	A	0.8284344673156738	I'm quoting Daniel Kahneman.
2871330	2875186	A	0.6423132419586182	Our thinking mind of a clinician is not a statistician.
2875378	2880258	A	0.7924477458000183	We don't think in probabilities, we think in labels and we think in stories.
2880434	2885018	A	0.6428643465042114	And I know you had this powerful quote, Mark, from Freud who said that that's the nature of the mind.
2885104	2888826	A	0.7105502486228943	And I most respectfully disagree that that's the entire nature of the mind.
2888928	2893374	A	0.647258460521698	I do think that we have things on the mind that are not stories and not words.
2893492	2905700	A	0.8746235370635986	So if the nature of the phenomenon is chaotic and stochastic and periodic, then we can use appropriate mechanisms to diagnose and classify that fits the nature of the model.
2906550	2911266	A	0.5088021159172058	The second thing you said chaos and stochasticity, I absolutely agree with you that they're different.
2911448	2919474	A	0.8197503685951233	On the chart that I've shown, if you converge to a stable, chaos is deterministic, forward deterministic.
2919522	2922962	A	0.7793774604797363	So if initial conditions are changing, they will diverge.
2923026	2925622	A	0.7760381698608398	But you can predict things forward, not back.
2925756	2929826	A	0.6228795051574707	But there is no formula in a stochastic thing, you throw the coin.
2929858	2930374	A	0.5294103026390076	You don't know.
2930412	2934374	A	0.5087567567825317	You have no predictability whatsoever, short term or third or long term.
2934422	2935434	A	0.6832392811775208	So they are different.
2935552	2948958	A	0.7656990885734558	And in the sense that you're talking to sensitivity, to initial conditions, this is music to my heart to hear you to say that you acknowledge that curioticity clearly is present in the brain, on which level of the hierarchy in your model is a very important thing.
2949044	2955598	A	0.8396702408790588	But again, when we draw this picture, whether it's a triangle or an onion with a core and layers, it's a static model.
2955764	2963042	A	0.8541674613952637	And when you acknowledge that there's higher unpredictability toward the periphery, it could be, but there could be dynamics about the structure of the model.
2963176	2965470	A	0.805922269821167	And perhaps what you're saying is survival.
2965630	2970342	A	0.714682936668396	Like I must breathe and I must breathe air and I'm not in the water.
2970396	2972354	A	0.5421878099441528	And that is a very stable prediction.
2972482	2973110	A	0.4650449752807617	Absolutely.
2973260	2984246	A	0.5767122507095337	But when we deal with psychopathology and we deal with things like shame and pride and awe and other things, then I wonder if we should continue to use this metaphor of a homeostat.
2984278	2989370	A	0.7092404961585999	I really don't see how homeostat applies to gamma written in the brain or to shame.
2990510	2997002	A	0.7898705005645752	And homeostat is the convergent systems so that you minimize entropy by keeping things in the range.
2997066	3008050	A	0.5410029888153076	However, if you dive inside the homeostat, if you look at the temperature variation inside a narrow range, you may see chaos, which is exactly the picture that I saw, that I showed.
3011030	3019862	A	0.7595967054367065	And to Andrea's point about the Freud's principle of psychic determinism yes, I honestly think that we haven't said goodbye to that.
3019996	3024646	A	0.6261719465255737	We haven't tried to say that chance exists in the mental life.
3024828	3026230	A	0.603441596031189	Accidents exist.
3026730	3028086	A	0.49269846081733704	We don't do that.
3028268	3034214	A	0.8381737470626831	There's a firm tradition in psychoanalytic, psychotherapy, to say there's no accidents it's all determined.
3034342	3036918	A	0.7373107075691223	That's a major key point of the discussion.
3037094	3039260	A	0.5133379697799683	I don't know if I said too much.
3041870	3048480	B	0.8988321423530579	Maybe, andrea, if you want to give any thoughts or how do you want things to continue in the coming minutes and years?
3048850	3049950	D	0.7883908748626709	Okay, thank you.
3050020	3051146	D	0.8880262970924377	Thank you, Daniel.
3051338	3062210	D	0.8171449899673462	Just adding a word that I didn't use because I think it's very important about trying to defend the point about psychic determinism, which I'm very fond of.
3062280	3064558	D	0.7657264471054077	I mean, the word is adaptation.
3064734	3076790	D	0.8896743655204773	I have difficulties because when you see a psychotic patient, when you see a borderline patient, well, I don't see chaos or total unpredictability.
3077130	3082230	D	0.6567291021347046	I see adaptation, their disruptions.
3084090	3101578	D	0.8634299635887146	I try to understand what are the even the part behind that, in my opinion, has to have a tendency toward an order, which is adaptive.
3101754	3124310	D	0.8160988092422485	In this way, I see the mathematical part of chaos may be of use, but bringing to an explanation maybe not to an order or to a determinism, but to a point in which there must be this adaptive reason even in the chaos.
3124810	3126280	D	0.7874081134796143	Do you see my point?
3127930	3128710	A	0.6151441931724548	I do.
3128780	3131914	A	0.7025251984596252	But I think there's a deeper issue about how we know.
3131952	3134662	A	0.8711218237876892	Say there's a clinician psychoanalytic psychotherapist.
3134806	3136374	A	0.5925530195236206	We have a working memory.
3136502	3143514	A	0.8706884980201721	And the Miller's law that, Mark, you quote a lot about the seven units of information in the audio verbal work in memory.
3143562	3146506	A	0.8519996404647827	I think in the Miller's paper, he actually said seven chunks.
3146698	3150302	A	0.903664767742157	So I'm sharing something from the paper in Review right now.
3150436	3154186	A	0.7194418907165527	We cannot think probabilistically because it overloads the work in memory.
3154298	3163074	A	0.8134459853172302	This is why when I'm a clinician, I think about psychosis, I come up with a story, a formulation that fits in the work in memory, and this influences our work.
3163192	3168866	A	0.5246315598487854	We don't have the mathematics in here to think in the terms of probabilistic things and chaos theory and other things.
3168968	3170390	A	0.792079746723175	We need tools to do that.
3170460	3172610	A	0.7167153358459473	And in mainstream neurology, they use tools.
3172690	3174882	A	0.8701596856117249	They do talk to the patient that examine the patient.
3174946	3178806	A	0.8053197264671326	But they have MRI, they have EHE, they have Pescan and all the other things.
3178908	3181958	A	0.7567275762557983	In psychoanalytic psychotherapy, we say, we don't need any tools.
3182054	3185514	A	0.5500937104225159	We just talk to a person, and that is sufficient for everything we do.
3185632	3187162	A	0.6022056341171265	But that's not necessarily true.
3187216	3194186	A	0.5265607237815857	Beatrice Bibi, who is a psychoanalyst, works with mother infant diet, and there's zero words exchanged zilch.
3194298	3200750	A	0.8000486493110657	But she looks at this movie that she records on a video camera, and then she shows it in a slow motion.
3201170	3205578	A	0.8267536759376526	So she takes a flow, which is dynamic flow, not words, not discrete things.
3205684	3210900	A	0.5634652376174927	And then she slows it down and she shows the level of attunement between the mother and the child.
3211510	3213426	A	0.5979087352752686	We don't do things like that.
3213608	3222390	A	0.6353253126144409	We talk and we use these deterministic things to understand the psychopathology of the patient, saying that's psychosis and that's schizophrenia, and that is bipolar one.
3222460	3224422	A	0.6742330193519592	This is panic system and this is seeking system.
3224476	3225974	A	0.7422917485237122	We determine everything.
3226172	3230418	A	0.5805193781852722	And that is a limitation because inside, I believe what is a fear cascade?
3230434	3231234	A	0.5457096099853516	How does fear stop?
3231292	3232102	A	0.6922466158866882	It's a flow.
3232166	3233594	A	0.5772491097450256	It's a turbulent thing.
3233712	3236310	A	0.5458820462226868	And we put one label on it, say fear.
3236470	3237914	A	0.7734371423721313	We've classified it.
3238032	3245182	A	0.7334600687026978	So for some things it's appropriate, but for some things, it may not be, as Einstein said, as Mark.
3245236	3248718	A	0.5949939489364624	You quoted Einstein as simple as possible, but more simpler than that.
3248884	3255460	A	0.6132085919380188	So at which point we are missing or missing the phenomenon by using deterministic tools in our work.
3256470	3257534	B	0.9094076156616211	Thank you, Alex.
3257662	3258162	D	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3258216	3259730	D	0.9214830994606018	Thank you, Daniel and Mark.
3259800	3260562	D	0.6679161190986633	To everyone.
3260696	3261186	D	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3261208	3262274	D	0.562035858631134	I have to go.
3262472	3263220	B	0.918424665927887	Awesome.
3263670	3269670	B	0.9188683032989502	So Albert and then Brynn and we'll continue on this topic.
3271690	3275640	E	0.9879583120346069	Yeah, thank you for the presentation and a very interesting discussion so far.
3276410	3278700	E	0.7815461754798889	One thing that comes to mind is.
3279150	3279900	A	0.5665541291236877	The.
3283470	3292430	E	0.7852219939231873	Well, the thing we're talking about right now, the psychic determinism as depicted as being a foundational law in psychoanalysis.
3294050	3301534	E	0.8192082643508911	Well, I'm thinking about the authors, the psychoanalytic authors who came the prominent ones who came after Freud, who seem to.
3301572	3302160	C	0.6063991189002991	Have.
3305730	3308926	E	0.5569886565208435	Room for this chaos.
3309038	3328310	E	0.7133121490478516	Maybe they didn't use this term explicitly, but I'm thinking, for example, Wilfred Bjong, who's got the notion of the O layer, which has connotations of well, the thing that cannot be known or categorized, who has, like, indeterminate elements of the mind.
3328460	3332238	E	0.5103945136070251	And that's one of his major contributions to psychoanalysis.
3332354	3334166	E	0.6901260614395142	On the other hand, more the French schools.
3334198	3346410	E	0.7546275854110718	I'm thinking of Jacques Lacan, who's got the notion of the real, which is also one of his major contributions to psychoanalysis, where notions of rupture, of absence, or of lack are very prominent.
3346850	3357570	E	0.7003394365310669	I'm not sure I'm not an expert here, but I think Lacan explicitly challenges the notion of Freud's mechanistic worldview in one of his seminars.
3358070	3361890	E	0.8943318128585815	So I'm wondering what you think about this, Alexei.
3364470	3370594	A	0.7048464417457581	I'm not an expert in Lacan at all, and I know Wilfred beyond in a limited fashion.
3370642	3376230	A	0.6204138994216919	So perhaps Mark is a better person to talk.
3376300	3378438	A	0.549188494682312	And I like Freud.
3378534	3381302	A	0.8345924615859985	Particularly mark's interpretations and translations.
3381366	3384134	A	0.8965998291969299	But maybe Mark can comment on Lacan and beyond.
3384262	3388220	A	0.8333632946014404	I'm not sufficiently knowledgeable about their work.
3394000	3398524	B	0.9227938652038574	If you want to Mark or Bren, you can share some thoughts.
3398572	3399330	B	0.5299542546272278	Yeah, please.
3400900	3412020	C	0.7236987352371216	Well, I think that the point that Albert's making is we must remember that psychoanalysis is not synonymous with Freud.
3412600	3420920	C	0.8075066208839417	That not everything in psychoanalysis stands or falls by whether or not we accept this or that tenet of Freud's.
3421580	3431776	C	0.7861036658287048	And in neuropsychoanalysis, we try very much to draw upon all of the traditions within psychoanalysis.
3431908	3446450	C	0.8745359182357788	And we sort of fondly believe that we'll be able to find more common ground because there are greater empirical tools available in neuropsychoanalysis than in psychoanalysis by itself.
3447220	3463444	C	0.4991390109062195	We are hoping to resolve some of these theoretical disagreements, trying to move beyond just different systems of belief, trying to move more toward a psychoanalysis in which we can decide questions in an ordinary scientific way.
3463562	3482170	C	0.486929714679718	But it will always be very difficult for exactly the reason that Alexei's whole talk is about, I suppose, which is the extreme complexity and therefore unpredictability of the phenomena that we are dealing with.
3482960	3486312	C	0.7116958498954773	So I think Albert's points are valid.
3486456	3495170	C	0.8567327857017517	That the beyond's approach, Lacan's approach, they add a great deal.
3497300	3504560	C	0.5442245006561279	They don't have as much to lose if we throw out the principle of psychical determinism.
3504980	3516390	C	0.7718740701675415	But having said that, let me just quickly say a word about psychical determinism, because this has been a big part of what Andrea picked up on in what Alexey said.
3517320	3522868	C	0.8380103707313538	I think it comes down to the question that I asked at the outset.
3522964	3531800	C	0.5885360240936279	It's not a matter of is the behavior of the mind random or it's a question of how predictable.
3532300	3535096	C	0.7176772356033325	It's not a matter of is there no determinism?
3535208	3541020	C	0.7996401190757751	It's a matter of how easily can we trace effects back to their causes.
3541360	3546140	C	0.5659615993499756	So the fact that there's a great deal that goes on where we can't do that.
3546290	3556368	C	0.5689130425453186	There are many things our patients say, whether they be slips of the tongue or anything else of that kind, and not only to do with parapraxes, but anything that they do.
3556534	3559872	C	0.8150812387466431	There are certain things that we see with regularity.
3560016	3564288	C	0.7449365854263306	I mean, the very phenomenon of transference is all about regularities.
3564464	3566276	C	0.7548182606697083	That there are certain things that we see.
3566298	3573880	C	0.6456620693206787	Yes, I can understand this happens repeatedly.
3574940	3584424	C	0.5879462361335754	I think I can explain that with reference to certain aspects of the patient's inner world and their past, but there's a great deal else that we can't.
3584552	3593496	C	0.6056700348854065	So I don't think that it's a kind of either there's determinism or there's stochasticity.
3593608	3599840	C	0.8740532398223877	I think that this is why I was talking also about the layers of the predictive hierarchy.
3600340	3602896	C	0.7215512990951538	The deeper layers are the unconscious ones.
3602998	3612412	C	0.9572063684463501	Their things are pretty stereotyped, pretty predictable, in fact, too predictable.
3612476	3619120	C	0.5724002718925476	I mean, in other words, it over generalizes, it's too confident about its beliefs.
3619420	3626440	C	0.6852961182594299	But as we head toward the pre conscious and conscious there, things are much less predictable.
3627900	3630872	C	0.7378637194633484	So I won't say more.
3631006	3644190	C	0.908892035484314	A couple of things in what Alexei said in his comments after mine, that if we have time, I'll come back to but I think let's rather hear from Brin before I say anything more.
3645540	3646770	F	0.9793016910552979	Thank you so much.
3648100	3673540	F	0.5295396447181702	I'm perhaps the least qualified here to comment on your paper, Alexi, but I do have one or two thoughts, and they come from a place of being very fortunate thus far in my life to have been a patient for many, many hours, sometimes on the couch, and also to be a clinical psychologist.
3673620	3676516	F	0.6975641846656799	I failed to mention that in my introduction.
3676628	3696364	F	0.8098373413085938	So I'm a was until recently, when my foray began into more research based areas, and via the Active Inference Institute and Mark's work and Cole Friston's work, I was a pure clinician.
3696412	3702000	F	0.6470907926559448	I had it in my mind that I was going to treat psychopathology to the best of my ability.
3702580	3715350	F	0.747846782207489	But really it was being a patient first and foremost that brought me into closer contact with the theme of your paper and certainly the themes of Mark's work.
3716200	3721800	F	0.8342196345329285	And I think I've encountered it from both areas.
3722140	3744040	F	0.47434407472610474	And certainly to my mind, it matters less the inner workings of the degree to which chaos stochastic, all these big wonderful terms that I'm only beginning to even think about.
3744210	3744930	A	0.6056497097015381	But.
3748580	3759700	F	0.5243164300918579	What matters to me is that how do you help somebody who is in a state, who comes in disheveled?
3760040	3766070	F	0.731273353099823	And how does one go about helping aiding somebody in that state?
3766760	3783736	F	0.5231547355651855	I fell out of love with psychoanalysis for personal reasons, but it was in returning to it, I've become more kind of better acquainted with its strengths and its limitations.
3783928	3814260	F	0.4868410527706146	And I'm realizing that when you help somebody and manage to reduce the noise, to reduce the chaos in somebody's mind, when they become the greater degrees of health start returning to them, that they do rely far more, whether they know it or not, on probabilistic reasoning in their daily kind of functioning.
3814920	3823464	F	0.5987682342529297	And so I think there is a strong case to be made for a mathematical way of processing the world.
3823582	3827530	F	0.821962833404541	It doesn't have to necessarily be made conscious to the person.
3827900	3834188	F	0.6465356349945068	It can be a bit overwhelming to try and impart that on somebody.
3834354	3856608	F	0.8741078972816467	But I think a brain that is not working properly, regardless of the degree to which there is chaos, that can be measured or quantifiably measured in that brain, somebody is tripping over themselves because they are unable to predict what might happen.
3856774	3870170	F	0.4661814570426941	And that is a terrifying prospect because I think there is some reliance and some staunch dependability on the fact that the sun is going to rise and that it's going to set and that I can then focus on other things.
3872060	3895184	F	0.747871458530426	So that's just my comments more from kind of a personal front of being a patient and encountering the limitations of psychotherapy and what I would have done in those moments of need to have not, as you say, had a more deterministic view of what was happening.
3895382	3904400	F	0.8744528889656067	And I've tried to transfer that or carry that over, rightly or wrongly, into my own therapy as a psychotherapist.
3905940	3927930	F	0.664079487323761	So a more personal thing of what it means to be feel chaotic and what I see, regardless of how confirmed it is or not, but chaos reigns and to try and not compound that is certainly something that I'm interested.
3928940	3929736	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3929918	3931160	B	0.9170547723770142	Thank you, Bryn.
3931740	3937832	B	0.8691902160644531	I'll also give my thought on what's at stake and what's on the table as a total non clinician.
3937896	3962288	B	0.7530701160430908	But what I saw in Alexi's paper and also what I see people coming towards I see the paper as Alexi making a real stable of concepts or portfolio of topics ranging from the first principles of active inference like surprise bounding, to dynamic stochastic chaotic, which not the same thing, but they sometimes cohabitate.
3962384	3974868	B	0.6552352905273438	So bringing a set of concepts into play, making it matter for the field so that it can matter for the clinician, so that it can matter for the patient, which is where you totally brought it home to Brin.
3974964	3992888	B	0.6357643008232117	And in my totally simplified model, I was seeing all this diagnostic machinery from personalized data, EEG recordings, all these surveys and samples, all the different conversation therapy itself, all these different measurements, inference.
3993064	4001824	B	0.7510283589363098	And then it passes through the Markov blanket of the diagnosis, and it's like, well, now we know that that person is X or they have X.
4002022	4007376	B	0.8979328274726868	And then here's where we now branch back out with modalities of treatment.
4007408	4020488	B	0.7465084195137024	And so that bottlenecking has obvious relevance in terms of getting a categorical grip on what we basically all agree are wetware complex systems, they're sensitive to initial conditions, all of that.
4020654	4030036	B	0.7109240889549255	And what if, though, like you brought up the example with the scar tissue, maybe it's literal bodily scar tissue, maybe it's conceptual scar tissue.
4030148	4037016	B	0.8794238567352295	What if that inference were able to be understood in the context of an attractor landscape?
4037128	4044740	B	0.810989499092102	And it's not just a singular attractor, so we have multiple attractors, we have a chaotic landscape.
4044920	4058320	B	0.8645536303520203	And so what if we were able to perforate that blanket, speaking super loosely, to bring in what we have already recognized as diagnostically relevant?
4058400	4077560	B	0.567866861820221	Like the fact that patients who have differential entropy have this or that epileptic outcome or coma outcome, bring in that machinery that led to the diagnosis, but now take it beyond the diagnosis and maybe even beyond the clinician's concept, directly into the hands of the patient?
4085690	4086662	A	0.9793016910552979	Thank you so much.
4086716	4090954	A	0.6194888353347778	Perhaps we can hear from Mark and yeah, I'm not eager to talk.
4091072	4093900	A	0.7345550060272217	If there is time, I'll say something, but if not, that's OK.
4095950	4101862	C	0.8151875734329224	Well, let me first of all say something about my might.
4101936	4105534	C	0.645492672920227	Some of you have noticed that suddenly everything went black behind me.
4105652	4109680	C	0.7642937302589417	That's because I'm in South Africa where they have power problems.
4110050	4114786	C	0.7179834842681885	And then a kind person in my household thought that they would help.
4114888	4119220	C	0.8534075617790222	And they've put this huge spotlight here which is shining in my eyes.
4123910	4128550	C	0.6677797436714172	If I look as if I'm in a rabbit in headlights, it's because I am.
4128620	4133014	C	0.6498157382011414	I sent a text message saying, please come and remove this big lamp you put here.
4133052	4135320	C	0.6018980145454407	But they don't seem to have received the message.
4136030	4139610	C	0.8351812958717346	Now back to our actual topic.
4141150	4156138	C	0.7753738760948181	To the extent that I'm able to not be distracted from it, I think that when I asked Alexi what was at stake, his main answer was to do with a diagnosis.
4156234	4162610	C	0.6844180822372437	Now, I don't mean that he's saying that that's all that's at stake, but I think he's saying this illustrates what's at stake.
4163350	4185510	C	0.7147813439369202	So I want to first of all make sure that because I'm not sure who our audience is and who's going to be watching this in case anybody misunderstands, I want to make clear that in psychoanalysis, we've long ago moved away from DSM and ICD type diagnosis.
4187050	4202906	C	0.6487078070640564	We always thought that the psychiatric nozology was wholly artificial and created divisions where they don't exist in nature.
4203098	4206378	C	0.6930132508277893	And we replaced it with a far more dynamic.
4206554	4208554	C	0.7985407114028931	Approach to diagnosis.
4208602	4210714	C	0.7153769135475159	And it's not just a matter of labeling.
4210842	4214814	C	0.7297467589378357	It's a matter also of what kind of thought process lies behind the diagnosis.
4214862	4233030	C	0.5745936632156372	In other words, conceptualizing what's going on here, rather than saying, this is an instance of personality disorder, and I'll specify which type, we don't think like that in psychoanalysis, and really, we never have in neuropsychoanalysis.
4234570	4236790	C	0.7965298295021057	We build in that same tradition.
4237450	4242346	C	0.8092052340507507	I think that what Alexei was worrying about.
4242528	4256830	C	0.8498950004577637	He's saying, yeah, but you use systems, you say that there's a certain number of drives and you use those to pass what you're seeing clinically.
4257330	4264050	C	0.5081982612609863	And yes, we do, and we have to, because you can't just say, what I'm seeing is chaos.
4264550	4271938	C	0.5987777709960938	What you've got to say is, well, what I'm seeing is chaos, but let me try my best to find the deeper structure of this.
4272104	4277126	C	0.7782390117645264	And so what we do is much the same as what I was saying earlier about how brain and mind work.
4277228	4279542	C	0.7404959201812744	Likewise, the clinician's mind works.
4279596	4290886	C	0.6865568161010742	That way we have some deeper concepts that organize what we see, and then more on the surface, we see the complexity.
4290998	4298826	C	0.7535775899887085	In other words, we don't think that we can reduce a patient just to one saying, this patient has problems with this drive, or something.
4298928	4305418	C	0.7566125392913818	It's not as simple as that, of course, but we do start with saying, well, these are the drives, these are the attractors.
4305594	4316770	C	0.8647570013999939	To put it in terms of the attractor landscape that you're talking about, these are the preferred states of the human phenotype.
4317190	4320020	C	0.7563037276268005	And in mental life too, they are preferred states.
4320630	4328514	C	0.855700671672821	There are certain attractors that we're trying to stay in.
4328552	4332050	C	0.6982507109642029	Those like, for example, fear.
4332130	4334710	C	0.6161972880363464	We want to be safe, we don't want to feel fear.
4335370	4341606	C	0.6495291590690613	With respect to attachment bonding, we want to stay close to our attachment figures.
4341638	4342906	C	0.5977893471717834	We don't want to lose them.
4343008	4349120	C	0.5800936818122864	With respect to rage, we don't want to be frustrated and have things standing in our way.
4349570	4354430	C	0.7353256344795227	We want to be able to have free access to the objects of our needs and so on.
4354580	4362770	C	0.7135103344917297	Those are these attractors, and we have great difficulty staying in those homeostatic bounds.
4364390	4366734	C	0.5826869010925293	It is a dynamic picture.
4366862	4381718	C	0.8571083545684814	And then over the question of the different drives, there's the highly individualized predictive model that each one of us comes up with in relation to those drives and in relation to the conflicts between those drives and so on.
4381804	4395434	C	0.8197752833366394	So I think that this way of thinking that we use in psychoanalysis and neuropsychoanalysis is already of the kind that Alex is calling for.
4395552	4418222	C	0.7095180153846741	So I think that what Daniel's just said is therefore perhaps very important to make clear it's that he's offering us a language, an additional language, an additional I don't just mean language, I should say an additional set of concepts and a highly developed one, which we might find useful.
4418286	4420482	C	0.5029234290122986	And so we should take this on board.
4420616	4425426	C	0.6830569505691528	That sounds very convincing to me, if that's what's at stake here.
4425528	4435400	C	0.7536041140556335	That Alexei is saying this is a language that lends itself to the phenomena that you study and to the way in which you go about studying it, then it sounds to me as if Alexi is right.
4436110	4444700	C	0.8687624931335449	So that's the main thing I wanted to say in response to his comments in relation to what I said.
4445630	4451614	C	0.7071142792701721	So if anyone else wants to say anything else, that's good with me.
4451652	4462240	C	0.5375140309333801	But Alexi, if I've misunderstood and if there's something else that you think is at stake that I'm not getting, now's your chance to say it.
4463410	4475560	A	0.6195619106292725	Well, I just wanted to end the conversation when you said that if this language might be of any even to consider this language in our future models, I'm a happy man and there's nothing else I need to say.
4476010	4480214	A	0.7378527522087097	And I just wanted to say that these are human things.
4480252	4481586	A	0.8745871782302856	They're occupational hazards.
4481618	4495434	A	0.5962461233139038	Some of the things I'm talking about, this paper I'm working on about narrative stuff, is that, of course, it is much easier for us to think in categories, even in the psychoanalytic world.
4495632	4501198	A	0.8835170865058899	What we do let's take the Macquillium system and the previous one.
4501284	4506522	A	0.5474539995193481	We used to say three levels of functioning neurotic, borderline psychotic.
4506586	4507710	A	0.718262255191803	These are categories.
4508130	4509562	A	0.6077996492385864	They're not DSM categories.
4509626	4512106	A	0.8053977489471436	They're not bipolar one, but they're categories nonetheless.
4512218	4516126	A	0.7736978530883789	Then we have character styles, obsessive character style, histrionic character style.
4516158	4517086	A	0.5483101606369019	They're categories.
4517198	4517762	A	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
4517896	4521102	A	0.7036124467849731	So to some degree, it's a human condition to put things in categories.
4521166	4526260	A	0.5453155636787415	And I do think that this is a very strong historical reasons that we think this way.
4528010	4531154	A	0.6671954393386841	We have generations of thinking this way in categories.
4531282	4536598	A	0.5686841607093811	And yes, at the end of the day, when we paint a portrait of a patient, it's developed, and it's like a tapestry.
4536694	4542198	A	0.7043474912643433	All of these things weave into one another, and it's complex, but we start from basic categories.
4542294	4551110	A	0.8184792995452881	And certainly if we consider that some things can be transient, there can be emergence, they're like that.
4551280	4557482	A	0.6476755142211914	Certain behavior in one context is a compulsion, but it's not a compulsion in another context.
4557626	4569838	A	0.5699146389961243	And perhaps I'm saying trivial things to clinicians and also what dream you said just to comment when you said as a patient to reduce the noise and reduce the chaos.
4569934	4571934	A	0.6970285773277283	I detect the bias in the language.
4572062	4576674	A	0.605137050151825	You see how we call psychopathology in DSM disorders.
4576802	4578630	A	0.9755329489707947	Disorder is a bad word for us.
4578700	4581270	A	0.661069393157959	And I'm trying to say chaos is healthy.
4581770	4585574	A	0.569133996963501	I spend most of my day in gamma functioning, which is a chaotic state.
4585692	4587062	A	0.6551750898361206	It's not a bad thing.
4587196	4589414	A	0.7871991991996765	So in the folk language, chaos is a bad word.
4589452	4593290	A	0.8111236095428467	Disorder is a bad I want to put things in order, and then perhaps we're missing something.
4593360	4605662	A	0.869026780128479	What comes to mind is, I think, Mark, you had meetings with Michael Levin and Ian McGilchrist, who know big on talking about the mechanistic, logical, linear, straight and narrow left hemisphere type.
4605716	4612946	A	0.8640374541282654	Of course it's not left hemisphere, but that's the model versus holistic sensorial kind of right hemisphere artistic type.
4613048	4629974	A	0.6577951908111572	And we're missing the second part, like Daniel's background is surrounded by art where we spend less time in the right hemisphere, maybe appropriately so, but I think that there's some things that lend themselves to that level of understanding and we break things.
4630172	4636934	A	0.8938558101654053	We look at psychopathology and a human suffering like it's a carburetor sometimes, where we again put it in buckets.
4636982	4637862	A	0.7812601327896118	That's my impression.
4637926	4643898	A	0.8919842839241028	But what you said is wonderful and I don't contradict with anything.
4643984	4645980	A	0.9072352051734924	I agree with everything you said, Mark.
4648610	4651230	F	0.8348496556282043	Alexi, if I can just comment.
4654210	4654586	C	0.645394504070282	It'S.
4654618	4655950	F	0.7071110606193542	Almost like an arc.
4656930	4665326	F	0.6726075410842896	The pot of gold at the end of the arc is the reduced chaos, the reduced noise in terms of the patients from the patient's perspective.
4665438	4679350	F	0.6522976160049438	But how you get there, ironically, is actually by inducing states of tolerable chaos and then kind of reformulating that, reconsolidating that chaos.
4680010	4698154	F	0.898972749710083	So it's not that from the healing or growth or whatever the patient might present to you for it has everything to do with minimal or marginal chaos induction and then reintegration of that.
4698192	4707854	F	0.6512162089347839	So the whole process is premised on chaos, but in bite sized doses, maybe one could say, right, and just to.
4707892	4709726	A	0.6668709516525269	Finish up and then I'll stop talking.
4709828	4726710	A	0.5914133191108704	Jonathan Schadler, who all know and know, widely respected as a psychoanalytic practitioner and teacher and writer, he recently said that take a patient X with an analyst Y together the diet has emergent properties.
4727210	4730680	A	0.5591367483139038	That is not the same thing as patient X with the analyst Z.
4731050	4731606	A	0.7360090017318726	Right?
4731708	4734790	A	0.8773813247680664	And show me one study where we take that into account.
4734860	4735750	A	0.5698980689048767	We don't.
4736650	4741254	A	0.8884994983673096	We just do random clinical trial, then we do metaanalysis of random clinical trial.
4741302	4742970	A	0.8794010877609253	What technique did the therapist use?
4743040	4746038	A	0.8032673001289368	They used, you know, whatever four letter therapy they applied.
4746134	4749138	A	0.5831174254417419	Nobody looks at the emerging properties in a diet.
4749334	4754234	A	0.8538565635681152	This matrix between the two, and that's the language of dynamical systems.
4754282	4756906	A	0.5693809986114502	This is Daniel Friedman ant colony.
4757098	4760314	A	0.5362725853919983	A single ant doesn't build bridges and grow mushrooms.
4760362	4761858	A	0.6928452849388123	Ant colony does all those things.
4761944	4765474	A	0.5765783786773682	We don't talk about emergence in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, do we?
4765592	4766354	B	0.5889394879341125	It's true.
4766472	4768718	B	0.6855797171592712	It's also a fundamental challenge.
4768894	4775654	B	0.5541665554046631	After all, you can't replicate within one Dyad or across Dyads in a finite world.
4775772	4777830	B	0.775048017501831	So it does point to fundamentals.
4778570	4791382	B	0.8327877521514893	In our last minutes, if each would like to give some thoughts, where do we go as we now the opponent of exponent away from each other in our paths?
4791446	4798102	B	0.9367615580558777	So maybe Albert, Brynn, Mark and then Alexey, what are your overall thoughts, reflections?
4798166	4800190	B	0.8170379400253296	And then where are we heading?
4804290	4805790	B	0.6249232888221741	Go for it, Albert.
4806930	4813780	E	0.8554496765136719	Yeah, I was about to comment on Alexey about the emergent properties thing.
4815350	4817730	E	0.8642377853393555	It's kind of the same point I made earlier.
4820310	4823650	E	0.9115835428237915	Later psychoanalytic theories do talk about emergent properties.
4824550	4828360	E	0.8290449976921082	But yes, I think as what Professor Salvage just mentioned.
4831530	4832486	C	0.8048208355903625	This new set of.
4832508	4846134	E	0.4909244179725647	Concepts makes it very practical for us to communicate with each other because psychoanalysis has a bad habit of reinventing new concepts every new decade.
4846182	4853790	E	0.5903387069702148	So there's a lot of chaos to use that word within psychoanalytic discourse.
4854690	4857450	E	0.9734861254692078	But overall, I thought I'm very grateful.
4857530	4859838	E	0.9809830784797668	I think this was a very interesting talk.
4860004	4860794	E	0.5108225345611572	So yeah.
4860852	4861700	E	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
4863830	4864450	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
4864520	4865140	C	0.46103888750076294	Yes.
4866390	4878258	C	0.9482564926147461	By way of closing remarks, I agree with actually, it seems to me that there's an abundance of agreement in this meeting.
4878434	4881510	C	0.759019672870636	I don't see any big controversy.
4882330	4884680	C	0.970795750617981	So that's nice.
4886250	4890602	C	0.597453236579895	I think what Brynn said really captures it.
4890656	4894746	C	0.9493756294250488	I liked it because what he said was so experience near.
4894848	4910630	C	0.6921409964561462	He was just describing what it feels like to be a patient, to be in a state of not knowing and uncertainty as opposed to a more stable kind of tranquility.
4910730	4934710	C	0.7130450010299683	And then the ability to allow yourself to return to uncertainty if you've found answers that are too simple and that are too static to allow ourselves to go back into this state of not really knowing.
4935870	4941430	C	0.5654060244560242	That, I think, really does describe what we try to do for our patients.
4941510	4950862	C	0.8282031416893005	What we have to remember applies to ourselves not only because we are ultimately patients too, but because it applies to how the mind works.
4950916	4960718	C	0.6706297993659973	It applies to science, how science works, that we do need to find order, but there is disorder out there.
4960804	4972158	C	0.8190434575080872	And so we're always at risk of coming prematurely to a rigid system of belief and we have to return back to the coalface and back to the chaos.
4972334	4978390	C	0.7180874347686768	But ultimately, where we want to be is back in that valley.
4980490	5007710	C	0.6856147050857544	And so, as much as Alex is right to remind us that the highest levels of brain activity in many senses of the word are entropic and that deep sleep and seizures are bad things, as much as that's true.
5007860	5018306	C	0.6291729211807251	Nevertheless, I think that the great trend of the mind it's one of its fundamental working principles is we are wanting to be more certain.
5018488	5021102	C	0.5222446918487549	We want life to be more predictable.
5021166	5023258	C	0.7050405740737915	We don't like to be in chaos.
5023454	5045302	C	0.5899524092674255	And I think that that's an important thing to remember while we are acknowledging the importance of chaos and of the highly unpredictable nature of the world and of the phenomena we study in our field, nevertheless, we retreat from it, and for very good reasons.
5045446	5047970	C	0.8873686194419861	So those are my closing remarks.
5048150	5049120	C	0.5090138912200928	And thank.
5052310	5054766	F	0.7889822721481323	And I'll be very brief.
5054958	5067058	F	0.9273632764816284	Alexia, just thank you for the paper and for having such a strong focus on the patient and on psychopath well, on the human condition.
5067154	5075234	F	0.9528548121452332	I think that's so nice to have that come out of the paper when at first glance it doesn't seem to be there.
5075292	5083158	F	0.915966272354126	So thanks for making it so human and then just Daniel for organizing and to spend time with Mark and Albert.
5083334	5084262	F	0.9776464104652405	It's a great pleasure.
5084326	5085660	F	0.9706712365150452	So thank you very much.
5087650	5089360	B	0.7410500645637512	Alexi, final words.
5090530	5095918	A	0.9643974900245667	I want to thank everybody and Mark and Brynn and Albert and Daniel, Andrea, thank you.
5096004	5102930	A	0.9911922812461853	I had a great fun and I'm very grateful, honestly, for your help and openness and flexibility.
5103510	5112302	A	0.7310421466827393	One of the other reasons is kind of the time we live in Yuval harari made that comment that the rate of change is accelerating.
5112446	5115090	A	0.6789666414260864	When we were hunter gatherers, uncertainty was norm.
5115160	5116834	A	0.6181422472000122	You wake up, there's nothing in the fridge.
5116882	5117986	A	0.7241846323013306	You have to go hunt.
5118098	5120054	A	0.5746995210647583	And we tolerated uncertainty better.
5120092	5122534	A	0.7662370204925537	We could put our worldly possessions on the back.
5122652	5124786	A	0.6641753911972046	And then we started living in the world of iPads.
5124818	5126370	A	0.618491530418396	iPhones were bombarded with information.
5126460	5128054	A	0.806778073310852	And we must minimize uncertainty.
5128102	5133398	A	0.5229055881500244	We must have predictability in everything, which is not the natural world for mammals.
5133574	5142762	A	0.7764753103256226	And now we live our life and then bang, COVID hits, and then bang, certain person becomes the President of the United States and everything goes upside down.
5142816	5146614	A	0.5227230191230774	So the black swans are hitting us more frequently.
5146742	5152862	A	0.7668625116348267	So I think having the theory of that at our fingerprint and applying it to our work is probably beneficial.
5152926	5154514	A	0.9747616648674011	But again, thank you all so much.
5154552	5155940	A	0.9703162312507629	I really appreciate it.
5156390	5156898	B	0.918424665927887	Awesome.
5156984	5158926	B	0.9691698551177979	Well, thank you all for joining.
5158958	5162914	B	0.6965689659118652	The conversation continues, so till next time.
5163112	5164100	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
5164630	5165346	A	0.4864291548728943	Bye bye.
5165448	5166594	A	0.915550708770752	Thanks a lot.
5166792	5167118	A	0.5137446522712708	Bye.
