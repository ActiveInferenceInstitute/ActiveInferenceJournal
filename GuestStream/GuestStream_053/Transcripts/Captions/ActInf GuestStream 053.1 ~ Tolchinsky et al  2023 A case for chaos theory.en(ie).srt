stream number 53.1 at the Active

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,260
inference Institute it's August 23rd

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,199
2023 we're going to be having a

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,260
presentation followed by a discussion

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,480
around the recent work of Alexi

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,760
tulcinski a case for a Chaos Theory

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,279
inclusion in neuropsychoanalytic

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,960
modeling so if you're watching live

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,700

into the live chat otherwise we will now

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,079
have the presentation followed by a

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,360
discussion with our excellent panelists

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,160
so thank you everybody for joining and

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,898
Alexi to you for the presentation

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,860
um thank you uh Daniel

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,520
um

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,500
thank you Mark for finding the time I'm

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,719
very uh grateful and excited to talk

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,199
about this thank you Andrea uh we're in

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,899
Albert I hope maybe Mike will join us

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,840
and uh thank you Daniel and active

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,939
inference Institute for organizing this

24
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,020
meeting

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,320
so uh can you see the slides

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,180
yeah okay so I'll just uh receive them

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,240
um this is the outline of the talk I'll

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,420
share some preliminary comments and talk

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,220
briefly about assumptions in the current

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,920
models summarize the data talk about

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,200
free energy Principle formulations as

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,299
compatible with chaos and talk about

33
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,119
some future developments and hopefully

34
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,799
we can discuss that I'm very much

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,600
looking forward to have more questions

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,060
than answers

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,400
I'd like to start with what Mike 11 uh

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,020
taught me I guess is just why it's

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,079
important to me the most important thing

40
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,740
is the clinical applications I think

41
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,060
that

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,579
with your work Mark and with yakpanzip's

43
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,579
work we have been moving uh away from

44
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,939
dualism over the course of some time but

45
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,280
I think the other big determinants is

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
still highly prevalent and dominant and

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,139
I do think it influences power uh

48
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,060
clinical work diagnosis and

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,640
Psychotherapy and assessments and I

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,379
think that it may be beneficial for some

51
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,360
of the harder conditions we work with to

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,000
consider including non-linear framework

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,480
that's my main focus and this is the

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
link to the preprint and the paper is

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,379
published fully in your recycle analysis

56
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,360
Journal

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,879
some of it is a discussion with this

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,400
foundational paper that umark wrote the

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,500
new project for a scientific psychology

60
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,379
General scheme which is a perhaps

61
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,720
revision a Revival of Freud's famous

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,980
paper project for scientific psychology

63
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,640
and

64
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,660
um

65
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,940
I'd like to give you a credit Mark that

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,040
you have been opening conversations

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
between disciplines that hadn't been

68
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,400
talking to each other prior to your

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,620
efforts such as psychoanalysis and uh

70
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,239
neurosciences you've been doing for more

71
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,000
than 20 years with great success in the

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,040
same spirit I wanted to mention that

73
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,120
Society for chaos theory in psychology

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
exists since 91 which is one of the

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,500
first conference happened about less

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,420
than 20 years than the first conference

77
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,680
on chaos in Lake Italy around Lake Italy

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Lake Cuomo in Italy in 76 which was

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,420
mostly physicists at that time and then

80
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,940
psychologists joined and I've attended

81
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,800
the recent conference in Toronto which

82
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,840
was absolutely wonderful and I met

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,760
extraordinary clinicians and scientists

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,980
and I think that it would be beneficial

85
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,019
to open that dialogue as well and maybe

86
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,360
there is a wall between us to consider

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,180
demolishing the wall

88
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,180
um

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,739
um in terms of intent for the paper Your

90
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,360
Mark pointed out to me that you've had

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,580
an exchange with Robert gallitzer Levy

92
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,799
for those of you who may not know him

93
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,900
he's a psychoanalyst from Chicago a

94
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,019
psychologic writer and a teacher who

95
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,220
wrote a book on non-linear

96
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,319
psychoanalysis and there's a deserves a

97
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,840
lot of credit for his advocacy and you

98
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,940
know he's sharing his thoughts

99
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,159
he posed the question to you mark of

100
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,080
possibly considering non-linear

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,019
components in that seminal paper or

102
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,180
project for scientific psychology

103
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,519
and to which you responded that the key

104
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,680
point in such discussion was whether the

105
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,259
mental apparatus was indeed non-linear

106
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,320
so I took your comment as a task as a

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,360
challenge if you wish and decided to

108
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,800
write a paper about it

109
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,900
I don't know if the data presented is

110
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,940
sufficient but I tried

111
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,460
and very clearly I don't intend to

112
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,040
contradict or criticize you know that

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,259
would be funny of me to do I am hopeful

114
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,320
maybe to add a branch of this tree that

115
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,639
you're growing

116
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,460
clinical and theoretical tree and should

117
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,680
you consider it worthwhile to go in this

118
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,720
direction we wouldn't have to change

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,180
very much because this is the paper by

120
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,100
Tristan Lancelot De Costa and others

121
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,660
called stochastic chaos and Mark of

122
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,240
blankets our financial principle is

123
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,180
compatible with the uh chaotic

124
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,400
attracting set what I thought was not

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,100
present just yet was a formulation where

126
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,080
the attracting set experiences a phase

127
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,100
transition

128
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,520
and I took Liberty to ask Carl about it

129
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,259
and he shared some very nice thoughts

130
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,240
that I wrote uh with his permission

131
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,699
share at the end of The Talk

132
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,419
um

133
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,539
I'd like to cite Maxwell ramstead whom

134
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,120
you know and his colleagues from the

135
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,860
paper and Basin mechanics are physics

136
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,080
Often by beliefs where they talk about

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,560
Dynamics mechanics and principles and in

138
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,680
physics uh you know Kepler's work is

139
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,660
descriptive it shows you know what the

140
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,699
orbits of heavenly bodies are

141
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,360
mechanics are the how of the Dynamics

142
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,120
this is Newton's laws and principles are

143
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,460
prescriptive they are about why things

144
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,199
work this way there's a certain

145
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,180
hierarchy in physics where you could

146
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,100
derive the second law of Newton from

147
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,800
principle of least action and then if

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,300
you have initial conditions you can

149
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,220
calculate the Dynamics

150
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,259
the reason I'm mentioning that is I

151
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,000
think Mark your new project for

152
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,400
scientific psychology is a high road

153
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,979
it seems to start from first principles

154
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,900
such as the free energy principle and

155
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,120
you seem to derive things down from

156
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,259
there

157
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,259
so I thought why not try to see how the

158
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,960
low road may look like if in addition to

159
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,819
these derivations and deductions and

160
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,919
Declaration of what entropy should be in

161
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,259
the brain what if we measure it in

162
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,300
animal studies and human studies in

163
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,979
health and pathology and see what the

164
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,080
data shows and whether or not the low

165
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,699
road meets The High Road in the middle

166
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,440
or perhaps something may need to be

167
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,419
added

168
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,600
I also like to clarify why I spend time

169
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,039
in the paper talking about obvious

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,960
things for everybody here the axioms and

171
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,280
postulates and I'm quoting here Edward

172
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,139
Frankel who is a mathematician at

173
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,160
Berkeley

174
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,580
and you know uh Michael will forgive me

175
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,360
but you know a Viewpoint is that one can

176
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,400
say that some parts of biology can be

177
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,800
seen as based on chemistry which can be

178
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,780
seen as based on physics which can be

179
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,120
seen as based in mathematics so how do

180
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,220
things work in mathematics we know that

181
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,020
Carl Kristin likes to translate nearly

182
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,660
everything he works on into the language

183
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,099
of mathematics

184
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,900
classically there's something called a

185
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,539
formal system which we can

186
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,639
metaphorically compare to building a

187
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,860
house so the foundation of the house is

188
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,840
a set of axioms that has certain

189
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,660
qualities and then we build things up

190
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,880
using the logic of Aristotle and we

191
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,039
derive things like theorems

192
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,319
an example would be including geometry

193
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,840
which is on the plane that is based on

194
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,240
five axioms of Euclid that's the

195
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,099
foundation and then you could derive

196
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,319
things like Pythagorean theorem

197
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,599
now if we were to change just one of the

198
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,520
axioms in the foundation the entire

199
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
house changes

200
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,419
an example would be the fifth Axion of

201
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,520
Euclid that parallel lines essentially

202
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,860
don't intersect if you change that then

203
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,199
we could have a house of on the sphere

204
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,780
which is lobojevski Roman geometry and

205
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,759
meridians of the Earth are parallel and

206
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,380
they intersect but you could have

207
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,660
parabolic shape where parallel lights

208
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,039
also intersect

209
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,479
so we'll have an entirely different

210
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,300
framework and it may be naive to expect

211
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,699
the theorem to look the same the

212
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,340
figurative theorem if we you know put it

213
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,500
on the sphere is different the formula

214
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,419
is different

215
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,759
um I'm mentioning that is because I I

216
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,620
love multidisciplinarity and I think

217
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,360
that's the way of the future

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,360
with that sometimes when when we cross

219
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,339
over into another discipline such as you

220
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,679
know psychologists you know taking

221
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,339
mathematicals or physics ideas then we

222
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,160
we may occasionally forget this formal

223
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,800
system thing for example when we see

224
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,920
things like human beings resist or

225
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,260
violate the second law of thermodynamics

226
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,980
then we uh the second law was formally

227
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,779
related for Clovis systems in the state

228
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,420
of equilibrium such as a sealed chamber

229
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,700
of gas and human beings are neither

230
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,500
closed nor in the state of equilibrium

231
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,420
so it doesn't quite apply it's a

232
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,339
different formal system one needs

233
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:12,959
physics development systems to make a

234
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,660
statement like that so again in

235
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,519
mathematics because you mark seem to

236
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,019
have taken us deeply in the native

237
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,019
mathematics in your project you have

238
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,040
differential equations for Action

239
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,100
perception Precision you have you know

240
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,019
Mark of blankets random dynamical

241
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,600
systems you know equivalences partial

242
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,040
derivatives then

243
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,800
in mathematics people fix the set of

244
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,920
axioms they fix the definitions and then

245
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,160
they build a theory right

246
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,019
um so I want to be clear I want to

247
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,940
clarify what are the axioms in the

248
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,980
theory that is built what is the

249
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,000
foundation

250
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,339
and in the effort of time maybe I'll

251
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,200
talk about just one of them

252
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,899
uh which is Freud psychic determinism

253
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,540
and this is a question for me not an

254
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,880
answer I wanted to ask you because I am

255
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,959
assuming

256
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,560
uh whether you uh kept this Axiom or you

257
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,640
changed it

258
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,160
the Freud said in the Psychopathology of

259
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,080
everyday life that there is nothing

260
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,480
arbitrary or undetermined in the psychic

261
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,700
life there's different versions of this

262
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,620
statement and it has been repeated by

263
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,839
generations of psychoanalysts over 100

264
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,000
years and it became very entrenched it's

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,040
sort of a cultural Meme and a major

266
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,519
tenet of psychoanalysis

267
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,959
if I were to give an illustration

268
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,220
perhaps those of us who are not in in

269
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,420
psychologic therapy then

270
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,760
let's imagine a analytic therapist

271
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,740
hearing a patient

272
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,500
who intends to say same with an S but

273
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,120
they use the word shame

274
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,440
right

275
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,380
so such a phenomenon you know first of

276
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,120
all I think psychodynamics psychologic

277
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,040
therapists would probably say that's not

278
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,120
an accident

279
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,560
okay accident is is not naughty you know

280
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,380
used term in psychoanalysis and secondly

281
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,180
they will probably infer of what it

282
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,260
might mean

283
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,600
for example infer along the lines of

284
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,180
unconscious or emotional Dynamics

285
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,459
emotional conflict somebody else may

286
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,800
infer that it may have

287
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,300
neuropsychological reasons somebody else

288
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,279
may infer that it probably is a migraine

289
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,100
but what you might will not hear in

290
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,680
psychodynamic culture is that that was

291
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,899
you know an accident that it was due to

292
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,720
chance I think the chance accidents

293
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,660
Randomness stochasticity chaos are not

294
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,260
used they're bad form in psychoanalysis

295
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,420
and that that is the illustration of I

296
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,980
think for its assumption ultimately it's

297
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,720
it's an axiom it's a belief that it's

298
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,040
not questioned

299
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,200
if we were to translate that assumption

300
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
in the uh Kristen language this is the

301
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,700
longevon equation from which Christian

302
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,120
starts which is has notations by Daniel

303
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,180
thank you Daniel and we'll have the

304
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,360
change in the state of x equals the flow

305
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
plus the Omega

306
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,720
Omega is the stochastic component it's

307
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,579
the

308
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:02,339
uh you know in Daniel's metaphor we have

309
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,140
a wave and then we have Ripple

310
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,660
so we would have to change the

311
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,459
stochastic component if we were to go

312
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,279
with the Freud's Axiom and then if we do

313
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,200
that we would find ourselves squarely in

314
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,240
the domain of cold physics Newtonian

315
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,940
physics LaPlace is demon LaPlace

316
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,920
famously said give me a position and

317
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,140
momentum of every particle and I'll tell

318
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,579
you exactly where they have been before

319
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,440
and exactly where they will be in the

320
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,660
future now Freud didn't make statements

321
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,620
like that

322
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,660
but this is what would happen if you

323
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,880
kill the stochastic component

324
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,220
I want to be clear that it's not for its

325
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,200
fault at all well first of all you need

326
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,060
axioms to build a theory you chose that

327
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,579
Axiom that's the theory he built and

328
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:42,899
second of all it wasn't exactly

329
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,100
mathematics

330
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,560
and and finally the Zeitgeist of the

331
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,019
time was deterministic you know perhaps

332
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,779
they were uh you know initial

333
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,000
derivations of stochastic mechanics and

334
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,579
quantum mechanics but for it when he was

335
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,980
learning the world of deterministic

336
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,260
physics was dominant

337
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,779
and uh there's an important Nuance in

338
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,579
this discussion pointed out to me by the

339
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,920
first peer reviewer of the paper who

340
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
said You Know listen if you have

341
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,519
something that changes like a stochastic

342
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,680
thing and then you apply statistics to

343
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,500
it such as variance then the variance of

344
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,760
a changing variable will be

345
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,320
deterministic

346
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,300
and then if we look at things like verbs

347
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,220
which are used a lot in talk therapy

348
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,600
like Apple

349
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,700
when Apple is a semantic memory it's a

350
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,560
category it's a course grading already

351
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,600
from green apples and red apples and all

352
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,240
other kinds of apples so in that regard

353
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,880
words are deterministic phase

354
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,339
so perhaps when we have a dream analysis

355
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,680
session and the patient shares with an

356
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,320
analyst you know the movie that they saw

357
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,959
the messy you know irrational thing with

358
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,139
images and tunes and anything and maybe

359
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,779
words even if they narrate it

360
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,360
then they they slow things down they

361
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,519
average things out and they put it in

362
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,800
deterministic tools which is words

363
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,320
so with some objects we can apply

364
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,480
deterministic tools but I want to point

365
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,760
out that the foundation that everything

366
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,560
and anything in the psychic-wise that

367
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,480
all the limitations have no statisticity

368
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,639
Randomness is a very strong assumption

369
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,680
and I'm curious what would happen if we

370
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,579
were to

371
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,500
allow ourselves to see things on the

372
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,959
sphere on the parabolic shape it's not a

373
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,720
bad exercise because the uh general

374
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,100
theory of relativity would not have

375
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,839
existed between without these other

376
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,040
geometries

377
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,920
uh in terms of definitions this is a

378
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,079
familiar formula that you mark use of

379
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,060
Shannon's entropy he originally wrote

380
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,160
about Telegraph and Sandra and receiver

381
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,800
in a fixed alphabet but here if we draw

382
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,660
an attracting set which happens to be

383
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,019
lorenza tractor in Phase space and we

384
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,000
look at these I don't know if you can

385
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,740
see them they're small the white points

386
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,199
you know that's the initial condition

387
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,660
and then they spread out and evolve as

388
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,360
time goes by but you can see the density

389
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,240
of the attracting set it is a higher

390
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,040
density and lower density so we could

391
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,760
calculate uh probability distribution

392
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,060
uh a slightly different question is this

393
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,339
what would happen if you were to change

394
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,380
the initial condition a little bit well

395
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,360
one millimeter in Phase space

396
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,279
different things can happen and one of

397
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,320
them is shown in this diagram that would

398
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
be diverges

399
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,040
in the formula here's initial condition

400
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,740
multiplied by exponent of Lambda T so

401
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,639
when Lambda is positive you have

402
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,380
Divergence and it's called weapon of

403
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,180
exponent and that's one of the criteria

404
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,440
for chaos

405
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,540
when it is negative we have convergence

406
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,639
and when it is zero we have equidistant

407
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,620
trajectories we have Newtonian mechanics

408
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,260
right

409
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,880
this is an illustration of a chaotic

410
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,500
system which is a Great Red Spot on

411
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,519
Jupiter

412
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,740
and it fits perfectly the first things

413
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,959
paper about the Markov blankets and

414
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,420
stochastic chaos because that thing is

415
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,339
stable we have been observing it for 300

416
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,320
years and one could say that this

417
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,360
elliptical shape is the mark of blanket

418
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,399
around the chaos that maintains its

419
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,360
integrity

420
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,459
it's not a contradiction because in one

421
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,560
spatial scale you have marker blanket

422
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,300
and on another spatial scale you have a

423
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,880
chaos within Mark of blank

424
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,279
this is a convergent system that is a

425
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,260
bit trivial to all of you this is a hole

426
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,880
in the ground and then surrounded by

427
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,680
heels on all sides

428
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,260
and if you were to put a ball on the

429
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,880
hill it's going to roll down in the

430
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,459
potential well and typically in face

431
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,260
space we'll call the bottom of the hole

432
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,060
and a tractor and we call the heels

433
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,820
repeller repeller is a term uh less

434
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,399
frequently used but you know it's the

435
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,199
highly unstable point in Phase space

436
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,720
from which things move away from and

437
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,459
they move toward the attractor

438
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,440
now that's just one attraction the

439
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,880
interesting things start happening if

440
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,740
you've got two of them imagine a second

441
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,380
hole immediately to the right and the

442
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,180
boundary between them may very quickly

443
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,399
become chaotic

444
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,199
there's another illustration on a

445
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,699
convergent system from the active

446
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,380
inference textbook that I hadn't read

447
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,759
when I was working on the paper I

448
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,459
discovered it later

449
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:02,759
the chart on the left is the density and

450
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,380
again we see high density in the center

451
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,299
and we hate lower density in the

452
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,760
periphery and the chart on the right is

453
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,859
surprise we're very not surprised to

454
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,419
find a ball in the center and we're very

455
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,880
much surprised if it stays on the hill

456
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,880
and I'll read you a citation active

457
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,919
inference is restricted to systems like

458
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,959
that one on the left which count to

459
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,760
random fluctuations with their average

460
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,459
flow and thereby retain their form over

461
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,720
time

462
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,400
it may sound like the statement

463
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,200
contradicts what I said earlier that Fab

464
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
is compatible with chaos but it doesn't

465
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,340
because you could have different spatial

466
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,380
scales and convergence on one scale and

467
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,360
Divergence in another I also

468
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,740
historically think that we have been

469
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,260
studying converging systems mostly so

470
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,820
far

471
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,460
now if we move from things like that

472
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,860
which is very simple

473
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,100
through a mind or Consciousness then I

474
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,720
think that what which could be looking

475
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,480
at is this that's a landscape with

476
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,340
attractors and repellers

477
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,100
that is very complex and I'm going to

478
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,840
quote the former president of the coast

479
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,299
Society for psychology is that that

480
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,940
landscape is dynamic it moves

481
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,940
uh perhaps some things on it are stable

482
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,160
before imagine a clinical scenario where

483
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,960
there's a patient who is very prone to

484
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,100
shame

485
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,559
and very verse to express anger then we

486
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,080
could say that shame is an attractor and

487
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,740
anger is a repeller but and we work with

488
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,480
pattern things in dynamic therapy so

489
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,760
they could be relatively stable until

490
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,380
the work in therapy makes them more

491
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,020
shallow distributions but certain things

492
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,000
change overnight some things change in a

493
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,919
week or during the course of therapy so

494
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,539
I mean strictly speaking that's a

495
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,700
dynamic landscape and I don't think we

496
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,520
model things this way

497
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,500
um I'd like to also quote Maxwell

498
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,260
ramstead from the same paper that free

499
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,880
energy principle is a tale of two

500
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,580
densities it would be incomplete to say

501
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,799
that we just minimize one variable

502
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,740
you know uh what happens is we minimize

503
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,840
the Shannon's entropy of probability

504
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,480
distribution over sensor States while at

505
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,880
the same time we maximize entropy of

506
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,100
internal beliefs which is very important

507
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,100
that's adaptation if somebody has rigid

508
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,860
internal beliefs

509
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,600
with sharp probabilities and then covet

510
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
happens they will have lower probability

511
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,919
of survival

512
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,140
they're not adaptable so adaptability

513
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,539
means maximization of entropy of

514
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,820
internal beliefs while maintaining the

515
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,980
four means the minimization of Shannon

516
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,260
xanthropy of probability distribution

517
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,419
over sensory States

518
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,820
uh here's another term comogorov

519
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,880
cyanthropy that is not intuitive and

520
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,740
it's from topology

521
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,080
the picture you see is the photograph of

522
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,360
the statue called intuition outside the

523
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,980
fields Institute of mathematics in

524
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,080
Toronto and here's a graphical

525
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,240
illustration if you were to draw the

526
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,340
trajectories in face space

527
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,280
and surrounded by certain volume say a

528
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,860
circle with a radius Epsilon

529
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,900
and asked herself what happens to this

530
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,299
volume as they evolve

531
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,299
well when when the when it expands then

532
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,640
you can have characteristicity when it

533
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,520
uh becomes more compact you could have

534
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,679
convergence when it stays the same you

535
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,320
have periodic system which is indicated

536
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,360
on the chart on the right where you have

537
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,919
you know a correlative they call

538
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,679
logarithm entropy on the y-axis and you

539
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,679
have this Epsilon on the x-axis so the

540
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,660
flat line at the bottom where the the

541
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,460
circle doesn't change is the periodic

542
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,580
system homographs an entropy stays zero

543
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,679
the curved line in the center that

544
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,260
converges on a k is the proper chaos

545
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,900
this is theoretical chaos and the

546
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,020
options from it uh is is what friston

547
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,700
calls stochastic chaos this is cares

548
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,799
plus noise and then you can have pure

549
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,240
nodes and then you can have pure

550
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,520
linearity so all of these things exist

551
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,200
they're all on the table you can have

552
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,419
geometry on the plane geometry in the

553
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,280
sphere geometry in the parabolic shape

554
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,440
so what is the data show

555
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,700
and uh when we look at EG entropy people

556
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,520
use approximate enthropy permutation

557
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
entropy and Spectrum entropy which are

558
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,620
all derivations of coma chorusinai and

559
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,880
the first two are in a different face

560
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,220
space from the last one I believe Mark

561
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,559
correct me if I'm wrong your side go

562
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,440
series uh a study in your book Hidden

563
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,179
Spring when you talk about entropy and

564
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,760
phases of sleep and they use Spectrum

565
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,640
entropy which is a derivation of

566
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,980
chromogorovsinai in the frequency domain

567
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,659
analysis phase space

568
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:33,900
so the data shows that you know uh

569
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,260
assistance for as small as a axon of a

570
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,960
squid isolated in the lab to single

571
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,020
neurons two coupled neurons to EEG

572
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,419
we have evidence of positive lack of lap

573
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,120
enough exponents in some regimes of

574
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,700
operation with EEG we can be more

575
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,980
specific that Alpha Rhythm seems to be

576
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,480
weakly non-linear

577
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,059
while things below Alpha like Delta seem

578
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,460
to be more periodic with noise and

579
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,679
things above Alpha such as gamma and

580
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,840
high gamma seem to be chaotic

581
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
so if we were to summarize this data

582
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,100
that it would

583
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,440
be we can say that komogorously enthropy

584
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,900
appears to increase as generalized

585
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,940
arousal increases from Delta to gamma

586
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,940
rhythm

587
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,380
seems to be higher in healthy alert

588
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,940
brain mind functioning than in the

589
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,100
states of coma Seashore deep sleep and

590
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,080
it can stay close to zero in a coma or

591
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,720
deep sleep the interesting anecdote here

592
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,220
is that a simple Act of closing your

593
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,720
eyes when you're alert decreases

594
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,940
commodore cinethropy

595
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,059
clinical applications are vast and

596
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,059
developing fast for example but except

597
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,820
for Clinical Psychology I must say in

598
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,559
Psychiatry psychotherapy but in

599
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,480
neurology the seizure detection on the

600
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,659
EEG is right now can be done with AI

601
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,700
with about the same accuracy as a human

602
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,360
neurologist and that algorithm does use

603
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,500
characteristicity assessment there's

604
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,480
models for Parkinson's neuropathic pain

605
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,340
and other have other examples that I'll

606
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,020
skip right now

607
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,880
this is a graphical illustration of

608
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,260
phases of sleep

609
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,559
and again it has called mogorithm

610
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,140
anthropy as a phase of sleep it shows

611
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,940
wakefulness and then shallow sleep

612
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,340
progressively deeper sleep and REM and

613
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,140
that's the time Evolution if you move

614
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,419
Ram in frequency to where it belongs to

615
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,860
wakefulness then you'll see the same

616
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,539
progression that golma grows in the

617
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,220
entropy appears to increase as a

618
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,380
function of generalized arousal

619
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,559
this is a seizure onset at about second

620
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,460
floor

621
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,620
teacher is a reduction in keraticity

622
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,240
healthy functioning is higher

623
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,159
characteristic than a seizure

624
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,679
this is a coma which is relatively

625
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,140
invariant fat in Delta frequency this is

626
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,820
a nearly periodic system with some noise

627
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,760
and death is a linear system it doesn't

628
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,840
change

629
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,760
this is persistent vegetative state

630
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,860
minimally conscious state where

631
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,539
researchers were asking a question on

632
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,760
prognosis of survival and they've

633
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,679
concluded that diversity and variability

634
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,039
of the EEG was the predictor of survival

635
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,820
higher entropy means life

636
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,760
so the hypothesis is that chaotic

637
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,039
stochastic and linear processes as well

638
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,080
as hybrid ones such as primarily chaotic

639
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,059
function with noise can be present

640
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,799
concurrently at different scales of the

641
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,020
brain mind

642
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,340
or the same scale but in different

643
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,159
places or at different times I realize

644
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,200
it's a mouthful but it fits the data

645
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,659
presented in the paper

646
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,880
this is again a picture from the

647
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,700
textbook and after your inference by

648
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,559
Thomas Parr Carl friston and Giovanni

649
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,520
passulo it's a cortical column and the

650
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,580
errors you see here

651
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,500
ascending and descending connections if

652
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,000
by chance you're not familiar with the

653
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,419
framework they correspond to uh the

654
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,039
ascending errors are prediction errors

655
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,140
and descending ones are predictions this

656
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,700
is what they say in the book

657
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,380
but there's an asymmetry and message

658
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,020
passing and the reason for that is that

659
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,700
the operations required to compute

660
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,100
prediction error from expectations are

661
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,740
non-linear this non-linearity is due to

662
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,179
computation of predictions using

663
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,159
non-linear functions that tend to

664
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,640
increase the frequency of the signal

665
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,440
I'd like to talk a little bit about

666
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,780
reduction it became very fashionable and

667
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,460
sometimes silly to you know use this

668
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,080
like oh your reduction is now your

669
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,940
reduction is done the second most

670
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,740
popular term is oversimplify you'll

671
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,200
oversimplify now you oversimplifying to

672
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,179
me they're not bad words and they're

673
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,340
necessary tools to simplify and to

674
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,640
reduce uh you know the map that equals

675
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,320
the territory exactly is useless

676
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,659
nobody's going to use it it must kind of

677
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,120
I'm quoting James Glick simplify and

678
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,140
abstract

679
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,600
but you know I'll illustrate the the

680
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,039
specific term

681
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,960
if the car is moving with a fixed

682
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,940
velocity in a straight line and if I

683
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,799
know exactly where it is right now I can

684
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,600
tell with certainty where it has been an

685
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,880
hour before that is a reduction in time

686
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,400
and I can do that because the formula is

687
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,279
linear its distance equals velocity

688
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,620
multiplied by time and velocity is

689
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,640
constant

690
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,159
if the watch is broken and I disassemble

691
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,380
it and I find a faulty part and then I

692
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,240
put it back together

693
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,659
uh and it works then it's a reduction in

694
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,360
space and I can do that because watch is

695
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,059
not an ant colony to use Daniel's terms

696
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,539
which is equal to the collection of its

697
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:19,380
parts

698
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,900
so I wanted to talk about Mark your uh

699
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,640
mention of the predictive hierarchy

700
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,679
composed of billions of homeostats in

701
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,059
your in your work

702
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,460
and this is approximate picture this is

703
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,840
not the exact picture of what you talk

704
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,580
about in a new project and this is from

705
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,960
your Hidden Spring

706
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,299
it's a predictive hierarchy where

707
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,520
predictions flow from left to right and

708
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,520
prediction errors from right to left

709
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,159
and one of the statements in the book of

710
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,900
The Hidden Spring you say that brains

711
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,820
many complex functions really can

712
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,039
ultimately be reduced to a few simple

713
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,679
mechanisms like this so it appears that

714
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,100
you you know you call it reduction

715
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,679
but I just wanted it is a powerful model

716
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,600
it is a flexible model I wanted to

717
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,059
describe some features of it well first

718
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,640
of all if homeostat is present at every

719
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,799
single scale then we have this

720
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,779
homogeneity of mechanism throughout

721
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,100
these scales

722
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,020
and I want to say that in physics things

723
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,299
don't look this way quantum mechanics is

724
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,640
the microphysics statistical mechanics

725
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,159
is a molecular level Newtonian mechanics

726
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,659
is heavenly bodies and then we have

727
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,400
general theory of relativity there's

728
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,260
qualitative shifts that is in the

729
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,820
homogeneity of mechanism all the way

730
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,820
throughout in fact when people say take

731
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,620
entanglement and they apply to human

732
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,360
beings that's sort of a misunderstanding

733
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,919
or entanglement

734
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,960
uh the second comment is from Michael

735
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Levin who talks about these scales and

736
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,720
if you know his comment is that you

737
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,220
could have different functional spaces

738
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,260
at every scale where you could solve the

739
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,659
genetic task on one scale

740
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:50,100
electrochemical in another morphological

741
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,140
than the third one and then how you do

742
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,520
message passing what is the common

743
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,279
language it's not a trivial question

744
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,740
along the same lines I've already

745
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,659
mentioned that a message between the

746
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,700
scales can be non-linear if you do

747
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,039
prediction errors now if you take one

748
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,720
non-linear message and then you multiply

749
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,820
it by billions you're going to have a

750
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,860
full on turbulence which is a chaotic

751
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,080
system it's a dynamical system and

752
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,480
turbulence you cannot reduce the

753
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,400
homeostat or anything else you know

754
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,679
saying that water consists of H2O does

755
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,539
not explain turbulence

756
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,580
so I don't know that's an open question

757
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,080
but I wanted to maybe share some

758
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,220
perceptions of this model this I talked

759
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,799
about uh and this is the for instance

760
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,539
thought about phase transition and the

761
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,120
attracting set he said that if you have

762
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,980
a hierarchy of lorenza structures a

763
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,840
slower one and a faster one

764
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,520
and just lower one governing the

765
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,140
transitions of the faster lorenza

766
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,880
tractor and then you could have a pep

767
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,559
formulation with an attracting set

768
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,020
experiencing changes and transitions

769
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,179
and that's brilliant I think and it

770
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,919
matches the anatomy because the brain

771
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,539
stem and the subcortical structures

772
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,820
appear to be slower lorenza tractor that

773
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,140
could be seen as governing the

774
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,940
transitions of the cortex which is

775
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,039
astrological

776
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,020
I know I'm oversimplified things a great

777
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,360
deal but it sort of this is his thoughts

778
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,220
I think him and Lancelot Acosta are

779
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,779
working on that perhaps Maxwell

780
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,520
ramstad's group is working on that as

781
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,900
well

782
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,000
the clinical applications the landscape

783
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,320
that I've mentioned before would be

784
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,000
absolutely lovely to see if it were to

785
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,500
consider going there

786
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,960
uh borderline personality disorder or

787
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,520
another term for that could be complex

788
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,679
trauma the metaphor that we use for

789
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,299
these patients is they're predictably

790
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,399
unpredictable that the only thing we

791
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,500
know on Wednesday that we don't know

792
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,000
what's going to come up suggesting

793
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,520
characteristicity acute trauma has a

794
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,559
symptom of hyperarousal suggesting

795
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,960
possibly higher level of chaoticity an

796
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,640
onset of mania can be seen as a

797
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,260
transition into a higher energy State

798
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,059
and addiction is particularly with

799
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,500
stimulants can be seen as phase

800
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,720
transitions into a geologic state

801
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,760
it may sound like what I said now is

802
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,440
contradictory to the what I said before

803
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,020
when I suggested that you know lower

804
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,340
characteristicity could be a problem

805
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,440
such as an onset of a seizure and here

806
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,240
I'm saying higher chaoticity can be a

807
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,220
problem but that would only be a

808
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,799
contradiction in the linear world in the

809
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,539
real world where linear is very small

810
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,299
percentage of what's happening I'm

811
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,220
saying both that too little and too much

812
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,840
caves could be a problem

813
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,000
just enough chaos imbalance could be

814
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,260
perfectly fine

815
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,360
this is a graphical illustration of what

816
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,860
can be done and this is from my

817
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,720
colleague and friend David Pinkus who is

818
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,340
a professor in Chapman University and I

819
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,899
think also former president of the

820
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,559
society for chaos and psychology Society

821
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,940
these are trees and may sound like

822
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,500
completely unrelated to what we do

823
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,140
except if you look at the human lung or

824
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,679
a dendrites in a neuron and you can see

825
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,620
a healthy Tree on the right from me and

826
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,659
the nearly dead tree on the left

827
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,899
and if you do the fractal assessment

828
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,940
fractal Dimension assessment on them by

829
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,860
counting the thickness of branches and

830
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,299
count the number of branches at each

831
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:52,140
level

832
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,240
then you can quantify

833
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,399
and you then you can have approximate

834
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,140
quantification of health and resilience

835
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,240
versus you know pathology

836
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,960
and again as exotic as it may sound this

837
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,520
is very similar to what people do when

838
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,440
they detect a seizure on the AG they

839
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,360
measure CD correlational Dimension which

840
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,000
is approximately a fractal dimension

841
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,200
and

842
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,960
I think my 30 minutes are up thank you

843
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,860
so much for your attention

844
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,960
thank you Lexi gray presentation well

845
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,179
looking forward to this discussion first

846
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,179
Mark please feel free to add your

847
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,000
Reflections then Andrea then we'll

848
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,580
continue on

849
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,799
thanks very much

850
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:38,460
um

851
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,700
I when Alexi asked me if I would join

852
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,580
this panel uh the first thing that I

853
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,460
said to him was yes uh coupled with the

854
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,500
second thing being but please be aware

855
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,899
that I know next to nothing about Chaos

856
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,980
Theory so you know I'm not sure

857
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,740
how much uh of a contribution I can make

858
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,140
to a technical discussion

859
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,460
um of

860
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,200
this kind uh so I'm just repeating that

861
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,559
uh before I say anything else if I say

862
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,899
anything that sounds amateur that it

863
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,179
sounds as if this guy doesn't know what

864
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,559
he's talking about when it comes to

865
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,960
Chaos Theory it's because I'm an amateur

866
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,399
and I don't know what I'm talking about

867
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,399
when it comes to chaos theory

868
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,960
that said

869
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,899
um the second thing I want to say is I'm

870
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:31,799
not entirely sure what is at stake uh

871
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,039
here you know it seems as if Alexi feels

872
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,520
that it's really important that um that

873
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,020
I and uh our colleagues uh get our head

874
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,720
around chaos theory and bring

875
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,779
um some of its um what it has to offer

876
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,720
uh into our field

877
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,320
um because I don't know much about it I

878
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,059
don't know what's at stake you see I

879
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:01,140
don't know uh why that's important so uh

880
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,000
um you know perhaps somewhere along the

881
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,460
line in the next uh just less than an

882
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,340
hour that we have perhaps Alexi you can

883
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,980
clarify that for us

884
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,640
um the third thing I wanted to say is

885
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,620
um and perhaps in order to illustrate

886
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,640
the first thing is that as Alexi was

887
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,279
talking now it seemed as if he was

888
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,980
talking about chaos as if it were

889
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,519
synonymous with stochasticity or or

890
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,059
Randomness uh and that's not my

891
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,640
understanding my very limited

892
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,279
understanding of chaos theory was that

893
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,059
it's not a synonymous chaos as used in

894
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:45,659
that um in that science or in that

895
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,100
theory

896
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,140
um is not synonymous with with

897
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,019
Randomness it's rather synonymous with

898
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,120
unpredictability

899
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,360
um because we don't know the initial

900
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,100
conditions of the system what we can't

901
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,039
specify all the variables with

902
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,559
sufficient Precision uh in their initial

903
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,480
conditions it becomes impossible to

904
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,620
predict

905
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,719
um and and because of the nature of the

906
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,280
interrelated relationships of the

907
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,300
variables one tiny little error in your

908
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,820
estimation of the initial conditions can

909
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,699
lead to massive consequences and this is

910
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:25,739
why it's so hard to predict uh chaotic

911
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,239
systems

912
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:31,440
so if that is what is meant then I would

913
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,760
say

914
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,199
um of course this applies to the way

915
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,239
that the mind works and the way that the

916
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,800
brain works

917
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,780
um but that leads me back to my second

918
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,899
point I'm not sure what's at stake but I

919
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:47,639
would say if that's what you're asking

920
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,460
if that's what you're claiming rather uh

921
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,820
Alexi then I would say that's that

922
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,460
surely must be so that it is exceedingly

923
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,099
difficult to predict

924
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,940
um mental and neural events at any level

925
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,119
of complexity

926
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,220
um now uh I think I've said three things

927
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,619
let me now say a fourth thing

928
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,400
um I think that a crucial

929
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,280
um well let me put it this way uh of

930
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,359
course what the brain and mind are

931
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,220
trying to do

932
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,060
um

933
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,280
it's a matter of trying to predict

934
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,800
what's going to happen so when I what

935
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,540
I've just said about how how difficult

936
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,760
it is uh to predict what's going to

937
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,579
happen in the brain or mind it's it's

938
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,339
it's it's almost the same thing as to

939
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:45,000
say uh that the the mind and brain are

940
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,420
trying to model the world uh that's

941
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,220
that's the main thing that we're trying

942
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,940
to do is is is is uh have a good model

943
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,660
of the world so that we can get some

944
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,500
sort of grip uh on this chaos

945
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,119
um so that we can act rationally in the

946
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,400
sense that we can act

947
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,820
um in order to preserve ourselves that

948
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,339
we do not dissipate uh by uh just uh

949
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,940
exploring all possible States and and no

950
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,220
longer existing as a system because we

951
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,520
as systems need to remain within certain

952
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,400
bounds across a great many variables as

953
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,780
you said

954
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,820
um we can't afford to just let should

955
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,160
happen and you know and throw ourselves

956
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,660
uh uh to its uh to to to its Fates uh we

957
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,119
need to try to predict uh in a very

958
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,079
unpredictable world uh what must I do in

959
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,300
order to meet this need given how the

960
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,480
world works so the brain is trying to

961
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,900
model the world uh our predictive model

962
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,160
uh is is is trying to synchronize itself

963
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,680
with the world and for that reason it's

964
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,220
going to be very chaotic

965
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,859
um but the crucial point is it's trying

966
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:14,880
to reduce uh the unpredictability

967
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,060
um with that said uh I'll make a fifth

968
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,339
point or maybe it's another part of my

969
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,079
fourth point no I think it's a fifth

970
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,280
point which is that the way that I

971
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,800
conceptualize the predictive model and

972
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,560
it's not me alone who does this is that

973
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,260
it is a hierarchical model

974
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,480
um and I think that's very important and

975
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,480
perhaps here's where things do start

976
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,180
where it starts to um at least in my

977
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,820
mind I start to see some of what's at

978
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,200
stake

979
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,200
um I I think that the more peripheral

980
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,380
layers of the predictive model I see the

981
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,440
predictive model as a as a not as a

982
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,500
triangle but rather as an onion so the

983
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,099
core that is the the deepest layers of

984
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,740
the model that is to say

985
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,280
um the the layers that have the um the

986
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,240
greatest

987
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,280
um spatial and temporal generalizability

988
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,500
um and they're the most stable layers of

989
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,839
the model and as we move toward the

990
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,520
periphery which coincides with the

991
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,660
periphery

992
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,180
um of the of the nervous system in other

993
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,520
words the encounter with the outside

994
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,020
world

995
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,680
um

996
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,520
so it becomes more chaotic we are able

997
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,579
to we can tolerate

998
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,280
um more unpredictability at the

999
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,839
periphery uh and uh we we're trying to

1000
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,720
and that's and that also allows for

1001
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,420
greater accuracy because the world is so

1002
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,579
unpredictable we have a more more

1003
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,579
chaotic uh um outer layer of our

1004
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:57,300
predictive model where where things also

1005
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,160
there's less that's at stake you know is

1006
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,540
that car going to turn left or right

1007
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,980
well I thought it was going to turn left

1008
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,260
turn right so what doesn't matter you

1009
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,339
know but

1010
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:07,380
um it is the law going to is the car

1011
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,300
going to obey the laws of gravity that

1012
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,400
that matters more you know that's not

1013
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,760
something uh that that's a a much more

1014
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,280
consequential surprise uh if it if it

1015
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,420
does not

1016
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,060
um and perhaps that's a silly uh analogy

1017
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,859
but at least it demonstrates the general

1018
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,880
Point our most heartfelt beliefs

1019
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,020
um and um uh that is to say the deepest

1020
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,000
layers of our of our predictive

1021
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,720
hierarchy there we find the same

1022
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,300
patterns over and again and we we we we

1023
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,020
find ourselves we we are more certain

1024
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,099
um of our predictions and we act more

1025
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:48,440
stereotypically in accordance with them

1026
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,040
uh whereas uh at the periphery uh that

1027
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,220
does not apply so I think um at one

1028
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,280
point in your presentation Alexi you you

1029
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,500
were saying something like you know one

1030
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,240
size doesn't fit all it's not all just

1031
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,000
one mechanism all the way down uh of

1032
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,400
course I completely agree with that

1033
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,619
um the the the it's not just one

1034
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,260
mechanism and the different homeostats

1035
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,640
that you were referring to on their

1036
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,800
different scales are also serving

1037
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,480
different needs you know and there's

1038
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,940
there's not a common currency uh I I

1039
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,880
think that's a very important part of um

1040
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,280
of how Consciousness works why we have

1041
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,619
qualier at all is because we can't

1042
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,420
introduce things to a common currency

1043
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,079
we're dealing with categorical variables

1044
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:35,640
at the very least in relation to our

1045
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,680
bodily needs they are categorically

1046
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,900
distinct needs and they need to be

1047
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,700
treated as such and this is why we have

1048
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,619
different feelings in relation to these

1049
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,200
different uh categories of of free

1050
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,099
energy

1051
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,339
so um those are those are some of the

1052
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:51,420
main things

1053
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,640
um I I wanted to say just to get the

1054
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,800
ball rolling I'm mindful of the fact

1055
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,400
that Andrea clarichi uh only has uh 15

1056
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,119
more minutes with us so um maybe we can

1057
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,980
pick I can pick up on some other points

1058
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,460
later uh but at this stage let me hand

1059
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,560
over to Andrea thank you

1060
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,380
can you hear me now

1061
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,859
yes sorry I will try also to articulate

1062
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,920
something of the very fascinating paper

1063
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,820
of Alexia I must confess since I'm also

1064
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,980
a psychonalytic psychotherapist a

1065
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,920
psychiatrist it's not my field I'm not a

1066
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,460
physicist so I can really say a few

1067
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,680
words

1068
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,560
some is of as I said already Fascination

1069
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,119
because in general I hate to stick to

1070
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,619
rigid theories so if there is a paper

1071
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:02,520
like Alexia who can counter size my

1072
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,660
theories even in psychoanalysis

1073
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,460
in the workings of the mind and the

1074
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,420
Brain I'm happy to to to to to dive into

1075
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,619
it

1076
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,700
at the same time uh I unders I I don't

1077
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,880
have the skills to to to to discuss the

1078
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,359
the math part of his papers or even the

1079
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:27,420
the physical formulas and so on

1080
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,839
but I was reminded of a very early and

1081
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,900
you I think you all know that book uh

1082
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,260
Jacques monod chants a necessity which

1083
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,720
is a classic

1084
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,260
and I think it's a book in which you uh

1085
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,579
you can

1086
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:47,220
from from scratch I mean here that we

1087
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,300
our aim in the world and I I I'm I know

1088
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,839
I'm talk I'm sounding

1089
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,500
teleological but we have theological uh

1090
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,180
um teleological uh AIMS in order to stay

1091
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:07,260
alive we have to face chance and cows so

1092
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,700
I think this is

1093
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,240
uh in order to survive and reproduce we

1094
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,060
have to uh have a mathematical system to

1095
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,660
reduce chaos and to bring up again the

1096
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,780
terminism or psychic determinism since

1097
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,859
one of the of the points that lexier I

1098
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:33,060
think raised is do can this can we still

1099
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,359
hold the point of Freud's about psychic

1100
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:37,859
determinism

1101
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:40,800
and I think if you apply not to the

1102
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,280
physics of of just materialism of of of

1103
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,280
things actually but to the living

1104
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,859
organism I think we do this is my point

1105
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:56,640
and I I would like to uh to

1106
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,420
hear what Alexia says in the end

1107
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,440
the chaos theory mathematics

1108
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,140
as far as I understand it must be in

1109
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,819
mathematics who reduce chance or chaos

1110
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:15,359
to uh to a linearity at least in the in

1111
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,920
the living organism

1112
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,980
and I and I wonder if

1113
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,400
and what Alexei thinks about it

1114
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,560
because you seems to disagree with that

1115
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,920
want to give a direct response Lexi or

1116
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,079
pen brain and Albert be awesome to hear

1117
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,420
your takes as well some of the thoughts

1118
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,700
from Mark and from Andrea

1119
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,800
today she started by responding to

1120
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,640
Andreas Owen's remarks or

1121
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,440
yeah

1122
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,720
maybe I'll start by because I think the

1123
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,700
key point that Mark you brought up is

1124
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,280
what's at stake is still unclear my

1125
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,839
impression isn't please correct me if

1126
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,880
I'm wrong I was very influenced marked

1127
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,800
by your paper I forgot exactly the

1128
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,060
journal where you talked about

1129
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,060
Psychiatry world how these sort of you

1130
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,160
know convention-based diagnosis of fear

1131
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,960
is a major depressive disorder here's a

1132
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,240
bipolar disorder nothing which has to do

1133
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,300
with etiology you know uh convention and

1134
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,400
statistics you know and then you brought

1135
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,200
up this you know revolutionary thing

1136
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,819
with effective Neuroscience where you

1137
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:20,040
talked about the manic State and the

1138
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,560
depression State and you know tied into

1139
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,660
the punk step system I think is

1140
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,880
extraordinary but what I wanted to say

1141
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,440
is you know if we look at how we

1142
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,060
diagnose and think about what's

1143
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,920
happening and we look at the language of

1144
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,440
how we do it it is still a deterministic

1145
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,900
language at the end of the day so when

1146
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,300
we move from dsm-4 to DSM-5 we

1147
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,040
brilliantly discovered that continuous

1148
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,200
variables exist we used to have buckets

1149
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,420
everything was in a separate bucket and

1150
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,040
then we said autism as a spectrum and

1151
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,960
everybody applaud it but you know

1152
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,700
mathematicians were quietly laughing in

1153
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,079
the corner you know because of course

1154
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,720
continuous variables exist and but we

1155
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,940
don't do Dynamics we're still very

1156
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,579
static here's this clear-cut thing and

1157
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:01,200
this is the clear-cut continuous thing

1158
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,660
right and I'm my impression I may be

1159
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,300
wrong is that even in in our

1160
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,260
neuropsychonalytic developments we still

1161
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,480
do things deterministically we assess

1162
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,339
which bucket things belong to maybe two

1163
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:12,780
buckets at the same time or three

1164
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,480
buckets but we don't do things like

1165
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,940
you know how the chaotic systems are

1166
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,680
qualitatively different from aesthetic

1167
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,200
things I'm quoting William Solis they

1168
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,660
have transients they have contextuality

1169
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,520
and they have emergence

1170
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,240
we don't do that you know and uh I think

1171
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,040
that if we embrace the chaos theory if

1172
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,240
we do things like correlational

1173
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,400
Dimension assessment or fractal

1174
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,740
Dimension assessment starting from this

1175
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,480
system of classification of emotions

1176
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,520
they're still buckets here is a

1177
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,440
clear-cut thing called fear and that's a

1178
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,300
clear-cut thing called rage buckets

1179
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,540
determinism okay and you know they look

1180
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,220
differently in the dynamical systems

1181
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,380
world and then the system of

1182
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,359
Psychopathology could look like you know

1183
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:57,000
correlational Dimension changed and not

1184
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,280
that somebody fell into a bucket you

1185
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,960
know if we look at this complex you know

1186
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,760
landscape of attractors and repellers

1187
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,400
and examine psychodynamic things like

1188
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,520
please forgive me if I'm incorrect uh um

1189
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,619
but one of the possible definitions of

1190
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,540
repression could be seen as not letting

1191
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,880
things into Consciousness maybe we can

1192
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,380
call it suppression but what I'm trying

1193
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,300
to say is I don't want to think that

1194
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,359
right now it hurts it's a painful thing

1195
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:23,160
that in in the terminology that I shared

1196
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,619
is a repeller and perhaps when you work

1197
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,300
through things in a Dynamic

1198
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,700
psychotherapy perhaps you put a scar

1199
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,099
tissue on the wound it becomes less of a

1200
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,920
Sharp you know uh repeller and it

1201
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,119
Smooths out

1202
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,940
you know we don't talk we don't diagnose

1203
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,380
like that we don't trip like that we

1204
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,700
don't think like that

1205
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,920
uh one paper that I'm working on that is

1206
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,420
in in peer review right now and I can't

1207
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,940
share too much says that you know we

1208
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,160
think like storytellers I'm quoting

1209
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,680
Daniel kahnemann our our you know think

1210
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,300
in Mind of a clinician is not a

1211
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,700
statistician we don't think in

1212
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,400
probabilities we think in labels and we

1213
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,560
think in stories and I know you have

1214
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,720
this powerful quote mark from Freud who

1215
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,920
said that that's the nature of the mind

1216
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,200
and I most respectfully disagree that

1217
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,240
that's the entire nature of the mind I

1218
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,859
do think that we have things on the mind

1219
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:14,040
that are not stories and not words so

1220
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,260
ain't the nature of the phenomena is

1221
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,020
chaotic and stochastic and periodic then

1222
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,599
we can use appropriate mechanisms to

1223
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,480
diagnose and classify uh that fits the

1224
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,579
the nature of the model

1225
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,380
the second thing you said case is

1226
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,359
stochasticity I absolutely agree with

1227
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,040
you that they're different you know the

1228
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,200
chart that I've shown if you converge to

1229
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,619
a stable uh stochastic chaos is

1230
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,020
deterministic for a deterministic so if

1231
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,300
initial conditions are changing they

1232
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,520
will diverge but you can predict things

1233
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,280
forward not back but uh there is no

1234
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,200
formula in a stochastic thing you know

1235
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,640
you throw the coin you don't know you

1236
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,440
have no predictability whatsoever short

1237
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,079
term or third or long term so they are

1238
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,819
different and in the sense that you're

1239
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:58,319
talking to sensitivity to initial

1240
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,540
conditions this is music to my heart to

1241
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,160
hear you to say that you acknowledge

1242
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,560
that irriticity clearly is present of

1243
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,720
the brain on which level of the

1244
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,280
hierarchy in your model is a very

1245
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,319
important thing but again when we draw

1246
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,420
this picture whether it's a triangle or

1247
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,819
an onion with a core and layers it's a

1248
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:15,900
static model

1249
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,460
now when you acknowledge that there's

1250
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,900
higher and predictability toward the

1251
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,119
periphery it could be but there could be

1252
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,740
Dynamics about the structure of the

1253
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,780
model and perhaps what you're saying is

1254
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,240
survival you know like I must breathe

1255
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,060
and I must breathe air and I'm not in

1256
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,680
the water and that is a very stable

1257
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,260
prediction absolutely but when we deal

1258
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,880
with Psychopathology and we deal with

1259
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,400
things like shame and pride and awe and

1260
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,400
other things then I wonder if we should

1261
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,619
continue to use this metaphor of

1262
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,540
homeostat I really don't see how

1263
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,819
homeostat applies to gamma rhythm in the

1264
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,760
brain or to shame

1265
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,040
so and homeostat is is the convergent

1266
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,859
systems so that you you minimize entity

1267
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,780
by keeping things in the rage however if

1268
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,520
you dive inside the homeostat if you

1269
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,079
look at the temperature variation inside

1270
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:03,900
our narrow range you may see chaos which

1271
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,900
is exactly the picture that I saw so

1272
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,819
um that I showed um

1273
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,980
hmm

1274
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,700
and to Andrea's point is about the

1275
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,380
Freud's principle of psychic determinism

1276
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,180
yes I almost was thinking that we

1277
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,700
haven't said goodbye to that we haven't

1278
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,760
tried to say that chance exists in the

1279
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,540
mental life accidents exist we don't do

1280
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,380
that

1281
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,540
there's a firm tradition in and

1282
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,160
psychonautic Psychotherapy to say

1283
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,200
there's no accidents it's all determined

1284
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,240
that's a major key point of the

1285
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,200
discussion

1286
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,060
I don't know if I said too much

1287
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,339
maybe Andrea if you want to give any

1288
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:46,380
yes or how do you how do you want things

1289
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,940
to continue in the coming minutes and

1290
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,720
years okay thank you thank you Daniel uh

1291
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,880
just adding a word that I didn't use

1292
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,559
because I think it's very important

1293
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,380
about trying to defend the point about

1294
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,740
psychic determinism which I'm I'm very

1295
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,520
fond of I mean the word is adaptation I

1296
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,180
have difficulties in because when you

1297
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,700
see a psychotic patient when you see a

1298
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,920
borderline patient well I don't see

1299
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,300
chaos or total unpredictability idea the

1300
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,940
adaptation

1301
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,160
their disruptions

1302
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,720
uh I I try to to to to to understand

1303
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,180
what are the even the mathematics the

1304
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,839
mathematical part be behind that

1305
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,880
in my opinion has to have a

1306
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,680
tendency to over an order which is

1307
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,480
adaptive in this way I see uh the the

1308
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,780
mathematical part of of chaos may be of

1309
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,839
use I mean but bringing

1310
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,079
uh to an explanation not to maybe not to

1311
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,220
an order or to a determinism but to a

1312
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,920
point in which uh there must be this

1313
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,920
adaptive reason even in the chaos

1314
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,980
do you see my point

1315
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,619
I do but I think there's a deeper issue

1316
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:12,660
about how we think you know say there's

1317
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,460
a clinician psychologic psychotherapist

1318
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,160
we have a work in memory and The

1319
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,900
Miller's law that Mark you quote a lot

1320
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,540
about the seven units of information uh

1321
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,339
in the auditor what a verbal work in

1322
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:24,960
memory I think in The Miller's paper he

1323
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,540
actually said seven chunks so I'm

1324
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,460
sharing something from the paper in

1325
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,500
review right now we cannot think

1326
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,359
probabilistically because it overloads

1327
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,640
the working memory this is why when I'm

1328
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,559
a clinician I think about psychosis I

1329
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:40,079
come up with a story a formulation that

1330
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,000
fits in the working memory and this

1331
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,220
influences our work we don't have the

1332
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,780
mathematics in here to think in the

1333
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,880
terms of probabilistic things and Chaos

1334
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,160
Theory and other things we need tools to

1335
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,140
do that and in mainstream neurology they

1336
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,940
use tools they do talk to the patient

1337
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,680
that examine the patient but they have

1338
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,319
MRI they have ehe they have pestican and

1339
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,000
all the other things inside chronic

1340
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,559
Psychotherapy will say we don't need any

1341
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:03,960
tools we just talk to a person that is

1342
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,119
sufficient for everything we do but

1343
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,740
that's not necessarily true the entries

1344
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,619
be B who is a psychoanalyst works with

1345
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:12,839
Mother infant diet and there's zero

1346
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,599
words exchanged zilch but she looks at

1347
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,220
this movie that she records on a video

1348
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,440
camera and then she throws it shows it

1349
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,619
in a slow motion so she takes the flow

1350
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,780
which is dynamic flow not words not

1351
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,000
discrete things and then she slows it

1352
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,680
down and she slows the level of

1353
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,540
Attunement between the mother and the

1354
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,559
child

1355
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:33,660
we don't do things like that

1356
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,540
we talk and we use these deterministic

1357
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,220
things to understand the Psychopathology

1358
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,319
of the patients in not psychosis and

1359
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,240
that's schizophrenia and that is bipolar

1360
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,980
one this Hispanic system and this is

1361
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,260
seeking system we determinize everything

1362
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,660
and that is a limitation because inside

1363
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,760
I believe what is a fear Cascade how

1364
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,680
does Fear stop it's a flow it's a

1365
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,440
turbulent thing and we put one label in

1366
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,740
it say fear we've classified it so for

1367
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,119
some things it's appropriate but for

1368
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:01,980
some things it may not be it may be you

1369
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,980
know as as you know Einstein said as

1370
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,960
Mark you quoted Einstein as simple as

1371
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,900
possible but more simpler than that so

1372
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,420
at which point we are missing with or

1373
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,800
missing the phenomenon by using

1374
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,619
deterministic Tools in our work

1375
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:19,559
thank you thank you thank you Daniel and

1376
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:22,020
Mark to everyone thank you I have to go

1377
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,760
awesome

1378
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,099
so Albert

1379
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:29,160
and then Brennan will continue on this

1380
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,079
topic

1381
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:31,859
um

1382
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:33,839
yeah thank you for the presentation and

1383
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,480
a very interesting discussion so far

1384
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,980
um one thing that comes to mind is the

1385
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,900
um

1386
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,940
the the well

1387
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,380
the thing we're talking about right now

1388
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,140
the psychic determinism as as uh

1389
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,240
depicted as being a foundational line

1390
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,520
psychoanalysis

1391
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,240
um

1392
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,920
well I'm thinking about the authors the

1393
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,020
psychoanalytic authors who came The

1394
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,599
prominent ones who came after Freud

1395
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,200
uh who seem to have uh

1396
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,960
uh who have room

1397
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,140
or this this chaos maybe they didn't use

1398
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,240
this term

1399
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,380
explicitly but I'm thinking for example

1400
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,839
Wilfred Beyond who's got the notion of

1401
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,180
the O layer

1402
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,300
um which has connotations of uh well the

1403
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,500
thing that

1404
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,680
I cannot be known or categorized who has

1405
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,020
like in indeterminate elements of the

1406
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,700
mind and that's one of his major

1407
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,440
contributions contributions to

1408
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,420
psychoanalysis on the other hand the

1409
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,740
more the French schools I'm thinking of

1410
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,480
Jack Lacon who's got the notion of the

1411
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,160
real which is also one of his major

1412
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,140
contributions contributions to

1413
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,140
psychoanalysis where Notions of rupture

1414
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:46,220
of absence or of lack are very prominent

1415
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:49,079
I'm not sure I'm not an expert here but

1416
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,540
I think

1417
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,000
explicitly uh challenges the notion of

1418
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,819
Freud's mechanistic worldview in one of

1419
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:58,200
its seminars

1420
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,599
so I'm wondering what you think about

1421
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,680
this Alexei

1422
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,380
hey I'm not an expert in lacan at all

1423
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,319
and I know Wilfred Beyond in a limited

1424
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,559
fashion so perhaps Mark is a better

1425
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:18,059
person to to to uh to talk and I I like

1426
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:19,859
for it particularly it marks

1427
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,839
interpretations and translations but

1428
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,760
maybe Mark can comment on lacan and

1429
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,520
Beyond I I'm not sufficiently

1430
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,079
knowledgeable about that they work

1431
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,599
if you want to mark

1432
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,880
or Brin you can share some thoughts yeah

1433
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,119
please

1434
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:45,380
um well I think that uh um the the point

1435
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,420
that Elder is making that is we must

1436
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,760
remember that psychoanalysis is not

1437
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,680
synonymous with Freud

1438
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,280
um that not everything in psychoanalysis

1439
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,619
stands or Falls by whether or not we

1440
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,680
accept this or that tended to Freud's

1441
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,640
um and uh in neuropsychoanalysis we try

1442
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,300
very much to draw upon all of the

1443
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,119
Traditions uh within psychoanalysis and

1444
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:15,420
we we sort of uh fondly believe that

1445
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,839
we'll be able to find more a common

1446
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:21,059
ground because they are greater

1447
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:23,000
empirical tools available in

1448
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,480
neuropsychoanalysis than in

1449
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,180
psychoanalysis by itself you know we're

1450
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,660
we're hoping to resolve some of these uh

1451
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,059
theoretical disagreements trying to move

1452
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:35,400
Beyond just different systems of belief

1453
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,780
trying to move more toward a a

1454
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,339
psychoanalysis in which we can decide

1455
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:43,319
questions in an ordinary scientific way

1456
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:46,079
but it will always be very difficult for

1457
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,319
exactly the reason that Alexis whole

1458
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,900
talk is about I suppose which is you

1459
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,500
know the the extreme complexity uh and

1460
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,059
therefore

1461
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:00,300
um unpredictability uh of the of the

1462
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,700
phenomena that we're dealing with

1463
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:06,119
um so I think Albert's points are valid

1464
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:11,460
uh that uh the Beyond's approach lacon's

1465
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,660
approach

1466
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,839
um they they add a great deal that they

1467
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,660
they don't um they don't

1468
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,260
um have as much to to lose if we throw

1469
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,640
out the principle of psychical

1470
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,140
determinism

1471
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:26,700
um but having said that let me just

1472
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,440
quickly say a word about psychical

1473
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,079
determinism because this has been a a

1474
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:34,260
big part of what uh Andrea picked up on

1475
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,900
on in what Alexi said

1476
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,980
um I I think it comes down to the the

1477
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,900
the question that I asked at the outset

1478
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,140
it's not a matter of is the behavior of

1479
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,799
the Mind random uh or uh it's it's a

1480
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:52,260
it's a question of how predictable uh

1481
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,359
it's not a matter of is there no

1482
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:57,420
determinism it's a matter of how easily

1483
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,240
can we Trace effects back to their

1484
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,619
causes

1485
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:03,599
um so the fact that there's a great deal

1486
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,599
that goes on where we can't do that uh

1487
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:08,220
there are many things our patients say

1488
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,380
whether they be slips of the tongue or

1489
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,599
anything else of that kind and not only

1490
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:15,720
to do with parapraxes but anything that

1491
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,640
they do you know there's certain things

1492
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,880
that we see with regularity I mean the

1493
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,920
very phenomenon of transference is all

1494
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,559
about regularities that there's certain

1495
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:27,720
things that we see Yep this size this I

1496
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,420
pre this I I can understand

1497
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:35,099
um this happens repeatedly uh I I I I

1498
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:37,799
think I can explain that with reference

1499
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:40,920
to uh certain aspects of the patients in

1500
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,140
a world and and their past but there's a

1501
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,480
great deal else that we can't so I don't

1502
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,819
think that it's a kind of you know

1503
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:51,420
either there's determinism or there's or

1504
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,660
there's a statisticity I think that

1505
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,940
there's this is why I was talking also

1506
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,980
about the layers of the predictive

1507
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,740
hierarchy that the the deeper layers or

1508
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,319
the unconscious ones their things are

1509
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,559
pretty pretty stereotyped

1510
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:11,119
um pretty pretty predictable in fact

1511
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,380
too predictable I mean in other words

1512
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,619
it's over generalizes it it's it it's

1513
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:19,559
it's too confident about its beliefs

1514
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:21,900
um but as we head toward uh the

1515
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,760
pre-conscious and conscious peripheries

1516
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,619
you know their things are much less

1517
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:27,599
predictable

1518
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,839
um so that that's I I won't say more

1519
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:32,660
about this a couple of things in what

1520
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,280
Alexi said in his uh in his comments

1521
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,440
after mine that that if we have time

1522
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,540
I'll come back to you but I I think

1523
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:42,119
let's rather hear from from Bryn before

1524
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,020
I I say anything more yeah I think thank

1525
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,040
you so much

1526
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,099
um I I I'm perhaps the least qualified

1527
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:52,500
here to to comment on your on your paper

1528
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,440
uh Alexi um but I do have one or two

1529
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,140
thoughts and they they come from a place

1530
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,960
of being

1531
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,180
very fortunate uh thus far in my life to

1532
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,880
have been a patient from for many many

1533
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,380
hours

1534
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,520
um

1535
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,880
um sometimes on the couch and also to be

1536
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,339
a clinical psychologist I failed to

1537
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:15,900
mention that at the at the in my

1538
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,839
introduction so I'm I'm a clinician I

1539
01:01:18,839 --> 01:01:22,559
was a until recently uh when my foray

1540
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,299
began into more

1541
01:01:24,299 --> 01:01:27,420
um research based areas and by the

1542
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,020
active uh inference Institute and Mark's

1543
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,540
Work and uh and and and and and called

1544
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,480
Kristen's work I was a a pure clinician

1545
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,640
I had it in my mind that I was going to

1546
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,460
treat Psychopathology to the best of my

1547
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,640
ability and but really it was being a

1548
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,160
patience first and foremost that brought

1549
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,760
me into closer contact with the the

1550
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,099
theme of your paper and certainly the

1551
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:56,160
themes of Mark's Work

1552
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,200
um and

1553
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,099
um

1554
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:00,960
I think I've encountered it from both

1555
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,559
areas and it certainly

1556
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:05,460
um

1557
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,500
it matters to to my mind it matters less

1558
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:13,140
the inner workings of the degree to

1559
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:17,220
which uh chaos a stochastic uh all these

1560
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,280
big wonderful terms that that I'm only

1561
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:25,500
beginning to to even think about but

1562
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,660
um oh

1563
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:32,099
what what's what matters to me is that

1564
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:34,920
how do you help somebody

1565
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,700
uh who is in a in a state who comes in

1566
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,760
disheveled and and and you know how does

1567
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,059
one go about helping uh aiding somebody

1568
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:46,920
in that state

1569
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,579
um I have um fell out of love with

1570
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:54,660
psychoanalysis uh for for personal

1571
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:55,980
reasons

1572
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,700
um but it was in returning to it I've

1573
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,440
become more kind of a better acquainted

1574
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,420
with its strengths and its limitations

1575
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:06,359
and I'm realizing that

1576
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:08,220
it's um

1577
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:12,180
it's that when you help somebody and

1578
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:15,000
manage to reduce the noise to reduce uh

1579
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,460
the chaos in somebody's mind

1580
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,480
um that they that when they become the

1581
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,740
greater degrees of Health start

1582
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:26,339
returning to them that they they do rely

1583
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:28,740
far more whether they know it or not on

1584
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:32,339
probabilistic reasoning in their daily

1585
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:34,980
um kind of functioning

1586
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,900
um and so I think there is a strong case

1587
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:42,359
to be made for a mathematical uh way of

1588
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:44,579
processing the world it doesn't have to

1589
01:03:44,579 --> 01:03:46,740
necessarily be conscious made conscious

1590
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,180
to the person

1591
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,720
um it can be a bit overwhelming to uh to

1592
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,799
try and impart that on somebody but um I

1593
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:58,559
think a brain that is not working

1594
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,799
properly uh regardless of the degree to

1595
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:03,900
which there is chaos that can be

1596
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,900
measured or quantifiably uh measured in

1597
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,599
that brain somebody isn't is tripping

1598
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,000
over themselves because they

1599
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,180
um they've they are unable to predict

1600
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,240
what might happen and and that is a

1601
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,920
terrifying Prospect because I think

1602
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,460
there is a some Reliance and some some

1603
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,079
staunch dependability on the the fact

1604
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:26,819
that the sun is going to rise and that

1605
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:28,859
it's going to set and that I can then

1606
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:32,040
focus on other things uh um

1607
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,920
so that's just the my comments more from

1608
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,380
kind of a personal front of being a a

1609
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,200
patient uh and and encountering the

1610
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,180
limitations of psychotherapy and what

1611
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,740
what I would have

1612
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,839
what I would have done in those moments

1613
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:51,540
of need to have not as you say had a

1614
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,540
more a deterministic view of what was

1615
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,299
happening and I've tried to

1616
01:04:57,299 --> 01:04:58,980
um transfer that or carry that over

1617
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,020
rightly or wrongly

1618
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,079
um into my own therapy as a

1619
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,160
psychotherapist as

1620
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:05,940
um

1621
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,980
um so a more personal thing of what it

1622
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,319
means to be to feel chaotic and what I

1623
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,960
see regardless of how confirmed it is

1624
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,059
um you know or not

1625
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,180
um but but chaos Reigns and and it's to

1626
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,339
try and

1627
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:25,260
not compound that uh it's certainly

1628
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,740
something that um I'm interested in

1629
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,859
so yeah thank you Bryn

1630
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:33,900
I'll also give my thought on what's at

1631
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:36,740
stake and what's on the table as a total

1632
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:40,020
non-clination but what I saw in Alexis

1633
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,720
paper and also what I see people coming

1634
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,040
towards

1635
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,540
I see the paper as Alexi making a a real

1636
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,660
stable of concept or portfolio of topics

1637
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,940
ranging from the first principles of

1638
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,920
active inference like surprise bounding

1639
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,400
to Dynamic stochastic chaotic which is

1640
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,280
not the same thing but they sometimes

1641
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,160
cohabitate so bringing a set of Concepts

1642
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,799
into play making it matter for the field

1643
01:06:07,799 --> 01:06:09,960
so that it can matter for the clinician

1644
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,119
so that it can matter for the patient

1645
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:13,740
which is where you totally brought it

1646
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:17,700
home to Bryn and in my totally

1647
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,119
simplified model I was seeing all this

1648
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,240
diagnostic Machinery from personalized

1649
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,240
data EEG recordings all these surveys

1650
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,619
and samples all the different

1651
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,839
conversation therapy itself all these

1652
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:33,240
different measurements inference

1653
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,039
and then it passes through the Markov

1654
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,619
blanket of the diagnosis and it's like

1655
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,559
well now we know that that person is X

1656
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,119
or the half X

1657
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:45,059
and then here's where we now Branch back

1658
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:47,400
out with the modalities of of treatment

1659
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,319
and so that bottlenecking has obvious

1660
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:51,839
relevance in terms of like getting a

1661
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,599
categorical grip on what we basically

1662
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:58,319
all agree are wet wear complex systems

1663
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,640
they're sensitive to initial conditions

1664
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,720
all of that

1665
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,980
and

1666
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,780
what if though like you brought up the

1667
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,180
example with a scar tissue maybe it's

1668
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,700
literal bodily Scar Tissue maybe it's

1669
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,280
conceptual Scar Tissue what if that

1670
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,220
inference were able to be understood in

1671
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,859
the context of an attractor landscape

1672
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:19,740
and it's not just a singular attractor

1673
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:22,799
so we have multiple tractors

1674
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:24,960
we have a chaotic landscape

1675
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,420
and so what if we were able to

1676
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,980
um perforate that blanket speaking super

1677
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,400
Loosely to bring in what we have already

1678
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,339
recognized as diagnostically relevant

1679
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,740
like the fact that patients who have

1680
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,960
differential entropy have this or that

1681
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,140
epileptic outcome or a coma outcome

1682
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,539
bring in that Machinery that led to the

1683
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:50,339
diagnosis but now take it beyond the

1684
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:53,460
diagnosis and maybe even beyond the

1685
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,400
clinicians concept directly into the

1686
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,359
hands of the patient

1687
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,720
but

1688
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,859
thank you so much perhaps we can hear

1689
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:10,680
from Mark and yeah I am not eager to

1690
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,420
talk I'll if there is time I'll say

1691
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:15,619
something but if not that's okay

1692
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,819
um well let me first of all say

1693
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:20,339
something about my

1694
01:08:20,339 --> 01:08:22,799
um screen you might some of you have

1695
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,420
noticed that suddenly everything went

1696
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:27,420
black behind me that's because I had I'm

1697
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,040
in South Africa where they have power

1698
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,179
problems and then um a kind person in my

1699
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:34,738
household thought that they would help

1700
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:37,259
and they've put this huge Spotlight here

1701
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:41,640
which is shining in my eyes and uh

1702
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,979
um so um if if I if I look as if I'm in

1703
01:08:45,979 --> 01:08:48,600
a rabbit in headlights it's because I am

1704
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,359
I sent a text message saying please come

1705
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,040
and remove this big lamp you put here

1706
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,899
but they don't seem to have received the

1707
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:56,399
message

1708
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:00,238
um now back to our our actual uh topic

1709
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:03,479
um to the extent that I'm able to not be

1710
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:06,899
distracted from it I think that um that

1711
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,759
when I asked

1712
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:11,520
um uh Alexi what was at stake

1713
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,479
um his main answer uh was to do with a

1714
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:17,580
diagnosis now I don't mean that he's

1715
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,259
saying that that's all that's at stake

1716
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:21,060
but I think he's saying this illustrates

1717
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,460
what's at stake

1718
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:26,399
um so I want to first of all make sure

1719
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,040
that because I'm not sure who our

1720
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,420
audience is and who's going to be

1721
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:34,219
watching this in case anybody uh is

1722
01:09:34,219 --> 01:09:37,198
misunderstands uh I want to make clear

1723
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,979
that in psychoanalysis we've long ago

1724
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:44,460
moved away from DSM and ICD type

1725
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:48,600
diagnosis uh we we we always thought

1726
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,299
that um the the the nosology uh the the

1727
01:09:53,299 --> 01:09:56,900
psychiatric nursology was was who really

1728
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:01,260
artificial and created divisions where

1729
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,020
they don't exist in nature and we

1730
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,320
replaced it with a far more Dynamic

1731
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,480
approach to diagnosis and it's not just

1732
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,000
a matter of labeling it's a matter also

1733
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,980
of what kind of thought process lies

1734
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,739
behind the diagnosis in other words

1735
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:18,080
conceptualizing what's going on here

1736
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,000
rather than saying this is a an instance

1737
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,480
of personality disorder and I'll specify

1738
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,520
which type you know we don't think like

1739
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,100
that in psychoanalysis and and really we

1740
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,659
never have

1741
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:34,679
um in neuropsychoanalysis uh the the we

1742
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:37,679
we build in that same tradition

1743
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,580
um I think that what Alexia was uh was

1744
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,980
worrying about is he's he's saying yeah

1745
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:47,820
but you know you use you use systems uh

1746
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,159
you you say that there's this very

1747
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:52,800
there's a certain number of drives

1748
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,620
um and you use those to pass what you

1749
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,300
seeing clinically

1750
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,880
and yes we do

1751
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,520
um and we have to because you can't just

1752
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,500
say what I'm seeing is chaos you know

1753
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,600
what you've got to say is well what I'm

1754
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,120
seeing is chaos but let me try my best

1755
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,420
to find the deeper structure of this uh

1756
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,760
and so what we do is much the same as

1757
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,140
what I was saying earlier about how

1758
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,179
brain and mind work likewise the

1759
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:20,460
clinician's mind works that way we have

1760
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:23,280
some deeper Concepts uh that organize

1761
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,000
what we see and then more on the surface

1762
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,840
uh we we we see uh the the complexity

1763
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,460
you know in other words we don't think

1764
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,060
that we can reduce a patient just to one

1765
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:37,920
saying this patient has problems with

1766
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,719
this drive or something it's not as

1767
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:41,640
simple as that of course but we do start

1768
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,500
with saying well these are the drives

1769
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,920
these are the attractors uh to put it uh

1770
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,260
in terms of the attractor landscape that

1771
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:52,199
you're talking about these are the these

1772
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,120
are the preferred States

1773
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,760
um of the of the human phenotype you

1774
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,219
know and and in mental life too they are

1775
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:01,380
preferred States there's certain there's

1776
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,140
certain attractors uh that that we're

1777
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,460
trying to

1778
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,620
um

1779
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:10,140
stay in those in those um like for

1780
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:13,560
example uh if fear we want to be safe we

1781
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,960
don't want to feel fear uh you know with

1782
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,360
respect to attachment bonding we want to

1783
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,360
stay close to our uh to our attachment

1784
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,580
figures we don't want to lose them with

1785
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,219
respect to rage we we don't want to be

1786
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:28,560
frustrated and have things standing in

1787
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,840
our way we want to we want to be able to

1788
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,060
have free access to the objects of our

1789
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,820
needs and so on you know those are these

1790
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,520
attractors and you know we we have great

1791
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,280
difficulty staying in those in those

1792
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,400
homeostatic bounds and uh so you know

1793
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,460
it's a it is a dynamic a picture and

1794
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,500
then it's a quick over over the question

1795
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,199
of the of the different drives there's

1796
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:54,420
the the highly individualized predictive

1797
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,340
model that each one of us comes up with

1798
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,980
in relay relation to those drives and in

1799
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,780
relation to the conflicts between those

1800
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:05,520
drives and so on so I think that um that

1801
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,940
this way of thinking that we use in

1802
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:11,040
psychoanalysis and neuropsychoanalysis

1803
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,640
is already of the kind that Alex is

1804
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,460
calling for so I think that what Daniels

1805
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,800
just said is that it therefore perhaps

1806
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,520
uh very important to make clear uh it's

1807
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,100
that that he's offering us a language an

1808
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,920
additional language an additional I

1809
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,780
don't just mean language I should say an

1810
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:34,080
additional set of Concepts uh and

1811
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,380
um and a highly developed one which we

1812
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,600
might find useful and so we should take

1813
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,000
this on board that sounds very

1814
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,400
convincing to me that if if that's

1815
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,560
what's at stake here that that Alex is

1816
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,300
saying this is a language that lends

1817
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,159
itself to the phenomena that you study

1818
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,780
and to the way in which you go about

1819
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:54,360
studying it then it sounds to me as if

1820
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,219
Alex is right

1821
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:58,620
um so that's the main thing I wanted to

1822
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:02,040
say in response to to his comments uh uh

1823
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,580
in in relation to what I said

1824
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,260
um so

1825
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,179
um if anyone else wants to say anything

1826
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:12,080
else that's that's good with me but

1827
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,480
Alexi uh if if I've misunderstood and if

1828
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,920
there's something else that you think is

1829
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,679
at stake that I'm not getting now's your

1830
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,400
chance to to to say it

1831
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,040
well I I just wanted to to end the

1832
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,900
conversation when you said that that if

1833
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,120
this language might be of any even to

1834
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,100
consider this language to to in our

1835
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,900
future models I'm a happy man and

1836
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,300
there's nothing else I need to say uh

1837
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,380
and

1838
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,719
um I just wanted to to say that these

1839
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:41,100
are human things they're occupational

1840
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,719
hazards some of the things I'm talking

1841
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,820
about this paper I'm working on about

1842
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:48,239
narrative stuff is that you know uh of

1843
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,760
course you know it is much easier for us

1844
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,880
to think in in uh categories now even

1845
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,920
the psychoanalytic world you know what

1846
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,440
what uh you know we do in in the old

1847
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,719
let's take the mcquilliam system and the

1848
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,000
previous one we used to say three levels

1849
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,340
of functioning you know uh neurotic

1850
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,140
borderline psychotic these are

1851
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,280
categories

1852
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,199
they're not DSM categories they're not

1853
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:11,580
bipolar one but they're categories

1854
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,320
nonetheless then we have character

1855
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,840
Styles obsessive character style

1856
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,560
histrionic character style their

1857
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,500
categories okay so to some degree it's a

1858
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,820
human condition to put things in

1859
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,560
categories and I do think that this is

1860
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,960
this is a very strong historical reasons

1861
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,960
that we think this way we we this we're

1862
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,420
we have generations of thinking this way

1863
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,760
in categories and yes at the end of the

1864
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,440
day when we paint a portrait of a

1865
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,060
patient it's developed and it's like a

1866
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,100
tapestry all of these things weave into

1867
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,199
one another and it's complex

1868
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:42,900
but we start from basic categories and

1869
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,760
you know um

1870
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,739
certainly if we consider that you know

1871
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:48,960
some things can be transient there can

1872
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,540
be emergence they're like that the

1873
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,179
certain behavior in one context is in a

1874
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:56,460
compulsion but it's not a compulsion in

1875
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,800
another context and perhaps I'm saying

1876
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,380
trivial things to clinician and to

1877
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:05,100
clinicians and uh also what what dream

1878
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,440
you said just a comment when you said as

1879
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,120
a patient to reduce the noise and reduce

1880
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,460
the case I detect the bias in the

1881
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:14,040
language you see how we call you know

1882
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,679
Psychopathology and DSM disorders

1883
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:19,260
disorder is a bad word for us and I'm

1884
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:22,620
trying to say chaos is healthy I spend

1885
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,300
most of my day in gamma functioning

1886
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,640
which is a chaotic State it's not a bad

1887
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,280
thing so in the folk language chaos is a

1888
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,840
bad word disorder is a bit I want to put

1889
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,760
things in order and then perhaps we're

1890
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,440
missing something what comes to mind is

1891
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,300
I think Mark you had meetings with

1892
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,179
Michael Levin and Ian mcgilchrist who's

1893
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:40,739
you know big on talking about the

1894
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:43,440
mechanistic you know logical linear

1895
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,719
straight and narrow left hemisphere type

1896
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:47,400
of course it's not left hemisphere but

1897
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,260
that's the model versus holistic

1898
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,640
sensorial

1899
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,860
kind of right hemisphere artistic type

1900
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:55,140
and we're missing the second part like

1901
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:57,000
Daniel's background is surrounded by Art

1902
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,820
where you know we

1903
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,199
we spend less time in the right

1904
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,960
hemisphere maybe maybe appropriately so

1905
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,340
but I think that there's some things

1906
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,140
that lend themselves to that level of

1907
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:09,540
understanding and we would break things

1908
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,000
we we we look at Psychopathology and

1909
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,679
human suffering like it's a carburetor

1910
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,560
sometimes where we again you know put it

1911
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,780
in buckets that's my impression but what

1912
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:22,020
you said uh is is wonderful and I I you

1913
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,480
know I don't contradict with anything I

1914
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:28,140
agree with everything you said Mark so

1915
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,920
uh Alex if I can just um comment uh if

1916
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,820
you know if I if it's almost like an arc

1917
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,940
you know the the pot of gold at the end

1918
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:41,880
of the arc is is the uh reduced chaos

1919
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,739
the reduced noise in terms of the

1920
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:45,239
patience from the patient's perspective

1921
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:48,120
but how you get there ironically is

1922
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,400
actually by inducing

1923
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,719
um uh States of uh tolerable chaos

1924
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,239
um and then kind of

1925
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,440
re-reformulating that reconsolidating

1926
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,000
that chaos

1927
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,820
um so it's not that uh that from the you

1928
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:05,760
know healing or growth or whatever the

1929
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,580
patient might present to you for it has

1930
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,300
everything to do with um

1931
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:15,420
minimal or marginal chaos induction and

1932
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,600
then you know reintegration of that so

1933
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,940
it the whole process is is premised on

1934
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:24,480
chaos but in bite-sized doses maybe one

1935
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,400
could could say

1936
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,920
right and just to finish up and then

1937
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,260
I'll stop talking Jonathan schadler who

1938
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:33,600
is you know and he's uh you know rightly

1939
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,820
uh respected as a psychoanalytic

1940
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:38,100
practitioner and teacher and writer uh

1941
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:40,679
he recently said that take a patient x

1942
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:42,960
with an analyst why

1943
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,179
together the diet

1944
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,280
as emergent properties

1945
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,260
that is not the same thing as patient x

1946
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,120
with the analyst Z

1947
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,940
right and show me one study where we we

1948
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:56,280
take that into account we don't

1949
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,500
we just we just do random you know a

1950
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,300
clinical trial then we do meta-analysis

1951
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,980
of random clinical trial what technique

1952
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,080
did the therapist use they used you know

1953
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,580
whatever four-letter therapy they

1954
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,620
applied nobody looks at the emerging

1955
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:10,860
properties in a diet the this Matrix you

1956
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,960
know between the two and that's the

1957
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,699
language of dynamical systems this is

1958
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:17,100
Daniel Friedman you know ant colony that

1959
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,900
you know a single end doesn't build

1960
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,000
Bridges and grow mushrooms and Colony

1961
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,679
does all those things we don't talk

1962
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,360
about emergence in psychoanalytic

1963
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,239
Psychotherapy do we it's true it's also

1964
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:30,239
a fundamental challenge after all you

1965
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,179
can't replicate within one dyad or

1966
01:19:33,179 --> 01:19:36,480
across dyads in a finite world so so it

1967
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,580
does point to fundamentals

1968
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:41,820
in our last minutes if

1969
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:44,340
um each would like to give some thoughts

1970
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:49,080
where do we go as we now the option of

1971
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,000
exponent away from each other in our

1972
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,300
paths so maybe um Albert Brin Mark and

1973
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,500
then Alexi

1974
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,719
what are your overall thoughts

1975
01:19:57,719 --> 01:19:59,400
Reflections and then where are we

1976
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,000
heading

1977
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,780
go for it Albert

1978
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:09,659
um yeah I was I was about to comment on

1979
01:20:09,659 --> 01:20:11,040
Alexey

1980
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,219
um about the emerging properties thing

1981
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:16,679
um it's it's it's kind of the same point

1982
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:18,000
I made earlier

1983
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,260
um

1984
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:22,380
in in later psychologic theories do talk

1985
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,780
about emerging properties

1986
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,000
um but yes I think as what what

1987
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,920
Professor sulbs just mentioned uh this

1988
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,380
this language I mean

1989
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:33,960
this this new set of Concepts makes it

1990
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,780
very uh uh practical for us to

1991
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:37,940
communicate

1992
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:40,560
with each other because

1993
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,320
psychoanalysis has a bad habit of

1994
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,840
Reinventing new Concepts every every new

1995
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,640
decade so it's

1996
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,219
there's a lot of chaos to use that word

1997
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:54,000
um within uh psychonalic uh discourse so

1998
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,159
yeah but overall

1999
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,500
I thought I'm very grateful I think this

2000
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,900
was a very interesting talk so yeah

2001
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,379
thank you

2002
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,920
thank you yes so uh by by way of closing

2003
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,960
uh remarks I I I agree with um actually

2004
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,300
it seems to me that there's there's a

2005
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,400
there's an abundance of agreement in

2006
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,520
this meeting I I don't see uh any big

2007
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,440
controversy um so uh that's nice

2008
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,460
um the uh I think what Bryn said uh is

2009
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,620
it really captures it I liked it because

2010
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,780
it because what he said was so

2011
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,580
experienced near you know he was just

2012
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,920
describing what it feels like to be a

2013
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,699
patient and and and and you know to be

2014
01:21:41,699 --> 01:21:45,360
in a state of and not knowing uh and

2015
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,880
uncertainty as opposed to you know a

2016
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,179
more stable kind of uh tranquility and

2017
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:56,360
then the the the ability to uh to to

2018
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:00,179
allow yourself to return to uncertainty

2019
01:22:00,179 --> 01:22:03,780
um if you've if you've um found uh

2020
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:06,179
answers that are too simple and that

2021
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:10,260
that are that are too static to allow

2022
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,659
ourselves to go back into this state of

2023
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:15,300
of not really knowing

2024
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,760
um that's that I think really does

2025
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,179
describe what what we try to do for our

2026
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:22,640
patients what we have to remember

2027
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:26,159
applies to ourselves not only because we

2028
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:29,100
are ultimately patients too but because

2029
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,260
it applies to how the mind works it

2030
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:34,320
applies to science how science works you

2031
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:38,100
know that we we do need to find order uh

2032
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,280
but uh there is disorder out there and

2033
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,040
so we're always at risk of coming

2034
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,880
prematurely to a rigid system of belief

2035
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:50,340
um and we have to return back to the

2036
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:53,040
coal face and back to the chaos but

2037
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,460
ultimately where we want to be is back

2038
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,239
in in that Valley uh uh

2039
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:04,320
um and uh so the as much as Alexis right

2040
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:10,500
to remind us that at the uh that the the

2041
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,040
the the highest levels of brain activity

2042
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,980
um in many senses of the word uh are

2043
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,239
entropic

2044
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,360
um and that that's deep sleep and

2045
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,760
seizures you know are are are bad things

2046
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,159
as much as that's true nevertheless I

2047
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:31,380
think that the great trend of the mind

2048
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:34,020
it's it's it's one of its fundamental

2049
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,540
working principles is where we're

2050
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:39,179
wanting to be more certain to we want

2051
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:41,820
life to be more predictable we don't

2052
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:43,679
like to be in chaos

2053
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,440
um and I think that that's an important

2054
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,179
um

2055
01:23:47,179 --> 01:23:50,100
a thing to remember you know while we

2056
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:53,040
are acknowledging the importance of of

2057
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,040
chaos and and of the the highly

2058
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,320
unpredictable nature of the world and of

2059
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,820
the phenomena we study in our field

2060
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:04,140
nevertheless we Retreat from it and and

2061
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,780
for very good reasons so those are my

2062
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:11,059
closing remarks and and thank you

2063
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:15,960
and I'll be very brief uh Alexa yeah

2064
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,480

2065

2066
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,540
the patient and non-psychopathic Well on

2067
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:27,659
on human The Human Condition I I think

2068
01:24:27,659 --> 01:24:29,880
that's so nice to have that

2069
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,820
um come out uh of the paper when at at

2070
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:35,340
first glance it doesn't seem to be there

2071
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,860
so thanks for making it so human and

2072

very grateful honestly for your uh help

2081
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,199
and openness and flexibility one of the

2082
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:07,020
other reasons is uh kind of the the time

2083
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:08,699
will live in you've all Herrera made

2084
01:25:08,699 --> 01:25:11,640
that comment that the rate of change is

2085
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,199
accelerating you know when we were

2086
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,179
hunter-gatherers uncertainty was Norm

2087
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:16,679
you wake up there's nothing in the

2088
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:18,780
fridge you have to go hunt and we

2089
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,580
tolerate an uncertainty better we could

2090
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:22,440
put our worldly positions on the back

2091
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,300
and then we started Living in the world

2092
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,159
of iPads iPhones were bombarded with

2093
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,659
information and we must minimize

2094
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:29,100
uncertainty we must you know have

2095
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,140
predictability in everything which is

2096
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:34,620
not the natural world or mammals and now

2097
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,480
you know we live our life and then vain

2098
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,880
called it hits and then Bank you know

2099
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,440
certain person becomes the president of

2100
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,640
the United States you know and

2101
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,400
everything goes upside down so uh the

2102
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,020
black swans are hitting us more

2103
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,300
frequently so I think having the theory

2104
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,040
of that you know at our fingerprints and

2105
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,320
applying guitar work is probably you

2106
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,360
know beneficial but again thank you all

2107
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,400
so much I really appreciate

2108
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,100
awesome well thank you all for joining

2109
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,280
the conversation continues so till next

2110
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,519
time

2111
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,699
my birth

2112
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:11,360
foreign
