00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,290
Hello and welcome,

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,690
everyone. This is guest stream number

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,238
53.1 at the Active Inference Institute.

4
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:16,538
It's August 23, 2023.

5
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:19,638
We are going to be having a presentation

6
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:22,522
followed by a discussion around the

7
00:00:22,576 --> 00:00:25,642
recent work of Alexei Tolchinski, a case

8
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:28,254
for chaos theory inclusion in Neuro

9
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:30,306
psychoanalytic modeling. So if you're

10
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:32,034
watching live, please feel free to add

11
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:34,622
any questions into the live chat.

12
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:37,218
Otherwise, we will now have the

13
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,382
presentation followed by a discussion

14
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:42,566
with our excellent panelists. So thank

15
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:44,466
you everybody for joining. And Alexi,

16
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:46,070
to you for the presentation.

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,830
Thank you, Daniel.

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,082
Thank you, Mark, for finding the time.

19
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:57,562
I'm very grateful and excited to talk

20
00:00:57,616 --> 00:01:01,062
about this. Thank you, Andrea Brynn

21
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,882
Albert. I hope maybe Mike will join us.

22
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:06,698
And thank you, Daniel And, active

23
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:08,782
inference institute, for organizing this

24
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:12,110
meeting. So, can you see the slides?

25
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,880
Yep. Okay, so I'll just proceed then.

26
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,086
This is the outline of the talk. I'll

27
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,242
share some preliminary comments and talk

28
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,082
briefly about assumptions in the current

29
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:28,882
models, summarize the data, talk about

30
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:31,122
free energy principle formulations as

31
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,446
compatible with chaos, and talk about

32
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:35,954
some future developments. And hopefully

33
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:37,654
we can discuss that. I'm very much

34
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:39,510
looking forward to have more questions

35
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,614
than answers. I'd like to start with

36
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:44,934
what Michael Levin taught me, I guess,

37
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,946
is just why it's important to me. The

38
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:49,782
most important thing is the clinical

39
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:53,260
applications. I think that

40
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,038
with your work, Mark, and with Pang

41
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:59,070
SIP's work, we have been moving away

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,174
from dualism over the course of some

43
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:03,934
time. But I think the other big d

44
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:06,026
determinism is still highly prevalent

45
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:08,126
and dominant. And I do think it

46
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:11,646
influences our clinical work, diagnosis

47
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:14,386
and psychotherapy and assessments. And I

48
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:16,146
think that it may be beneficial for some

49
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:18,162
of the harder conditions we work with to

50
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:21,162
consider, including nonlinear framework.

51
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:24,454
That's my main focus. This is the link

52
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,406
to the preprint. And the paper is

53
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,146
published fully in Neuropsychoanalysis

54
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:32,306
Journal. Some of it is discussion

55
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,474
with this foundational paper that you,

56
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:36,186
Mark, wrote, the new Project for a

57
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,694
Scientific Psychology General Scheme,

58
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:41,846
which is a perhaps revision, a revival

59
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,674
of Freud's famous paper Project for

60
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:48,966
Scientific Psychology. And I'd

61
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:50,974
like to give you credit, Mark, that you

62
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:53,342
have been opening conversations between

63
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:55,086
disciplines that hadn't been talking to

64
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,054
each other prior to your efforts, such

65
00:02:57,092 --> 00:03:01,550
as psychoanalysis and neurosciences,

66
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,714
you've been doing for more than 20 years

67
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:06,334
with great success. In the same spirit,

68
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:08,546
I wanted to mention that Society for

69
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:12,126
Chaos Theory in Psychology exists since

70
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:14,322
91, which is when their first conference

71
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:17,158
happened, about less than 20 years.

72
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:19,334
Then the first conference on chaos in

73
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:21,670
Lake, Italy, around Lake Italy,

74
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,546
lake Como in Italy in 76, which was

75
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,274
mostly physicists at that time. And then

76
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:29,686
psychologists joined. And I've attended

77
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:31,546
the recent conference in Toronto, which

78
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:33,594
was absolutely wonderful. And I've met

79
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:35,494
extraordinary clinicians and scientists.

80
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:37,834
And I think that it would be beneficial

81
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,902
to open that dialogue as well. And maybe

82
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,886
if there is a wall between us to

83
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:43,920
consider demolishing the wall.

84
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,454
In terms of intent for the paper, you,

85
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,106
Mark, pointed out to me that you've had

86
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:53,758
an exchange with Robert Gallitzer Levy.

87
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,586
For those of you who may not know him.

88
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:57,666
He's a psychoanalyst from Chicago, a

89
00:03:57,688 --> 00:04:00,786
psychoanalytic writer and teacher who

90
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,026
wrote a book on non linear

91
00:04:02,078 --> 00:04:04,358
psychoanalysis and deserves a lot of

92
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:07,266
credit for his advocacy and he's sharing

93
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:10,086
his thoughts. He posed a question to

94
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:12,386
you, Mark, of possibly considering

95
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,266
nonlinear components in that seminal

96
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,962
paper, your Project for Scientific

97
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,686
Psychology. And to which he responded

98
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,622
that the key point in such discussion

99
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:23,466
was whether the mental apparatus was

100
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:26,406
indeed nonlinear. So I took your comment

101
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:29,578
as a task, as a challenge, if you wish

102
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:31,630
and decided to write a paper about it.

103
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,806
I don't know if the data presented is

104
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:36,654
sufficient, but I tried, and very

105
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,246
clearly I don't intend to contradict or

106
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:41,826
criticize. That would be funny of me to

107
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:45,294
do. I'm hopeful maybe to add a branch

108
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:47,438
on this tree that you're growing,

109
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:49,746
clinical and theoretical tree. And

110
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:52,146
should you consider it worthwhile to go

111
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,294
in this direction we wouldn't have to

112
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:56,454
change very much because this is the

113
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:58,646
paper by Friston. Lancelot de Costa and

114
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:00,118
others called Stochastic. Chaos and

115
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:02,754
Marker blankets. Free energy principle

116
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,926
is compatible with the chaotic

117
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,234
attracting set. What I thought was not

118
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:10,906
present just yet was a formulation where

119
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,934
the attracting set experiences a phase

120
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:16,346
transition. And I took liberty to

121
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:18,286
ask Karl about it and he shared some

122
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:20,766
very nice thoughts that I will, with his

123
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,046
permission, share. At the end of the

124
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:26,042
talk, I'd like to cite

125
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:29,122
Maxwell Ramstead, whom you know, and his

126
00:05:29,176 --> 00:05:30,766
colleagues from the paper and Bayesian

127
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,958
mechanics of physics, often by beliefs

128
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,670
where they talk about dynamics,

129
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,314
mechanics and principles. And in

130
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:41,194
physics, Kepler's work is descriptive.

131
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,394
It shows what the orbits of heavenly

132
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:46,822
bodies are. Mechanics are the how of

133
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:50,182
the dynamics. This is Newton's. Laws and

134
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:52,374
principles are prescriptive. They are

135
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:54,578
about why things work this way. There's

136
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:56,906
a certain hierarchy in physics where you

137
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,662
could derive the second law of Newton

138
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,434
from principle of least action. And then

139
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:02,906
if you have initial conditions, you

140
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:05,994
could calculate the dynamics. The reason

141
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,642
I'm mentioning that is, I think, Mark,

142
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:09,402
your new project for scientific

143
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:12,686
psychology is a high road. It seems to

144
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,446
start from first principles such as the

145
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:16,218
free energy principle and then you seem

146
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:19,646
to derive things down from there. So I

147
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:22,114
thought, why not try to see how the low

148
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:24,706
road may look like? If in addition to

149
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:26,594
these derivations and deductions and

150
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:28,658
declaration of what entropy should be in

151
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:31,026
the brain what if we measure it in

152
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,154
Animal Studies and Human Studies in

153
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,726
Health and Pathology and see what the

154
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:36,854
data shows and whether or not the low

155
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:38,630
road meets the high road in the middle?

156
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,246
Or perhaps something may need to be

157
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:44,302
added. I also like to clarify

158
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,394
why I spend time in the paper talking

159
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,690
about obvious things for everybody.

160
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,366
Here the axioms and postulates. And I'm

161
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:54,058
quoting here Edward Frankel, who is a

162
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:57,660
mathematician at you know,

163
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,114
Michael will forgive me, but viewpoint

164
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:04,446
is that one can say that some parts of

165
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:06,174
biology can be seen as based on

166
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:08,494
chemistry, which can be seen as based on

167
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:10,306
physics, which can be seen as based on

168
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:12,546
mathematics. So how do things work in

169
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:14,766
mathematics? We know that Karl Frieston

170
00:07:14,798 --> 00:07:16,386
likes to translate nearly everything he

171
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:18,786
works on into the language of

172
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:20,926
mathematics. Classically there's

173
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,590
something called a formal system which

174
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,926
we can metaphorically compare to

175
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:28,086
building a house. So the foundation of

176
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:30,454
the house is a set of axioms that has

177
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,014
certain qualities. And then we build

178
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,398
things up using the logic of Aristotle.

179
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,314
And we derive things like theorems. An

180
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:40,134
example would be Euclidean geometry,

181
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:42,634
which is on the plane that is based on

182
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,986
five axioms of Euclid. That's the

183
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:46,886
foundation. And then you could derive

184
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:49,614
things like Pythagorean theorem. Now,

185
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,406
if we were to change just one of the

186
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:53,390
axioms in the foundation, the entire

187
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,318
house changes. An example would be the

188
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:58,666
fifth axiom of Euclid that parallel

189
00:07:58,698 --> 00:08:00,606
lines essentially don't intersect. If

190
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:02,626
you change that then we could have a

191
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,598
house on the sphere which is Lobozevsky

192
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:07,426
Riemann geometry and meridians on the

193
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:09,826
earth are parallel and they intersect or

194
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:11,778
you could have parabolic shape where

195
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:14,338
parallel lines also intersect. So we'll

196
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:16,534
have an entirely different framework and

197
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:19,526
it may be naive to expect the theorem to

198
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:21,526
look the same. The Figurian theorem, if

199
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:24,538
we put it on the sphere is different,

200
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:28,294
the formula is different. I'm mentioning

201
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,914
that is because I love

202
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:31,638
multidisciplinarity and I think that's

203
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:34,058
the way of the future with that

204
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:36,654
sometimes when we cross over into

205
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:39,310
another discipline such as psychologists

206
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,178
taking mathematicals or physics ideas

207
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:46,654
then we may occasionally forget this

208
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,154
formal system thing. For example, when

209
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:52,446
we say things like human beings resist

210
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:53,746
or violate the second law of

211
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:57,666
thermodynamics then the

212
00:08:57,688 --> 00:08:59,886
second law was formulated for closed

213
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:02,226
systems in the state of equilibrium such

214
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:04,802
as a sealed chamber of gas and human

215
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:06,438
beings are neither closed nor in the

216
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,502
state of equilibrium so it doesn't quite

217
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:10,342
apply. It's a different formal system.

218
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:12,486
One needs physics of open systems to

219
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:15,162
make a statement like that. So again,

220
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:17,258
in mathematics because you mark seem to

221
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:18,858
have taken us deeply in the main of

222
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:21,082
mathematics in your project you have

223
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:22,934
differential equations for action,

224
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:26,438
perception, precision you have mark of

225
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:28,830
blankets, random dynamical systems

226
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,806
equivalences, partial derivatives. Then

227
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,638
in mathematics people fix the set of

228
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:37,566
axioms, they fix the definitions and

229
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:39,520
then they build a theory, right?

230
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,182
So I want to be clear, I want to clarify

231
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:45,314
what are the axioms in the theory that

232
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:48,946
is built? What is the foundation? And in

233
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,434
the effort of time, maybe I'll talk

234
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:53,858
about just one of them which is Freud's

235
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:56,246
psychic determinism and this is a

236
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:58,454
question for me, not an answer. I wanted

237
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:01,750
to ask you because I'm assuming whether

238
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,298
you kept this axiom or you changed it.

239
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:08,026
So Freud said in the psychopathology of

240
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,010
everyday life that there is nothing

241
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,374
arbitrary or undetermined in the psychic

242
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:14,586
life. There's different versions of this

243
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,554
statement and it has been repeated by

244
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,630
generations of psychoanalysts over a

245
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,094
hundred years. And it became very

246
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:22,170
entrenched. It's sort of a cultural meme

247
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,750
and a major tenet of psychoanalysis.

248
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,946
If I were to give an illustration,

249
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:30,898
perhaps those of us who are not in

250
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,726
psychoanalytic therapy, then let's

251
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,386
imagine an analytic therapist hearing a

252
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:39,906
patient who intends to say same with an

253
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:42,840
S, but they use the word shame, right?

254
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,438
So such a phenomenon. First of all, I

255
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:47,986
think psychodynamic, psychopathic

256
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:49,926
therapists would probably say that's not

257
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:53,560
an accident. Okay? Accident is

258
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,754
not a used term in psychoanalysis. And

259
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,626
secondly, they will probably infer of

260
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:02,486
what it might mean, for example, infer

261
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,634
along the lines of unconscious or

262
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,314
emotional dynamics, emotional conflict.

263
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:09,454
Somebody else may infer that it may have

264
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,822
neuropsychological reasons. Somebody

265
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,566
else may infer that it probably is a

266
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:16,334
migraine. But what you might will not

267
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:18,914
hear in psychodynamic culture is that

268
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:21,746
that was an accident, that it was due to

269
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,494
chance. I think that chance accidents,

270
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:27,442
randomness stochasticity chaos are not

271
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:28,786
used, they're bad form in

272
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:31,826
psychoanalysis. And that is the

273
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:33,686
illustration of, I think, for its

274
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,538
assumption. Ultimately it's an axiom.

275
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:37,590
It's a belief that is not questioned.

276
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,082
If we were to translate that assumption

277
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:42,966
in the pristine language, this is the

278
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:44,878
long givan equation from which pristine

279
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:48,182
starts, which has notations by Daniel.

280
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:50,986
Thank you, Daniel. And we have the

281
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,558
change in the state of x equals the flow

282
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,990
plus the omega. Omega is the Stochastic

283
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,158
know, in Daniel's metaphor we have a

284
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:05,486
wave and then we have ripple. So we

285
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:06,986
would have to change the Stochastic

286
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,558
component if we were to go with the

287
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,442
Freud's axiom. And then if we do that,

288
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,186
we would find ourselves squarely in the

289
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,134
domain of cold physics, Newtonian

290
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:17,854
physics, Laplace's demon. LaPlace

291
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,746
famously said, give me a position and

292
00:12:19,768 --> 00:12:21,986
momentum of every particle and I'll tell

293
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,686
you exactly where they have been before

294
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:25,238
and exactly where they will be in the

295
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,014
future. Now, Freud didn't make

296
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:29,574
statements like that, but this is what

297
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:31,266
would happen if you kill the Stochastic

298
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:34,418
component. I want to be clear that it's

299
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,506
not Freud's fault at all. Well, first of

300
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:38,214
all, you need axioms to build a theory.

301
00:12:38,262 --> 00:12:39,974
He chose that axiom. That's the theory

302
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:42,374
he built. Second of all, it wasn't

303
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:45,546
exactly mathematics. And finally, the

304
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:48,282
zeitgeist of the time was deterministic.

305
00:12:48,426 --> 00:12:51,738
Perhaps there were initial

306
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,886
derivations of Stochastic mechanics and

307
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:56,174
quantum mechanics. But Freud, when he

308
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:58,826
was learning the world of deterministic

309
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:02,366
physics, was dominant. And there's

310
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,174
an important nuance in this discussion

311
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:05,806
pointed out to me by the first peer

312
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:08,770
reviewer of the paper who said, listen,

313
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,754
if you have something that changes like

314
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,642
a Stochastic thing and then you apply

315
00:13:12,696 --> 00:13:15,138
statistics to it, such as variance,

316
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:17,234
then the variance of a changing variable

317
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:19,926
will be deterministic. And then if we

318
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:21,814
look at things like words which are used

319
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,854
a lot in talk therapy like apple. An

320
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:26,518
apple is a semantic memory. It's a

321
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:28,522
category. It's a coarse grading already

322
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:30,442
from green apples and red apples and all

323
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:32,666
other kinds of apples. So in that

324
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,420
regard, words are deterministic things.

325
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,154
So perhaps when we have a dream analysis

326
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:40,446
session and the patient shares with an

327
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:43,534
analyst the movie that they saw the

328
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,814
messy irrational thing with images and

329
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:49,434
tunes and anything and maybe words,

330
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:53,086
even if they narrate it, then they slow

331
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:55,554
things down, they average things out and

332
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:57,406
they put it in deterministic tools,

333
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,674
which is words. So with some objects we

334
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:02,834
can apply deterministic tools. But I

335
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:04,882
want to point out that the foundation

336
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:06,518
that everything and anything in the

337
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:08,114
psychic life that all the munications

338
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:10,566
have no stochasticity randomness is a

339
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,434
very strong assumption. And I'm curious

340
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:14,982
what would happen if we were to allow

341
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:16,626
ourselves to see things on the sphere,

342
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:18,954
on the parabola shape. It's not a bad

343
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,866
exercise because the general theory of

344
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:23,590
relativity would not have existed

345
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,922
without these other geometries. In terms

346
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:29,066
of definitions, this is a familiar

347
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:31,386
formula that you mark use of Shannon's

348
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:33,134
entropy. He originally wrote about

349
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,278
telegraph and sender and receiver in a

350
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,886
fixed alphabet. But here if we draw an

351
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:39,486
attracting set which happens to be

352
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:42,866
Lorenz attractor in phase space and we

353
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,818
look at these I don't know if you can

354
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:47,650
see them, they're small. The white know

355
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,986
that's the initial condition and then

356
00:14:50,008 --> 00:14:51,974
they spread out and evolve as time goes

357
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:54,806
by. But you can see the density of the

358
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:57,526
attracting set. It is higher density and

359
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,830
lower density. So we could calculate

360
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,150
probability distribution.

361
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,022
A slightly different question is this

362
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,122
what would happen if you were to change

363
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:10,886
the initial condition a little bit 1 mm

364
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:13,274
in phase space, different things can

365
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,130
happen. And one of them is shown in this

366
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,206
diagram that would be divergence. And

367
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,122
the formula here is initial condition

368
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,606
multiplied by exponent of lambda T. So

369
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:25,120
when lambda is positive, you have

370
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,158
divergence and it's called lapin of

371
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:30,046
exponent. And that's one of the criteria

372
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:32,786
for chaos. When it is negative, we have

373
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,786
convergence and when it is zero we have

374
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,386
equidistant trajectories, we have

375
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:40,402
Newtonian mechanics. This is an

376
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,226
illustration of a chaotic system which

377
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:45,126
is a great red spot on Jupiter. And it

378
00:15:45,148 --> 00:15:47,462
fits perfectly the Friston's paper about

379
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,266
the mark of blankets and stochastic

380
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:51,846
chaos because that thing is stable. We

381
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,134
have been observing it for 300 years and

382
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:56,066
one could say that this elliptical shape

383
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:58,038
is the mark of blanket around the chaos

384
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:00,986
that maintains its integrity. It's not a

385
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:02,646
contradiction because in one spatial

386
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,586
scale you have mark of blanket and on

387
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:06,518
another spatial scale you have a chaos

388
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:09,418
within the marker blanket. This is a

389
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:11,706
convergent system that is a bit trivial

390
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,278
to all of you. This is a hole in the

391
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:15,246
ground and then surrounded by hills on

392
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:18,746
all sides and if you were to put a ball

393
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,410
on the hill, it's going to roll down in

394
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,106
the potential. Well, and typically in

395
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:24,578
phase space, we'll call the bottom of

396
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,546
the hole an attractor and we call the

397
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,714
hills repeller. Repeller is a term less

398
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:32,686
frequently used, but it's the highly

399
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,854
unstable point in phase space from which

400
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,934
things move away from and they move

401
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:39,126
toward the attractor. Now, that's just

402
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:40,934
one attractor. The interesting things

403
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:42,406
start happening. If you've got two of

404
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:44,834
them, imagine a second hole immediately

405
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:46,842
to the right and the boundary between

406
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,210
them may very quickly become chaotic.

407
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,946
Here's another illustration on a

408
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:53,478
convergent system from the active

409
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:55,242
inference textbook that I hadn't read

410
00:16:55,296 --> 00:16:56,586
when I was working on the paper. I

411
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:59,866
discovered it later. The chart on the

412
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:03,214
left is the density. And again we see

413
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:05,082
high density in the center and we hate

414
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:07,438
lower density in the periphery. And the

415
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,706
chart on the right is surprise. We're

416
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,450
very not surprised to find a ball in the

417
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,106
center, and we're very much surprised if

418
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:16,002
it stays on the hill. And I'll read you

419
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:18,354
a citation. Active inference is

420
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:20,578
restricted to systems like that one on

421
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,174
the left, which counter random

422
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:24,614
fluctuations with their average flow and

423
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:28,006
thereby retain their form over time. It

424
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,746
may sound like the statement contradicts

425
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:31,126
what I said earlier, that FAP is

426
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:33,314
compatible with chaos, but it doesn't

427
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:35,126
because you could have different spatial

428
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:37,146
scales and convergence on one scale and

429
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:39,130
divergence on another. I also

430
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,634
historically think that we have been

431
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,034
studying converging systems mostly so

432
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:46,394
far. Now, if we move

433
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,542
from things like that, which is very

434
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:51,950
simple, to a mind or consciousness,

435
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,366
then I think that what we could be

436
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:57,066
looking at is this that's a landscape

437
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:59,714
with attractors and repellers that is

438
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:02,322
very complex. And I'm going to quote the

439
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:04,094
former president of the Chaos Society

440
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:06,786
for Psychology is that that landscape is

441
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:10,514
dynamic. It moves. Perhaps some things

442
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:12,978
on it are stable. If we were imagine a

443
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:14,518
clinical scenario where there's a

444
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:17,286
patient who is very prone to shame and

445
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:19,366
very averse to express anger, then we

446
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:22,070
could say that shame is an attractor and

447
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,574
anger is a repeller. But we work with

448
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:27,306
pattern things in dynamic therapy so

449
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:29,642
they could be relatively stable until

450
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:31,274
the work in therapy makes them more

451
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:33,674
shallow distributions. But certain

452
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,274
things change overnight. Some things

453
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:37,078
change in a week or during the course of

454
00:18:37,104 --> 00:18:38,894
therapy. So I mean, strictly speaking,

455
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,146
that's a dynamic landscape, and I don't

456
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:44,734
think we model things this way. I'd like

457
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,886
to also quote Maxwell Rammstead from the

458
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:50,066
same paper that free energy principle is

459
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,546
a tale of two densities. It would be

460
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:54,414
incomplete to say that we just minimize

461
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:58,114
one variable. What happens is we

462
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:00,226
minimize the Shannon's entropy of

463
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:02,114
probability distribution over sensory

464
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:04,054
states, while at the same time we

465
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,770
maximize entropy of internal beliefs,

466
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,386
which is very important. That's

467
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:11,026
adaptation. If somebody has rigid

468
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:13,958
internal beliefs with sharp

469
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:15,914
probabilities and then COVID happens,

470
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:17,546
they will have lower probability of

471
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:21,082
survival. They're not adaptable. So

472
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,866
adaptability means maximization of

473
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:25,978
entropy of internal beliefs while

474
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,338
maintaining the forum means the

475
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:29,774
minimization of Shannon's entropy of

476
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:32,074
probability distribution over sensory

477
00:19:32,122 --> 00:19:34,954
states. Here's another term,

478
00:19:35,002 --> 00:19:37,262
Kolmogorov Sinai entropy that is not

479
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:40,290
intuitive and it's from topology.

480
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,866
The picture you see is the photograph of

481
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:45,154
the statue called Intuition outside the

482
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:46,786
Fields Institute of Mathematics in

483
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:48,894
Toronto. Here's a graphical

484
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:51,026
illustration. If you were to draw the

485
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:54,366
trajectories in phase space and surround

486
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:56,514
it by a certain volume, say a circle

487
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,334
with the radius epsilon, and ask

488
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,414
yourself what happens to this volume as

489
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:05,018
they evolve? Well, when it

490
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,702
expands, then you can have chaoticity.

491
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:11,226
When it becomes more compact, you can

492
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:13,226
have convergence. When it stays the

493
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:15,754
same, you have periodic system, which is

494
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,466
indicated on the chart on the right,

495
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:19,546
where you have a correlate of the

496
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:22,334
colmorphs in entropy on the y axis. And

497
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:25,326
you have this epsilon on the x axis. So

498
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,486
the flat line at the bottom where the

499
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:29,306
circle doesn't change is the periodic

500
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:32,100
system. Omogorovsina entropy stays zero.

501
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,386
The curved line in the center that

502
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:37,022
converges on a K is the proper chaos.

503
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:39,666
This is theoretical chaos. And the

504
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:43,006
upshoot from it is what Friston calls

505
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,754
stochastic chaos. This is chaos plus

506
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:47,042
noise. And then you can have pure noise

507
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:48,850
and then you can have pure linearity.

508
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,626
So all of these things exist, they're

509
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:52,594
all on the table. You can have geometry

510
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:54,566
on the plane, geometry on the sphere,

511
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:56,746
geometry in the parabolic shape. So what

512
00:20:56,768 --> 00:21:00,234
does the data show? And when we look

513
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:04,166
at EEG entropy, people use approximate

514
00:21:04,198 --> 00:21:05,978
entropy, permutation entropy and

515
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:07,434
spectrum entropy, which are all

516
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:10,526
derivations of colmorefsini. And the

517
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:11,982
first two are in different phase space

518
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:14,078
from the last one, I believe. Mark,

519
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:16,286
correct me if I'm wrong. You cite Go

520
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,510
serious study in your book Hidden Spring

521
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,214
when you talk about entropy and phases

522
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:24,206
of sleep. And they use spectrum entropy,

523
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:26,702
which is a derivation of colmorov Sinai

524
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:29,614
in the frequency domain analysis phase

525
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:34,770
space. So the data shows that systems

526
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,162
as small as the axon of a squid isolated

527
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:40,866
in the lab to single neurons to coupled

528
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:44,006
neurons to EEG, we have evidence of

529
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:47,194
positive lap enough exponents in some

530
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:50,346
regimes of operation with EEG. We can be

531
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:52,698
more specific. That algorithm seems to

532
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:55,722
be weakly nonlinear, while things below

533
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:57,374
alpha like delta seem to be more

534
00:21:57,412 --> 00:21:59,946
periodic with noise. And things above

535
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:02,218
alpha such as gamma and high gamma seem

536
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:04,606
to be chaotic. So if we were to

537
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:08,494
summarize this data, then we can

538
00:22:08,532 --> 00:22:10,834
say that comogorous entropy appears to

539
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:13,166
increase as generalized arousal

540
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,490
increases from delta to gamma rhythm,

541
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,906
comogorous and entropy seems to be

542
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:19,634
higher in healthy, alert, brain mind

543
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,374
functioning than in the states of coma,

544
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:23,334
seizure, deep sleep. And it can stay

545
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:25,762
close to zero in a coma or deep sleep.

546
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:27,958
The interesting anecdote here is that a

547
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:29,478
simple act of closing your eyes when

548
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:31,522
you're alert decreases Comography

549
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:35,542
entropy clinical applications are vast

550
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:38,250
and developing fast, for example,

551
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,266
except for clinical psychology, I must

552
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:42,758
say, in psychiatry and psychotherapy.

553
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:45,046
But in neurology, the seizure detection

554
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:48,602
on the EEG right now can be done with AI

555
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,574
with about the same accuracy as a human

556
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:53,262
neurologist. And that algorithm does use

557
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:55,738
chaoticity assessment. There's models

558
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:57,710
for Parkinson's, neuropathic, pain, and

559
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,986
I have other examples that I'll skip for

560
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:01,854
right now. This is a graphical

561
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:05,060
illustration of phases of sleep. And

562
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,338
again, it has colmob Sinai entropy as a

563
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:10,946
phase of sleep. It shows wakefulness and

564
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:12,926
then shallow sleep, progressively deeper

565
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,822
sleep and REM. And that's the time

566
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,394
evolution. If you move REM in frequency

567
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:18,834
to where it belongs to wakefulness,

568
00:23:18,882 --> 00:23:20,226
then you'll see the same progression

569
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:22,294
that comographs and entropy appears to

570
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:24,134
increase as a function of generalized

571
00:23:24,182 --> 00:23:28,122
arousal. This is seizure onset at about

572
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:30,666
second four. Seizure is a reduction in

573
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:32,634
chaoticity. Healthy functioning is

574
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:35,594
higher chaoticity than a seizure. This

575
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:37,978
is a coma, which is relatively invariant

576
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:39,918
theta and delta frequency. This is a

577
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:41,946
nearly periodic system with some noise.

578
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:44,714
And death is a linear system. It doesn't

579
00:23:44,762 --> 00:23:47,274
change. This is persistent vegetative

580
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,682
state, minimally conscious state, where

581
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:51,346
researchers were asking a question on

582
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:53,486
prognosis of survival and they've

583
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:55,582
concluded that diversity and variability

584
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:58,546
of the EHE was the predictor of

585
00:23:58,568 --> 00:24:01,220
survival. Higher entropy means life.

586
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,586
So the hypothesis is that chaotic

587
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:07,846
stochastic and linear processes as well

588
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:09,506
as hybrid ones, such as primarily

589
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:11,606
chaotic functioning with noise can be

590
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:13,346
present concurrently at different scales

591
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:16,566
of the brain mind or at the same scale,

592
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:18,362
but in different places or at different

593
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,034
times. I realize it's a mouthful, but it

594
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:23,660
fits the data presented in the paper.

595
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,638
This is again a picture from the

596
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:29,674
textbook enough to inference by Thomas

597
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:31,338
Parr, Karl Friston, and Giovanni

598
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:34,718
Pizzoulo. It's a cortical column. And

599
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,720
the errors you see here,

600
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,818
ascending and descending connections,

601
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:41,666
if by chance you're not familiar with

602
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,700
the framework they correspond to,

603
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,574
the ascending errors are prediction

604
00:24:46,622 --> 00:24:47,874
errors and descending ones are

605
00:24:47,912 --> 00:24:49,746
predictions. This is what they say in

606
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,998
the book, that there's an asymmetry in

607
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,342
message passing. And the reason for that

608
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,134
is that the operations required to

609
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:57,862
compute prediction error from

610
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:00,294
expectation are nonlinear. This

611
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,246
nonlinearity is due to computation of

612
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,210
predictions using nonlinear functions

613
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,266
that tend to increase the frequency of

614
00:25:06,288 --> 00:25:09,386
the signal. I'd like to

615
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,194
talk a little bit about reduction. It

616
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:12,858
became very fashionable and sometimes

617
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,918
silly to use this like, oh, you're

618
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:16,454
reductionist. No, you're reductionist.

619
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:18,634
And the second most popular term is

620
00:25:18,672 --> 00:25:20,506
oversimplify. You oversimplify. Now you

621
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:22,862
oversimplify. And to me, they're not bad

622
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,326
words. They're necessary tools to

623
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:28,766
simplify and to reduce. The map

624
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:30,866
that equals the territory exactly is

625
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:32,674
useless. Nobody's going to use it. It

626
00:25:32,712 --> 00:25:35,042
must kind of I'm quoting James Quick

627
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:39,006
simplify and, you know, I'll illustrate

628
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:42,114
the specific term. If the car is moving

629
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:44,098
with a fixed velocity on a straight line

630
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:45,846
and if I know exactly where it is right

631
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,766
now, I can tell with certainty where it

632
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:49,926
has been an hour before. That is a

633
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,182
reduction in time. And I can do that

634
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:54,306
because the formula is linear. It's

635
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:56,874
distance equals velocity multiplied by

636
00:25:56,912 --> 00:26:00,058
time and velocity is constant. If the

637
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,266
watch is broken and I disassemble it and

638
00:26:02,288 --> 00:26:04,906
I find a faulty part and then I put it

639
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:08,846
back together and it works, then it's a

640
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,958
reduction in space. And I can do that

641
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:13,886
because watch is not an end colony to

642
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:17,486
use Daniel's terms. Watch is equal to

643
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:19,934
the collection of its parts. So I wanted

644
00:26:19,972 --> 00:26:22,434
to talk about, Mark, your mention of the

645
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:24,066
predictive hierarchy composed of

646
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:26,660
billions of homeostats in your work.

647
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,506
This is approximate picture. This is not

648
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:30,946
the exact picture of what you talk about

649
00:26:30,968 --> 00:26:32,406
in the new project. And this is from

650
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:34,994
your hidden spring. It's a predictive

651
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,494
hierarchy where predictions flow from

652
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:39,366
left to right and prediction errors from

653
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:43,394
right to left. And one of the statements

654
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:45,066
in the book in the Hidden Spring you say

655
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:47,014
that brain's many complex functions

656
00:26:47,062 --> 00:26:49,338
really can ultimately be reduced to a

657
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:51,866
few simple mechanisms like this. So it

658
00:26:51,888 --> 00:26:55,530
appears that you call it reduction.

659
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,038
But it is a powerful model. It is a

660
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:00,714
flexible model. I wanted to describe

661
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:03,134
some features of it. Well, first of all,

662
00:27:03,172 --> 00:27:05,806
if homeostat is present at every single

663
00:27:05,908 --> 00:27:08,574
scale, then we have this homogeneity of

664
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:11,426
mechanisms throughout the scales. And I

665
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:13,166
want to say that in physics things don't

666
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,346
look this way. Quantum mechanics is the

667
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:17,682
microphysics. Statistical mechanics is

668
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,226
molecular level. Newtonian mechanics is

669
00:27:20,248 --> 00:27:21,506
heavenly bodies. And then we have

670
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:23,294
general theory of relativity. There's

671
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,046
qualitative shifts. There isn't a

672
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:26,726
homogeneity of mechanism all the way

673
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:29,222
throughout. In fact, when people say

674
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,206
take entanglement and they apply to

675
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:32,518
human beings, that's sort of a

676
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:35,606
misunderstanding of entanglement. The

677
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:38,074
second comment is from Mike Eleven who

678
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,242
talks about these scales. And if his

679
00:27:41,296 --> 00:27:43,114
comment is that you could have different

680
00:27:43,152 --> 00:27:45,306
functional spaces at every scale where

681
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:47,162
you could solve the genetic task on one

682
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:49,146
scale, electrochemical on another,

683
00:27:49,248 --> 00:27:51,486
morphological on the third one. And then

684
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:53,198
how you do message passing, what is the

685
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,810
common language is not a trivial

686
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,850
question. Along the same lines,

687
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,950
I've already mentioned that a message

688
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,286
between the scales can be nonlinear if

689
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:04,386
you do prediction errors. Now if you

690
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:06,226
take one nonlinear message and then you

691
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:08,338
multiply it by billions, you're going to

692
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:10,226
have a full on turbulence, which is a

693
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:12,662
chaotic system, it's a dynamical system

694
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:15,174
and turbulence you cannot reduce to

695
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:17,846
homeostat or anything else. Saying that

696
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:20,150
water consists of H 20 does not explain

697
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,806
turbulence. So I don't know, that's an

698
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,394
open question. But I wanted to maybe

699
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:27,660
share some perceptions of this model.

700
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,034
This I talked about and this is the

701
00:28:31,072 --> 00:28:33,046
Friston's thought about phase transition

702
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,786
and the attracting set. He said that if

703
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:37,206
you have a hierarchy of Lorenzo

704
00:28:37,238 --> 00:28:39,614
tractors, a slower one and a faster one

705
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:41,406
and a slower one governing the

706
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,938
transitions of the faster Lorenzo

707
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,746
tractor, then you could have a FEP

708
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:46,462
formulation with an attracting set

709
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,590
experiencing changes and transitions.

710
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,926
And that's brilliant, I think. And it

711
00:28:50,948 --> 00:28:52,366
matches the anatomy because the

712
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:54,382
brainstem and the subcortical structures

713
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,270
appear to be slower. Lorenzo tractor

714
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,986
that could be seen as governing the

715
00:28:58,008 --> 00:28:59,986
transitions of the cortex, which is

716
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:02,606
astral Lorenzo tractor. I know I'm

717
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:04,206
oversimplifying things a great deal,

718
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:06,358
but it sort of misses his thoughts. I

719
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:08,006
think him and Lancelor de Costa are

720
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:09,666
working on that. Perhaps Maxwell

721
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:11,366
Ramstead's group is working on that as

722
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:14,406
well. The clinical applications, the

723
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:15,702
landscape that I've mentioned before

724
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,546
would be absolutely lovely to see if we

725
00:29:17,568 --> 00:29:20,374
were to consider going there borderline

726
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:22,506
personality disorder or another term for

727
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,314
that could be complex trauma. The

728
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,974
metaphor that we use for these patients

729
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:28,098
is they're predictably unpredictable.

730
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:30,634
That the only thing we know on Wednesday

731
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:32,046
that we don't know what's going to come

732
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:34,986
up. Suggesting chaoticity acute trauma

733
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:36,842
has a symptom of hyperarousal,

734
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:38,558
suggesting possibly higher level of

735
00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:40,878
chaoticity. An onset of mania can be

736
00:29:40,884 --> 00:29:42,402
seen as a transition into a higher

737
00:29:42,456 --> 00:29:44,222
energy state and addictions,

738
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:45,666
particularly with stimulants, can be

739
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:47,614
seen as phase transitions into a chaotic

740
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:50,306
state. It may sound like what I said now

741
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:52,386
is contradictory to what I said before

742
00:29:52,488 --> 00:29:55,486
when I suggested that lower chaoticity

743
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:57,158
could be a problem, such as an onset of

744
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:58,902
a seizure. And here I'm saying higher

745
00:29:58,956 --> 00:30:01,254
chaoticity can be a problem, but that

746
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:02,886
would only be a contradiction in the

747
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:05,266
linear world. In the real world, where

748
00:30:05,308 --> 00:30:07,594
linear is very small percentage of

749
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:10,154
what's happening, I'm saying both that

750
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:11,866
too little and too much chaos could be a

751
00:30:11,888 --> 00:30:14,374
problem. Just enough chaos imbalance

752
00:30:14,422 --> 00:30:16,826
could be perfectly fine. This is a

753
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,506
graphical illustration of what can be

754
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:20,174
done. This is from my colleague and

755
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:21,866
friend David Pinkus, who is a professor

756
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:23,534
in Sheppin University and I think also

757
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,806
former president of the Society for

758
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:28,494
Chaos and Psychology Society. These are

759
00:30:28,532 --> 00:30:30,110
trees. It may sound like completely

760
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,578
unrelated to what we do, except if you

761
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:34,978
look at a human lung or dendrites in a

762
00:30:34,984 --> 00:30:38,386
neuron and you can see a healthy tree on

763
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:41,406
the right from me and a nearly dead tree

764
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:45,042
on the left. And if you do the fractal

765
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:47,026
assessment, fractal dimension assessment

766
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:48,886
on them by counting the thickness of

767
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:50,406
branches and count the number of

768
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,774
branches at each level, then you can

769
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:55,530
quantify and then you can have

770
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,626
approximate quantification of health and

771
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,930
resilience versus pathology.

772
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,354
And again, as exotic as it may sound,

773
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:05,226
this is very similar to what people do

774
00:31:05,248 --> 00:31:06,846
when they detect a seizure on the AG.

775
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,986
They measure CD correlational dimension,

776
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,634
which is approximately fractal

777
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:13,886
dimension. And I think my

778
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:16,206
30 minutes are up. Thank you so much for

779
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:16,990
your attention.

780
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,956
Thank you, Lexi. Great presentation.

781
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:25,904
Well, looking forward to this

782
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:28,592
discussion. First, Mark, please feel

783
00:31:28,646 --> 00:31:31,472
free to add your reflections. Then

784
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:33,970
Andrea, then we'll continue on.

785
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,930
Thanks very much.

786
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,164
When Alexi asked me if I would join this

787
00:31:42,282 --> 00:31:44,808
panel, the first thing that I said to

788
00:31:44,814 --> 00:31:47,512
him was yes, coupled with. The second

789
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:50,184
thing being, but please be aware that I

790
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:52,132
know next to nothing about chaos theory.

791
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:56,330
So I'm not sure how much

792
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,036
of a contribution I can make to a

793
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:03,020
technical discussion of this

794
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,792
kind. So I'm just repeating

795
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:10,236
that before I say anything else. If I

796
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:12,572
say anything that sounds amateur, that

797
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:14,976
sounds as if this guy doesn't know what

798
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:16,416
he's talking about when it comes to

799
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:18,336
chaos theory. It's because I'm an

800
00:32:18,358 --> 00:32:19,948
amateur and I don't know what I'm

801
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:21,532
talking about when it comes to chaos

802
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:24,470
theory. That said,

803
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,616
the second thing I want to say is I'm

804
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:32,196
not entirely sure what is at stake here.

805
00:32:32,378 --> 00:32:35,188
It seems as if Alexei feels that it's

806
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:39,208
really important that I

807
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:42,872
and our colleagues get our head

808
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:46,104
around chaos theory and bring some

809
00:32:46,142 --> 00:32:49,708
of what it has to offer into

810
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:54,284
our field. Because I don't know much

811
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,296
about it. I don't know what's at stake,

812
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:58,776
you see. I don't know why that's

813
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:02,364
important. So perhaps somewhere

814
00:33:02,412 --> 00:33:04,896
along the line in the next just less

815
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:06,940
than an hour that we have, perhaps,

816
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,810
Alexi, you can clarify that for us.

817
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,070
The third thing I wanted to say is,

818
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,756
and perhaps in order to illustrate the

819
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:20,452
first thing is that as Alexei was

820
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:23,172
talking now, it seemed as if he was

821
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:25,784
talking about chaos, as if it were

822
00:33:25,822 --> 00:33:29,272
synonymous with stochasticity or

823
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:32,840
randomness. And that's not my

824
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,380
understanding. My very limited

825
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,236
understanding of chaos theory was that

826
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:42,030
it's not synonymous. Chaos, as used

827
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,460
in that science or in that theory,

828
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,284
is not synonymous with randomness. It's

829
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,880
rather synonymous with unpredictability.

830
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,244
Because we don't know the initial

831
00:33:57,292 --> 00:33:58,924
conditions of the system, or we can't

832
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:01,792
specify all the variables with

833
00:34:01,846 --> 00:34:04,384
sufficient precision in their initial

834
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:06,244
conditions, it becomes impossible to

835
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:09,476
predict. And because of the nature of

836
00:34:09,498 --> 00:34:11,728
the interrelationships of the variables,

837
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:15,064
one tiny little error in your

838
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:17,624
estimation of the initial conditions can

839
00:34:17,662 --> 00:34:20,376
lead to massive consequences. And this

840
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,360
is why it's so hard to predict

841
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,728
chaotic systems. So if that

842
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:31,850
is what is meant, then I would say,

843
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,412
Stuart, of course this applies to

844
00:34:36,546 --> 00:34:38,636
the way that the mind works and the way

845
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:41,928
that the brain works. But that leads me

846
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,984
back to my second point. I'm not sure

847
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:46,384
what's at stake, but I would say, if

848
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:48,268
that's what you're asking, if that's

849
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:51,116
what you're claiming, rather, Alexey,

850
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:54,916
then I would say that surely must be so,

851
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:57,604
that it is exceedingly difficult to

852
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:01,184
predict mental and neural

853
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:04,500
events at any level of complexity.

854
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,424
Now, I think I've said three things.

855
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:14,232
Let me now say a fourth thing. I think

856
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:17,724
that a crucial well,

857
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:21,452
let me put it this way. Of course, what

858
00:35:21,506 --> 00:35:24,684
the brain and mind are trying to

859
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:28,716
do, it's a matter of trying to

860
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:31,536
predict what's going to happen. So what

861
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:34,160
I've just said about how difficult it is

862
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,304
to predict what's going to happen in the

863
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:40,256
brain or mind it's almost the

864
00:35:40,278 --> 00:35:43,812
same thing as to say that the mind

865
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:47,110
and brain are trying to model the world.

866
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,084
That's the main thing that we are trying

867
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:53,860
to do is have a good model

868
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,352
of the world so that we can get some

869
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:00,600
sort of grip on this chaos,

870
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,460
so that we can act rationally

871
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,956
in the sense that we can act in

872
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:12,124
order to preserve ourselves that we do

873
00:36:12,162 --> 00:36:16,044
not dissipate by

874
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:20,240
just exploring all possible states and

875
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,624
no longer existing as a system. Because

876
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:25,856
we, as systems, need to remain within

877
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:28,272
certain bounds across a great many

878
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:32,560
variables. As you said, we can't

879
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,124
afford to just let shit happen and

880
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:41,156
throw ourselves to

881
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:44,616
its fates. We need to try to predict in

882
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:48,104
a very unpredictable world. What must I

883
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:50,936
do in order to meet this need, given how

884
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,944
the world works? So the brain is trying

885
00:36:53,982 --> 00:36:58,030
to model the world. Our predictive model

886
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,748
is trying to synchronize itself with the

887
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,924
world. And for that reason it's going to

888
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:09,036
be very chaotic. But the

889
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:11,788
crucial point is it's trying to reduce

890
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:13,360
the unpredictability.

891
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,208
With that said, I'll make a fifth point,

892
00:37:18,294 --> 00:37:20,396
or maybe it's another part of my fourth

893
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:22,500
point. No, I think it's a fifth point,

894
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,980
which is that the way that I

895
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,596
conceptualize the predictive model and

896
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:31,316
it's not me alone who does this is that

897
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:34,704
it is a hierarchical model. And I think

898
00:37:34,762 --> 00:37:36,836
that's very important. And perhaps

899
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:39,816
here's where things do start, where it

900
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,064
starts to at least in my mind, I start

901
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:47,188
to see some of what's at stake. I think

902
00:37:47,294 --> 00:37:50,076
that the more peripheral layers of the

903
00:37:50,098 --> 00:37:52,616
predictive model I see the predictive

904
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:56,380
model not as a triangle, but rather

905
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:01,020
as an onion. So the core is the deepest

906
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,210
layers of the model. That is to say,

907
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,800
the layers that have the greatest

908
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,140
spatial and temporal generalizability

909
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,308
and they're the most stable layers of

910
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:18,628
the model. And as we move toward the

911
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:20,356
periphery, which coincides with the

912
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:23,652
periphery of the nervous system,

913
00:38:23,706 --> 00:38:26,184
in other words, the encounter with the

914
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:29,624
outside world, so it

915
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:31,240
becomes more chaotic,

916
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,360
we can tolerate more unpredictability

917
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:44,156
at the periphery and

918
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:46,792
that also allows for greater accuracy

919
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:48,904
because the world is so unpredictable.

920
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:52,776
We have a more chaotic outer

921
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:56,224
layer of our predictive model where

922
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:58,176
things also there's less that's at

923
00:38:58,198 --> 00:39:00,176
stake. Is that car going to turn left or

924
00:39:00,198 --> 00:39:01,488
right? Well, I thought it was going to

925
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:03,296
turn left, turn right. So what? Doesn't

926
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:07,028
matter. But is the

927
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:09,152
car going to obey the laws of gravity

928
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:10,950
that matters more?

929
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,332
That's a much more consequential

930
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:18,964
surprise if it does not. And perhaps

931
00:39:19,012 --> 00:39:21,816
that's a silly analogy, but at least it

932
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:24,200
illustrates the general point, our most

933
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,280
heartfelt beliefs,

934
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,904
and that is to say, the deepest

935
00:39:31,032 --> 00:39:33,752
layers of our predictive hierarchy.

936
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:37,724
There we find the same patterns over and

937
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:41,216
again and we

938
00:39:41,238 --> 00:39:44,496
are more certain of our predictions and

939
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:47,264
we act more stereotypically in

940
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,816
accordance with them, whereas at the

941
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:53,876
periphery that does not apply.

942
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,996
So I think at one point in your

943
00:39:57,098 --> 00:39:59,860
presentation, Alexi, you were saying

944
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,324
something like one size doesn't fit all.

945
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:04,436
It's not all, just one mechanism. All

946
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,600
the way down. Of course, I completely

947
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,896
agree with that. It's not

948
00:40:09,918 --> 00:40:12,088
just one mechanism. The different

949
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:14,296
homeostats that you were referring to on

950
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:16,740
there different scales are also serving

951
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,212
different needs and there's not a common

952
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:21,644
currency. I think that's a very

953
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:25,112
important part of how consciousness

954
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:27,724
works. Why we have qualia at all is

955
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:29,548
because we can't reduce things to a

956
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,004
common currency. We're dealing with

957
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:34,096
categorical variables, at the very

958
00:40:34,118 --> 00:40:36,192
least, in relation to our bodily needs.

959
00:40:36,246 --> 00:40:38,800
They are categorically distinct needs

960
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,544
and they need to be treated as such.

961
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:41,932
And this is why we have different

962
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,244
feelings in relation to these different

963
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,804
categories of free energy.

964
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:51,764
So those are some of the main things I

965
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:53,664
wanted to say just to get the ball

966
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:55,784
rolling. I'm mindful of the fact that

967
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:59,320
Andrea Clarici only has 15

968
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,336
more minutes with us. So maybe I

969
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:05,624
can pick up on some other points later.

970
00:41:05,822 --> 00:41:08,844
But at this stage, let me hand over to

971
00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:10,830
Andrea. Thank you.

972
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,554
Can you hear me now? Yes, sorry.

973
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:29,098
I will try also to articulate something

974
00:41:29,184 --> 00:41:33,210
of the very fascinating paper of Alexia.

975
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,854
I must confess, since I'm also a

976
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:37,726
psychoanalytic psychotherapist, a

977
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:40,446
psychiatrist. It's not my field. I'm not

978
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:44,242
a physicist, so I can really say few

979
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:48,082
words. Some is of, as I said

980
00:41:48,136 --> 00:41:51,122
already, fascination, because in

981
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:54,718
general, I hate to stick to rigid

982
00:41:54,894 --> 00:41:58,834
theories. So if there is a paper like

983
00:41:58,872 --> 00:42:02,754
Alexia who can chaoticize my theories,

984
00:42:02,882 --> 00:42:06,994
even in psychoanalysis, in the workings

985
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:10,060
of the mind and the brain, I'm happy to

986
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,100
dive into it. At the same time,

987
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,380
I don't have the skills to discuss

988
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:24,606
the math part of his papers or even the

989
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:28,174
physical formulas and so on. But I

990
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,374
was reminded of a very early and I think

991
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:34,718
you all know that book Jacques Monot

992
00:42:34,814 --> 00:42:38,546
Chance and Necessity, which is a

993
00:42:38,568 --> 00:42:41,074
classic. And I think it's a book in

994
00:42:41,112 --> 00:42:45,234
which you can from

995
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:48,678
scratch. I mean, here that our aim in

996
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:52,130
the world. And I know I'm

997
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,280
sounding theological, but we have

998
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,862
theological aims.

999
00:43:02,006 --> 00:43:04,842
In order to stay alive, we have to face

1000
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:09,546
chance and chaos. So I think this is in

1001
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:12,302
order to survive and reproduce, we have

1002
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,950
to have a mathematical

1003
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:20,622
system to reduce chaos and to bring

1004
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:22,922
up again determinism or psychic

1005
00:43:22,986 --> 00:43:26,318
determinism. Since one of the points

1006
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:32,306
that Lexie, I think, raised is can

1007
00:43:32,328 --> 00:43:35,582
we still hold the point of Freud's about

1008
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:38,806
psychic determinism? And I think if

1009
00:43:38,828 --> 00:43:42,534
you apply not to the physics of

1010
00:43:42,652 --> 00:43:44,630
just materialism.

1011
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:49,290
Of. Things, actually, but to the living

1012
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,474
organism, I think we do. This is my

1013
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:56,922
point, and I would like to hear

1014
00:43:56,976 --> 00:44:01,162
what Alexia says. In the end, the chaos

1015
00:44:01,226 --> 00:44:04,030
theory. Mathematics,

1016
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,926
as far as I understand it, must be a

1017
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:10,510
mathematics who reduce chance or chaos

1018
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,650
to a linearity, at least in the living

1019
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,242
organism. And I wonder if and

1020
00:44:20,296 --> 00:44:22,740
what Alexia thinks about it,

1021
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,780
because he seems to disagree with that.

1022
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,942
Want to give a direct response, lexi or

1023
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:33,926
then Brynn and Albert be awesome to hear

1024
00:44:33,948 --> 00:44:36,226
your takes as well, some of the thoughts

1025
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:39,190
from Mark and from Andrea. Should I

1026
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,962
start by responding to Andrea's points

1027
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:42,970
or marks?

1028
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,538
Maybe I'll start by because I think the

1029
00:44:48,624 --> 00:44:50,474
key point that Mark you brought up is

1030
00:44:50,512 --> 00:44:52,954
what's at stake is still unclear. My

1031
00:44:52,992 --> 00:44:54,606
impression is, and please correct me if

1032
00:44:54,628 --> 00:44:56,542
I'm wrong I was very influenced, Mark,

1033
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:58,654
by your paper. I forgot exactly, the

1034
00:44:58,692 --> 00:45:00,062
journal where you talked about

1035
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:02,766
psychiatry world, how these sort of

1036
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:05,106
convention based diagnosis of here is a

1037
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:06,706
major depressive disorder, here's a

1038
00:45:06,728 --> 00:45:08,866
bipolar disorder, nothing of which has

1039
00:45:08,888 --> 00:45:11,986
to do with etiology convention and

1040
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:15,010
statistics. And then you brought up this

1041
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,606
revolutionary thing with effective

1042
00:45:16,638 --> 00:45:18,246
neuroscience where you talked about the

1043
00:45:18,268 --> 00:45:21,622
manic state and the depression state and

1044
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:24,486
tied into the punk subsystem, I think is

1045
00:45:24,508 --> 00:45:26,694
extraordinary. But what I wanted to say

1046
00:45:26,732 --> 00:45:29,014
is if we look at how we diagnose and

1047
00:45:29,052 --> 00:45:30,806
think about what's happening, and we

1048
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,490
look at the language of how we do it,

1049
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,746
it is still a deterministic language at

1050
00:45:34,768 --> 00:45:36,998
the end of the day. So when we moved

1051
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:39,034
from DSM Four to DSM Five, we

1052
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:40,854
brilliantly discovered that continuous

1053
00:45:40,902 --> 00:45:42,634
variables exist. We used to have

1054
00:45:42,672 --> 00:45:44,426
buckets. Everything was in a separate

1055
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:46,318
bucket. And then we said autism is a

1056
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:48,638
spectrum, and everybody applauded, but

1057
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:50,558
mathematicians were quietly laughing in

1058
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:51,934
the corner. Because, of course,

1059
00:45:51,972 --> 00:45:54,746
continuous variables exist, but we don't

1060
00:45:54,778 --> 00:45:57,326
do dynamics. We're still very static.

1061
00:45:57,438 --> 00:45:59,618
Here's this clear cut thing. And this is

1062
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,634
the clear cut continuous thing, right?

1063
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:03,826
And my impression I may be wrong, is

1064
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:06,206
that even in our neuropsychoanalytic

1065
00:46:06,238 --> 00:46:07,474
developments, we still do things

1066
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:09,554
deterministically. We assess which

1067
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:11,174
bucket things belong to, or maybe two

1068
00:46:11,212 --> 00:46:12,614
buckets at the same time, or three

1069
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:16,294
buckets. But we don't do things like how

1070
00:46:16,332 --> 00:46:18,646
the chaotic systems are qualitatively

1071
00:46:18,678 --> 00:46:20,086
different from static things. I'm

1072
00:46:20,118 --> 00:46:22,234
quoting William Solis. They have

1073
00:46:22,272 --> 00:46:24,534
transients, they have contextuality,

1074
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:27,786
and they have emergence. We don't do

1075
00:46:27,968 --> 00:46:31,146
know. And I think that if we embrace the

1076
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:32,606
chaos theory, if we do things like

1077
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:34,638
correlational dimension assessment or

1078
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:36,910
fractal dimension assessment, starting

1079
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,926
from the system of classification of

1080
00:46:38,948 --> 00:46:41,086
emotions, they're still buckets. Here is

1081
00:46:41,108 --> 00:46:43,218
a clear cut thing called fear. That's a

1082
00:46:43,224 --> 00:46:45,182
clear cut thing called rage. Buckets

1083
00:46:45,246 --> 00:46:48,354
determinism, okay? And they look

1084
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:50,046
differently in the dynamical systems

1085
00:46:50,078 --> 00:46:52,146
world. And then the system of

1086
00:46:52,168 --> 00:46:54,034
psychopathology could look like

1087
00:46:54,152 --> 00:46:56,742
correlational dimension changed and not

1088
00:46:56,796 --> 00:46:59,398
that somebody fell into a bucket. If we

1089
00:46:59,404 --> 00:47:01,446
look at this complex landscape of

1090
00:47:01,468 --> 00:47:03,794
attractors and repellers and examine

1091
00:47:03,842 --> 00:47:06,466
psychodynamic things like please forgive

1092
00:47:06,498 --> 00:47:09,366
me if I'm incorrect, but one of the

1093
00:47:09,388 --> 00:47:11,126
possible definitions of repression could

1094
00:47:11,148 --> 00:47:12,890
be seen as not letting things into

1095
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,986
consciousness. Maybe we can call it

1096
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:16,586
suppression. But what I'm trying to say

1097
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:18,554
is I don't want to think that right now.

1098
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:21,626
It hurts. It's a painful thing that in

1099
00:47:21,648 --> 00:47:23,326
the terminology that I shared, is a

1100
00:47:23,348 --> 00:47:25,454
repeller. And perhaps when you work

1101
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:27,066
through things in a psychodynamic,

1102
00:47:27,098 --> 00:47:29,498
psychotherapy, perhaps you put a scar

1103
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,726
tissue on the wound, it becomes less of

1104
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:35,066
a sharp repeller, and it smooths

1105
00:47:35,098 --> 00:47:39,026
out. We don't diagnose like

1106
00:47:39,048 --> 00:47:40,446
that. We don't treat like that. We don't

1107
00:47:40,478 --> 00:47:43,006
think like that. One paper that I'm

1108
00:47:43,038 --> 00:47:44,738
working on that is in peer review right

1109
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:46,882
now and I can't share too much, says

1110
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:49,618
that we think like storytellers. I'm

1111
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:52,630
quoting Daniel Kahneman. Our thinking

1112
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,086
mind of a clinician is not a

1113
00:47:54,108 --> 00:47:56,406
statistician. We don't think in

1114
00:47:56,428 --> 00:47:59,126
probabilities, we think in labels and we

1115
00:47:59,148 --> 00:48:01,366
think in stories. And I know you had

1116
00:48:01,388 --> 00:48:03,246
this powerful quote, Mark, from Freud

1117
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,666
who said that that's the nature of the

1118
00:48:04,688 --> 00:48:06,822
mind. And I most respectfully disagree

1119
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:08,426
that that's the entire nature of the

1120
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:10,426
mind. I do think that we have things on

1121
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:12,798
the mind that are not stories and not

1122
00:48:12,884 --> 00:48:15,246
words. So if the nature of the

1123
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,982
phenomenon is chaotic and stochastic and

1124
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:20,506
periodic, then we can use appropriate

1125
00:48:20,538 --> 00:48:23,694
mechanisms to diagnose and classify that

1126
00:48:23,732 --> 00:48:27,074
fits the nature of the model. The second

1127
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,958
thing you said chaos and stochasticity,

1128
00:48:29,054 --> 00:48:30,638
I absolutely agree with you that they're

1129
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:32,862
different. On the chart that I've shown,

1130
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:34,770
if you converge to a stable,

1131
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,630
chaos is deterministic, forward

1132
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,866
deterministic. So if initial conditions

1133
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:43,446
are changing, they will diverge. But you

1134
00:48:43,468 --> 00:48:45,622
can predict things forward, not back.

1135
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,354
But there is no formula in a stochastic

1136
00:48:48,402 --> 00:48:50,178
thing, you throw the coin. You don't

1137
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:51,490
know. You have no predictability

1138
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,074
whatsoever, short term or third or long

1139
00:48:54,112 --> 00:48:56,106
term. So they are different. And in the

1140
00:48:56,128 --> 00:48:57,146
sense that you're talking to

1141
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:58,870
sensitivity, to initial conditions,

1142
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,986
this is music to my heart to hear you to

1143
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:02,506
say that you acknowledge that

1144
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:04,446
curioticity clearly is present in the

1145
00:49:04,468 --> 00:49:06,906
brain, on which level of the hierarchy

1146
00:49:06,938 --> 00:49:08,958
in your model is a very important thing.

1147
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:10,842
But again, when we draw this picture,

1148
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,054
whether it's a triangle or an onion with

1149
00:49:13,092 --> 00:49:15,598
a core and layers, it's a static model.

1150
00:49:15,764 --> 00:49:17,246
And when you acknowledge that there's

1151
00:49:17,278 --> 00:49:18,658
higher unpredictability toward the

1152
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,738
periphery, it could be, but there could

1153
00:49:20,744 --> 00:49:22,546
be dynamics about the structure of the

1154
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:24,594
model. And perhaps what you're saying is

1155
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:28,066
survival. Like I must breathe and I

1156
00:49:28,088 --> 00:49:30,086
must breathe air and I'm not in the

1157
00:49:30,108 --> 00:49:31,554
water. And that is a very stable

1158
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:34,086
prediction. Absolutely. But when we deal

1159
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:35,734
with psychopathology and we deal with

1160
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:38,166
things like shame and pride and awe and

1161
00:49:38,188 --> 00:49:41,242
other things, then I wonder if we should

1162
00:49:41,296 --> 00:49:43,498
continue to use this metaphor of a

1163
00:49:43,504 --> 00:49:45,354
homeostat. I really don't see how

1164
00:49:45,392 --> 00:49:47,498
homeostat applies to gamma written in

1165
00:49:47,504 --> 00:49:51,830
the brain or to shame. And homeostat

1166
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,886
is the convergent systems so that you

1167
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:56,526
minimize entropy by keeping things in

1168
00:49:56,548 --> 00:49:58,142
the range. However, if you dive inside

1169
00:49:58,196 --> 00:49:59,726
the homeostat, if you look at the

1170
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:01,546
temperature variation inside a narrow

1171
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:03,826
range, you may see chaos, which is

1172
00:50:03,848 --> 00:50:05,620
exactly the picture that I saw,

1173
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,050
that I showed.

1174
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:14,274
And to Andrea's point about

1175
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:15,694
the Freud's principle of psychic

1176
00:50:15,742 --> 00:50:17,766
determinism yes, I honestly think that

1177
00:50:17,788 --> 00:50:20,294
we haven't said goodbye to that. We

1178
00:50:20,332 --> 00:50:23,170
haven't tried to say that chance exists

1179
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,230
in the mental life. Accidents exist.

1180
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,126
We don't do that. There's a firm

1181
00:50:29,158 --> 00:50:30,918
tradition in psychoanalytic,

1182
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:32,266
psychotherapy, to say there's no

1183
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:34,778
accidents it's all determined. That's a

1184
00:50:34,784 --> 00:50:37,386
major key point of the discussion. I

1185
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:39,260
don't know if I said too much.

1186
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,920
Maybe, andrea, if you want to give any

1187
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,478
thoughts or how do you want things to

1188
00:50:46,484 --> 00:50:47,854
continue in the coming minutes and

1189
00:50:47,892 --> 00:50:50,366
years? Okay, thank you. Thank you,

1190
00:50:50,388 --> 00:50:53,534
Daniel. Just adding a word that I didn't

1191
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:55,346
use because I think it's very important

1192
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:58,274
about trying to defend the point about

1193
00:50:58,312 --> 00:51:01,854
psychic determinism, which I'm very fond

1194
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:05,278
of. I mean, the word is adaptation. I

1195
00:51:05,384 --> 00:51:09,206
have difficulties because when you see a

1196
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,398
psychotic patient, when you see a

1197
00:51:11,404 --> 00:51:13,702
borderline patient, well, I don't see

1198
00:51:13,756 --> 00:51:16,790
chaos or total unpredictability.

1199
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:22,230
I see adaptation, their disruptions.

1200
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:27,654
I try to understand what are

1201
00:51:27,692 --> 00:51:31,440
the even the part

1202
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,694
behind that, in my opinion, has to

1203
00:51:35,812 --> 00:51:39,194
have a tendency toward

1204
00:51:39,242 --> 00:51:42,254
an order, which is adaptive. In this

1205
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:46,082
way, I see the mathematical part

1206
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:51,410
of chaos may be of use, but bringing

1207
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,518
to an explanation maybe not to an order

1208
00:51:55,624 --> 00:51:59,382
or to a determinism, but to a point

1209
00:51:59,436 --> 00:52:02,354
in which there must be this adaptive

1210
00:52:02,402 --> 00:52:05,654
reason even in the chaos. Do you see my

1211
00:52:05,692 --> 00:52:09,334
point? I do. But I think

1212
00:52:09,372 --> 00:52:11,418
there's a deeper issue about how we

1213
00:52:11,584 --> 00:52:12,966
know. Say there's a clinician

1214
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:15,306
psychoanalytic psychotherapist. We have

1215
00:52:15,328 --> 00:52:17,514
a working memory. And the Miller's law

1216
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,098
that, Mark, you quote a lot about the

1217
00:52:19,104 --> 00:52:22,566
seven units of information in the audio

1218
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,078
verbal work in memory. I think in the

1219
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:25,582
Miller's paper, he actually said seven

1220
00:52:25,636 --> 00:52:28,766
chunks. So I'm sharing something from

1221
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:31,082
the paper in Review right now. We cannot

1222
00:52:31,146 --> 00:52:32,686
think probabilistically because it

1223
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,734
overloads the work in memory. This is

1224
00:52:34,772 --> 00:52:36,586
why when I'm a clinician, I think about

1225
00:52:36,628 --> 00:52:38,674
psychosis, I come up with a story, a

1226
00:52:38,712 --> 00:52:40,786
formulation that fits in the work in

1227
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:43,074
memory, and this influences our work.

1228
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:45,106
We don't have the mathematics in here to

1229
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,606
think in the terms of probabilistic

1230
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:48,434
things and chaos theory and other

1231
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:50,838
things. We need tools to do that. And in

1232
00:52:50,844 --> 00:52:52,610
mainstream neurology, they use tools.

1233
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:54,386
They do talk to the patient that examine

1234
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:56,326
the patient. But they have MRI, they

1235
00:52:56,348 --> 00:52:58,278
have EHE, they have Pescan and all the

1236
00:52:58,284 --> 00:52:59,778
other things. In psychoanalytic

1237
00:52:59,794 --> 00:53:01,434
psychotherapy, we say, we don't need any

1238
00:53:01,472 --> 00:53:03,418
tools. We just talk to a person, and

1239
00:53:03,424 --> 00:53:05,514
that is sufficient for everything we do.

1240
00:53:05,632 --> 00:53:07,162
But that's not necessarily true.

1241
00:53:07,216 --> 00:53:09,734
Beatrice Bibi, who is a psychoanalyst,

1242
00:53:09,782 --> 00:53:11,946
works with mother infant diet, and

1243
00:53:11,968 --> 00:53:14,622
there's zero words exchanged zilch. But

1244
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:16,586
she looks at this movie that she records

1245
00:53:16,618 --> 00:53:19,294
on a video camera, and then she shows it

1246
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:22,506
in a slow motion. So she takes a flow,

1247
00:53:22,538 --> 00:53:24,686
which is dynamic flow, not words, not

1248
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:26,786
discrete things. And then she slows it

1249
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:28,466
down and she shows the level of

1250
00:53:28,488 --> 00:53:30,306
attunement between the mother and the

1251
00:53:30,328 --> 00:53:33,426
child. We don't do things like that.

1252
00:53:33,608 --> 00:53:36,318
We talk and we use these deterministic

1253
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:38,062
things to understand the psychopathology

1254
00:53:38,126 --> 00:53:39,810
of the patient, saying that's psychosis

1255
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,526
and that's schizophrenia, and that is

1256
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:43,526
bipolar one. This is panic system and

1257
00:53:43,548 --> 00:53:45,266
this is seeking system. We determine

1258
00:53:45,298 --> 00:53:47,682
everything. And that is a limitation

1259
00:53:47,826 --> 00:53:49,906
because inside, I believe what is a fear

1260
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,658
cascade? How does fear stop? It's a

1261
00:53:51,664 --> 00:53:54,554
flow. It's a turbulent thing. And we put

1262
00:53:54,592 --> 00:53:56,886
one label on it, say fear. We've

1263
00:53:56,918 --> 00:53:59,158
classified it. So for some things it's

1264
00:53:59,174 --> 00:54:00,666
appropriate, but for some things, it may

1265
00:54:00,688 --> 00:54:04,286
not be, as Einstein said,

1266
00:54:04,388 --> 00:54:06,654
as Mark. You quoted Einstein as simple

1267
00:54:06,692 --> 00:54:08,718
as possible, but more simpler than that.

1268
00:54:08,884 --> 00:54:12,206
So at which point we are missing or

1269
00:54:12,228 --> 00:54:13,554
missing the phenomenon by using

1270
00:54:13,592 --> 00:54:16,786
deterministic tools in our work. Thank

1271
00:54:16,808 --> 00:54:19,102
you, Alex. Thank you. Thank you, Daniel

1272
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:21,458
and Mark. To everyone. Thank you. I have

1273
00:54:21,464 --> 00:54:25,090
to go. Awesome. So Albert

1274
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,726
and then Brynn and we'll continue on

1275
00:54:28,748 --> 00:54:32,438
this topic. Yeah, thank you

1276
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:33,974
for the presentation and a very

1277
00:54:34,012 --> 00:54:36,966
interesting discussion so far. One thing

1278
00:54:36,988 --> 00:54:39,900
that comes to mind is. The.

1279
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,946
Well, the thing we're talking about

1280
00:54:45,968 --> 00:54:48,810
right now, the psychic determinism as

1281
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,190
depicted as being a foundational law in

1282
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,430
psychoanalysis.

1283
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,514
Well, I'm thinking about the authors,

1284
00:54:55,562 --> 00:54:57,774
the psychoanalytic authors who came the

1285
00:54:57,812 --> 00:55:00,110
prominent ones who came after Freud,

1286
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,160
who seem to. Have.

1287
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,926
Room for this chaos.

1288
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:10,850
Maybe they didn't use this term

1289
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,026
explicitly, but I'm thinking, for

1290
00:55:13,048 --> 00:55:15,266
example, Wilfred Bjong, who's got the

1291
00:55:15,288 --> 00:55:18,822
notion of the O layer, which has

1292
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:21,960
connotations of well, the thing that

1293
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,494
cannot be known or categorized, who has,

1294
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:27,798
like, indeterminate elements of the

1295
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:29,880
mind. And that's one of his major

1296
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,618
contributions to psychoanalysis. On the

1297
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:34,166
other hand, more the French schools.

1298
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,706
I'm thinking of Jacques Lacan, who's got

1299
00:55:35,728 --> 00:55:37,386
the notion of the real, which is also

1300
00:55:37,408 --> 00:55:40,010
one of his major contributions to

1301
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,442
psychoanalysis, where notions of

1302
00:55:42,496 --> 00:55:45,514
rupture, of absence, or of lack are very

1303
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:48,158
prominent. I'm not sure I'm not an

1304
00:55:48,164 --> 00:55:50,426
expert here, but I think Lacan

1305
00:55:50,538 --> 00:55:53,794
explicitly challenges the notion of

1306
00:55:53,832 --> 00:55:56,578
Freud's mechanistic worldview in one of

1307
00:55:56,584 --> 00:56:00,066
his seminars. So I'm wondering what you

1308
00:56:00,088 --> 00:56:01,890
think about this, Alexei.

1309
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:07,894
I'm not an expert in Lacan at all, and I

1310
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:10,130
know Wilfred beyond in a limited

1311
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,494
fashion. So perhaps Mark is a better

1312
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:16,230
person to talk.

1313
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,734
And I like Freud. Particularly mark's

1314
00:56:19,782 --> 00:56:21,690
interpretations and translations. But

1315
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,626
maybe Mark can comment on Lacan and

1316
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:26,246
beyond. I'm not sufficiently

1317
00:56:26,438 --> 00:56:28,220
knowledgeable about their work.

1318
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,760
If you want to Mark or Bren, you can

1319
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,330
share some thoughts. Yeah, please.

1320
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,544
Well, I think that the

1321
00:56:44,582 --> 00:56:48,116
point that Albert's making is we

1322
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,564
must remember that psychoanalysis is not

1323
00:56:50,602 --> 00:56:53,284
synonymous with Freud. That not

1324
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:56,340
everything in psychoanalysis stands or

1325
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,124
falls by whether or not we accept this

1326
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:03,704
or that tenet of Freud's. And in

1327
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:06,808
neuropsychoanalysis, we try very much to

1328
00:57:06,974 --> 00:57:10,440
draw upon all of the traditions within

1329
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,584
psychoanalysis. And we sort of fondly

1330
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:18,044
believe that we'll be able to find more

1331
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:20,824
common ground because there are greater

1332
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:22,636
empirical tools available in

1333
00:57:22,658 --> 00:57:24,328
neuropsychoanalysis than in

1334
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:27,916
psychoanalysis by itself. We are hoping

1335
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:31,052
to resolve some of these theoretical

1336
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:33,500
disagreements, trying to move beyond

1337
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,324
just different systems of belief,

1338
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,596
trying to move more toward a

1339
00:57:38,618 --> 00:57:41,152
psychoanalysis in which we can decide

1340
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:43,444
questions in an ordinary scientific way.

1341
00:57:43,562 --> 00:57:45,924
But it will always be very difficult for

1342
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,200
exactly the reason that Alexei's whole

1343
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:52,728
talk is about, I suppose, which is the

1344
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:56,280
extreme complexity and therefore

1345
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,936
unpredictability of the phenomena that

1346
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:04,856
we are dealing with. So I think Albert's

1347
00:58:04,888 --> 00:58:09,576
points are valid. That the beyond's

1348
00:58:09,768 --> 00:58:12,060
approach, Lacan's approach,

1349
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,170
they add a great deal.

1350
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,324
They don't have as much to lose

1351
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:23,056
if we throw out the principle of

1352
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:25,856
psychical determinism. But having said

1353
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,412
that, let me just quickly say a word

1354
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:29,332
about psychical determinism, because

1355
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:32,900
this has been a big part of what Andrea

1356
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,390
picked up on in what Alexey said.

1357
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,984
I think it comes down to the

1358
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:42,868
question that I asked at the outset.

1359
00:58:42,964 --> 00:58:45,944
It's not a matter of is the behavior of

1360
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:49,876
the mind random or it's

1361
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:52,904
a question of how predictable. It's not

1362
00:58:52,942 --> 00:58:55,096
a matter of is there no determinism?

1363
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:58,824
It's a matter of how easily can we trace

1364
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:02,076
effects back to their causes. So the

1365
00:59:02,098 --> 00:59:04,092
fact that there's a great deal that goes

1366
00:59:04,146 --> 00:59:06,648
on where we can't do that. There are

1367
00:59:06,674 --> 00:59:08,752
many things our patients say, whether

1368
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:10,512
they be slips of the tongue or anything

1369
00:59:10,566 --> 00:59:13,104
else of that kind, and not only to do

1370
00:59:13,142 --> 00:59:15,744
with parapraxes, but anything that they

1371
00:59:15,782 --> 00:59:18,516
do. There are certain things that we see

1372
00:59:18,618 --> 00:59:20,900
with regularity. I mean, the very

1373
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,108
phenomenon of transference is all about

1374
00:59:23,194 --> 00:59:25,380
regularities. That there are certain

1375
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:26,870
things that we see. Yes,

1376
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,672
I can understand this

1377
00:59:31,726 --> 00:59:33,880
happens repeatedly.

1378
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,144
I think I can explain that with

1379
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:39,896
reference to certain aspects of the

1380
00:59:39,918 --> 00:59:42,156
patient's inner world and their past,

1381
00:59:42,258 --> 00:59:43,884
but there's a great deal else that we

1382
00:59:43,922 --> 00:59:46,284
can't. So I don't think that it's a kind

1383
00:59:46,322 --> 00:59:49,740
of either there's determinism

1384
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,152
or there's stochasticity. I think

1385
00:59:54,226 --> 00:59:56,752
that this is why I was talking also

1386
00:59:56,806 --> 00:59:58,796
about the layers of the predictive

1387
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:01,776
hierarchy. The deeper layers are the

1388
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,144
unconscious ones. Their things are

1389
01:00:04,182 --> 01:00:07,040
pretty stereotyped,

1390
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,970
pretty predictable, in fact,

1391
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,456
too predictable. I mean, in other words,

1392
01:00:13,558 --> 01:00:17,500
it over generalizes, it's too confident

1393
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,172
about its beliefs. But as we head toward

1394
01:00:21,316 --> 01:00:24,376
the pre conscious and conscious there,

1395
01:00:24,478 --> 01:00:26,440
things are much less predictable.

1396
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,872
So I won't say more.

1397
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:34,076
A couple of things in what Alexei said

1398
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:36,876
in his comments after mine, that if we

1399
01:00:36,898 --> 01:00:39,404
have time, I'll come back to but I think

1400
01:00:39,442 --> 01:00:43,164
let's rather hear from Brin before I say

1401
01:00:43,202 --> 01:00:46,770
anything more. Thank you so much.

1402
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,768
I'm perhaps the least qualified here to

1403
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:54,496
comment on your paper, Alexi, but I do

1404
01:00:54,518 --> 01:00:57,396
have one or two thoughts, and they come

1405
01:00:57,418 --> 01:01:01,568
from a place of being very fortunate

1406
01:01:01,744 --> 01:01:03,636
thus far in my life to have been a

1407
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:06,470
patient for many, many hours,

1408
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:12,296
sometimes on the couch, and also to be a

1409
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:14,216
clinical psychologist. I failed to

1410
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:17,636
mention that in my introduction. So I'm

1411
01:01:17,668 --> 01:01:20,920
a was until recently,

1412
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,212
when my foray began into more research

1413
01:01:25,346 --> 01:01:27,992
based areas, and via the Active

1414
01:01:28,136 --> 01:01:33,116
Inference Institute and Mark's work and

1415
01:01:33,138 --> 01:01:35,748
Cole Friston's work, I was a pure

1416
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:38,016
clinician. I had it in my mind that I

1417
01:01:38,038 --> 01:01:40,656
was going to treat psychopathology to

1418
01:01:40,678 --> 01:01:43,616
the best of my ability. But really it

1419
01:01:43,638 --> 01:01:46,236
was being a patient first and foremost

1420
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:49,910
that brought me into closer contact with

1421
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,660
the theme of your paper and certainly

1422
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,350
the themes of Mark's work.

1423
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,748
And I think I've

1424
01:01:59,764 --> 01:02:02,888
encountered it from both areas. And

1425
01:02:03,054 --> 01:02:07,624
certainly to

1426
01:02:07,662 --> 01:02:10,836
my mind, it matters less the inner

1427
01:02:10,868 --> 01:02:14,620
workings of the degree to which chaos

1428
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,344
stochastic, all these big wonderful

1429
01:02:18,392 --> 01:02:22,590
terms that I'm only beginning to even

1430
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,930
think about. But.

1431
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:32,464
What matters to me is that how

1432
01:02:32,502 --> 01:02:36,368
do you help somebody who is

1433
01:02:36,534 --> 01:02:39,700
in a state, who comes in disheveled?

1434
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:44,704
And how does one go about helping aiding

1435
01:02:44,752 --> 01:02:49,324
somebody in that state? I fell

1436
01:02:49,472 --> 01:02:54,184
out of love with psychoanalysis for

1437
01:02:54,222 --> 01:02:57,864
personal reasons, but it was in

1438
01:02:57,902 --> 01:03:00,328
returning to it, I've become more kind

1439
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:02,376
of better acquainted with its strengths

1440
01:03:02,408 --> 01:03:05,096
and its limitations. And I'm realizing

1441
01:03:05,128 --> 01:03:10,524
that when

1442
01:03:10,642 --> 01:03:13,016
you help somebody and manage to reduce

1443
01:03:13,048 --> 01:03:15,676
the noise, to reduce the chaos in

1444
01:03:15,698 --> 01:03:16,750
somebody's mind,

1445
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,096
when they become the greater degrees of

1446
01:03:22,118 --> 01:03:24,704
health start returning to them, that

1447
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:27,796
they do rely far more, whether they know

1448
01:03:27,818 --> 01:03:30,836
it or not, on probabilistic reasoning in

1449
01:03:30,858 --> 01:03:34,260
their daily kind of functioning.

1450
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,996
And so I think there is a strong case to

1451
01:03:37,018 --> 01:03:41,944
be made for a mathematical way

1452
01:03:41,982 --> 01:03:44,216
of processing the world. It doesn't have

1453
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:46,936
to necessarily be made conscious to the

1454
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:51,384
person. It can be a bit overwhelming to

1455
01:03:51,422 --> 01:03:55,516
try and impart that on somebody. But I

1456
01:03:55,538 --> 01:03:58,620
think a brain that is not working

1457
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,596
properly, regardless of the degree to

1458
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:03,772
which there is chaos, that can be

1459
01:04:03,826 --> 01:04:06,688
measured or quantifiably measured in

1460
01:04:06,694 --> 01:04:09,664
that brain, somebody is tripping over

1461
01:04:09,702 --> 01:04:13,264
themselves because they are

1462
01:04:13,302 --> 01:04:16,608
unable to predict what might happen.

1463
01:04:16,774 --> 01:04:19,164
And that is a terrifying prospect

1464
01:04:19,212 --> 01:04:21,616
because I think there is some reliance

1465
01:04:21,648 --> 01:04:24,676
and some staunch dependability on the

1466
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:26,436
fact that the sun is going to rise and

1467
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,292
that it's going to set and that I can

1468
01:04:28,426 --> 01:04:30,170
then focus on other things.

1469
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,696
So that's just my comments more from

1470
01:04:34,718 --> 01:04:37,384
kind of a personal front of being a

1471
01:04:37,422 --> 01:04:40,484
patient and encountering the limitations

1472
01:04:40,532 --> 01:04:44,236
of psychotherapy and what I

1473
01:04:44,258 --> 01:04:47,148
would have done in those moments of need

1474
01:04:47,314 --> 01:04:50,412
to have not, as you say,

1475
01:04:50,546 --> 01:04:54,044
had a more deterministic view of

1476
01:04:54,082 --> 01:04:56,944
what was happening. And I've tried to

1477
01:04:57,142 --> 01:04:58,992
transfer that or carry that over,

1478
01:04:59,046 --> 01:05:02,764
rightly or wrongly, into my own therapy

1479
01:05:02,892 --> 01:05:04,400
as a psychotherapist.

1480
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,876
So a more personal thing of what it

1481
01:05:07,898 --> 01:05:11,830
means to be feel chaotic and what I

1482
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,510
see, regardless of how confirmed it is

1483
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,932
or not, but chaos reigns

1484
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:23,572
and to try and not compound

1485
01:05:23,636 --> 01:05:27,316
that is certainly something that I'm

1486
01:05:27,348 --> 01:05:31,160
interested. Yeah. Thank you, Bryn.

1487
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,804
I'll also give my thought on what's at

1488
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:36,540
stake and what's on the table as a total

1489
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:39,928
non clinician. But what I saw in Alexi's

1490
01:05:39,944 --> 01:05:42,572
paper and also what I see people coming

1491
01:05:42,626 --> 01:05:46,572
towards I see the paper as Alexi

1492
01:05:46,636 --> 01:05:49,916
making a real stable of concepts

1493
01:05:49,948 --> 01:05:52,896
or portfolio of topics ranging from the

1494
01:05:52,918 --> 01:05:54,556
first principles of active inference

1495
01:05:54,588 --> 01:05:57,244
like surprise bounding, to dynamic

1496
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:59,876
stochastic chaotic, which not the same

1497
01:05:59,898 --> 01:06:02,288
thing, but they sometimes cohabitate.

1498
01:06:02,384 --> 01:06:06,068
So bringing a set of concepts into play,

1499
01:06:06,234 --> 01:06:08,436
making it matter for the field so that

1500
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,328
it can matter for the clinician, so that

1501
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:12,456
it can matter for the patient, which is

1502
01:06:12,478 --> 01:06:14,168
where you totally brought it home to

1503
01:06:14,254 --> 01:06:18,484
Brin. And in my totally simplified

1504
01:06:18,612 --> 01:06:21,920
model, I was seeing all this diagnostic

1505
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,352
machinery from personalized data, EEG

1506
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,356
recordings, all these surveys and

1507
01:06:27,378 --> 01:06:29,304
samples, all the different conversation

1508
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,972
therapy itself, all these different

1509
01:06:31,026 --> 01:06:33,756
measurements, inference. And then it

1510
01:06:33,778 --> 01:06:35,696
passes through the Markov blanket of the

1511
01:06:35,718 --> 01:06:38,416
diagnosis, and it's like, well, now we

1512
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:41,072
know that that person is X or they have

1513
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:44,604
X. And then here's where we now branch

1514
01:06:44,652 --> 01:06:47,376
back out with modalities of treatment.

1515
01:06:47,408 --> 01:06:49,204
And so that bottlenecking has obvious

1516
01:06:49,322 --> 01:06:51,636
relevance in terms of getting a

1517
01:06:51,658 --> 01:06:54,420
categorical grip on what we basically

1518
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:58,176
all agree are wetware complex systems,

1519
01:06:58,208 --> 01:06:59,584
they're sensitive to initial conditions,

1520
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:03,016
all of that. And what if, though, like

1521
01:07:03,038 --> 01:07:04,484
you brought up the example with the scar

1522
01:07:04,532 --> 01:07:07,796
tissue, maybe it's literal bodily scar

1523
01:07:07,828 --> 01:07:09,476
tissue, maybe it's conceptual scar

1524
01:07:09,508 --> 01:07:12,796
tissue. What if that inference were able

1525
01:07:12,818 --> 01:07:15,564
to be understood in the context of an

1526
01:07:15,602 --> 01:07:18,268
attractor landscape? And it's not just a

1527
01:07:18,354 --> 01:07:21,336
singular attractor, so we have multiple

1528
01:07:21,368 --> 01:07:24,740
attractors, we have a chaotic landscape.

1529
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:30,044
And so what if we were able to perforate

1530
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:32,700
that blanket, speaking super loosely,

1531
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:35,280
to bring in what we have already

1532
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:38,320
recognized as diagnostically relevant?

1533
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,660
Like the fact that patients who have

1534
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,932
differential entropy have this or that

1535
01:07:42,986 --> 01:07:45,700
epileptic outcome or coma outcome,

1536
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,388
bring in that machinery that led to the

1537
01:07:48,394 --> 01:07:50,136
diagnosis, but now take it beyond the

1538
01:07:50,158 --> 01:07:53,256
diagnosis and maybe even beyond the

1539
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,264
clinician's concept, directly into the

1540
01:07:56,302 --> 01:07:57,560
hands of the patient?

1541
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,618
Thank you so much. Perhaps we can hear

1542
01:08:07,644 --> 01:08:10,506
from Mark and yeah, I'm not eager to

1543
01:08:10,528 --> 01:08:12,314
talk. If there is time, I'll say

1544
01:08:12,352 --> 01:08:13,900
something, but if not, that's OK.

1545
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,930
Well, let me first of all say something

1546
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,862
about my might.

1547
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:23,674
Some of you have noticed that suddenly

1548
01:08:23,722 --> 01:08:26,026
everything went black behind me. That's

1549
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:28,446
because I'm in South Africa where they

1550
01:08:28,468 --> 01:08:32,098
have power problems. And then a kind

1551
01:08:32,184 --> 01:08:34,194
person in my household thought that they

1552
01:08:34,232 --> 01:08:36,210
would help. And they've put this huge

1553
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,594
spotlight here which is shining in my

1554
01:08:38,632 --> 01:08:39,220
eyes.

1555
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:47,198
If I look as if I'm in a rabbit in

1556
01:08:47,224 --> 01:08:49,238
headlights, it's because I am. I sent a

1557
01:08:49,244 --> 01:08:51,366
text message saying, please come and

1558
01:08:51,388 --> 01:08:53,206
remove this big lamp you put here. But

1559
01:08:53,228 --> 01:08:54,726
they don't seem to have received the

1560
01:08:54,748 --> 01:08:58,538
message. Now back to our actual

1561
01:08:58,704 --> 01:09:01,926
topic. To the extent

1562
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,994
that I'm able to not be distracted from

1563
01:09:04,032 --> 01:09:07,980
it, I think that when I asked

1564
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:12,880
Alexi what was at stake, his main answer

1565
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:16,778
was to do with a diagnosis. Now, I don't

1566
01:09:16,794 --> 01:09:18,334
mean that he's saying that that's all

1567
01:09:18,372 --> 01:09:20,014
that's at stake, but I think he's saying

1568
01:09:20,052 --> 01:09:22,610
this illustrates what's at stake.

1569
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:26,802
So I want to first of all make sure that

1570
01:09:26,936 --> 01:09:29,346
because I'm not sure who our audience is

1571
01:09:29,368 --> 01:09:31,586
and who's going to be watching this in

1572
01:09:31,608 --> 01:09:35,190
case anybody misunderstands,

1573
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:37,814
I want to make clear that in

1574
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:41,186
psychoanalysis, we've long ago moved

1575
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:45,510
away from DSM and ICD type diagnosis.

1576
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:53,350
We always thought that the

1577
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,230
psychiatric nozology was wholly

1578
01:09:56,810 --> 01:10:00,714
artificial and created divisions

1579
01:10:00,762 --> 01:10:03,742
where they don't exist in nature. And we

1580
01:10:03,796 --> 01:10:06,378
replaced it with a far more dynamic.

1581
01:10:06,554 --> 01:10:09,326
Approach to diagnosis. And it's not just

1582
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:11,794
a matter of labeling. It's a matter also

1583
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:13,774
of what kind of thought process lies

1584
01:10:13,822 --> 01:10:15,538
behind the diagnosis. In other words,

1585
01:10:15,624 --> 01:10:18,020
conceptualizing what's going on here,

1586
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,862
rather than saying, this is an instance

1587
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:23,826
of personality disorder, and I'll

1588
01:10:23,858 --> 01:10:26,326
specify which type, we don't think like

1589
01:10:26,348 --> 01:10:28,966
that in psychoanalysis, and really, we

1590
01:10:28,988 --> 01:10:33,030
never have in neuropsychoanalysis.

1591
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:36,790
We build in that same tradition.

1592
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:41,322
I think that what Alexei was

1593
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:44,380
worrying about. He's saying, yeah, but

1594
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:49,200
you use systems, you say that

1595
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:53,070
there's a certain number of drives and

1596
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,950
you use those to pass what you're seeing

1597
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:59,200
clinically. And yes, we do,

1598
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:02,286
and we have to, because you can't just

1599
01:11:02,308 --> 01:11:04,818
say, what I'm seeing is chaos. What

1600
01:11:04,824 --> 01:11:06,366
you've got to say is, well, what I'm

1601
01:11:06,398 --> 01:11:09,106
seeing is chaos, but let me try my best

1602
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,938
to find the deeper structure of this.

1603
01:11:12,104 --> 01:11:14,558
And so what we do is much the same as

1604
01:11:14,584 --> 01:11:16,054
what I was saying earlier about how

1605
01:11:16,092 --> 01:11:17,958
brain and mind work. Likewise, the

1606
01:11:17,964 --> 01:11:20,326
clinician's mind works. That way we have

1607
01:11:20,348 --> 01:11:23,446
some deeper concepts that organize what

1608
01:11:23,468 --> 01:11:27,210
we see, and then more on the surface,

1609
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:31,642
we see the complexity. In other words,

1610
01:11:31,696 --> 01:11:33,866
we don't think that we can reduce a

1611
01:11:33,888 --> 01:11:36,774
patient just to one saying, this patient

1612
01:11:36,822 --> 01:11:38,394
has problems with this drive, or

1613
01:11:38,432 --> 01:11:40,154
something. It's not as simple as that,

1614
01:11:40,192 --> 01:11:42,014
of course, but we do start with saying,

1615
01:11:42,052 --> 01:11:44,206
well, these are the drives, these are

1616
01:11:44,228 --> 01:11:47,486
the attractors. To put it in terms

1617
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:49,226
of the attractor landscape that you're

1618
01:11:49,258 --> 01:11:52,734
talking about, these are the preferred

1619
01:11:52,782 --> 01:11:56,770
states of the human phenotype.

1620
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:58,914
And in mental life too, they are

1621
01:11:58,952 --> 01:12:01,522
preferred states. There are certain

1622
01:12:01,656 --> 01:12:07,700
attractors that we're trying to stay

1623
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,520
in. Those like, for example,

1624
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,638
fear. We want to be safe, we don't want

1625
01:12:13,644 --> 01:12:17,198
to feel fear. With respect to attachment

1626
01:12:17,234 --> 01:12:20,714
bonding, we want to stay close to our

1627
01:12:20,752 --> 01:12:22,186
attachment figures. We don't want to

1628
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:25,386
lose them. With respect to rage, we

1629
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:27,514
don't want to be frustrated and have

1630
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:30,206
things standing in our way. We want to

1631
01:12:30,228 --> 01:12:32,126
be able to have free access to the

1632
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:34,894
objects of our needs and so on. Those

1633
01:12:34,932 --> 01:12:38,334
are these attractors, and we have great

1634
01:12:38,372 --> 01:12:41,966
difficulty staying in those homeostatic

1635
01:12:41,998 --> 01:12:45,822
bounds. It is a dynamic

1636
01:12:45,966 --> 01:12:50,386
picture. And then over the question of

1637
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:52,894
the different drives, there's the highly

1638
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:54,774
individualized predictive model that

1639
01:12:54,812 --> 01:12:57,442
each one of us comes up with in relation

1640
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,446
to those drives and in relation to the

1641
01:12:59,468 --> 01:13:01,334
conflicts between those drives and so

1642
01:13:01,372 --> 01:13:05,650
on. So I think that this

1643
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:08,634
way of thinking that we use in

1644
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:10,998
psychoanalysis and neuropsychoanalysis

1645
01:13:11,094 --> 01:13:14,554
is already of the kind that Alex is

1646
01:13:14,592 --> 01:13:16,666
calling for. So I think that what

1647
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:20,010
Daniel's just said is therefore perhaps

1648
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:23,854
very important to make clear it's that

1649
01:13:23,972 --> 01:13:25,934
he's offering us a language, an

1650
01:13:25,972 --> 01:13:28,766
additional language, an additional I

1651
01:13:28,788 --> 01:13:30,302
don't just mean language, I should say

1652
01:13:30,356 --> 01:13:34,546
an additional set of concepts and

1653
01:13:34,648 --> 01:13:37,394
a highly developed one, which we might

1654
01:13:37,432 --> 01:13:39,714
find useful. And so we should take this

1655
01:13:39,752 --> 01:13:42,626
on board. That sounds very convincing to

1656
01:13:42,648 --> 01:13:45,426
me, if that's what's at stake here.

1657
01:13:45,528 --> 01:13:47,554
That Alexei is saying this is a language

1658
01:13:47,602 --> 01:13:49,494
that lends itself to the phenomena that

1659
01:13:49,532 --> 01:13:51,446
you study and to the way in which you go

1660
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,846
about studying it, then it sounds to me

1661
01:13:53,868 --> 01:13:57,402
as if Alexi is right. So that's the main

1662
01:13:57,536 --> 01:14:00,762
thing I wanted to say in response to his

1663
01:14:00,816 --> 01:14:04,700
comments in relation to what I said.

1664
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:09,102
So if anyone else wants to say anything

1665
01:14:09,156 --> 01:14:13,230
else, that's good with me. But Alexi,

1666
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:15,546
if I've misunderstood and if there's

1667
01:14:15,578 --> 01:14:17,054
something else that you think is at

1668
01:14:17,092 --> 01:14:19,534
stake that I'm not getting, now's your

1669
01:14:19,572 --> 01:14:22,240
chance to say it.

1670
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:25,794
Well, I just wanted to end the

1671
01:14:25,832 --> 01:14:27,874
conversation when you said that if this

1672
01:14:27,912 --> 01:14:29,906
language might be of any even to

1673
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:32,162
consider this language in our future

1674
01:14:32,216 --> 01:14:34,078
models, I'm a happy man and there's

1675
01:14:34,094 --> 01:14:37,814
nothing else I need to say. And I

1676
01:14:37,852 --> 01:14:39,910
just wanted to say that these are human

1677
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,586
things. They're occupational hazards.

1678
01:14:41,618 --> 01:14:43,174
Some of the things I'm talking about,

1679
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:44,822
this paper I'm working on about

1680
01:14:44,876 --> 01:14:48,746
narrative stuff, is that, of course,

1681
01:14:48,928 --> 01:14:51,994
it is much easier for us to think in

1682
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:54,726
categories, even in the psychoanalytic

1683
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:58,934
world. What we do let's

1684
01:14:58,982 --> 01:15:00,478
take the Macquillium system and the

1685
01:15:00,484 --> 01:15:02,414
previous one. We used to say three

1686
01:15:02,452 --> 01:15:05,194
levels of functioning neurotic,

1687
01:15:05,242 --> 01:15:06,926
borderline psychotic. These are

1688
01:15:06,948 --> 01:15:09,562
categories. They're not DSM categories.

1689
01:15:09,626 --> 01:15:10,858
They're not bipolar one, but they're

1690
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:12,766
categories nonetheless. Then we have

1691
01:15:12,788 --> 01:15:14,366
character styles, obsessive character

1692
01:15:14,398 --> 01:15:16,126
style, histrionic character style.

1693
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:18,674
They're categories. Okay? So to some

1694
01:15:18,712 --> 01:15:20,274
degree, it's a human condition to put

1695
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:21,874
things in categories. And I do think

1696
01:15:21,912 --> 01:15:24,302
that this is a very strong historical

1697
01:15:24,366 --> 01:15:26,260
reasons that we think this way.

1698
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:30,246
We have generations of thinking this way

1699
01:15:30,268 --> 01:15:32,486
in categories. And yes, at the end of

1700
01:15:32,508 --> 01:15:34,198
the day, when we paint a portrait of a

1701
01:15:34,204 --> 01:15:35,946
patient, it's developed, and it's like a

1702
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:37,994
tapestry. All of these things weave into

1703
01:15:38,032 --> 01:15:40,714
one another, and it's complex, but we

1704
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:42,940
start from basic categories. And

1705
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:47,034
certainly if we consider that some

1706
01:15:47,072 --> 01:15:48,954
things can be transient, there can be

1707
01:15:48,992 --> 01:15:51,710
emergence, they're like that. Certain

1708
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,858
behavior in one context is a compulsion,

1709
01:15:54,954 --> 01:15:56,670
but it's not a compulsion in another

1710
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,114
context. And perhaps I'm saying trivial

1711
01:15:59,162 --> 01:16:04,190
things to clinicians and also

1712
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,386
what dream you said just to comment when

1713
01:16:06,408 --> 01:16:08,386
you said as a patient to reduce the

1714
01:16:08,408 --> 01:16:10,626
noise and reduce the chaos. I detect the

1715
01:16:10,648 --> 01:16:12,914
bias in the language. You see how we

1716
01:16:12,952 --> 01:16:16,674
call psychopathology in DSM disorders.

1717
01:16:16,802 --> 01:16:19,106
Disorder is a bad word for us. And I'm

1718
01:16:19,138 --> 01:16:22,422
trying to say chaos is healthy. I spend

1719
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:24,146
most of my day in gamma functioning,

1720
01:16:24,178 --> 01:16:26,502
which is a chaotic state. It's not a bad

1721
01:16:26,556 --> 01:16:28,966
thing. So in the folk language, chaos is

1722
01:16:28,988 --> 01:16:30,538
a bad word. Disorder is a bad I want to

1723
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,454
put things in order, and then perhaps

1724
01:16:32,502 --> 01:16:33,898
we're missing something. What comes to

1725
01:16:33,904 --> 01:16:35,894
mind is, I think, Mark, you had meetings

1726
01:16:35,942 --> 01:16:38,630
with Michael Levin and Ian McGilchrist,

1727
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,574
who know big on talking about the

1728
01:16:40,612 --> 01:16:43,706
mechanistic, logical, linear, straight

1729
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:45,838
and narrow left hemisphere type. Of

1730
01:16:45,844 --> 01:16:47,246
course it's not left hemisphere, but

1731
01:16:47,268 --> 01:16:49,114
that's the model versus holistic

1732
01:16:49,162 --> 01:16:51,934
sensorial kind of right hemisphere

1733
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:53,986
artistic type. And we're missing the

1734
01:16:54,008 --> 01:16:56,066
second part, like Daniel's background is

1735
01:16:56,088 --> 01:17:00,066
surrounded by art where we

1736
01:17:00,088 --> 01:17:01,970
spend less time in the right hemisphere,

1737
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:04,594
maybe appropriately so, but I think that

1738
01:17:04,632 --> 01:17:06,022
there's some things that lend themselves

1739
01:17:06,076 --> 01:17:08,934
to that level of understanding and we

1740
01:17:08,972 --> 01:17:11,602
break things. We look at psychopathology

1741
01:17:11,666 --> 01:17:13,078
and a human suffering like it's a

1742
01:17:13,084 --> 01:17:16,266
carburetor sometimes, where we again put

1743
01:17:16,288 --> 01:17:17,862
it in buckets. That's my impression.

1744
01:17:17,926 --> 01:17:22,586
But what you said is wonderful and I

1745
01:17:22,608 --> 01:17:24,394
don't contradict with anything. I agree

1746
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:25,980
with everything you said, Mark.

1747
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,230
Alexi, if I can just comment.

1748
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:37,726
It'S. Almost like an arc. The pot of

1749
01:17:37,748 --> 01:17:40,586
gold at the end of the arc is the

1750
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:43,106
reduced chaos, the reduced noise in

1751
01:17:43,128 --> 01:17:44,606
terms of the patients from the patient's

1752
01:17:44,638 --> 01:17:47,170
perspective. But how you get there,

1753
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,570
ironically, is actually by inducing

1754
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:54,150
states of tolerable chaos

1755
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:57,414
and then kind of reformulating that,

1756
01:17:57,452 --> 01:18:00,806
reconsolidating that chaos. So it's not

1757
01:18:00,828 --> 01:18:04,406
that from the healing or growth or

1758
01:18:04,428 --> 01:18:06,826
whatever the patient might present to

1759
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:09,740
you for it has everything to do with

1760
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:15,194
minimal or marginal chaos induction and

1761
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:18,154
then reintegration of that.

1762
01:18:18,192 --> 01:18:20,766
So the whole process is premised on

1763
01:18:20,788 --> 01:18:24,094
chaos, but in bite sized doses, maybe

1764
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:27,854
one could say, right, and just to.

1765
01:18:27,892 --> 01:18:29,726
Finish up and then I'll stop talking.

1766
01:18:29,828 --> 01:18:32,478
Jonathan Schadler, who all know and

1767
01:18:32,644 --> 01:18:34,914
know, widely respected as a

1768
01:18:34,952 --> 01:18:36,606
psychoanalytic practitioner and teacher

1769
01:18:36,638 --> 01:18:39,826
and writer, he recently said that take a

1770
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:44,034
patient X with an analyst Y together the

1771
01:18:44,072 --> 01:18:47,686
diet has emergent properties. That is

1772
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:49,526
not the same thing as patient X with the

1773
01:18:49,548 --> 01:18:53,030
analyst Z. Right? And show me one study

1774
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,094
where we take that into account. We

1775
01:18:55,132 --> 01:18:58,754
don't. We just do random clinical

1776
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:00,614
trial, then we do metaanalysis of random

1777
01:19:00,662 --> 01:19:02,138
clinical trial. What technique did the

1778
01:19:02,144 --> 01:19:03,962
therapist use? They used, you know,

1779
01:19:04,016 --> 01:19:05,466
whatever four letter therapy they

1780
01:19:05,488 --> 01:19:07,446
applied. Nobody looks at the emerging

1781
01:19:07,478 --> 01:19:10,590
properties in a diet. This matrix

1782
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:13,066
between the two, and that's the language

1783
01:19:13,098 --> 01:19:14,986
of dynamical systems. This is Daniel

1784
01:19:15,018 --> 01:19:17,982
Friedman ant colony. A single ant

1785
01:19:18,036 --> 01:19:19,774
doesn't build bridges and grow

1786
01:19:19,812 --> 01:19:21,474
mushrooms. Ant colony does all those

1787
01:19:21,512 --> 01:19:23,506
things. We don't talk about emergence in

1788
01:19:23,528 --> 01:19:25,474
psychoanalytic psychotherapy, do we?

1789
01:19:25,592 --> 01:19:27,790
It's true. It's also a fundamental

1790
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:30,174
challenge. After all, you can't

1791
01:19:30,222 --> 01:19:33,486
replicate within one Dyad or across

1792
01:19:33,608 --> 01:19:36,566
Dyads in a finite world. So it does

1793
01:19:36,588 --> 01:19:39,654
point to fundamentals. In our last

1794
01:19:39,772 --> 01:19:43,158
minutes, if each would like to

1795
01:19:43,244 --> 01:19:47,178
give some thoughts, where do we go as we

1796
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:49,914
now the opponent of exponent away from

1797
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:52,202
each other in our paths? So maybe

1798
01:19:52,336 --> 01:19:55,270
Albert, Brynn, Mark and then Alexey,

1799
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:57,494
what are your overall thoughts,

1800
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:59,278
reflections? And then where are we

1801
01:19:59,364 --> 01:20:00,190
heading?

1802
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:05,790
Go for it, Albert.

1803
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:10,670
Yeah, I was about to comment on Alexey

1804
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:13,780
about the emergent properties thing.

1805
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:16,962
It's kind of the same point I made

1806
01:20:17,016 --> 01:20:21,406
earlier. Later psychoanalytic

1807
01:20:21,438 --> 01:20:22,846
theories do talk about emergent

1808
01:20:22,878 --> 01:20:26,834
properties. But yes, I think as what

1809
01:20:26,872 --> 01:20:28,360
Professor Salvage just mentioned.

1810
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:34,280
This new set of. Concepts makes it very

1811
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:38,794
practical for us to communicate with

1812
01:20:38,832 --> 01:20:41,498
each other because psychoanalysis has a

1813
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:44,650
bad habit of reinventing new concepts

1814
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:48,186
every new decade. So there's a lot of

1815
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:50,890
chaos to use that word within

1816
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,790
psychoanalytic discourse.

1817
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:57,006
But overall, I thought I'm very

1818
01:20:57,028 --> 01:20:58,766
grateful. I think this was a very

1819
01:20:58,788 --> 01:21:01,700
interesting talk. So yeah. Thank you.

1820
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:07,886
Thank you. Yes. By way of closing

1821
01:21:07,998 --> 01:21:11,780
remarks, I agree with

1822
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:15,654
actually, it seems to me that there's an

1823
01:21:15,692 --> 01:21:18,258
abundance of agreement in this meeting.

1824
01:21:18,434 --> 01:21:21,510
I don't see any big controversy.

1825
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,680
So that's nice.

1826
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:29,882
I think what Brynn said really

1827
01:21:29,936 --> 01:21:32,906
captures it. I liked it because what he

1828
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:35,434
said was so experience near. He was just

1829
01:21:35,472 --> 01:21:37,738
describing what it feels like to be a

1830
01:21:37,744 --> 01:21:38,410
patient,

1831
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:45,102
to be in a state of not knowing and

1832
01:21:45,156 --> 01:21:48,202
uncertainty as opposed to a more stable

1833
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:51,620
kind of tranquility. And then

1834
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:57,090
the ability to allow

1835
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,426
yourself to return to uncertainty if

1836
01:22:01,448 --> 01:22:04,774
you've found answers that are too

1837
01:22:04,812 --> 01:22:09,138
simple and that are too static

1838
01:22:09,314 --> 01:22:11,846
to allow ourselves to go back into this

1839
01:22:11,948 --> 01:22:14,710
state of not really knowing.

1840
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:18,970
That, I think, really does describe what

1841
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,866
we try to do for our patients. What we

1842
01:22:21,888 --> 01:22:24,246
have to remember applies to ourselves

1843
01:22:24,358 --> 01:22:27,350
not only because we are ultimately

1844
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:29,902
patients too, but because it applies to

1845
01:22:29,956 --> 01:22:31,694
how the mind works. It applies to

1846
01:22:31,732 --> 01:22:35,534
science, how science works, that we

1847
01:22:35,572 --> 01:22:39,054
do need to find order, but there

1848
01:22:39,092 --> 01:22:41,646
is disorder out there. And so we're

1849
01:22:41,678 --> 01:22:44,862
always at risk of coming prematurely

1850
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:48,866
to a rigid system of belief and we have

1851
01:22:48,888 --> 01:22:51,106
to return back to the coalface and back

1852
01:22:51,128 --> 01:22:54,374
to the chaos. But ultimately, where we

1853
01:22:54,412 --> 01:22:58,390
want to be is back in that valley.

1854
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:04,070
And so, as much as Alex is right

1855
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:10,986
to remind us that the

1856
01:23:11,008 --> 01:23:14,682
highest levels of brain activity in many

1857
01:23:14,736 --> 01:23:17,850
senses of the word are entropic

1858
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:22,030
and that deep sleep and seizures

1859
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:26,846
are bad things, as much as

1860
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:29,422
that's true. Nevertheless, I think that

1861
01:23:29,476 --> 01:23:33,026
the great trend of the mind it's one of

1862
01:23:33,048 --> 01:23:36,306
its fundamental working principles is we

1863
01:23:36,328 --> 01:23:39,074
are wanting to be more certain. We want

1864
01:23:39,112 --> 01:23:41,646
life to be more predictable. We don't

1865
01:23:41,678 --> 01:23:44,326
like to be in chaos. And I think that

1866
01:23:44,348 --> 01:23:48,294
that's an important thing

1867
01:23:48,332 --> 01:23:51,010
to remember while we are acknowledging

1868
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:55,206
the importance of chaos and of

1869
01:23:55,308 --> 01:23:57,546
the highly unpredictable nature of the

1870
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,258
world and of the phenomena we study in

1871
01:23:59,264 --> 01:24:02,234
our field, nevertheless, we retreat from

1872
01:24:02,272 --> 01:24:05,302
it, and for very good reasons.

1873
01:24:05,446 --> 01:24:08,494
So those are my closing remarks. And

1874
01:24:08,532 --> 01:24:09,120
thank.

1875
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:15,710
And I'll be very brief. Alexia,

1876
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:19,506
just thank you for the paper and for

1877
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:22,486
having such a strong focus on the

1878
01:24:22,508 --> 01:24:26,166
patient and on psychopath well, on the

1879
01:24:26,188 --> 01:24:28,134
human condition. I think that's so nice

1880
01:24:28,172 --> 01:24:31,446
to have that come out of the

1881
01:24:31,468 --> 01:24:34,066
paper when at first glance it doesn't

1882
01:24:34,098 --> 01:24:36,634
seem to be there. So thanks for making

1883
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:39,146
it so human and then just Daniel for

1884
01:24:39,168 --> 01:24:42,010
organizing and to spend time with Mark

1885
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,554
and Albert. It's a great pleasure. So

1886
01:24:44,592 --> 01:24:45,660
thank you very much.

1887
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:50,958
Alexi, final words. I want

1888
01:24:50,964 --> 01:24:53,386
to thank everybody and Mark and Brynn

1889
01:24:53,418 --> 01:24:55,566
and Albert and Daniel, Andrea, thank

1890
01:24:55,588 --> 01:24:58,942
you. I had a great fun and I'm very

1891
01:24:58,996 --> 01:25:01,394
grateful, honestly, for your help and

1892
01:25:01,432 --> 01:25:04,066
openness and flexibility. One of the

1893
01:25:04,088 --> 01:25:07,026
other reasons is kind of the time we

1894
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:09,102
live in Yuval harari made that comment

1895
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:12,302
that the rate of change is accelerating.

1896
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:13,822
When we were hunter gatherers,

1897
01:25:13,886 --> 01:25:15,746
uncertainty was norm. You wake up,

1898
01:25:15,768 --> 01:25:17,126
there's nothing in the fridge. You have

1899
01:25:17,148 --> 01:25:19,762
to go hunt. And we tolerated uncertainty

1900
01:25:19,826 --> 01:25:21,346
better. We could put our worldly

1901
01:25:21,378 --> 01:25:23,286
possessions on the back. And then we

1902
01:25:23,308 --> 01:25:24,786
started living in the world of iPads.

1903
01:25:24,818 --> 01:25:26,370
iPhones were bombarded with information.

1904
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,266
And we must minimize uncertainty. We

1905
01:25:28,288 --> 01:25:30,330
must have predictability in everything,

1906
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,522
which is not the natural world for

1907
01:25:32,576 --> 01:25:35,866
mammals. And now we live our life and

1908
01:25:35,888 --> 01:25:38,486
then bang, COVID hits, and then bang,

1909
01:25:38,598 --> 01:25:40,218
certain person becomes the President of

1910
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,042
the United States and everything goes

1911
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:45,066
upside down. So the black swans are

1912
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,354
hitting us more frequently. So I think

1913
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,226
having the theory of that at our

1914
01:25:49,248 --> 01:25:50,914
fingerprint and applying it to our work

1915
01:25:50,952 --> 01:25:53,602
is probably beneficial. But again,

1916
01:25:53,656 --> 01:25:54,914
thank you all so much. I really

1917
01:25:54,952 --> 01:25:58,066
appreciate it. Awesome. Well, thank you

1918
01:25:58,088 --> 01:26:00,030
all for joining. The conversation

1919
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:02,914
continues, so till next time.

1920
01:26:03,112 --> 01:26:06,594
Thank you. Bye bye. Thanks a lot.
