00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,420
hello and welcome this is active guest

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,440
room 52.1 on August 10 2023 we have

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,900
Ahmed al-said Alexandra aurobia and

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,460
Travis de cell

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,400
is going to give a presentation and

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,680
following we'll have some Reflections

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,080
and discussions so thank you all for

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,240
joining and amen to you for the

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,779
presentation

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,079
okay thanks so much for having me

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,160
um today I'm going to this to discuss

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,300
um our

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,300
um the methods that we came up to solve

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,160
new architectural search and new

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,500
Evolution problems

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,180
um the methods that are

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,579
um and Colony optimization based

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,140
Solutions

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,100
um so as the title ish is mentioning um

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,199
and Colony optimization for neural

21
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,660
architectural search and Revolution

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,080
um this work this work is um

23
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,659
collaboration between me uh my uh

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,600
previous advisor dried the cell and my

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,580
code advisor

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,119
um Dr Ora and senator

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,979
I'm currently

28
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,140
um an assistant professor in University

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,520
and

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,159
um North Carolina University North

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,080
Carolina Wellington

32
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,520
um

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,640
and moving on to the next slide

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,920
um so as an overview the things that I'm

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
going to discuss today I'll try to take

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
um give um bird ice view for what is the

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,020
revolution

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,619
um why we why why we need it and from

39
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,680
there I'll just try to discuss

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,280
um our methods that is and that is based

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,200
on and calling optimization which is

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,540
called end-based neural policy search or

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,479
ends for short and after that I will

44
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,979
discuss how we Advanced with this idea

45
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,280
um by um

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,719
introducing a continuous ants or cancer

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,699
control which is

48
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,220
um which good thread of down this

49
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,160
research space and replaced it with A

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,220
continuous space and after that

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,220
I'm going to also say what we did with

52
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,379
the three-dimension The Continuous ants

53
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,980
to have a back propagation free class

54
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,620
and later I will um discuss three of the

55
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,319
points that we are answering for

56
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,000
um future work

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,220
so

58
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,819
um

59
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,780
in the machine learning uh learn as the

60
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,459
structure the neural network structures

61
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,620
get got deeper and deeper

62
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,900
um people were trying to optimize the

63
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,220
structures to have better performance

64
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,379
and people and people in different

65
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,480
Realms or different

66
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,700
um problem domain

67
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,019
um used to

68
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,660
um borrow the best performing neural

69
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,680
architectures or structures and try to

70
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,140
modify a little bit uh to work for for

71
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,599
their problem and they tried to be to

72
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,480
tweak some of the pictures of the of the

73
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,180
structure and compare

74
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,459
um these different tweaks and then they

75
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,080
say that we found the best performing

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,940
structure but

77
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,659
um

78
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,140
to actually find an absolute

79
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,700
um open structure

80
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,040
it it would uh concerning that solution

81
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,319
it would be a NPR problem because to

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,379
reach that solution we they had to

83
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,319
um to to try all the combinations of the

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,319
different structural elements right and

85
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,739
this is and because we have massive

86
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,379
um structures in these deep neural

87
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,519
networks

88
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,519
um they could be an NPR problem because

89
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,760
we don't have computational uh Power or

90
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,459
enough time to actually

91
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,159
um train and test all of these

92
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,080
structures all these structures

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,459
constructed from these different

94
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,080
combinations

95
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,780
of construction hands so the alternative

96
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,239
way to do this is to actually try to do

97
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,900
to apply a meteoristic method

98
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,180
and to convert to an ear to open

99
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,239
solution that is much better than not

100
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,339
optimizing the structure or relying on a

101
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,738
kind of like a random search right a

102
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,478
random search can get us um better

103
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,340
performance performing neural network

104
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,340
but it's not going to give us

105
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,740
um an a mute to Optimal solution or to

106
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,000
converge through near to Optimum

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,759
solution

108
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,660
so

109
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,680
um

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,660
so I mean heuristic method would give us

111
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,020
an automated method

112
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,259
um and and also we can converge to new

113
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,479
document structure near to open solution

114
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,039
to this uh structural problem

115
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,680
um so the the way that people approached

116
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,919
Nas was by trying to mimic

117
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,740
um how optimization is done in nature

118
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,400
right so the first method the the first

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,220
way the thoughts are uh it was

120
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,400
um to trying to mimic how

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,080
um living organisms um evolve in nature

122
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,400
um using

123
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,500
um genetic based algorithm like the

124
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,000
Darwin kinetic evolution

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,520
and it started with a neat

126
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,660
um or

127
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,660
um it's it's a short for

128
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,680
um uh new Revolution uh foreign

129
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,060
that concept was also applied for in

130
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,600
most of the nas on normal motion methods

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,680
and exam is one of them tries to uh came

132
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,380
up with this method and it became one of

133
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,020
the state of the Arts uh instead of the

134
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,460
art methods in uh in in Nas

135
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,600
um so in in in in such methods we tried

136
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,720
to again mimic genetic evolution by

137
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,699
introducing new structural elements or

138
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,979
removing structural elements or altering

139
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,180
the structure through the evolution

140
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,639
process through the evolution iterations

141
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,460
and through the evolution Generations so

142
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,120
we can apply mutations by splitting

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
edges

144
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,460
or adding edges or display disabling

145
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,919
edges and this we display Edge we

146
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,479
disable edges will disable some

147
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,979
structural elements so that we don't

148
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,919
lose that component so that we can later

149
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,520
on use it kind of like um a dormant uh

150
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,039
Gene in a genome right so that we it can

151
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,960
appear in later generations not to get

152
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,380
rid of totally so we can in mutations I

153
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,419
can disable edges we can enable them

154
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,580
later in later generations if we found

155
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,800
that we want to try

156
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,380
um this option

157
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,300
um we can also add recurrent edges or

158
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,419
remove recall or or or enable or disable

159
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,060
the current edges uh we can we can split

160
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,979
nodes we can take some of the nodes that

161
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,460
in in the previous generation of um uh

162
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,800
and we can just uh split it to two nodes

163
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,620
and then take the edges uh connected to

164
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,720
that node and

165
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,060
um try to divide it between the new stat

166
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,340
was generated from the previous node in

167
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,199
the previous uh generation

168
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,500
uh also we can add nodes from to the

169
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,479
structures and the structure so all of

170
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,639
these are part of the mutation classes

171
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,580
in the genetic process

172
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,160
um you can also disable a note if you

173
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,080
don't if you want to try to just get rid

174
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,120
of one of the notes and disabling a node

175
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,759
or multiple nodes will also disable the

176
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,940
edges connected to that note

177
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,979
um beside mutations we are the other

178
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,020
side of

179
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,620
um a genetic process is to do crossovers

180
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,360
where we have two of the best

181
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,840
performance uh population uh made

182
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
together to bring an offspring and

183
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,740
Offspring will have

184
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,319
um collection of the characteristics uh

185
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,900
of coming from their parents

186
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,160
um so it will take some of the

187
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,840
characteristics from that parents and

188
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,940
other characteristics from the other

189
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,680
parent hoping that this will give us a

190
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,840
bad performing neural network uh or

191
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,799
platforming generation

192
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,780
um so the main problem

193
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,500
sorry

194
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,719
so the main problem with with

195
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,179
um uh genetic based algorithms is that

196
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,399
they start with minimal structure

197
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,559
like we can see there meaning that

198
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,160
inputs and outputs and um you starting

199
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,740
from the the optimization with this

200
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,160
minimal search space can trap the method

201
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,620
in a local Minima through the

202
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,720
optimization process so we were thinking

203
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,720
how to get rid of this obstacle and by

204
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,899
having a bigger or larger space to start

205
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,060
with and then we can sample some

206
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,800
solutions from that

207
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
um

208
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,839
larger space and we were looking around

209
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,600
and we we we we concerned end calling

210
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,779
optimization and and I would say why

211
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,180
that I'll try to introduce

212
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,279
um the method first so the method was

213
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,680
first introduced as um graphic

214
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,720
optimization method

215
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,420
um graph optimization method sorry

216
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,339
um it was introduced in mid 90s by

217
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,000
Margaret River

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,680
applied this method

219
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,500
um uh in on a terrible sales Mass

220
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,720
problem and the problem is mainly about

221
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,000
a travel salesman who wants to visit

222
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,920
number of cities in the country do you

223
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,779
think it's George's staff and

224
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,640
considering this problem if we have

225
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,620
different number and if the number of

226
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,560
cities grows then that combinate the

227
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,839
implementations of these numbers are

228
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,760
updated that we have to consider to find

229
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,500
the open solution

230
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,779
um if this number says gross then we

231
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,580
will end up having an npmr problem

232
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,160
because we did we won't have enough time

233
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,060
or or computational power to have this

234
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,380
um this compact this explosives solution

235
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,260
um done or this pixel step search done

236
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,180
so he

237
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,180
here from his observations

238
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,959
um

239
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,580
um to advance in nature he found that he

240
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,060
can apply how they Forge to find food in

241
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,959
nature

242
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,440
and um and uh and and then take this

243
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,720
this concept that this observation

244
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,660
applies in an algorithm to find the not

245
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,500
the optimum path that leads from uh from

246
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,200
one point and to visit all the cities

247
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,240
and in a short shortest plan

248
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,019
um so the methods this observation

249
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,120
um so this line in the comic slides will

250
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,180
just try to

251
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,300
give us a picture of how hence

252
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,019
um

253
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,480
um pourish in nature to plant food and

254
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,180
then how Market reggae took that concept

255
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,060
to apply it and uh in that Charles's

256
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,640
hitman's problem so

257
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,380
um hence

258
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,079
observance funds that and go out from

259
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,360
from their natural plant food

260
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,680
and

261
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,300
um the the in Detroit different

262
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,860
directions right

263
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,320
um and when they find food eventually

264
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,120
find food they will take some of that

265
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,700
food and then they will go back to their

266
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,640
nest and in the way back they will

267
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,980
deposit some other substance called a

268
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,240
pheromone

269
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,360
um that the so they deposit that

270
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,040
substance so that they communicate that

271
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,820
through the foods resource with others

272
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,000
so actually other ants do exploit this

273
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,120
for more other substance and when they

274
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,279
sense it they try they will they follow

275
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,100
the path that the end that the first end

276
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,620
took from that uh from the police was to

277
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,940
the nest

278
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,860
um hoping that they will find food at

279
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,620
the end of that time and and when they

280
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,019
actually find food at the end of the the

281
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,640
path they will take some of the food and

282
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,220
do the same thing they will deposit some

283
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,740
more from lawn on the same path they can

284
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,540
get more appealing to other ants who

285
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,100
take it so that they can bring more food

286
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,240
to the nest

287
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,839
so the this in this process shows us the

288
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
exploitation uh behavior of ants but

289
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
again from sometime from time to time

290
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,940
other ants also try to explore some

291
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,220
other uh full resources potential food

292
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,760
resources and they they kind of resist

293
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,660
uh following the the formal uh phrases

294
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,540
uh and and they try to find to go away

295
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,800
and find some um new food resources for

296
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,219
the nest

297
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,540
exploiters they also explorers and and

298
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,519
these two concepts were

299
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,220
um used by market the rager to kind of

300
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,000
like

301
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,779
right balance the search bit for the

302
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,240
better uh the better or faster path

303
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,620
between

304
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,800
um the the the the the the the the the

305
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,359
cities for the Trump salesman's problem

306
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,040
um and the third thing that they

307
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,860
observed also uh in Helen's Sports and

308
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,680
in nature is that the odors for more the

309
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,720
other substance the hormone also

310
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,860
evaporates so whenever a path to a full

311
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,079
resource is not appealing anymore with

312
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,300
the full resources are exclusive no more

313
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,459
ants will take that path or when they

314
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,800
take it and reached it and the the the

315
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,279
full resources that is exposed that they

316
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,079
will not take the same path to the

317
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,880
NASDAQ and they will try to wonder and

318
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,519
to find more new food resources and

319
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,620
because they not go in that path again

320
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,200
and not depending any form on pheromone

321
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,019
on that path the hormone will eventually

322
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,600
evaporate and disappears and and making

323
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,820
it less and less uh appealing for other

324
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,480
ants to take

325
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,959
so

326
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:10,770
um

327
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,060
[Music]

328
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,300
so that's what Marco Durango was looking

329
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,980
at when he thought of the travel

330
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,839
spaceman's problem

331
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,139
um he wanted he applied that uh for the

332
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,779
federal salesman's Problem by making one

333
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:25,980
agent

334
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,760
um try this different tasks and then uh

335
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
comparing in it through each iteration

336
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,440
so that agent will take a path between

337
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,279
the the cities right and then it will

338
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,760
compare it the the the the length of

339
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,800
that path to the previous uh experience

340
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,440
with other paths and if it's shorter it

341
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,019
will try to deposit for months on the

342
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,199
segments of that path and eventually he

343
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,060
was hoping and he was right about when

344
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,519
he was hoping he was hoping that it

345
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,040
eventually the the more

346
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,959
um that the total pattern the shorter

347
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,839
shorter segments that give the ultimate

348
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,279
shorter

349
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,079
um path

350
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,040
um had more info more and more from one

351
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,959
deposits making it more more appealing

352
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,519
for the agent to take it through the

353
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,680
iterations

354
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,160
so we we thought about this concept

355
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,839
um and we thought that it's very

356
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,360
appealing to apply it for a an Nas

357
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,920
problem because

358
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,100
solution was applied for uh graph

359
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,500
optimization problem and um neural

360
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,600
networks are in their sense

361
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,160
um Direction graphs

362
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
so we we also considered ankle

363
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
optimization because it's full torrent

364
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,139
decentralized and scalable and it's also

365
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,240
easily traceable

366
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,019
and and and think going back to being

367
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,019
decentralized uh it gave us it make it

368
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,079
it made it it made this uh

369
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,139
um method a perfect candidate for a pal

370
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,760
and high performance Computing uh

371
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,260
solution

372
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,660
um and so which will eventually

373
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,940
accelerate the optimization problem and

374
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,120
I will in the next I think in the next

375
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,000
Slide the slide after the next one I'll

376
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,620
discuss how we

377
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,779
um exploit or use this

378
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,940
um

379
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,100
characteristic of end connectivization

380
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,440
um to accelerate the solution uh that we

381
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,940
came up with or the method that we came

382
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,339
up with which is ants and games

383
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,420
so um this scheme or the scheme of ants

384
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,760
applying ants or end call accommodation

385
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,060
uh in a neural or sorry in neural neural

386
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,459
architecture search is depicted depicted

387
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,120
in or Illustrated in this um

388
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,259
uh flow chart so we start off with a

389
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,420
massive search space

390
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,579
um

391
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:57,120
expressed in superstructure which

392
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,980
um

393
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,360
expresses or um it embodies a neural

394
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,880
network that is so massively uh

395
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,400
connected meaning that each node in that

396
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,780
superstructure is connected with the

397
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,599
other nodes through edges and recurrent

398
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,119
edges backwards and forward and backward

399
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,339
current edges

400
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:22,859
and then we let a number of Agents swarm

401
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,579
over the structure uh from an input node

402
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,220
to an output node so each one of these

403
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,740
agents will pick an input node and then

404
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,980
it wanders from that node uh through the

405
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,860
connections the current edges and

406
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,980
recurrent edges

407
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,299
and between the nodes in between hidden

408
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,940
layers till it gets and picks one of the

409
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,640
output nodes and then we take all these

410
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,660
Paths of the different agents and we put

411
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,660
them together to format our a structural

412
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,940
and a neural network structure and we

413
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,160
take that structure and drain it and

414
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,720
test it

415
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,360
and then compare its performance to the

416
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,100
population of best performing in neural

417
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,360
networks through this performance

418
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,360
structures and it's better than the

419
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
worst in the population then we reward

420
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,700
um the path that the ants took the

421
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,860
agents took over uh in the

422
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,679
superstructure we worked with hormone

423
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,559
um and so that it may make these paths

424
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,140
appealing for later iterations through

425
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,960
through the evolution process or the or

426
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,880
the optimization process

427
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,000
that's if the the durated structure is

428
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,980
best than the worst in the population if

429
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,380
not if it actually was worse and then

430
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,900
the worst in the population then

431
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,660
we discard that structure or that in

432
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,820
your network and we don't reward any of

433
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,280
the path that ants took and also the

434
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,919
thermal evaporation will help us get rid

435
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,020
of the the pheromones that were

436
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,880
deposited on the edges that are not

437
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,440
giving us better and better structures

438
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,600
and

439
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,900
and again because the end colony is

440
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,120
decentralized we exploited this by

441
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,080
having

442
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,940
um an asynchronous solution or

443
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,280
asynchronous Evolution

444
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,340
um we had a main process that took care

445
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,480
of

446
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,059
um generating the new structures and

447
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,100
also updating the the population the

448
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,860
test performing structures and updating

449
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,740
the poor moon on the superstructure so

450
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,919
the main process will generate generate

451
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,539
um structures and send them to worker

452
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,520
processes the worker processes will

453
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
train and test the neural network on the

454
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,100
data that we have for the problem

455
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,799
and then send the results back or the

456
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,260
thickness of the neural network to uh

457
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,940
the main process and based on that

458
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,760
Fitness that being process will

459
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,640
um either discard it or

460
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,980
um we'll take that this Fitness and

461
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,960
compare it to the best performing in the

462
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,760
population if it's better than the worst

463
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,460
it will reward the path that ends took

464
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,080
on the superstructure by depositing

465
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,940
motion mode or if it's worse than the

466
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,200
worst in the population will just

467
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,740
discard it and it will keep generating

468
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,020
um new structures and sending them to

469
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,160
processes because the the training uh

470
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,340
which relies on that propagation uh is

471
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,740
the most computationally expensive part

472
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,100
in this process if we have a number of

473
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,080
worker processities that can work in

474
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,620
parallel uh to train and evaluate these

475
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,900
uh neural networks this newer new

476
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,000
structures we can speed up the process

477
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,020
right

478
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,940
by

479
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,220
training and evaluating different

480
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,820
structures at the same time internal in

481
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,159
in asynchronous pollution scheme

482
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,020
um this is actually

483
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,580
um this is an animation but it's not

484
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,460
working in this version of the slides

485
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,740
um because we're using a PDF but it's

486
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,260
mainly a structure where

487
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,820
um you'll see

488
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,120
um edges or connections between these

489
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,679
nodes

490
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,940
um fading and or having

491
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,320
darker colors based on the per month

492
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,539
values through the iterations so each

493
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,460
frame in this um

494
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,360
uh in this animation is kind of an

495
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,840
update for the pheromone value of the

496
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,660
the edges based on the performance of

497
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,240
the version of the of the neural network

498
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
that were generated by the Asians when

499
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,860
they swarm from the start node taking

500
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,600
one of the input nodes in the middle

501
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,640
layer and then from there going to one

502
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,559
of the Hidden layers in this one hidden

503
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,780
layer that we have here and from there

504
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,678
going to the output

505
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,039
so um that was the concept of applying

506
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,400
an ATO and current optimization and

507
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,539
um Nas and this now I'm going to talk

508
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,340
about the actual method that we came up

509
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,580
with

510
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,580
so it's more dramatic and more powerful

511
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,280
um neural detection search methods uh

512
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,500
more comprehensive if I can say if I may

513
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,640
say that

514
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,220
um

515
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,580
we we we opted to apply the method and

516
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,220
uh on um we require neural networks

517
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,700
because they tend to be potentially

518
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,500
larger than

519
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,140
um other C other or neural networks

520
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,299
structures because of their current

521
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,880
connections uh so we thought that if we

522
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,760
started this problem build the method or

523
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,200
the constant applies to any neural

524
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
network but applying it to recurrential

525
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,740
networks

526
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,620
um made it more appealing challenge to

527
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,600
for for

528
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
um

529
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,679
measuring the performance of the method

530
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,400
that we thought of

531
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,500
so this line in the coming side will

532
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
discuss the different heuristics of the

533
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,280
methods of ants the characteristic is

534
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,600
superstructured itself

535
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,760
um and as we as I mentioned before it

536
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,400
and it's a method search space and at

537
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,980
method as possible to be handled with

538
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,100
the the the machine or the hardware that

539
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,840
we're working on

540
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,299
um the superstructure consists of a

541
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,740
neural network that is massively

542
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,020
connected meaning that every node in

543
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,520
that structure is connected to the other

544
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,240
nodes they are or through edges forward

545
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,059
edges and recurrent edges backward

546
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:32,820
forward edges and backward Corner edges

547
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,860
um this simple structure that we have

548
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,200
here represents one of just the concept

549
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
of the superstructure that we have we

550
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,780
apply in in ants here we have three

551
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,059
input nodes uh three hidden layers each

552
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,400
have three nodes and one output node in

553
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,020
the output layer and we are just showing

554
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,640
one node connected to the other nodes

555
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,220
through edges which are the ones

556
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,100
represented in green

557
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,380
forward recurrent

558
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,520
sorry

559
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,159
um the the edges are the one in Gray and

560
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,659
then forward current and backward

561
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,360
current in the green end uh in the red

562
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,620
and the concept of recurrent edges

563
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,419
um might be a little bit confusing if we

564
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,419
look at it in this example because how

565
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,460
can an edge

566
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,740
um appear current coming in and out from

567
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,460
the same node or of the the notes in the

568
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,280
same time step but this structure might

569
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,760
make it more uh clear

570
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,380
um so here we have

571
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,620
um a structure that three is pretty much

572
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,419
similar to the one we saw before but

573
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,700
here we have three input nodes two

574
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,200
hidden layers there are three in layers

575
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,059
in chapter three nodes and then output

576
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,860
they have two notes

577
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,260
um and then we have also three time

578
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,900
steps the current times that t zero and

579
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,640
the the previous times that T minus one

580
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,280
the one before that T minus two

581
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,080
edges here are Illustrated using the the

582
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,440
solid black lines

583
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,799
um and and of course these edges are

584
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,440
present in the current time step that is

585
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,059
going to propagate through the neural

586
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:16,140
network and then the current uh

587
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,600
connections these ones are going to

588
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,520
bring information

589
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,500
um or provided information from the

590
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,200
previous time steps the previous

591
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,260
um uh inputs or previous uh data that

592
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,440
was fired to the nodes in the previous

593
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,520
language

594
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,299
and these are current edges are detected

595
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,240
here in red and orange the four ones are

596
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,539
better in in red and orange the reds are

597
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,039
coming from T minus one and the orange

598
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,860
are coming from the T minus two

599
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,520
and the backward current edges are the

600
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,740
dot lines in blue and green and um and

601
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,940
you can see that they are going

602
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,279
backwards so they cut the

603
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,659
go backward and to backward layers

604
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:04,340
um

605
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,220
but the uh but we but because they

606
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,960
already current we can do that because

607
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,360
they are they process information they

608
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,220
bring information that already processed

609
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,520
so we don't have to worry about

610
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,320
improgating information back through

611
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,700
time

612
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,039
or back through the structure but we can

613
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,840
do that if it's coming from previous

614
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,439
timestamp

615
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,840
the second heuristic and ants is that

616
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,400
Colony weight sharing we wanted to use

617
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,700
um then so instead of initial branding

618
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,520
initialize the weights or the synaptic

619
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,179
weights and generated neural networks uh

620
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,539
we wanted to use the the train weights

621
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,600
to initialize the weights of the newly

622
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,140
generated uh neural neural networks we

623
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,240
did that by Saving these neural networks

624
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,880
on the superstructure

625
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,520
uh we used the last

626
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,700
um equation here to do this update so we

627
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,740
balance between the ways that were saved

628
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,100
previously and the ways that we were uh

629
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,260
are coming from the trained or evaluated

630
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,440
neural networks and we also used two

631
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,500
Chinese to do this update we used

632
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,020
um a fixed parameter file or if we let

633
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,659
find that that was the first strategy

634
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,700
the second strategy was to

635
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,380
get Fly by applying these two equations

636
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,600
which relies on the performance of the

637
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,159
neural network that was previously

638
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,740
generally oh sorry the the previously

639
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,380
related entrance so it relies on the

640
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,539
performance of the neural network that

641
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,500
was trained and validated or tested

642
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,480
so if

643
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,000
um if it if the promise is was good then

644
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,600
we will let this uh the weights of that

645
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,120
um uh neural network to contribute to

646
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,340
the the to contribute more to the uh

647
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,600
initialization of the way so the newly

648
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,580
generated RNs if it's not performing

649
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,279
that well then why will this equation

650
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,919
will not allow it to contribute that

651
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,360
much

652
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,240
okay the third meta heuristic is

653
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
multiple memory cells so

654
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,520
um each at each node

655
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,760
um uh when when when when an agent or an

656
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,919
ant reached to a node in in the

657
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,679
superstructure it will do um a local

658
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,179
search

659
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,779
um to pick uh the type of the new in the

660
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,080
neuron or the type of the node uh from

661
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,059
these three different types of memory

662
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,600
cells so in the generated RNN

663
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,880
um the generation structure the nodes in

664
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,279
the structure is not all the same they

665
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,200
will be different based on the local

666
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,299
search that

667
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,260
um

668
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,240
that the agent will do or the end will

669
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,520
do at each node they reach through their

670
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,039
path from the input to an output in the

671
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,419
superstructure

672
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:04,860
yeah

673
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,799
the fourth majoristic is the multiple

674
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,140
anti species so we applied

675
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,480
um different species uh or came up with

676
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,460
different species for the ants

677
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,860
um the first specie was the ones that

678
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,320
will Traverse over the edges only the

679
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,720
edges so they would go only forward

680
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,039
through the edge at the the edges of uh

681
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,720
the neural network of the mass the

682
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,100
superstructure

683
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,640
and these ones are going to define the

684
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,440
number of nodes in the generated

685
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,720
structure I will also Define the types

686
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,120
of the nodes uh in the superstructure

687
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,799
and when they're done with their work

688
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,559
then the social or the second species is

689
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,500
the social ants

690
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,039
well Traverse between these nodes but

691
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,460
they will use the uh their current edges

692
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,279
to do the to do to move between these

693
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,220
nodes so they will create them the

694
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,020
recurrent edges for them really

695
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,539
generated RNA and we have two different

696
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,600
species for these social ants or three

697
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,020
two different subtypes of species one is

698
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,320
um the forward so for so the forward uh

699
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,200
social ends we these ones progress only

700
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,919
over the uh that poor connections they

701
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,500
go from the input to the output but over

702
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,860
only over the the for the current edges

703
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,080
and then the back where it kind of just

704
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,659
all the backwards social ants these ones

705
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:33,720
go go from the output to the input and

706
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,299
the Traverse over the Recon connections

707
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:39,240
and the way the reason we thought about

708
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,100
these different species is that we

709
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,200
wanted to control the tendency of the

710
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,919
ants to wander in uh around in the

711
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,779
superstructure exploiting the the the

712
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,240
the convoluted

713
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,919
um mesh of

714
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,840
um recurrent connections

715
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,480
um so we wanted to control that so we

716
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,299
came up with this strategy so that we

717
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:01,080
can

718
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,020
just Define the structure using the

719
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,820
explore ends and then the recurrent

720
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,679
connections can be defined after that

721
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,539
using the social answer

722
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,240
the fifth the fifth um meteoristic is

723
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,760
the regularization of uh promo statement

724
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,980
again we want it to

725
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,380
um give advanced in an incentive to

726
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,799
bring to bring

727
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,059
sparser and also well performing neural

728
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,200
networks

729
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,620
um we by just penalizing them if they

730
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,220
bring if they constructed um denser or

731
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,260
bigger structures

732
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,179
so we added this regularization term and

733
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,340
um formula that updated the hormone

734
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,620
value

735
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,380
uh and as you see the regularization

736
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,779
term relies on the performance the Ada

737
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,159
here is the performance of the neural

738
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,980
network and also relies on the size of

739
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,539
the structure

740
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,120
um the last the thick and last one is um

741
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,480
is is is jumping and jumping ends which

742
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,760
is we want to experiment with

743
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,179
if we let the ends of

744
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,940
um if we let the names

745
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,100
um jump over layers when they move

746
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,620
through the uh

747
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,559
through the the superstructure

748
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,539
um if we let them jump over these layers

749
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:31,740
to construct the neural networks

750
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,140
compared to if we restrict their

751
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,399
movement uh to jump one layer at a time

752
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:41,100
how would this uh end up

753
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,039
um performance wise if they will give us

754
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,919
parser and while performing uh

755
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,320
structures or they will or this jumping

756
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,899
would hurt down the performance

757
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:56,279
um by keeping us weaker uh structures

758
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:59,279
so

759
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,679
um

760
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,039
we use the time series data uh that can

761
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,799
belong to coal-fired power plant uh we

762
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:11,940
divided the data to have uh 7200

763
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,179
um records for training and testing and

764
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,000
here the plot shows that the data and we

765
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,059
can see that it's non-linear and

766
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:24,659
um and it's a cycle and um and not

767
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,580
seasonal so it's hard it's a hard

768
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,019
problem for a non-um uh neural network

769
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,059
solution or a regression linear

770
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:36,120
regression solution so

771
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,820
the input consists of 12 parameters when

772
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,500
we when we we were trying to predict

773
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,019
only one parameter the flame intensity

774
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,840
experiments covered all of the

775
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,899
heuristics of uh of ants

776
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,820
um giving different values for these

777
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,600
different parameters

778
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,159
um the superstructure is consist of 12

779
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,659
really good nodes three hidden layers

780
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,299
and chapter 12 notes and one one output

781
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,340
node in the output player

782
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,740
um the recurrent connections spent over

783
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,260
um three time steps one two and three

784
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,639
times steps

785
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,339
um until the the superstructure had 49

786
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:19,739
nodes uh 9924 edges and almost 3.5

787
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:20,760
000

788
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,859
um recurrent address so if you unroll

789
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:26,820
the structure over 30 72 time steps uh

790
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,980
in in that propagation through time will

791
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,199
have about 3.5 sorry 352

792
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,659
um thousand you know which about 6.5

793
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:40,739
million edges and 20 about 26 million uh

794
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,119
recurring edges

795
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,940
we in the experience we also compared

796
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,219
performance of ants uh using the same

797
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,060
data set uh we compare it to exam and

798
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:56,940
need so exam is the state of the art in

799
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,760
um neural texture search which is

800
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,680
um genetic based

801
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,800
um methods we also compare it to neat

802
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,980
because it's like a benchmark in the new

803
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,700
Revolution and Nas uh well we and also

804
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,680
we convert it to fixed structures

805
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,920
unoptimized structures that were one two

806
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,900
and three uh that had one and two and

807
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,300
three hidden layers and also different

808
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,020
types of

809
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,960
memory based cells

810
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,359
the experiments covered 1600 experiments

811
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,859
to cover all the combinations of

812
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,540
premature heuristics and the heuristics

813
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,579
of ants

814
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,400
um each one of these experiments was

815
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,760
repeated 10 times for uh uh for

816
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,599
statistical analysis

817
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,300
um

818
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,300
Illustrated well 2000 rnns for each

819
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,200
experiment each trained for 10 Apex

820
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,680
in in total and it's generated about a

821
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,220
dream related training and evaluating

822
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,640
32 million uh rnns it took a month and

823
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,339
well and a thousand CPUs to finish the

824
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,619
experiments

825
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,579
the results that we got showed that ends

826
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,440
up from of course out from the

827
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,560
unstructured

828
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,359
unstructured structures uh unstructured

829
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,880
uh sorry unoptimized an optimized

830
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,880
structures and it also outperformed uh

831
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,200
need

832
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,020
and then some of the combinations of

833
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,500
ants outperforming sense so exam here is

834
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,420
the fourth from the left

835
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,820
and we can see that the the mean

836
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,579
absolute error or some of the versions

837
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,099
or the combinations in health and

838
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,140
heuristics uh

839
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,460
out from the exam

840
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,220
so we we try to look to do some

841
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,780
statistical

842
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,619
um

843
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:59,220
study or the results we got from ants so

844
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,880
we tried to look at the top uh

845
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,460
performing neural networks coming from

846
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,400
in our results so we try to look at the

847
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,339
top 10 25 120 200 250 and 500 results

848
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,980
and we could look at

849
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,079
um the contribution of these heuristics

850
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,500
in this best performing uh neural

851
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,839
networks or structures

852
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:28,260
we found that these heuristics

853
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,440
contributed effectively uh in most of

854
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,060
these results but

855
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,560
the more the

856
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,140
the thing that was really

857
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,140
um

858
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,320
um intriguing for us or or surprise

859
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,780
surprise us is that

860
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,260
um the that we saw that that their

861
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,000
current connections

862
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
um disappeared in this results because

863
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,260
the best performing neural networks

864
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,839
um didn't have that much of Recon

865
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,579
connections

866
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:06,119
um we would that mean meant for us that

867
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,180
the the the memory based cells did the

868
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,099
job for recurrent information coming

869
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:13,619
from the previous times test but we

870
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,619
wanted to just to expand on this layer

871
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,740
but so it's on our list on discussing on

872
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,899
on our future investigations

873
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,920
uh so this is just a summary for

874
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,320
um the achievements of ants based on the

875
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,380
results that we got from our experiments

876
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,339
foreign

877
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:54,540
exploiting recurrent connection prove

878
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,760
successful because

879
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,300
um the the regularization

880
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,800
component of the organization heuristics

881
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,260
from uh

882
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,780
it may give us better results showing

883
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,079
here in this table

884
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:13,079
and also the jumping ants jumping ants

885
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,359
here gave us better performance compared

886
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,560
to non-trumping ions

887
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,160
and uh

888
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,780
and the realization also um also the the

889
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,940
the the

890
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,680
data

891
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,280
which ring strategy also proved

892
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,099
um effective when we if we look at it

893
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,260
there is also here compared to if we

894
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,240
don't apply uh wage hearing

895
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,619
okay

896
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,220
so ultimizing and strategies uh are

897
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,500
generic so the the

898
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,000
strategies that we use are generic

899
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,220
enough to apply it for any

900
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,220
um any problem or solution that is end

901
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,020
Colony based and end call optimization

902
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,579
based

903
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,420
um

904
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,180
the Vermont deposition uh that the

905
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,280
method that we came up with is also the

906
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,900
value it wasn't introduced in any

907
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,839
illustrator previously creature

908
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,640
um and the performance of ads compared

909
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,099
to the other uh Benchmark and state of

910
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:28,680
Art in the realm is also

911
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,599
um remarkable

912
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,859
so

913
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:35,339
going forward we thought that and was

914
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:39,000
did gave us a good resource but the main

915
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,260
drawback of ants was that the the the

916
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,700
creature space

917
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,180
um so ants worked on this massively

918
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,300
connected uh

919
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,280
uhmetically connected superstructure but

920
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,760
it's massive yes but it's still uh

921
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,200
discrete

922
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,200
um ants can move freely between these um

923
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,380
nodes and or they are forced to move

924
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,960
over between these notes over these uh

925
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,260
predefined uh connections whether they

926
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,599
are forged edges or the current edges

927
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:16,140
so

928
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,320
um we thought of removing that

929
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,540
continuous search uh the streets of

930
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,040
space and replacing it with A continuous

931
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,440
space

932
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,640
so we designed a 3D search space

933
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,680
uh where

934
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,560
um the the search bit had like layers

935
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,800
representing the length the time lengths

936
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,500
um and then ants can jump over between

937
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,280
these these layers to have to give us

938
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,859
the the recurrent connections and on

939
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:50,099
each of these um layers hence will just

940
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,859
give us the forward and the port sorry

941
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,599
the edges between the nodes and the

942
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,680
edges between the nodes

943
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,960
um so in this line in the comic slides

944
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,780
we'll show an example of how I move in

945
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,060
cans or continuous and

946
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,040
um or continuous ends

947
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,160
um so the an agent or an ant will just

948
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,260
start by picking up one of the layers

949
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,320
that will move on this is done in a

950
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,640
discrete fashion

951
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,920
and once this is done it will then

952
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,480
decide if it's going to do an

953
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,240
exploitation exploration movement and

954
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,619
and this

955
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,780
um example we decided to do an

956
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,060
exploration movement so it will

957
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,020
um decide the angle and the radius of

958
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,520
its next allocation on on that layer

959
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,160
once that's done it's going to go

960
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,680
forward and to that location and then

961
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,060
decides if it's going to do an

962
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,460
exploitation or if the next move will be

963
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,040
exploitational exploration move and this

964
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,619
example

965
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:55,460
exploitation move so it will try to

966
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,380
exploit the formal traces the Vermont

967
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,359
that was previously deposited by other

968
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:04,319
fans on in the search space so it will

969
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,599
use that sensing radius that's something

970
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,280
that was is previously defined through

971
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,180
each end and then it will

972
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,780
um

973
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,560
find the center of mass of the hormone

974
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,859
traces and then once it finds that it

975
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,780
will calculates that Center of mass of

976
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,119
the hormone it will consider it as in

977
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:26,460
its next location

978
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,520
and then it will move to that spot

979
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,800
and then it will decide about this if

980
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,079
its next move will be an exploitation

981
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,079
exploration move an eight and and at

982
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,240
each location before it's deciding if

983
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,579
about the type of the step if it's

984
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,740
exploitational circulation it will also

985
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,839
decide that if it's going to stay at the

986
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,599
same level at the same time like or jump

987
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,060
on uh to a next timeline

988
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,760
um if if the jump or the movement is on

989
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,440
the same level

990
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,220
um

991
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,220
um if the if the movement is on the same

992
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,220
level the end when if the S is doing an

993
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,200
exploitation movement it will only

994
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,780
consider that from one phrases that is

995
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,140
uh um ahead of it

996
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,420
um because it can't move backwards on

997
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,540
the same time like

998
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,520
otherwise it will be doing backwards

999
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,880
step which is not allowed in in your

1000
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,420
Networks

1001
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,740
but if it's going to

1002
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,260
um another time lag

1003
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,800
um above above layer then it can be it

1004
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,780
then it's going to do a recurrent Edge

1005
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,940
and and so current edges can go back in

1006
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,220
time oh sorry back in the structure in

1007
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:49,140
the previous slide uh layer so now

1008
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,720
the ant can consider all the formal

1009
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,760
traces when it's tense and radius the

1010
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,619
ones that are ahead of it and the ones

1011
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,619
that are behind it so in this example he

1012
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:00,540
is going to consider

1013
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,460
um in this step is going to consider all

1014
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,079
the remote traces when it's sensing

1015
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,540
radius could calculate the center of

1016
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,839
mass and then consider it as its next

1017
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,880
position and then to keep doing do you

1018
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,400
keep doing this till it reaches to the

1019
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,880
proximity of the output nodes and once

1020
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,740
this is done it will consider it will

1021
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,099
decide which time which output node it

1022
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:26,400
will consider as its final position in

1023
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,599
its path from an input to the output

1024
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,140
and

1025
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,680
um then other ends will do the same

1026
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,040
and then we'll have different paths from

1027
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,300
some inputs and some outputs and then

1028
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,180
accounts will take these paths and then

1029
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,400
try to convince condense

1030
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,560
um the nodes so that we don't have so

1031
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,200
much nodes and and that are very close

1032
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,300
to each other so the one nodes that are

1033
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,599
within certain proximity will be uh

1034
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,300
clustered together using DB scan

1035
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,619
um to have less number of nodes and then

1036
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,440
the path will be the paths will be taken

1037
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,240
to

1038
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,700
collected and put in a structure

1039
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,660
a new enough structure and um then sent

1040
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,000
to a worker process to train and test

1041
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,040
and then compare it to the population

1042
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,500
the best performing RNs and the plus

1043
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,400
will be almost the same from this point

1044
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,819
will be almost the same as ants once the

1045
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,280
structure is constructed and the

1046
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,079
training and testing process

1047
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,839
will be the same as the ones that we

1048
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,560
discussed in dance

1049
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,500
um so this is this was also an animation

1050
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,579
which show which shows the the how these

1051
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:51,060
paths are taken by the ants uh look uh

1052
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,339
from an input to an output in the 3D

1053
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:54,420
space

1054
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,480
it's 3D search space

1055
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,020
so as if we look at ends uh the ants

1056
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,140
have uh only eight uh tunable hyper

1057
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,540
parameters compared to When comparing

1058
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,640
this to ends and exam it's half of the

1059
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,859
number of hyperplanners and other

1060
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:13,800
methods these hyper parameters are the

1061
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,599
number of ways layers of the search

1062
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,760
space the number of kind of legs how

1063
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,520
much how many of them we have in search

1064
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,920
space number of Agents number of ants

1065
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,859
which is similar to what we similar we

1066
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:28,140
have a similar uh hyper parameter and

1067
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,680
ants

1068
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:32,339
um

1069
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:34,980
the the sensing radius of the agents or

1070
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,240
the ants

1071
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,400
um and the agent's probability to create

1072
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,619
a new node uh which uh represents the

1073
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,540
exploration instead of exploitation of

1074
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,060
the parameters or all that from one uh

1075
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,640
back traces in the industries

1076
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,160
um node compensation

1077
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,880
um parameters or uh uh factors that the

1078
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,440
the the the

1079
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,200
the variables that are represented in

1080
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,900
the DB scan are considered also a hyper

1081
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,660
parameter hyper parameters and um in

1082
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,920
cancer

1083
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,900
um for one updating parameter and from

1084
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,940
one volatility primer and these are also

1085
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,280
present in

1086
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,660
um and and SEO based problems uh

1087
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,259
solution sorry

1088
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,640
um the experiments used three times

1089
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,319
years

1090
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,200
um different number of parameters and

1091
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,919
different sizes

1092
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,900
um the results showed that hence

1093
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,900
um

1094
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,060
the results that we got from cans were

1095
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,460
very uh competing with

1096
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,339
um ants out and exam

1097
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,160
um they weren't necessarily

1098
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,260
um better but they competed they were

1099
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,819
the same level

1100
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:55,560
um but it also uh did not didn't do very

1101
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,500
well uh on one of the database their

1102
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,440
data sets but it's uh comparing the that

1103
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,960
was comparing the performance of as the

1104
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,200
main absolute error but uh comparing

1105
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,200
cancer results uh from

1106
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:13,920
um

1107
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,359
the

1108
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,339
um

1109
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:19,880
sorry

1110
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:28,260
uh from the size of the new networks

1111
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,880
that we got from from Cairns we saw that

1112
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,160
case our structures were

1113
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,380
um sparser

1114
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,480
it so the performance was competing with

1115
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,420
uh hence and exam but the structures

1116
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,420
were also were compared compared to ants

1117
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:49,800
were much uh sparser uh similar to Sam

1118
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,740
uh the the size of the structure that

1119
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,859
we're getting from exam remember exam is

1120
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,960
um genetic based meaning that the start

1121
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,000
the structure the struct optimization

1122
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,740
process using the minimal structure

1123
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,599
elements

1124
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,060
um but it was susceptible to it was

1125
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,480
susceptible to local Minimus

1126
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,800
trap traps

1127
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,160
um and tense is not suitable to this

1128
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,099
problem but it also gave us

1129
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:19,740
um smaller structures and with

1130
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,420
performances that we're competing with

1131
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,020
other message examinants

1132
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,579
so the the advantages of cancer is that

1133
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:35,700
it's it has an unbalancer space compared

1134
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,079
to ants

1135
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,020
um result results compared uh the

1136
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,900
results that came out were good compared

1137
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,599
to ants and exam hyper parameters the

1138
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,760
tunable hyper parameters are half of the

1139
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,520
of these in examine ants

1140
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,220
um and also indirectly encoded the

1141
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,040
neural topology to 3D search space so

1142
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,720
this is one of them

1143
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,960
maybe the contributions of important

1144
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,220
contributions depends

1145
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,440
um then so so far aims and cans are

1146
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,880
solutions

1147
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,839
um that applied neural

1148
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,940
gold architecture search meaning that

1149
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,380
they did not

1150
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,859
optimize the synaptic parameters of the

1151
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:21,780
neural networks during the optimization

1152
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,079
process or during the evolution process

1153
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,680
so

1154
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,559
um we thought we thought of actually

1155
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,440
making ends capable of doing this as

1156
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,680
well so to train the neural network or

1157
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,920
optimize the synaptic weights uh the

1158
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,420
weights of the structure of the neural

1159
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,660
networks during the optimization process

1160
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,000
the structural optimization process so

1161
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,280
we added a fourth dimension to the

1162
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,920
search space

1163
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,960
which we embedded in uh embedded the

1164
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,420
weights of synaptic parameters

1165
00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:00,740
um in in that map this terminals in that

1166
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,440
new dimension

1167
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,380
we also uh wanted at the ends to be

1168
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,200
self-aware and try to

1169
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,380
evolve

1170
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,540
themselves through them the the

1171
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,839
evolution process so that they can

1172
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:21,900
um adapt to the changes or like um adapt

1173
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,819
themselves so that they can give us

1174
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,500
better performance

1175
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,020
um the the we want them to change their

1176
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,760
behavior of their characteristics like

1177
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,819
the sensing radius uh they had before

1178
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:35,579
for example they can be a variable that

1179
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:38,220
can be can change through the iteration

1180
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,380
thing evolve through decorations

1181
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,140
um each end can change their uh these

1182
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,339
characteristics uh as they are as the

1183
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:49,040
evolution goes on

1184
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,079
progress based on the performance of the

1185
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,460
neural networks that they are generating

1186
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,339
so um the the advantage of doing this

1187
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:08,220
was that it eliminated the back

1188
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,559
propagation process which is the most

1189
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,260
compilation completely expensive part in

1190
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,359
the evolution process and in the Pro in

1191
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,000
the in the in the method that we use so

1192
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,119
far in the exam ends and cans

1193
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,980
um so eliminating that that propagation

1194
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,819
gave us much much faster

1195
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:30,079
Revolution process

1196
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,640
there is also got

1197
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,920
um I will discuss the graph on the right

1198
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,839
hand side first which discusses the

1199
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:39,240
thickness or damage meaningful error of

1200
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,339
the results we got from

1201
00:53:41,339 --> 00:53:42,839
um

1202
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,720
back propagation free cancer the four

1203
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,359
dimension cans compared to the the

1204
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,339
normal chance the back propagation cans

1205
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:52,319
and um ends

1206
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,540
um so the results showed us that

1207
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,200
and again on a particular database

1208
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,900
um that that propagation uh canes and

1209
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,059
that propagation free chance

1210
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:06,059
um did a quite a similar job

1211
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:08,339
um and but they were both better than

1212
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:11,160
ants on this particular database

1213
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,800
um but they actually main contribution

1214
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,440
or the main advantage of applying case

1215
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,619
it shows up in the graph on the left

1216
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:23,099
hand side because we can see that if you

1217
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,140
compare the results

1218
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,200
um based on the time of the evolution

1219
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,020
that based on the evolution time we see

1220
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,280
that

1221
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,520
um hence with much had they took much

1222
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,660
much less time than the back propagation

1223
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:44,220
version of cans and uh the ants

1224
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,319
using these different

1225
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,579
um

1226
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,780
um and number of amps

1227
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,380
also this graph shows how fast and that

1228
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,900
propagation pre-cance compared to the

1229
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,359
normal cans

1230
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:04,020
um we could so in this figure the Curves

1231
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:08,760
in the data lines are shows the time

1232
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,280
um that back propagation free cans and

1233
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,099
cans took to prepare or generate the

1234
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:17,099
neural networks or we can see that that

1235
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:19,920
propagation free cans took more time

1236
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,500
uh to prepare or generate neural

1237
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,599
networks compared to Mac propagation

1238
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,520
cancer the normal case and that's

1239
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,800
because it has the fourth dimension also

1240
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,619
has to revolve the ends of the agents

1241
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,780
through the iteration so it needs more

1242
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,579
time to do that

1243
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,559
um but

1244
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:39,480
um the other curve the other two curves

1245
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,180
thing in dashed lines here are the lines

1246
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,520
that shows the the time the amount of

1247
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,240
time it took for the two methods to

1248
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,619
validate much

1249
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:51,780
um train and validate the neural

1250
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,800
networks

1251
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,500
so Mac propagation free cans doesn't

1252
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,359
have to train the neural network doesn't

1253
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,740
do

1254
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,260
um uh that propagation

1255
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,960
so it you can see that at the time it

1256
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,240
took is in an order of magnitude less

1257
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,380
than

1258
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,240
um the back propagation version of

1259
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,260
cancer

1260
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,720
and that's these solid lines shows the

1261
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,960
cumulative time took for both methods

1262
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,359
and of course it shows that that

1263
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:20,160
propagation precances took much much

1264
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,480
less time than

1265
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,720
um the back propagation three cans took

1266
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,920
much less time

1267
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,880
then the back propagation cancels

1268
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,460
um the future directions that we're just

1269
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,619
in the future points that we're

1270
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:36,660
concerning for uh

1271
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,400
sorry the point that we're considering

1272
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,579
for future work are to turn in against

1273
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:44,579
to a complete continuous space so um as

1274
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:45,839
you saw

1275
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:49,680
um we we the the the third the search

1276
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,579
space for cans is not purely

1277
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:56,460
um uh continuous because the time next

1278
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,520
are represented by discrete layers uh we

1279
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,319
want to replace this with the continuous

1280
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,240
Dimension continuous

1281
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,640
um layer representing the lag uh the

1282
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,240
time lag in in rnns however this is a

1283
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,460
little bit challenging because the num

1284
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,819
the time length has to be uh known prior

1285
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:18,900
to uh any optimization process because

1286
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,780
um other than that we we we will be in

1287
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,260
mapping the whole uh we the whole time

1288
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:29,180
series uh as um time lapse and then

1289
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,559
picking the time next from them which is

1290
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:32,460
not

1291
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,500
um feasible so

1292
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,960
this is the first thing we the first

1293
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,059
point we're considering to investigate

1294
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:42,480
for in future work the second one is to

1295
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,540
um investigate this finding that we

1296
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,380
found we we have we found in in in in

1297
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,420
the results

1298
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,059
um in ants where the recurrent

1299
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:55,740
connections disappear from the best

1300
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,619
performing uh structures

1301
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:00,540
um and the theory that we have is that

1302
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:03,720
the memory based cells replace these

1303
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,040
connections to give us the information

1304
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,040
that we need from the past 9 steps

1305
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,400
um so that they were more effective uh

1306
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,040
more efficient in doing this compared to

1307
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,260
their connections so we have to do this

1308
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,640
get expand on this and investigated more

1309
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,740
um the last thing we want to consider

1310
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,980
also mean this is one of the top things

1311
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,599
that we want just these three points on

1312
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,480
the wall the top on our list

1313
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,520
um the third one is to

1314
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,200
actually

1315
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,940
um you consider one of the the concept

1316
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,480
that was coined in a book by Dr Deborah

1317
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,740
Gordon

1318
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,040
um which we where she mentioned that

1319
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,099
um the living

1320
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:53,400
um organism in in ant's world is not are

1321
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,440
not the age themselves but there are the

1322
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,480
colonies the colonies are are the

1323
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,640
organisms that are

1324
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,240
um the the the start and they grow and

1325
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,980
and they interact with the environment

1326
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,960
of the ecosystem they interact with them

1327
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,359
with other colonies and they die at some

1328
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,359
point and the so the ants themselves are

1329
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:14,339
not organized they are the cells of

1330
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:17,400
these organisms The Colony organisms so

1331
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,799
we want to take that concept and apply

1332
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:22,859
it in our methods to have a number of

1333
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:26,839
colonies living together in parallel

1334
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:29,339
evolving and communicating with each

1335
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:32,339
other so that we and we want to see if

1336
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,740
this will give us a better performance

1337
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,480
but because after all we're trying to

1338
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,540
mimic nature in our in this in in the

1339
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,040
solution we we we're trying to

1340
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,520
investigate

1341
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,500
um so with this

1342
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,140
um I'm done with my presentation and if

1343
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:52,279
you have any questions

1344
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:56,059
foreign

1345
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,319
awesome wow

1346
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,299
what a great presentation

1347
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:03,299
how about you Travis and Alexander

1348
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,799
either of you which want to go first

1349
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,900
please feel free to give an introduction

1350
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,359
and any primary remarks that you have on

1351
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,540
that

1352
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,780
okay I can say something I don't have

1353
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,460
too much to add I think I'll go around

1354
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,579
and did a pretty good job you know going

1355
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:25,680
over the core bits of the work

1356
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,960
um I'm Alex rorbia I'm an assistant

1357
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,260
professor in computer science uh in

1358
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,240
affiliate faculty affiliate professor in

1359
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,980
Psychology and affiliate faculty in

1360
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,079
computational neuroscience at the

1361
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:40,020
Rochester Institute of Technology and I

1362
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,599
work on a lot of stuff but rain

1363
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,400
primarily predictive coding active

1364
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,040
inference variational free energy a lot

1365
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,059
of the stuff that's actually of interest

1366
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:51,299
to this group and uh uh yeah and this

1367
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:52,680
was a particularly interesting project

1368
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,599
for me because a branch of my own

1369
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:56,700
research is working in

1370
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,280
neuro-evolutionary methods or even just

1371
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,500
nature inspired meta heuristic

1372
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,619
optimization and uh you know when I got

1373
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,660
the pleasure of working with Abdul

1374
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,839
Rahman when he was a PhD student at RIT

1375
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:11,880
you know we you know we talked a lot

1376
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,460
about uh the and colony-based

1377
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,319
optimization approaches and I encouraged

1378
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,440
him and to do to look into sort of like

1379
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,240
the origins and also I try to understand

1380
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,520
actually how physical ants behave so

1381
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,920
that was always fascinating to me

1382
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,960
um I don't have too much to edit in

1383
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,460
terms of the technical Parts I think he

1384
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,440
covered all the core results the only

1385
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,839
thing I I like to think about and I'm

1386
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,780
actually more fascinated to to hear from

1387
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,880
the active infants Institute their

1388
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,880
interest in the and Colony methods and

1389
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,619
particularly what was interesting to

1390
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:47,280
them because uh thinking about what does

1391
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,619
and calling optimization how do you view

1392
01:01:49,619 --> 01:01:51,480
it from like an active inference

1393
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,819
perspective is I think particularly

1394
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:55,980
interesting and thinking and I even had

1395
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,599
a thought I don't know if this was a

1396
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,180
question among the audience's mine do

1397
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,579
the little ant agents or the can't

1398
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:04,319
agents that I'll build around and

1399
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,359
described earlier

1400
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:08,520
um you know what is there a way to start

1401
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,559
to view them as like a multi-agent

1402
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,359
system that's optimizing some

1403
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:15,119
variational free energy quantity uh and

1404
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,440
you know because you know a lot of even

1405
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,660
like Carl's work I mean I collaborate

1406
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,460
with him you know sort of touches into

1407
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,380
this area of like well what happens with

1408
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,260
collective intelligence and societal

1409
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,119
organization and you can kind of look

1410
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,059
look at free energy from these very very

1411
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:32,339
high level viewpoints all the way down

1412
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:34,799
to fine-grained Cellular activity and so

1413
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,740
I'm actually more curious to know when

1414
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,480
Daniel and anyone else in the active

1415
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,400
entrances who can sort of explain

1416
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,319
they're particularly interested in and

1417
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:45,480
based optimization and meta heuristic

1418
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,040
optimization I'm curious to know that

1419
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,720
but there could be some interesting

1420
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,599
viewpoints of you know like what is the

1421
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,220
the free energy I think the ants

1422
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,760
themselves are very simple I mean we

1423
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,260
have made them more intelligent I know

1424
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,940
of the Roman and I talked at length

1425
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:02,400
about well what if we even made them for

1426
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,020
example have like a reinforcement

1427
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,240
learning control system and you could

1428
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,280
even imagine well now what if the cans

1429
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,579
themselves uh you know engage in a form

1430
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,220
of active inference themselves what

1431
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,020
would that look like for the system and

1432
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,940
they are optimizing their own free

1433
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,640
energy those are just fun little thought

1434
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,740
experiments I we have obviously not

1435
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,260
worked on them uh at least Abdul Rahman

1436
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,140
was never exposed by me to that part of

1437
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,680
my world uh in you know and biomimetic

1438
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,140
intelligence so those are my comments

1439
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,579
I'm not sure if they're particularly

1440
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:37,920
helpful but they're very general uh and

1441
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,900
actually more curious to know from the

1442
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,059
active inference Institute uh their

1443
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:43,799
interest in it and you know where does

1444
01:03:43,799 --> 01:03:45,780
that maybe perhaps intersect or is it

1445
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,280
just like oh we like you know

1446
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,559
interesting topics and intelligence and

1447
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:52,319
so yeah

1448
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,079
thank you Alexandra Travis you want to

1449
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:57,000
say hello and give any Reflections on

1450
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,359
The Talk

1451
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,099
we're all coming hope somebody can see

1452
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:03,200
me a little bit

1453
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,940
in White Jungle here I'm hi I'm Travis's

1454
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,920
cell I'm an associate professor at RIT

1455
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,079
I'm also also the graduate program

1456
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,579
director for a master's in data science

1457
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,140
so if any of you are interested in any

1458
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,000
of this or data science please you know

1459
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,799
shoot me an email

1460
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,359
um you know I thought this work was

1461
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:21,480
really very interesting in a lot of ways

1462
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,760
so a lot of Dollarama was working on it

1463
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,559
um I think one of the coolest Parts

1464
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:28,440
about it is a popular neuro Evolution

1465
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,880
algorithm

1466
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,380
um that came after me is called

1467
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:35,460
hyperneat and it transforms the

1468
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,859
um discrete search space of neural

1469
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:39,599
architecture search into a continuous

1470
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:40,559
one

1471
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,299
um and it's it's shown to be pretty a

1472
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:44,099
pretty powerful method well this this

1473
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:46,140
version of ant colony optimization the

1474
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,180
new one does the same thing that makes

1475
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,280
the search space continuous but what I

1476
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,740
found was really cool about it was that

1477
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,200
um as opposed to traditional ant colony

1478
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,760
optimization where you have a graph and

1479
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,859
you just send the amps along the edges

1480
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:00,839
of the graph and you can and you take

1481
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:02,280
the best paths and construct a graph

1482
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,200
after it um here the answer actually

1483
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,180
working like ants in the real world will

1484
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,180
move a continuous amount of space not

1485
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,520
just from point A to point B

1486
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,380
um and actually dropping down pheromones

1487
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:16,200
and it's more like a real simulation of

1488
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,480
how ants would move around in the real

1489
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,619
world

1490
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:21,540
um and we're getting better results from

1491
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,660
it than some of the old older methods so

1492
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,660
um I think that is that really made me

1493
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,180
be kind of happy to see that and thought

1494
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,640
it made it as a very very interesting

1495
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,819
work

1496
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,980
that's awesome um Ahmed want to add

1497
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,960
anything or I'm happy to give a thought

1498
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,760
on the ants and ask some questions from

1499
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,380
the live chat

1500
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,000
oh I'm good

1501
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,680
um trying to think covered all of the

1502
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,140
things that we I wanted to say

1503
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:52,020
um about uh um I think just one thing

1504
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:55,260
that Alex mentioned that we give higher

1505
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,819
intelligence to the agent is something

1506
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,819
that we discussed and I'm pretty much uh

1507
01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:01,619
open to that I've started actually to

1508
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:02,940
think about it but they didn't Implement

1509
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:06,180
anything yet however the the last thing

1510
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,619
that I discussed in the future

1511
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:09,540
directions is something that I actually

1512
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,880
started working on but they didn't start

1513
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,920
the experiment patients yeah so

1514
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,260
hopefully we will see something out of

1515
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:18,380
that

1516
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,780
awesome well there's a ton of ways to go

1517
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,880
and isn't that kind of one of the

1518
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,740
fundamental questions like in an

1519
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:29,160
interactive setting either pure agent

1520
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,099
stigmergy interaction or multi-agent but

1521
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:34,319
ultimately mediated through multiple

1522
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,480
stigma G's with like reading and writing

1523
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,819
and error correcting codes so in that

1524
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:41,339
communication setting

1525
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:43,819
um I felt like the work

1526
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:46,700
generalizes along multiple Dimensions

1527
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:50,220
that previously approaches to

1528
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,900
multi-aging just didn't have those kinds

1529
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,420
of flexibilities like the continuous

1530
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,819
time feature and and several other

1531
01:06:56,819 --> 01:06:58,859
features and

1532
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:00,980
um

1533
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:02,880
I guess with respect to the ants

1534
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,079
themselves

1535
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,559
um I did five Summers of field work with

1536
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:11,460
ants in the USA Southwest in Arizona

1537
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,400
and observed a lot of foraging activity

1538
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,780
so

1539
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:19,880
fat problem or that context or setting

1540
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,980
is really a fun one and a pervasive one

1541
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,740
across any kind of living system

1542
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,020
anything that's going to be active

1543
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,599
and uh living so

1544
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:33,859
why did you pursue foraging type

1545
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:38,700
algorithms overall and does this class

1546
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,420
include the interaction based methods

1547
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,299
with direct agent contacts that

1548
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:47,280
Professor Gordon highlights in the ant

1549
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,000
encounters

1550
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:54,119
yeah I I wouldn't try to respond to this

1551
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,220
but I I just learned to act to mention

1552
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,619
that the British thought about this map

1553
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:01,200
actually Travis started this idea about

1554
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,420
using and quantumization in your version

1555
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,700
our new architecture search by applying

1556
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,339
this method in simpler neural networks

1557
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:10,200
uh Elma and Gordon neural networks your

1558
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,299
Cardinal networks and I did believe from

1559
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:14,160
there and started working on my pieces

1560
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,238
my my patient pieces so uh we thought

1561
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:20,520
about this idea I think I I mentioned a

1562
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,979
little bit about why we used uh and

1563
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:24,779
quantumization in previous slide but

1564
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:28,679
just repeating that for the audience to

1565
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:30,719
make sure that I the God we thought

1566
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,238
about this idea because

1567
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:36,620
um anytimization was applied for uh as a

1568
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:39,779
graph this uh a graph optimization

1569
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:43,679
solution and we thought that why not and

1570
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,600
why not your networks since they are in

1571
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,339
business uh neural networks they are

1572
01:08:47,339 --> 01:08:50,219
directed so they are directed grants are

1573
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:52,799
directed perhaps because the the flow of

1574
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,420
information goes from one direction to

1575
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,040
another Direction so that direction but

1576
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,719
they also graph because they are nodes

1577
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:01,859
connected with address and our ultimate

1578
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:04,859
aim or goal is was to optimize the

1579
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:06,779
structure by removing and adding

1580
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:08,580
elements States so that it gives us

1581
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:10,080
better performance

1582
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,160
okay

1583
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,040
awesome and and what one way that

1584
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,839
Professor Gordon and others have have

1585
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,960
talked about that bi-directional uh

1586
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,219
learning relationship between the

1587
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:21,779
computer science and the math and the

1588
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:24,238
analytical formulations and then the the

1589
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:26,520
field work and the actual behavior is

1590
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,219
because the thousands of species of ants

1591
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:33,238
they're working amidst a huge range of

1592
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:35,939
ecologies with all these different

1593
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:38,339
patterns of regularities all these

1594
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:40,020
different resource distributions and

1595
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,420
foraging it's amazing how General it is

1596
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,219
yet it's also just one of the

1597
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:46,319
functionalities that need to occur in

1598
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,460
terms of these like even slower

1599
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,238
processes like allocation of tissue to

1600
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:53,880
faster processes even of like response

1601
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,219
to alarm pheromone so it's like this one

1602
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:59,100
class of algorithms

1603
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,400
clearly scales across from view

1604
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,800
ultimately one some of these foraging

1605
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,100
algorithms are law enforesters they

1606
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,420
don't leave Fairmont Trails so it's like

1607
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,100
even the idea of leaving a single

1608
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,160
positive pheromone or leaving then but

1609
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,600
also there's things models can do that

1610
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,400
ants can't do like the time travel

1611
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,000
pheromone lossless perception High

1612
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,060
dimensional uh signaling profiles that

1613
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,980
can't occur just with like finite

1614
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,380
amounts of molecules and

1615
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,140
um now they are just persisting on their

1616
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:34,260
path as active agents within one

1617
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,420
generation with a variational free

1618
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:38,159
energy at the behavioral scale and then

1619
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:39,360
across generations with that

1620
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,540
evolutionary layer and the relationships

1621
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,739
between the neural network

1622
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,320
implementation and the active inference

1623
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,360
model they're kind of like two ways of

1624
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,000
describing slash implementing

1625
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,460
um yeah I'd be curious to hear any of

1626
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,900
your thoughts on where you see active

1627
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,960
inference coming into play or how do you

1628
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,719
see old ultimately similarities and

1629
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,940
differences between neural network-based

1630
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:05,340
approaches and active inference-based

1631
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:08,640
approaches are they same complementary

1632
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,640
overlapping

1633
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,280
you guys want to stick this one

1634
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,940
I think this might be more of an Alex

1635
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,080
question to be honest

1636
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,100
well yeah I mean if you want to keep it

1637
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,600
on active inference but I think Travis

1638
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,980
you're going to need to tag in when you

1639
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,719
want to get into the very specifics of

1640
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,900
like the actual and Colony details

1641
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,540
because again I kind of see Dan Colony

1642
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,360
optimization from a more global point of

1643
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,520
view I would say

1644
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,760
so to be clear I mean this particular

1645
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,440
work that I'll be so that way of the ram

1646
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,480
is not also completely blindsided by

1647
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,699
your question Daniel even though the

1648
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:53,100
name is in the Institute itself uh this

1649
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,560
isn't an active inference work so you

1650
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,420
know again while there are obviously as

1651
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,580
you pointed out lots of interesting

1652
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,620
elements like for example the fact that

1653
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,600
the ants when they conduct their

1654
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,460
exploration along let's just think about

1655
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,199
like the recurring networks and they're

1656
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,340
figuring out what nodes and what as

1657
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,560
uh explain the superstructure right as

1658
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,540
they iterate across with the pheromone

1659
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,940
trails and figure out what nodes I want

1660
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,100
to recurrently connect be forward

1661
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,400
connect skip connect so on and so forth

1662
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,380
um you you would say well okay what

1663
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,000
these ants are doing is they're engaging

1664
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,239
in epistemic foraging which is a key

1665
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:32,760
Concept in active inference or idid so

1666
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,320
that way I'll build Ramen and Travis are

1667
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,260
not also left behind by jargon uh Epi

1668
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:40,020
Summit forging in active inference it's

1669
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,060
a big General framework it's like a

1670
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:45,179
biological neurobiological process to RL

1671
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:47,340
and epistemic just refers to kind of

1672
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,020
like the uncertainty Travis that you and

1673
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,659
I work on and the ideas it's saying well

1674
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:55,440
okay I want to understand my world and

1675
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,080
the more that I explore my world right

1676
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,420
there will be things that surprise me

1677
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,760
less but if I encounter some information

1678
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,460
that is really weird when I build a

1679
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,500
generative World model or a predictive

1680
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,600
World model that's very surprising I

1681
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,640
should probably explore that

1682
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,040
um and so of course I'm condensing the

1683
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,719
concept down into sort of like the

1684
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:18,600
exploration part of the explore exploit

1685
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,540
trade-off and that I know you know but

1686
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,219
uh that characterizes reinforcement

1687
01:13:23,219 --> 01:13:24,540
learning so that's just what we mean

1688
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:27,000
when we say epistemic or epistemic

1689
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,980
foraging and obviously of the ramen

1690
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:31,560
foraging you know can be likened to what

1691
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,699
the ants are doing right they're

1692
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:34,260
exploring their environment

1693
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,260
and so I guess with that in mind so that

1694
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,880
way everyone's sort of on the same page

1695
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,920
here uh to get to your question about

1696
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,440
the differences about how does this work

1697
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,780
versus like your typical neural based

1698
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,120
approaches to active inference in I

1699
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,219
would fall into that category of oh I

1700
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:52,440
build neural models biological process

1701
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,080
models uh those are very much focused

1702
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,900
you could say at the individual level at

1703
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,340
least the ones that I am aware of when

1704
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,960
you're building for example even a back

1705
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,960
propagation based uh partially

1706
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,840
observable Markov decision process in uh

1707
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,940
you know active inference that's like a

1708
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,260
single agent right you're trying to

1709
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:12,420
build this construct that is trying to

1710
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:15,420
you know balance the epistemic quantity

1711
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:17,880
with its instrumental term which by the

1712
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,860
way another jargon term for you of the

1713
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,199
ramen and Travis that's just like your

1714
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:24,780
reward signal or your prior preference

1715
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:27,000
or a prior distribution over goal States

1716
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,520
and so the agent these agents sort of

1717
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,980
like deal with that trade-off but at an

1718
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:33,780
individual agent level now again I'm

1719
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,699
sure there's an interpretations of these

1720
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:37,159
from other perspectives

1721
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:40,739
the ant-based approach even though I

1722
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:43,260
would not argue per se that this has at

1723
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,120
least an explicit form or a connection

1724
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,280
at least that Bob the ramen has made

1725
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,500
clear to active inference but the idea

1726
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,300
is that this is like a multi-agent

1727
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,000
approach to active inference and so the

1728
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,219
ants when they conduct their epistemic

1729
01:14:56,219 --> 01:14:58,920
forging which arguably is a very very

1730
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,920
simple model each and each Anton of

1731
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,500
themselves is you know essentially a

1732
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,600
bunch of you know coefficients and some

1733
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,300
hard-coded rules uh because they're uh

1734
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,280
their job is essentially to work

1735
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,380
together with their pheromone trails to

1736
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,179
figure out oh what parts of the

1737
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:17,340
superstructure are useful so I'd say

1738
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,620
that that's different and it lends

1739
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,780
itself in some ways of course you can

1740
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,580
make the ants more complicated and lose

1741
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,159
the benefit I'm just about to say you

1742
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:27,840
could massively parallelize this and

1743
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,640
this is one of those key strengths that

1744
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:33,420
I think is natural in for example a lot

1745
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:36,060
of actually transpired optimization

1746
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:39,000
algorithms and and Colony optimization

1747
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,860
is one of them is you know Abdul ramen's

1748
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,800
been using hundreds of CPUs and you can

1749
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,300
put these ants on their own individual

1750
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,820
processor and the communication that's

1751
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,739
you know occurring across them as they

1752
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:51,540
exchange information

1753
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,640
is you know through the pheromone Trails

1754
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,260
there's an indirect mechanism it's not

1755
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,719
terribly complex to facilitate and I'm

1756
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,699
sure that there's even better ways to go

1757
01:15:59,699 --> 01:16:01,679
about doing like asynchronous forms of

1758
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,260
communication and further further

1759
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,659
optimizes I Know Travis and Travis can

1760
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:08,580
add to this has done things on like

1761
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,860
citizen science and uh distributed

1762
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,659
computing through you know the you know

1763
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:14,940
volunteer volunteer Computing and how

1764
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,739
you can distribute this through a

1765
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:19,199
massive Global asynchronous Network so

1766
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:22,620
you can imagine adapting the uh ant form

1767
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,719
sorry the ant colony optimization

1768
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,360
approach to some like distributed

1769
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,520
massively distributed version of active

1770
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,440
inference where you essentially have to

1771
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,900
write down that the variational free

1772
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,480
energy and I'm I'm putting quotes around

1773
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,640
this because again there is no concrete

1774
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,280
term written in out the ramen's work I

1775
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,080
mean because we haven't at least we

1776
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,820
haven't viewed this from the active

1777
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:46,800
inference perspective directly each ant

1778
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,659
is optimizing its own variational free

1779
01:16:48,659 --> 01:16:50,340
energy but then there's probably a

1780
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,980
global quantity that sort of is really

1781
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:55,739
as a function of those pheromone trails

1782
01:16:55,739 --> 01:16:58,199
in the individual hand agents

1783
01:16:58,199 --> 01:16:59,520
um and then of course with the

1784
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,120
exploitation term or the instrumental or

1785
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,679
the uh you know what is the reward

1786
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:07,440
signal to give an RL term that's sort of

1787
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,900
driven by the performance of the actual

1788
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:13,320
agent on the each candidate agent on the

1789
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,540
task right of the ramen you compute like

1790
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,860
mean squared error when you're doing

1791
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:19,380
time series predictions so in some sense

1792
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:22,080
we have built-in you know uh a reward

1793
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,900
function that we use and again for those

1794
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,300
in the active inference group here you

1795
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,800
know you can use the complete class

1796
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,199
theorem and look at you know the prior

1797
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,120
preferences saying oh well the reward is

1798
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,980
actually technically a prior preference

1799
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:38,100
right it's like a log probability so

1800
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,560
with that in mind you could squint at

1801
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,140
and Colony optimization and I guess the

1802
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,360
big benefit comes from that massive

1803
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,100
parallelization that you wouldn't

1804
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,920
actually very easily if at all get with

1805
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,679
you know our single agent neural based

1806
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:54,000
approaches

1807
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,380
um and that might be an interesting

1808
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,960
place to build on and I'll stop rambling

1809
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,400
at this point I'm not sure if that was

1810
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,759
helpful

1811
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,640
that that was awesome even earlier today

1812
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,280
Chris fields in the physics as

1813
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,920
information processing course was

1814
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,860
talking about the classical information

1815
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,120
inscribed on the blanket which is like

1816
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,520
the pheromone perception and deposition

1817
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,620
pheromone modification and and

1818
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,140
perception sense making an action which

1819
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:24,719
we can associate with like the nest mate

1820
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,719
cognitive system so then there could be

1821
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:29,400
as simple as a pass-through for the nest

1822
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,460
mate could be any arbitrary relationship

1823
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:35,159
described with a blanket simple Nest

1824
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:37,620
mate sophisticated Nest mate

1825
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,719
um like another level of Time series

1826
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:41,040
modeling

1827
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,560
whereas there's the environmental time

1828
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,679
series modeling and that's just in the

1829
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:48,780
ants and then the

1830
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:49,920
um

1831
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,739
fourth dimension is like that Quantum

1832
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:55,380
rotation which goes from the lower

1833
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,780
dimensional classical stigmergic screen

1834
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,500
into the quantum informational space and

1835
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,600
so that's one of the discussions on

1836
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,000
going in octinf right now is about well

1837
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,840
previous approaches to connect Quantum

1838
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,900
formalisms to

1839
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,840
macro let's just say neural phenomena

1840
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,820
based it upon the plausibility of like a

1841
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,860
molecular electronic

1842
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:23,400
bubbling up whereas just with research

1843
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,940
from decision making and statistics and

1844
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:29,820
just multi-perspectival modeling and all

1845
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:31,260
the issues associated with the

1846
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,300
physicalities information transfer the

1847
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,679
finiteness of it

1848
01:19:34,679 --> 01:19:37,560
the quantum formalism becomes useful

1849
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,140
just by itself with or without Reliance

1850
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,580
on some other

1851
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,760
electronic phenomena so it's just a lot

1852
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,560
of very interesting connections like

1853
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,239
having the degrees of freedom on the

1854
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,000
blanket which could be noiseless and

1855
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,340
four bits or it could be noisy with this

1856
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,340
really specific thing but in silico you

1857
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,360
get to

1858
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,239
play it from both sides and scale things

1859
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,219
up and down and do these meta heuristics

1860
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,739
on top of that arbitrary space could be

1861
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:07,199
really simple for learning or it could

1862
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:10,080
be however much and and then just like

1863
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,760
the ant colony algorithm is is

1864
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,480
ultimately Federated through embodiment

1865
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,820
that property makes it a really useful

1866
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,159
candidate for biomimetry so a lot of

1867
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:21,300
times when people think about collect

1868
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,980
Behavior they're thinking about like the

1869
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,500
flock of birds and the school of fish

1870
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,239
and those are of course Collective

1871
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,400
systems and Collective behavioral and

1872
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,140
all these kinds of like complex systems

1873
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:32,100
properties

1874
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,600
can be studied in that type of system

1875
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,320
but it is also neglecting it at least an

1876
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,000
analytical degree of Freedom with the

1877
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,199
stigma G

1878
01:20:40,199 --> 01:20:44,580
so that really opens up that both the

1879
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,739
quantum the classical information

1880
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:49,880
or both Niche modification and

1881
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,120
behavioral uh and cognitive modeling so

1882
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,280
just to add on because I think and and

1883
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,219
then also what the node is could even be

1884
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:02,159
heterogeneous or unknown or fit in in

1885
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:03,719
different ways or fixed through design

1886
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:06,239
processes so just like the ant colonies

1887
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,640
are flexible enabling them to live in

1888
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,460
all kinds of places make all these kinds

1889
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:13,620
of nested decisions to interact with

1890
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,480
each other

1891
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,699
that that flexibility is just like the

1892
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:19,800
tip of the iceberg of what we could even

1893
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,900
just describe because there would always

1894
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,940
be real environments we hadn't yet tried

1895
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,380
with ant colony so we really would never

1896
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,960
know the full extent of like all the

1897
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,540
repertoire and the Dynamics of the ant

1898
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:35,040
system but then we can just abduct into

1899
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,480
new mathematical statistical

1900
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,560
distributional Frameworks pull back to

1901
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,000
different levels of the learning in The

1902
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,500
Meta learning process and just start

1903
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:47,280
there and then um almost ironically or

1904
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,560
or um maybe the opposite of that like it

1905
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,840
could be applied to ant colony video

1906
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,320
data or movement data or foraging

1907
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,659
activity itself but

1908
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:59,699
it kind of

1909
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:01,920
takes inspiration and develops in

1910
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,960
parallel or in conversation so it's not

1911
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,659
like balance what real ants can do or

1912
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:08,880
you could constrain it so that there are

1913
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,120
properties that real ants have like they

1914
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,620
can only interact with in this certain

1915
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,719
way or like there really are only this

1916
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:18,960
many pheromones do model comparison so

1917
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,840
it's it's a lot of degrees of freedom I

1918
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,940
feel like you all are opening up with

1919
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,640
the ant colony modeling and also one of

1920
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,199
the challenging pieces of multi-agent

1921
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:30,000
simulation is kind of like the

1922
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
open-endedness with the design space

1923
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,699
so then it's very hard for even creative

1924
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:37,320
ideas like sometimes to find the right

1925
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,840
compute resources that that obviously

1926
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,940
are still even needed for for what you

1927
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,500
discovered

1928
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,560
um with the analysis here an awesome

1929
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,080
question from Bert in the chat I just

1930
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,500
wanna I just want to clarify just so uh

1931
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,600
make sure that I got the right term and

1932
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,060
certainly Abdullah Ramen and Travis you

1933
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:58,440
might want to look it up is when you

1934
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,820
were saying blanket you were referring

1935
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:03,179
to a Markov blanket correct yes so the

1936
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,580
technical definition of Markov blanket

1937
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:08,520
is when you have a Bayesian graph where

1938
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,080
nodes are the variables and edges are

1939
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,520
relationships amongst these variables

1940
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,159
for any given node of Interest we'll

1941
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,659
just call it internal States so these

1942
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:16,980
are not features of the world it's not

1943
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,260
tagged on to some tissue of a real Nest

1944
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,760
mate in the world this is something

1945
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,500
that's tagged onto or like a perspective

1946
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,420
we could take on any node in a base

1947
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,520
graph and then all the nodes that

1948
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,880
insulate it in the co-parents are known

1949
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,219
as the blanket in the sense that it's

1950
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:35,159
like one layer insulator and there's a

1951
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:36,659
lot of more discussion on it and the

1952
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:38,640
philosophical implications and all these

1953
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,340
generalizations of that

1954
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:43,500
but broadly the Markov blanket is just

1955
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,780
the inbound dependencies which we

1956
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,460
associate with sense making and

1957
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:50,340
perception learning attention and then

1958
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:53,520
the outgoing dependencies for the agents

1959
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,380
which we associate with like action

1960
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:57,659
influence in

1961
01:23:57,659 --> 01:24:00,360
some Downstream pointing way

1962
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,340
thank you I just wanted to clarify that

1963
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:04,860
because I don't think Abdul Rahman and

1964
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:06,600
Travis might be familiar just with that

1965
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,480
terminology it's very uh forstonian you

1966
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,460
know very active inferency kind of

1967
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,560
jargon so I wanted to make sure that

1968
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,239
they got that from the physics point of

1969
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:18,179
view thanks yeah yeah totally great

1970
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:20,520
point and um

1971
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,960
ask a question now from bird supper says

1972
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,360
very impressive solving generative

1973
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,219
models with more generative models

1974
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:31,199
sounds very promising what about

1975
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:35,239
replacing ants with convolutions

1976
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:42,000
I'd like a meta learning algorithm like

1977
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,860
having a neural networks that learns how

1978
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:47,480
to optimize your other neural networks

1979
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:51,199
yeah I mean this concept I think is is

1980
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,400
interviewed at some point I mean in

1981
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,520
machine regular but we we wanted to

1982
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:01,140
apply for nature based uh method that

1983
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:04,260
mimics like the the mother nature which

1984
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:08,040
is the uh you know uh nature is the most

1985
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,320
efficient optimization Revolution system

1986
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,760
so

1987
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,219
um looking at the results that we could

1988
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:16,199
that are there in those nature implying

1989
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:18,840
nature based methods uh they were

1990
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,420
Superior to any other method

1991
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,980
um and the results we got also which

1992
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,020
just pointed out that pointed that out

1993
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,719
that we so good performers are coming

1994
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:29,580
out from these results from our results

1995
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:31,380
and previous results from other methods

1996
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:32,820
as well

1997
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:35,520
so so I hop in here a little a little

1998
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,900
bit too

1999
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,300
um in the case of neural architecture

2000
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,620
research there's kind of a couple

2001
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,540
classes of approaches all right one is

2002
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,580
constructive so kind of like where we

2003
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:47,580
build larger and larger networks and try

2004
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,800
and keep your network size as minimal to

2005
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,320
try and find your optimal solution other

2006
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,120
types of neural architecture search

2007
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,400
approaches use like a superstructure and

2008
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,500
this is kind of how the the earlier

2009
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,780
iterations of this were where you have a

2010
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,699
bound of your search space and you try

2011
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,139
and find the optimal Network within that

2012
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:05,940
bound so one is like trying to build

2013
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,320
things from the ground up and the other

2014
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,260
one's trying to like trim down a big

2015
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:12,300
Network to a small Network

2016
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,840
um ask your question about convolutions

2017
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,880
there's a type of there's been a fair

2018
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,560
bit of research lately in what's called

2019
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,719
graph based neural networks which can

2020
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:24,960
which can use convolutions over like a

2021
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,179
discrete Graph Search space and can

2022
01:26:27,179 --> 01:26:28,920
potentially produce other graphs and I

2023
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,239
believe there's been some neural

2024
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:32,580
architect architecture search work using

2025
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:35,580
this but one of the main

2026
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,440
and I think cool things about the

2027
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,420
approach here which is different from

2028
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:40,800
those is that even if you have a graph

2029
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,659
based neural network and you have your

2030
01:26:42,659 --> 01:26:44,219
search base

2031
01:26:44,219 --> 01:26:45,960
um defined as some kind of Matrix where

2032
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,580
things are off and on depending on which

2033
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,080
nodes are connected to each other you

2034
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,600
have a fixed search space which may not

2035
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,520
be big enough or it might be not not be

2036
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,199
the correct search space for this neural

2037
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:57,179
architecture search problem where this

2038
01:26:57,179 --> 01:26:59,880
method here is all continuous right so

2039
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,440
um within this continuous search space

2040
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,300
you really have it gives the algorithm a

2041
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,860
lot of freedom maybe too much freedom

2042
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,620
but um a really open-ended way of

2043
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:10,199
generating a wide variety of neural

2044
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:12,900
architectures which if you pre-constrain

2045
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:16,199
your algorithm to work within a fixed

2046
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:18,120
discrete superstructure you may not even

2047
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,800
find them because they're not even in

2048
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,139
they're not even a possibility

2049
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:24,480
so that's one of the reasons we didn't

2050
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,760
we didn't go that route but there there

2051
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,159
are graph based neural artistic

2052
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:30,659
architecture search algorithms out there

2053
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:31,860
where basically you take the

2054
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:34,260
architecture as a graph you

2055
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:36,000
um train a neural network to spit out

2056
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,320
another graph that it might think is

2057
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,559
better

2058
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:42,960
and those use convolutions sometimes

2059
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,340
that helps

2060
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,199
that's awesome so convolution sounds

2061
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:49,139
like yes um and one thought on that is

2062
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:52,199
yes the ants solve all these incredible

2063
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:54,420
patterns and and

2064
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:56,820
kind of do amazing things amidst

2065
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,280
informational and physical limitations

2066
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,340
like like we all do

2067
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,400
um

2068
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:09,420
having the ants be able to

2069
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:11,159
um

2070
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:13,500
just

2071
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,239
make trade-offs

2072
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:18,300
within a task space

2073
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:22,199
and then have a dial as modelers to make

2074
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:24,840
that task space kind of like touching

2075
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,199
the pheromone distribution

2076
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:31,860
or metacognitive ants and all or

2077
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:34,500
something emulating essentially that

2078
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,080
um and for example the octave inference

2079
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,520
forward-looking and like thinking

2080
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,900
through other Minds

2081
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:42,239
that there could be a kind of cognitive

2082
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:43,440
colony

2083
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,100
so then that enables in silico

2084
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,560
total thought experiment colonies

2085
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:54,420
and through data driven processes also

2086
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:56,820
kind of keep continuity with that model

2087
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,739
perhaps literally continuity with the

2088
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:02,100
model and then connected to empirical

2089
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,679
which is something that that

2090
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:05,219
um

2091
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:08,580
is very hard for agent-based modeling

2092
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:11,580
which as you kind of Point into often

2093
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,699
sets certain fixed axes performs like a

2094
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:15,960
sweep

2095
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,179
looks at one mechanism doesn't look at

2096
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:20,699
all these possible mechanisms of like

2097
01:29:20,699 --> 01:29:24,120
learning and intra and intergenerational

2098
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,940
and all these time effects

2099
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:30,840
so how do you see this being used in

2100
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,460
different research or application

2101
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,460
domains

2102
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,719
wow

2103
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:44,880
well I mean we were the main use case

2104
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,739
that we're thinking of was new

2105
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:49,260
revolutionary architecture search uh

2106
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,380
it's for to apply it for other domains

2107
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:55,440
other than your Arctic search we didn't

2108
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,440
figure out that yeah uh I think Alex can

2109
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,719
explain on that

2110
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,179
I can hop in a little bit too I mean so

2111
01:30:03,179 --> 01:30:06,060
basically this this type of algorithm if

2112
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:08,219
you need to generate graphs

2113
01:30:08,219 --> 01:30:10,560
and you don't necessarily have a fixed

2114
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,960
structure for that graph and when I say

2115
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,219
graph I mean like a computer science

2116
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:16,860
graph where you have nodes images

2117
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:19,320
um so pretty much anything involving

2118
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,480
graph construction I think these types

2119
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,699
of methods no no that works kind of

2120
01:30:23,699 --> 01:30:25,560
under the hood are you know can be

2121
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,020
represented as graphs and usually are so

2122
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:30,000
I think we're using it for neural

2123
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,699
networks because it's really popular but

2124
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:34,620
um you know there's other other

2125
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,420
algorithms out there like you know the

2126
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:39,060
traditional uh traveling salesman

2127
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:40,560
um there's like routing problems all

2128
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,880
that any type of stuff where you might

2129
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,739
need to generate a graph

2130
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:47,040
in a smart way let's go do that yeah

2131
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,540
take another point though I think what's

2132
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,739
really cool here and I don't want to

2133
01:30:49,739 --> 01:30:51,420
steal up around those Thunder but you

2134
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,800
know his last point on future direction

2135
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,179
is

2136
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:56,760
um while the a particular version of

2137
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,440
this ant colony optimization search is

2138
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:59,880
running to find an optimal neural

2139
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,480
network a colony has fixed parameters

2140
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,659
that it operates Within but if you think

2141
01:31:06,659 --> 01:31:08,699
of the colony as an organism as opposed

2142
01:31:08,699 --> 01:31:10,739
to the ants being an organism you can

2143
01:31:10,739 --> 01:31:15,659
evolve colonies that optimize how it the

2144
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:17,880
the ants themselves act so you can have

2145
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:21,719
evolving colonies that in a smaller

2146
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:25,139
sense also evolve or optimize what

2147
01:31:25,139 --> 01:31:26,760
they're doing within their prescripted

2148
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,699
uh parameters for the agents they're

2149
01:31:29,699 --> 01:31:31,199
generating so you can have like a Meta

2150
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,860
Meta accuracy is really cool it's

2151
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:37,199
awesome I mean The evolutionary account

2152
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:40,320
of of a why question for amp Behavior

2153
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,900
today one part of that answer is like

2154
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,659
because colonies That Couldn't under

2155
01:31:45,659 --> 01:31:48,600
that regularity or constraints survive

2156
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,120
we've had a long long time to wipe those

2157
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,219
off the table and so every biological

2158
01:31:53,219 --> 01:31:54,540
system has to have that kind of

2159
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,639
multi-scale ordering

2160
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:00,840
um in 2021 we made the active infra ants

2161
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,120
paper which was modified from an

2162
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,139
epistemic foraging visual attention task

2163
01:32:07,139 --> 01:32:07,860
um

2164
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:11,580
about scanning around and then learning

2165
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,040
a cicade policy that had to do with

2166
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,080
epistemic foraging but not leaving the

2167
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,940
trace and then the main modification to

2168
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,040
bring that active inference epistemic

2169
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,860
visual foraging model into the active uh

2170
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,800
inference ant setting was to add a

2171
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,540
pheromone rule just like you described

2172
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,739
even though of course again that's not

2173
01:32:28,739 --> 01:32:30,540
the only pheromone rule but that's just

2174
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,100
the most simple pheromone rule that we

2175
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:34,080
can generalize from as you definitely

2176
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,800
have and there are just many emerging

2177
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,719
ways of of modeling those multi-scale

2178
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:41,940
active inference models so composing

2179
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:44,400
across layers which we might associate

2180
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,760
more with the kind of laterality

2181
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,900
of things that happen through

2182
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:52,199
interactions and then also as Mike Levin

2183
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:54,260
shows with kind of the time Diamond

2184
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:58,560
systems that have a memory retention

2185
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,239
components

2186
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:04,440
of some shape cognitive shape and then a

2187
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,420
pro tension

2188
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:10,139
um awareness or agency or other

2189
01:33:10,139 --> 01:33:11,880
attributes you can use to describe that

2190
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,699
and that that's a statistically amenable

2191
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:18,420
way to describe things

2192
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:20,100
and then there's a variety of

2193
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,920
implementations on a given statistical

2194
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,659
problem or like Federated compute

2195
01:33:24,659 --> 01:33:26,820
architecture it might be the case that

2196
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:29,300
you're not running like the pure Matrix

2197
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:32,460
multiplications that are shown in like

2198
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:34,560
the early Matlab code of active

2199
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,480
inference different components of

2200
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:37,920
machine Learning Systems might be kind

2201
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,580
of composed together also ways uh kind

2202
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:44,040
of abiding by those patterns of

2203
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,600
communication but then there's a level

2204
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,420
of abstraction that that um we can still

2205
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,920
describe but it doesn't mean active

2206
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,080
inference is going to be like kind of

2207
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,699
causing it

2208
01:33:53,699 --> 01:33:54,900
so that's what gives a lot of

2209
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:58,080
flexibility and it's really cool that

2210
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,600
through your backgrounds Alexander and

2211
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,020
work and and these kinds of

2212
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:05,639
collaborations that like the active

2213
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:07,320
inference perspective on multi-agent

2214
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:10,260
modeling with all these other views can

2215
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,820
at least come together

2216
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:12,679
um

2217
01:34:12,679 --> 01:34:14,580
comparatively

2218
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:17,400
and then that is gonna I think be quite

2219
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,639
an interesting Interchange to apply this

2220
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,800
entire

2221
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,760
tissue type or Colony type

2222
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,280
thinking up above and within the models

2223
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,380
just a lot of degrees of freedom like

2224
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:34,320
you said could be too much I mean and I

2225
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,300
think there's different ways to I think

2226
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,699
you depends on how you want to take the

2227
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:41,460
ant metaphor and you know again it's

2228
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:43,620
it's kind of interesting some of the

2229
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,239
questions or comments that you're making

2230
01:34:45,239 --> 01:34:47,400
Daniel and some from the audience about

2231
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,100
you know uh how does this you know think

2232
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,780
about it from a cognitive point of view

2233
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,460
I mean I do work in cognitive

2234
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:55,860
architectures of course again kind of

2235
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:58,679
from the whole single agent you know or

2236
01:34:58,679 --> 01:35:01,679
single entity and you know modeling a

2237
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,960
single brain in its different regions

2238
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,440
but I think if you take you know a

2239
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:11,040
nature inspired uh optimization approach

2240
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,739
like the ant metaphor that Abdel Ramen

2241
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:16,260
uh you know you know latched on to and

2242
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:17,960
that's sort of like the way in which he

2243
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,000
formalizes how or it takes a principle

2244
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,520
of how ants interact with their world

2245
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,460
interact with each other uh and then you

2246
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:28,920
know mathematically model those

2247
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:31,800
particular Concepts step by step

2248
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,500
I think if you bend the metaphor and say

2249
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,540
well okay could the ant colony metaphor

2250
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:39,900
apply to multi-human agent systems right

2251
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,480
or other entities does it does it does

2252
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,460
the ant necessarily can it be

2253
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:46,860
generalized Beyond you know the physical

2254
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:51,000
creature upon which uh abdulrahman based

2255
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,440
his initial metaphor and that's an

2256
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,300
interesting philosophical kind of take

2257
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:57,239
to it and then how do you apply that to

2258
01:35:57,239 --> 01:35:59,100
let's say building a multi-agent

2259
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:01,080
cognitive system and then of course says

2260
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,480
Travis was discussing with you and you

2261
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,820
were mentioning metacognition and you

2262
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:07,380
know you could think of ant colonies of

2263
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:09,000
ant colonies but you could even replace

2264
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,159
the word ant and just say well we have

2265
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:13,260
you know clusters of you know

2266
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:15,719
intelligent agents or however whatever

2267
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:17,760
degree of modeling we're doing because

2268
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,159
again I do want to emphasize that at

2269
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,440
least they can'ts and ants agents that I

2270
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,360
have worked with in the context of the

2271
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,280
ramen you know they are not in each and

2272
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,040
of themselves even I would argue if

2273
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,739
nothing else a very extremely simplified

2274
01:36:31,739 --> 01:36:34,920
generative model or a very very very

2275
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:38,100
simple control system there's no neural

2276
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:39,540
network under each one because then

2277
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,159
you'd have to simulate computationally

2278
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:43,139
each one of these ants within the

2279
01:36:43,139 --> 01:36:44,580
framework so I think there's always that

2280
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:47,280
good practical machine learning kind of

2281
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,780
viewpoint of well you know there's

2282
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:50,820
always a how do you simulate that in you

2283
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:53,040
know obvious working with CPUs it's not

2284
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,980
like he has an army of gpus to replace

2285
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:57,840
them with convolutional networks again

2286
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,699
if you have the resources this would be

2287
01:36:59,699 --> 01:37:02,159
awesome but uh you know expense and

2288
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:03,900
money is another constraint on this

2289
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,340
planet but

2290
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:07,260
um I think there's interesting views and

2291
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:10,260
interesting directions one could go by

2292
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:13,139
taking inspiration from the ant metaphor

2293
01:37:13,139 --> 01:37:15,420
and you know the concept of pheromones

2294
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:18,000
and translate them to other you know

2295
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,699
other real world signals and how for

2296
01:37:20,699 --> 01:37:23,100
example communication patterns among you

2297
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:25,020
know other animal entities or other

2298
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,940
human agents and I think that that opens

2299
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:28,920
up an interesting perspective and if

2300
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,840
you're constantly trying to connect it

2301
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,940
back to you know free energy

2302
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:35,340
minimization and trying to say well how

2303
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:38,159
are we balancing you know the terms that

2304
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:40,500
you can decompose it into an epistemic

2305
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,480
and an instrumental and how are these

2306
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,239
balancing out and how how are these

2307
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:48,540
physical processes that we specify uh

2308
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:50,280
you know balancing those terms that's

2309
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,139
just a very interesting place to be and

2310
01:37:52,139 --> 01:37:53,940
you mentioned you know active inference

2311
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,159
versions of ants and that's fascinating

2312
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:58,739
and of itself uh last comment I have is

2313
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:01,320
again the degree of modeling and what

2314
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,420
you are modeling like if you're modeling

2315
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:05,639
a society or organization you know

2316
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:07,500
that's one way you could use you know

2317
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,320
the ant colony framework if you will or

2318
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,199
optimization or meta heuristic

2319
01:38:12,199 --> 01:38:14,760
optimization Frameworks to you know then

2320
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,820
cast you know uh you know a system any

2321
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:20,940
type of complex multi-agent system as an

2322
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:22,920
active inference kind of uh you know

2323
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,620
engaging uh process or you could go

2324
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,719
really low level and think about you

2325
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:30,120
know cells in a body or you know or

2326
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,820
units that make up organs or organelles

2327
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,560
and trying to say well can we use this

2328
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,600
to model that level of granularity

2329
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,760
within like a human or an animal entity

2330
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:39,900
right and I think there's some

2331
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,880
fascinating questions about how does

2332
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,340
this metaphor manifest itself at

2333
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:45,960
different time scales and different

2334
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,719
degrees of you know perspective right

2335
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,520
about how you're modeling what are you

2336
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,320
looking at what's the picture that you

2337
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,940
want to emulate and of course there's

2338
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:55,560
always under the hood this practical

2339
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,780
consideration of well okay the

2340
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:00,420
computational expense they allocate and

2341
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:02,219
are you able to actually run that

2342
01:39:02,219 --> 01:39:04,020
simulation long enough because I think

2343
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:06,600
all the ramen incorrect me if by if I'm

2344
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,280
wrong you mentioned like one of the

2345
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,560
experiments I think was for the bigger

2346
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,480
systems took a month right of course

2347
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,300
this was on CPUs uh you know that that

2348
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:17,880
can get pretty uh prohibitive if you

2349
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,560
want to go even bigger than that but

2350
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,659
again I think it just depends on you

2351
01:39:21,659 --> 01:39:23,400
know what Hardware you have to simulate

2352
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:27,239
the Sun yeah yeah and also uh I mean

2353
01:39:27,239 --> 01:39:29,159
using high performance Computing is not

2354
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:31,739
always feasible for for smaller um so if

2355
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:34,320
we try to model the brain of ants like

2356
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,239
small neural network

2357
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:39,300
um you're using a GPU might not be like

2358
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,760
a feasible solution and Travis is the

2359
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,260
high performance Computing specialist

2360
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:46,639
here it's expert value but like sending

2361
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:49,920
data to the GPU and getting it back it's

2362
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,440
very time consuming and resources can

2363
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:55,500
continue so it will worsen the the the

2364
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,260
the the time consumption rather than

2365
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,960
solving it because communicating between

2366
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,440
the the main memory and the GPU would it

2367
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:08,880
had like a an overhead so it has to be a

2368
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,820
big enough problem to actually utilize

2369
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:17,780
this GPU in in such Solutions yeah so

2370
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,040
um when you have like you know the super

2371
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,980
large language models or large models

2372
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:28,639
for computer vision they do a lot of

2373
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:32,100
just massive operations on tensors which

2374
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,840
are basically multi-dimensional matrices

2375
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,780
right and when you have really big wide

2376
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:39,540
tensors they you can parallelize the

2377
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:42,139
operation really nicely across the GPU

2378
01:40:42,139 --> 01:40:45,659
a lot of this work is based on uh doing

2379
01:40:45,659 --> 01:40:47,699
like a Time series forecasting time

2380
01:40:47,699 --> 01:40:50,400
series specification on on sensor data I

2381
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,800
think stuff from like Power Systems so

2382
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,380
you know in the input to a large

2383
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:57,360
language model might be a thousand or

2384
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,320
more

2385
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,080
um you know word length of a word

2386
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,900
embedding which is actually not not huge

2387
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,880
but it only if you go up to computer

2388
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,520
vision model the input image may be a

2389
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,960
thousand five thousand pixels and that

2390
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,580
gives you like actually a million inputs

2391
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:12,420
right

2392
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:13,679
um when you're working with sensor

2393
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,900
Systems off of aircraft power plants

2394
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:17,159
that type of thing you may have 50 to

2395
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:19,320
100 inputs and when you're working with

2396
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,940
this type of Time series data you don't

2397
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:24,179
need a massive super wide neural network

2398
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:26,159
and then if you add in recurrency where

2399
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:27,540
you have to do back problem over time

2400
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:28,800
and over other things like this you

2401
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,239
actually can't really parallelize it

2402
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:32,880
nicely on a GPU so for us the CPU is

2403
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,440
actually more more efficient we tried

2404
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:36,179
Abdul Rahman wrote a bunch of code a

2405
01:41:36,179 --> 01:41:38,400
long time ago to put this stuff on gpus

2406
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,900
and we found it was quite a bit slower

2407
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:42,119
so depending on what you're doing with a

2408
01:41:42,119 --> 01:41:43,679
neural network a GPU actually isn't the

2409
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,060
right answer

2410
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,500
um and but the other cool thing about

2411
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,360
this which I think does have maybe even

2412
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:51,179
potential for there is that

2413
01:41:51,179 --> 01:41:54,179
um you know one of the big not talked

2414
01:41:54,179 --> 01:41:55,739
about problems in machine learning is

2415
01:41:55,739 --> 01:41:58,260
that back propagation is the fastest

2416
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:00,659
thing we know but it's inherently not

2417
01:42:00,659 --> 01:42:03,239
scalable like you can get a bigger

2418
01:42:03,239 --> 01:42:05,520
better GPU to do your bits of your

2419
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,260
network in parallel to speed things up

2420
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,179
but that only gets better if you have a

2421
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:11,040
bigger network if you want to speed up

2422
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,659
the training process you can't just add

2423
01:42:12,659 --> 01:42:16,440
another CPU or another GPU and make

2424
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,840
backdrop go faster you can make the

2425
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,219
forward and backward pass through your

2426
01:42:20,219 --> 01:42:22,260
neural network faster but you still have

2427
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:24,239
to do but every Epoch of back prop

2428
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:25,980
iteratively

2429
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:28,380
um a method like this where we're

2430
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:30,060
generate we're not we're not one it's

2431
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,800
back prop three so it's not using back

2432
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,440
prop we can use a nature Inspire or

2433
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,179
other method to use hundreds of

2434
01:42:36,179 --> 01:42:37,619
computers and you can throw twice as

2435
01:42:37,619 --> 01:42:39,119
many computers at it and get a result

2436
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,820
twice as that twice as fast whereas that

2437
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:43,679
problem you can't do that so if you

2438
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:45,480
think about actually being able to train

2439
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:47,820
a neural network faster

2440
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,920
um that crop actually you know it's got

2441
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,380
a pretty pretty low speed limit for for

2442
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:54,420
what we need to do and it's kind of a

2443
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:55,320
big problem with the machine learning

2444
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:56,400
community that people don't like to talk

2445
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,239
about because they're like oh I'll just

2446
01:42:57,239 --> 01:43:00,239
buy the next big Nvidia GPU and that'll

2447
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:01,320
do things faster

2448
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:02,580
so that

2449
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:05,159
that's super interesting does this maybe

2450
01:43:05,159 --> 01:43:08,100
even bring up a kind of relationship

2451
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,380
where things like a graphics

2452
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:13,260
visualization of course a GPU does well

2453
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:15,659
and that's like the screen changing

2454
01:43:15,659 --> 01:43:18,840
through time with the classical process

2455
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:22,860
that can be massively unfolded

2456
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:26,100
and then the cognitive models ultimately

2457
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,139
of the nest mates which which again can

2458
01:43:28,139 --> 01:43:29,880
be nested but the cognitive the thing

2459
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,920
that's more Quantum more cognitive model

2460
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,580
like you can do in parallel

2461
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:38,159
because the minds are not influencing

2462
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:40,679
each other except through stigmergy so

2463
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:43,080
then that is CPU bound the size The

2464
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,100
Colony

2465
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:46,440
but um and then you could use different

2466
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,600
like Graphics techniques like there are

2467
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:53,580
colonies organisms so one ants being

2468
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:55,560
or or it's a philosophical question what

2469
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:58,619
what is the scale at which uh a exists

2470
01:43:58,619 --> 01:44:01,619
but all throughout California with the

2471
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:04,080
Argentine Ant for example and so how do

2472
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,639
we deal with those kinds of like mesh

2473
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:08,639
work cognitive systems all the way on

2474
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,340
through 50 in an acorn

2475
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:12,960
there's just all these different

2476
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,900
trade-offs that are being made and like

2477
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:18,659
in the featureless deserts there's um

2478
01:44:18,659 --> 01:44:21,840
different wayfinding pathfinding

2479
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,060
um sensor integration polarization of

2480
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:25,380
light like different cognitive

2481
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:28,139
strategies because they might be going

2482
01:44:28,139 --> 01:44:31,020
out long distance and dragging something

2483
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,639
home not leaving any pheromone because

2484
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:34,739
it's not any more likely to have food

2485
01:44:34,739 --> 01:44:36,900
there so in that case the stigma G is

2486
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:40,199
basically minimal to essentially none

2487
01:44:40,199 --> 01:44:42,239
and then in other situations you could

2488
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:45,239
have something that's very adherent to

2489
01:44:45,239 --> 01:44:47,100
distributions to the point of being like

2490
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,560
fit to to very

2491
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:53,159
um like kind of a normative path

2492
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:55,280
but that's happening at a level that

2493
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,380
allows the um different compute

2494
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:00,179
architectures

2495
01:45:00,179 --> 01:45:03,360
different information architectures

2496
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:06,440
and ultimately different biological

2497
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:09,719
embodiments to to really engage

2498
01:45:09,719 --> 01:45:12,360
fruitfully again looking at the

2499
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,639
variability the diversity of biological

2500
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,159
algorithms for Collective Behavior

2501
01:45:17,159 --> 01:45:19,500
which have been studied by Professor

2502
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,880
Gordon and others in so many different

2503
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,980
angles yet sometimes it can feel like

2504
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:24,780
multi-agent models always start kind of

2505
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:27,179
like at Square One demonstrate some

2506
01:45:27,179 --> 01:45:29,100
proof of concept phenomena

2507
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:31,080
and then that is utilized as part of

2508
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,420
like a bigger perspective but it's not

2509
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:36,900
like that model was ever like claimed to

2510
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:39,719
have been tuned to maximum performance

2511
01:45:39,719 --> 01:45:41,219
it's like well we got decision making

2512
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:42,600
Behavior

2513
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:43,980
you could transfer this to group

2514
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:46,260
decision making with honeybee decision

2515
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,060
making or something like that

2516
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:49,260
but

2517
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,719
there's still a big gap there

2518
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:53,820
but I think what you're describing with

2519
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,619
the cans which is funny because it could

2520
01:45:55,619 --> 01:45:57,900
be cannot but also the cans is the

2521
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,460
dialect

2522
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,619
which is spoken yeah so it was very I

2523
01:46:01,619 --> 01:46:03,780
mean we came up with it

2524
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:06,300
great choice and it's just like yeah

2525
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,280
because there's multiple perspectives to

2526
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,980
swap from on

2527
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:13,139
the classical screen because the meaning

2528
01:46:13,139 --> 01:46:15,840
of the word is is something that's

2529
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,040
happening that fourth dimension

2530
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,320
cognitively

2531
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:21,659
the meaning of the word isn't to be

2532
01:46:21,659 --> 01:46:24,960
found just on the blanket just on the

2533
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,219
interface itself that's just the

2534
01:46:26,219 --> 01:46:28,380
communication

2535
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:30,179
um and that's like a bounded systems and

2536
01:46:30,179 --> 01:46:31,320
then if you model a cognitive system

2537
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,580
that doesn't have that kind of a

2538
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:33,780
constraint

2539
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:36,420
then so represented by a map that that

2540
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:39,600
has some kind of blanket uh index some

2541
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,699
kind of blanketing like if you don't

2542
01:46:41,699 --> 01:46:43,139
embody that constraint in the

2543
01:46:43,139 --> 01:46:45,420
statistical model the map you're

2544
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:46,880
ignoring one of the fundamental

2545
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:50,219
constraints of modeling

2546
01:46:50,219 --> 01:46:51,659
the way that things happen in an

2547
01:46:51,659 --> 01:46:53,639
embodied fashion maybe there's some

2548
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:55,260
abstract space for a certain problem

2549
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,020
that's just like a total slam dunk

2550
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:00,960
however for for full generality at least

2551
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,580
to the space that we know of of

2552
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,860
biological life forms and their

2553
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:07,679
engagements and like ecological

2554
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:08,540
um

2555
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:10,980
engagements not just like within one

2556
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:15,420
Behavior just that space is is so vast

2557
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:17,159
and there's so much to learn across

2558
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:19,560
different systems within two again to

2559
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,300
abduce away

2560
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:22,880
into different like information

2561
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,860
architectures and active inference being

2562
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:29,280
some subsetter type of those

2563
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,560
so it's awesome work do you have any

2564
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:34,760
last comments

2565
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,320
um I uh well being giving ability to for

2566
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,600
friends to be self-aware and well aware

2567
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,860
about this environment it's actually

2568
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:46,020
something that we implemented

2569
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:49,320
um in in our last work here with the BP

2570
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,760
free accounts

2571
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:53,520
um they are indirectly aware about their

2572
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,619
environment and Theory

2573
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:58,199
um adapt adapting to the changes in

2574
01:47:58,199 --> 01:48:00,659
their clinical environment by indicted

2575
01:48:00,659 --> 01:48:03,900
meaning that they are evolving using a

2576
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:07,080
genetic based algorithm

2577
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,540
um to just change their behavior like

2578
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:12,540
how these things the the the word the

2579
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:14,760
word the pheromones when they take the

2580
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,920
steps and some other times or some other

2581
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,960
characters that they have so they are

2582
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,440
adapting but kind of like nuts in

2583
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:26,699
um an intelligent uh uh way but through

2584
01:48:26,699 --> 01:48:28,560
it through through Evolution if you want

2585
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:32,580
to say actually we we consider putting a

2586
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:34,440
putting a brain in each one of these

2587
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,879
agents but then again as

2588
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:49,860
design because we couldn't like paralyze

2589
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:52,080
that it will take time to train each one

2590
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,119
of these brains as we evolve the neural

2591
01:48:54,119 --> 01:48:56,480
networks

2592
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:01,139
awesome

2593
01:49:01,139 --> 01:49:05,540
Alexander or Travis any last thoughts

2594
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:14,219
oh okay

2595
01:49:14,219 --> 01:49:15,179
um

2596
01:49:15,179 --> 01:49:18,179
jeez I I I'm just really really happy I

2597
01:49:18,179 --> 01:49:19,500
mean I think this this work is really

2598
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:22,080
interesting and it opens up a lot of

2599
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,719
um pretty cool Avenues again

2600
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,420
if we can get to the point where we're

2601
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:29,400
evolving colonies that are producing

2602
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,960
ants

2603
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,840
um and can see where that can go so one

2604
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,219
of the big issues in neural architecture

2605
01:49:35,219 --> 01:49:37,320
search is the whole question of what is

2606
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,940
an optimal neural network and what an

2607
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:40,980
optimal neural network is

2608
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:43,440
um could be different for well will be

2609
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,940
different for different tasks but not

2610
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:47,520
only that even if it's the same data set

2611
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,380
how you're using that neural network

2612
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:51,719
could lead to less optimal lesser more

2613
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:53,520
optimal neural network right depending

2614
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,199
on doing with it maybe you need one

2615
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,540
that's more energy efficient maybe you

2616
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:59,159
don't care about energy efficient

2617
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:00,900
efficiency or performance and you'll

2618
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:02,219
take a slower neural network but you

2619
01:50:02,219 --> 01:50:05,159
need more accuracy so being able to have

2620
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:07,860
algorithms which can automate this whole

2621
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:10,260
process for us and tune them to what we

2622
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:11,340
actually want to use the neural network

2623
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:14,219
for is really important and I think one

2624
01:50:14,219 --> 01:50:16,080
just having ant colony optimization be

2625
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,580
able to optimize the network for a

2626
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:19,080
problem was great but two if we can make

2627
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,179
it such that the algorithm itself is

2628
01:50:21,179 --> 01:50:24,239
self-optimizing it really can streamline

2629
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:27,600
this whole process where right now if

2630
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:28,980
you're doing machine learning it can be

2631
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:31,020
kind of miserable you like make a neural

2632
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:32,639
network architecture you try it out see

2633
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:34,500
how well it does oh nope that didn't do

2634
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,199
do so well let me tweak a couple knobs

2635
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:40,320
um automating that process my whole life

2636
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,540
as a computer scientist is about being

2637
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,719
lazy about being smart about it so

2638
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:47,760
whatever I can optimize so that I don't

2639
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,619
have to do it over and over again seems

2640
01:50:49,619 --> 01:50:52,020
like a good good use of my time so I'll

2641
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:54,000
be smart about having to do as little as

2642
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,840
possible in the future

2643
01:50:57,719 --> 01:51:00,540
then I guess uh my I don't have too much

2644
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:02,880
to add to that I think uh a lot of the

2645
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,760
good discussion has happened already and

2646
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:08,719
we talked about various implications and

2647
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,400
ways of viewing you know and Colony

2648
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,260
optimization from you know other

2649
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:15,000
perspectives including an active

2650
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,340
inference point of view so I guess

2651
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,980
really more from a closing thought on my

2652
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:23,159
end is that uh it will be interesting or

2653
01:51:23,159 --> 01:51:25,800
it is an interesting direction to think

2654
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:28,260
about like I said earlier or suggested

2655
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:30,719
about the adaptation of the metaphor

2656
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:34,020
right to other systems and what are you

2657
01:51:34,020 --> 01:51:36,300
trying to model and you know what's your

2658
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,580
goals from a scientific and

2659
01:51:38,580 --> 01:51:40,619
philosophical point of view what are

2660
01:51:40,619 --> 01:51:41,820
what are the questions you seek to

2661
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,739
answer and I think it might be very

2662
01:51:43,739 --> 01:51:46,260
interesting again given other

2663
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:48,119
developments and you know Computing

2664
01:51:48,119 --> 01:51:50,760
technology uh in ways in which you

2665
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,880
implement the parallelization that I

2666
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:56,280
think is That's What attracted me the

2667
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,380
most to a lot of these meta heuristic

2668
01:51:58,380 --> 01:52:00,780
algorithms even things like particle

2669
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:03,060
swarm and you know when I worked with

2670
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:05,400
Travis many years ago on the exam

2671
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,739
algorithms you saw our names on that and

2672
01:52:07,739 --> 01:52:10,440
uh working on that type of stuff the

2673
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,060
part that always caught my attention is

2674
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:13,739
again that ability to say I can put

2675
01:52:13,739 --> 01:52:16,139
these entities on different you know

2676
01:52:16,139 --> 01:52:18,600
processing Computing processing you know

2677
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:21,420
resources or devices and then they will

2678
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:23,880
interact or interact and exchange their

2679
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,340
results in some way to try to optimize

2680
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:29,900
uh some you know often complex

2681
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:32,820
multi-objective cost function and so I

2682
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:35,040
think the part that we'll see or that

2683
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,860
would encourage the wider spread

2684
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:40,500
adoption of even like meta-heuristic

2685
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,119
algorithms in general not to say that

2686
01:52:42,119 --> 01:52:43,800
they aren't used a lot in for example

2687
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:46,440
the engineering domains is again the

2688
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:48,300
development of you know parallel

2689
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:50,100
Computing processing systems and I think

2690
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:52,139
exploiting things like asynchronous

2691
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:53,760
Computing that was again another angle

2692
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,860
that caught my attention from Travis you

2693
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:57,780
know he's done a lot of work on you know

2694
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:59,940
genetic optimization in their evolution

2695
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:01,980
from an asynchronous point of view and

2696
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:04,440
how can we allocate whatever resources

2697
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,540
are available you know and you know

2698
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:09,179
Distributing them across Global networks

2699
01:53:09,179 --> 01:53:11,940
I think that might be the best shot to

2700
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:14,340
scaling up let's see with what we got

2701
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:16,440
right now there might be again you've

2702
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:18,679
mentioned annual Quantum technology

2703
01:53:18,679 --> 01:53:20,940
Quantum Computing is another interesting

2704
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:23,699
place that sort of like changes the game

2705
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:25,800
um uh but you know barring you know

2706
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,320
technologies that we don't necessarily

2707
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,540
have exactly at their best at this

2708
01:53:30,540 --> 01:53:32,040
moment you know how can we take

2709
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,880
advantage of Citizen citizen science or

2710
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,100
distributed computing or peer-to-peer

2711
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:40,159
type of communication and building

2712
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:42,960
massive active inference systems that

2713
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,380
you know embody like the multi-agent

2714
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:48,540
metaphor of and Colony optimization or

2715
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:51,239
other nature inspired Frameworks and

2716
01:53:51,239 --> 01:53:54,659
um Can this system you know evolve over

2717
01:53:54,659 --> 01:53:57,119
very long spans of time just like

2718
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:59,760
Evolution really worked another piece my

2719
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,580
final count and uh is that uh why I'm

2720
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:05,639
interested sometimes in evolution is

2721
01:54:05,639 --> 01:54:09,179
that to me it is the inductive bias that

2722
01:54:09,179 --> 01:54:11,460
provided us with structures that allow

2723
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:13,920
for example a human agent babies can you

2724
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,540
know to operate already babies can

2725
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:18,000
already recognize faces right and uh we

2726
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,400
we have certain instinctual reactions

2727
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,139
and certain mechanisms that

2728
01:54:22,139 --> 01:54:24,600
evolutionists endowed us with and so a

2729
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,699
fascinating question is what is the

2730
01:54:26,699 --> 01:54:29,159
interplay of this you know the idea of

2731
01:54:29,159 --> 01:54:31,619
simulating an artificial form of

2732
01:54:31,619 --> 01:54:33,900
evolution maybe building you know DNA

2733
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:35,780
structures are very very simplified

2734
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:37,679
computational structures which would

2735
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,139
answer Abdel rahman's concern about well

2736
01:54:40,139 --> 01:54:41,940
maybe we don't want the agents to be too

2737
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:43,739
smart and of themselves because I can't

2738
01:54:43,739 --> 01:54:45,960
really simulate that unless you give me

2739
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:48,600
like a decade to run the simulator

2740
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:50,219
um but you could maybe come up with a

2741
01:54:50,219 --> 01:54:51,960
more fundamental primitive and then use

2742
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:54,239
that as a starting point for your neural

2743
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:56,219
network let's say Daniel you're you want

2744
01:54:56,219 --> 01:54:58,380
to do some task in image segmentation

2745
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:00,960
and and you know like okay but what can

2746
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,000
uh your evolutionary framework give me

2747
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,980
well I'll say here here's a template to

2748
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:07,380
start from this is this is a kernel on

2749
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:09,239
which you build your framework and you

2750
01:55:09,239 --> 01:55:11,940
know it's like a DNA structure and this

2751
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:13,980
has evolved across you know many many

2752
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:16,380
years of distributed peer-to-peer

2753
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:18,360
Computing and you can imagine building

2754
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:22,020
this Mammoth evolving continual learning

2755
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:25,320
style you know evolutionary algorithm

2756
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:27,719
whether it is based on uh genetic

2757
01:55:27,719 --> 01:55:29,940
algorithms brand colony and you could

2758
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:31,619
imagine that might be an interesting way

2759
01:55:31,619 --> 01:55:33,420
to think about it and by the way I am

2760
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:36,060
spitballing and generating an idea of

2761
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:38,639
like how I could Envision a scalable

2762
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:41,280
form without inventing a new Computing

2763
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,500
system that I don't know will or will

2764
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:46,739
not exist uh because Quantum has a lot

2765
01:55:46,739 --> 01:55:48,480
of problems still to solve too like

2766
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,580
super conducting there's super

2767
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:54,719
temperatures or trapping photons as I

2768
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:55,860
have learned

2769
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:57,300
um so that might be an interesting

2770
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:59,100
Direction and I think the scaling of

2771
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:01,679
this especially from the Practical end

2772
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:03,600
is going to be the most important we're

2773
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,219
going to need to pull together all the

2774
01:56:05,219 --> 01:56:08,100
tools that we have as I mentioned before

2775
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,380
so I'll stop there too because I'll end

2776
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:12,239
up rambling more so hopefully that made

2777
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:13,980
sense

2778
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:17,820
well this was very epic and inspiring so

2779
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:20,460
good luck with the work you're all

2780
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:23,820
welcome to suggest uh another

2781
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:25,800
piece that we might focus on or or

2782
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:27,840
continue the discussion however you see

2783
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,659
fit because it's super interesting

2784
01:56:30,659 --> 01:56:33,659
Direction so thank you until next time

2785
01:56:33,659 --> 01:56:38,820
thank you so much bye
