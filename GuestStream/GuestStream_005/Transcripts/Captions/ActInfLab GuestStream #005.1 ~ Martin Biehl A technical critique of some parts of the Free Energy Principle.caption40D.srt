1
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,438
Great.

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:08,641
Hello and welcome everyone to Active Lab.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,212
Today is April 28th, 2021.

4
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:13,880
It's ActInf Lab

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,416
Guesttream number 5.1 with Martin

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:17,751
Biehl.

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,920
Martin, thanks so much for joining us
on today's stream.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,322
And we're really looking forward

9
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,525
to hearing about your perspective
and what you have to share here.

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,362
So if anyone in the live
chat would like to ask

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,533
questions, we'll be relaying those to you
during and at the end of the stream.

12
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,702
Other than that, please take it away.

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,139
And thanks again for coming on.

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,675
Thank you.

15
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,377
Oh, Daniel.

16
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,746
Welcome to my talk, everybody.

17
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,749
I would talk about

18
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,520
I will talk about,

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,722
at least in the background
about the paper.

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,925
I wrote it all up and real text night,

21
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,829
which is called Technical Critique
of some part of the free

22
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,466
energy principle. But

23
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,236
I will
not go directly through this paper.

24
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:15,075
I will kind of try to give a more updated
perspective.

25
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,679
Yeah, what I have to say, I work at Araya

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,748
in Tokyo

27
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,386
and this work is also funded
by a charity foundation

28
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,823
and Felix was supported
by the Monash University.

29
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,992
Okay, so

30
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,495
he is the

31
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,231
content of this talk.

32
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,134
Let's make some preliminary remarks
and then

33
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,605
talk about my perspective
basically on the free energy principle

34
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,910
and how it can
maybe maybe split into two parts,

35
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,580
the construction of agents
and the identification of agents.

36
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,282
And then

37
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,218
I'll talk about what

38
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,187
the FP agent constructs is

39
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,590
and what the FP agent ID

40
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,760
method kind of is.

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,163
And then I'll talk about the relation
between those

42
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,599
or at least a claims relation
between those.

43
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,135
And then I'll go through some issues

44
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,504
with this agent

45
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:22,041
ID method and also with this relation.

46
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:23,610
Okay.

47
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,882
So yeah, like I said,
the main publication

48
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,217
is the same name

49
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,453
as the has
the same title as it's talk and

50
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,490
email this year.

51
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,461
And it resulted from an effort
with Phenix

52
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,431
where we, we actually set out to do

53
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:49,135
a, like a descriptive version of the life
as we know it.

54
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,205
People.

55
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,039
But we failed.

56
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,945
And then in the end
we wrote this critique.

57
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,150
So yeah, I will,
I will give this a in this talk.

58
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,853
I will give

59
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,256
my personal view
a little bit of the free energy principle

60
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,692
and why I find it interesting.

61
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,094
And like I said,
I want to go through the paper in detail

62
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,567
and instead summarize

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,537
how I currently see the issues.

64
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,241
Also, the issues that we mentioned
in the paper, but the FFP,

65
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,579
FFP meets the energy principles.

66
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,747
That's why we were writing this paper.

67
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,817
It has changed and so

68
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:45,491
my perspective has also changed.

69
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:49,262
And but if you have questions,
particular questions

70
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,565
about the paper, then you can of course

71
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,102
ask me afterwards.

72
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,438
Okay, so here's the

73
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,574
maybe

74
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,711
a little bit more detailed overview.

75
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:09,349
So in my opinion,
the free energy principle can be viewed

76
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,953
as two parts of.

77
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:17,223
And the first part is basically what

78
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,593
maybe you've heard in this statement

79
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,963
that Markus Blanket implies

80
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:30,003
Markov is imply based on inference.

81
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:35,875
And I so from my perspective,
this is kind of a way to identify agents

82
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,076
in stochastic processes.

83
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:41,114
So this is one part
that is contained in the FP literature

84
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,183
and another part
is about how to construct

85
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,587
artificial agents for

86
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,790
example, for reinforcement
learning or partially observable

87
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,160
Markov decision problems.

88
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,995
And I call this to construct

89
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,097
different agents, but

90
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,968
and the claim

91
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,638
the claim is that

92
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,775
like if you read papers about this
constructing agent part,

93
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,978
the claim is that they
that this construction

94
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,348
is based on this identifying agents part.

95
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,450
So the construction is based on this

96
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,220
model and gets implication inference

97
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,591
part of the literature.

98
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,495
And I would kind of argue that this is
has not been established.

99
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,831
And I also kind of think it's

100
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,103
questionable a

101
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:42,508
at least in the current state.

102
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,279
Then I also present
some other issues for the FP among those

103
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,016
those that I mentioned in the paper

104
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,352
and these issues.

105
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,954
So yeah, one thing I want
to say is that these issues,

106
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,523
they kind of effect.

107
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,358
What effect?

108
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,761
I mean, if they if I'm
if I'm correct about those issues

109
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:05,198
and they affect the usefulness

110
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,034
of the free energy principle

111
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,772
for agent ID so so then we couldn't

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,378
identify agency for you and this also

113
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,883
as a theory of life is sort of like
general or life as we know it.

114
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,552
If you want.

115
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,954
And then

116
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,860
it would also affect this claim that

117
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,063
these create these construct
it's the energy

118
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:42,468
it's the agents are somehow
based on trust principles

119
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,838
more than, let's say,
some other enforcement

120
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,975
learning. It.

121
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:53,346
What what all of this
what all of these points, in my opinion,

122
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,815
what effect is

123
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,886
that free that these free energy

124
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,389
that's for agents,
free energy minimizing agents

125
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:08,094
that are constructed
in the literature that they work or

126
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:10,530
that they work at

127
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,599
or basically or that they can be useful
for some research.

128
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,438
I mean, I think I think those
I think that these agents work

129
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,374
is kind of independent of this whole

130
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:26,846
Markov blanket implementation in.

131
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:27,847
But maybe I'm wrong.

132
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:31,651
That's okay.

133
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,153
So what's this what are these two things?

134
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,557
Well, in the construction of agents

135
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,893
and the identification of agents.

136
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,130
So like I said, I think the literature
can be split into these two parts

137
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,567
and it's hard to construct

138
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,104
an agent or a controller

139
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,076
on. And the other one is how to identify

140
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:02,949
an agent
in a stochastic and American system.

141
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,486
And yeah, so

142
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,856
and like I said also before, the, the

143
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,861
is first method
how to construct an agents

144
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,197
or controller
is to inherit from second message.

145
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,501
And these are the claims that are

146
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:22,869
current.

147
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:27,440
So it's a paper that came out
just actually a week ago.

148
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,510
So I think it's called sophisticated

149
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,146
inference.

150
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:34,680
Okay.

151
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,018
So what do I mean by
construction of agents or what is this?

152
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,055
What is the problem
of construction of agents?

153
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,492
Because that's a yeah.

154
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,628
A different problem than the ID. Okay.

155
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,431
That's kind of the first point
I want to make that these two

156
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,302
problems are different

157
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,773
in general.

158
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:04,544
So yeah, in, in, in artificial
intelligence research, what,

159
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,747
what people are occupied with

160
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,751
is the construction
of intelligence agents

161
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,021
for some given environment or test

162
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,223
or like you

163
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,726
and yeah.

164
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,696
So basically what what these people do
in artificial intelligence

165
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:28,334
research or engineering
is programing robots of actual agents.

166
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,803
And of course, the robot

167
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,939
is then kind of it's

168
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,575
a fixed environment.

169
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,779
Or if you have a virtual world
and this is also fixed environment

170
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,049
and then if you have some reinforcement

171
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,419
learning problem,
then you have kind of a test.

172
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,820
Okay, so

173
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,523
like I said,

174
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,626
we in these cases, what we have is

175
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,361
some environment

176
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,864
that is given and I,

177
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,734
I write this here
is that there's a network

178
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,071
and then we construct a controller.

179
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,274
And then what it does is
we have some environment states

180
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,043
that call each other

181
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,579
and sets of values
that depend on each other.

182
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,084
And we have dynamics of each other.

183
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,120
So, so basically towards the right time
increases.

184
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,623
And so this is

185
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,657
so we have

186
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,393
we have some dynamics

187
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:31,631
of this environment
which tells us how ether changes

188
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,134
under the influence of actions
and depending on the state

189
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,305
and the
environment of your sense of values.

190
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,141
And what an agent does
is actually centenarians

191
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,781
and updates its internal state,

192
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,183
which is called new

193
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,453
and produces actions accordingly.

194
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,822
So as you see here, mute

195
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,392
depends on both the sentences
and the actions,

196
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,033
how exactly these features are.

197
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,870
Look, there's some variability in it,
but is roughly one one idea

198
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,373
like now, most of them are rough.

199
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,741
It's much

200
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,312
so, like I said,

201
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,448
a little bit more formally, maybe

202
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,686
each of t is an environment state
or an environment

203
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,555
or a task is defined as by

204
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,526
an environment state, sense of values,

205
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,996
some kind of action interface.

206
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,432
So some dependency
on the external variable.

207
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,703
So this dependance
the update of each on the action

208
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,241
and the dynamics, which means

209
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,612
if we have a

210
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,116
if we are in discrete time,
then the dynamics can be specified as

211
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,653
Markov kernel or conditional probability

212
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,356
of the next or the next

213
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,761
internal state and extends
the sense of are value

214
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,797
conditioned on the process in terms

215
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,101
that sense, the value and the action,

216
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,536
which is the inference from.

217
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,372
So it's

218
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:24,009
and in continuous time
we could also formulate this.

219
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,513
And one way to formulate
this looks like this week is the

220
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,317
time derivative of the part

221
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,855
that has some function in its own state

222
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,924
and the action plus some noise.

223
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,694
And similarly for the

224
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,463
sense of dynamics

225
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,136
and maybe

226
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,973
it's not so important,
but in general you can have

227
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,243
and an environment
can have some kind of reward

228
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,247
that it gives to the agent
as part of the sense of value or

229
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,185
it may not.

230
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,287
Okay. And then what's an agent?

231
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,590
So an agent
has this internal memory state.

232
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,795
And if these actions

233
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,931
and it also has an interface

234
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:23,068
for accepting or senses
and I produce that environment

235
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,372
and it's an image
this can also be written

236
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:30,142
as instead of conditional probability
or similarly

237
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,779
this time the written

238
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,382
in the time continuous state

239
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,251
and maybe the the main part

240
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:45,090
that's going to be relevant
or some something later in this talk

241
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,361
is that we can combine and we can combine

242
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,531
such environments and agents

243
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,569
and then they form a markov process.

244
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,139
So then we have some joint variable X

245
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,544
and the product of these two

246
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,480
conditional probabilities
for one for the environment

247
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,652
and the one for
the agent, they induce this

248
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,691
Markov kernel of the joint process.

249
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:24,396
And similarly, in the continuous case
we can see the whole thing

250
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:27,700
as one, the combination
of the environment and the agent

251
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,105
as a whole, as a single, very,

252
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,041
as a single Markov process with

253
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,382
State X.

254
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,216
Okay.

255
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,620
So that's kind of what
we should keep in mind

256
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,661
some remarks on this.

257
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,697
Usually we have we construct these agents

258
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,933
to solve some problems
so we have some kind of the what.

259
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,637
So this is the case in reinforcement

260
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,773
learning for a few entities,

261
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,743
but we can also have agents
that have just intrinsic goals

262
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,679
and they don't need any reward
from the environment.

263
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,916
These things are usually called
intrinsic motivations

264
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,988
and the these

265
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:30,029
the FP agents from the literature,
they actually kind of have both

266
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,634
in within them.

267
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,136
So they have a

268
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,738
they contain some part that's like

269
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,541
an intrinsic motivation and they also can

270
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,514
they have some part
that is similar to a reward.

271
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,651
And so basically the intrinsic motivation
for is

272
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,121
it's like a maximization
of information gain and the

273
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,992
instead of reward

274
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,062
maximization,
we minimize some divergence from

275
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,133
a desired distribution interest.

276
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,103
But at least on a high level,

277
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:16,141
this is seen as of

278
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,012
so these two things are kind of combined
in the B

279
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:25,651
and in the expected the energy.

280
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,251
Yeah,

281
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,122
I mean there are some tricks to this,
but roughly this.

282
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,491
Oh, sure.

283
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,126
Okay.

284
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:39,999
So, so that that's that's what

285
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,002
I hope it came across.

286
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,605
What I mean by construction of agents

287
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,440
and don't know
if there were any questions

288
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,211
already and it's.

289
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,413
Not yet continue.
Thank you. And yet. Okay.

290
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,814
And so then

291
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,751
what do
I mean by identification of agents,

292
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,553
which is maybe a bit less

293
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,094
common practice?

294
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,464
So first, maybe let's ask the question
what what is an agent

295
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,800
in general

296
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,305
and so very roughly,

297
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,143
there's a definition by

298
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,046
the end of an era,

299
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,781
and they say

300
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,917
to be an agent, you have to be something

301
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:36,655
that's individuated, that can act,

302
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,925
that makes things happen, and

303
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,694
an act which just means
to make things happen basically.

304
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:48,133
And it can act to achieve

305
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,571
these actions are performed
in order to achieve some goal.

306
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,240
So an agent does go

307
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,078
maybe something that has a goal, an X
to achieve,

308
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:03,816
actively pursue some school.

309
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,883
And these

310
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,654
these agents that I just talked
about these construct the agents that we

311
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,990
construct in artificial intelligence

312
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,028
but also in the literature.

313
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,531
They are agents because they are.

314
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,569
And if by construction
they are individuated

315
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,071
because we kind of know
where their boundary is.

316
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,341
Like if you ask some engineer

317
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,311
what they have to do to construct
the agent, they know exactly what to do.

318
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,315
So they they seem to know

319
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,651
where the agent's is or what
the agent is.

320
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,688
And of course,
since we programed into them

321
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,825
the intrinsic motivation
or some kind of reward

322
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,496
maximization mechanism,
they are also directed

323
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:57,569
by construction.

324
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:02,107
Okay, so but then this is not
just for what agents are.

325
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,443
So what's what's what about?

326
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,013
I don't dislocation of agents

327
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,550
so the the and this for me

328
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,355
the origin of this question
is the kind of

329
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,592
the problem of agents in physics.

330
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,630
So the physicists they tell us
that everything is determined

331
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,999
by the laws of physics.

332
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,402
So that means everything that happens
is made happen by the laws of physics

333
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,906
and not by any thing within this

334
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,212
within the universe.

335
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,549
So in this,
if they are correct, then nothing within

336
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,719
the universe can make anything. It.

337
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,520
But that also means

338
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,857
that nothing can act to achieve a goal
because nothing can make anything happen.

339
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,661
So you can't act to achieve some goal
because you can't act in the substance.

340
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:00,532
So this seems to suggest
that basically there are no agents

341
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:05,904
and they don't think that
it must be some kind of illusion.

342
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,942
But at the same time,
I mean, we are here,

343
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,812
we are agents and we kind of want to

344
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,250
we kind of have goals,
or at least it seems extremely likely.

345
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,419
And it also seems like
there are things that don't.

346
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,154
And we

347
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:26,158
built these robots
and they seem to be quite real things.

348
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,827
And I'm of course also

349
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,798
so it's kind of
so maybe there is some way

350
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,000
there should be some way
to make these things

351
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:43,442
compatible with.

352
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,346
So what we want is that if you are,
if you like the

353
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,682
physicist perspective

354
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,385
and also you like

355
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:57,489
you like to think about agents, then
you maybe you want what you want to form

356
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,425
a theory of agents that is compatible

357
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:04,796
physics.

358
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,098
And then

359
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,934
so one one problem

360
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,105
that such any such theory
should be able to solve is that if

361
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,042
you have some kind of universe
and in physics

362
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:25,751
that's basically just done in a system,
then what and where are the agents?

363
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,753
So if you have that, if you have a formal

364
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,088
definition of agents

365
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,191
or formal theory of agents, then

366
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:38,230
this is a question that it should
probably be able to answer.

367
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,036
So here's the universe.

368
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:48,740
And what we want to do
is we want to check where inside this

369
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:54,279
long history of the universe,

370
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,083
there are these things
that are maybe chemical agents like this.

371
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,751
Anybody

372
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,755
a bit more formally.

373
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,058
So we have some kind of

374
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,193
in physics,
we have some kind of dynamical system.

375
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,095
We have a state space

376
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,131
and states

377
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:17,336
and we have a dynamical law that is
look maybe looks like this.

378
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,672
The time derivative of y
is some function of the.

379
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,742
So the time derivative
of the state of the universe

380
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:28,580
is a function
of the current state of the universe.

381
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,514
And then we have

382
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:37,222
so these things have trajectories.

383
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,859
And if we select
one of those trajectories

384
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,764
by some initial condition, y zero,

385
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,634
then what we would expect from

386
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,002
a theory about

387
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,072
a theory of agents

388
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:58,710
and one that can also identify agents,
then what we would want

389
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,249
is that this theory gives us,
like once we give it such a trajectory

390
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:08,987
of the dynamical system, or
maybe the trajectory and the dynamics of

391
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,724
that, this theory tells us
what is the set of agents

392
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,794
contained in this trajectory.

393
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:20,031
And it should tell us this, including
what is basically its body

394
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,168
or its individual, what is the individual

395
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,372
to the actions and all the other goals?

396
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,508
Okay.

397
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,412
So this is what I think is kind of the

398
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:38,483
agent identification problem

399
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,087
and the FP

400
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,458
does something like this.

401
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,728
They start not directly, maybe

402
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:53,832
with a deterministic dynamical system
and stuff is maybe

403
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,334
like,

404
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:01,273
but they instead start with something
that's usually considered

405
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:06,244
a subsystem
of such a deterministic universe.

406
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,281
And this subsystem should obey
this kind of large

407
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:14,619
of an equation.

408
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,689
And then the FP kind of tells us what

409
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,027
how to like conditions under

410
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:27,966
which there's an agent inside
such a thing.

411
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:34,039
So I'm not sure how this relates to this,
the exact formulation I gave here where

412
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:38,043
you just get a trajectory and the system
and it tells you where the agents are

413
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,846
and some subtleties to this.

414
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:45,016
But but roughly
I think the energy principle

415
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:50,155
is definitely a step towards
such a theory.

416
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,558
And this part
of the free energy principle

417
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,394
is what I call the free energy principle

418
00:24:56,394 --> 00:25:02,100
ID, the FP agent ID method.

419
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,371
And it is
if you are familiar with the literature,

420
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,841
this is where

421
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,978
the Markov blanket plays
a fundamental role.

422
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:18,283
The so-called mark of speculations.

423
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,251
Okay.

424
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:25,423
Barton, they ask, What do we gain or lose
by by going to the lines

425
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:30,662
of an equation, what is what is gained
or lost in that maneuver

426
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:37,502
relative to the more general phrasing
you had on the previous slide?

427
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:42,140
Yeah, good question.

428
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,877
So I well, I don't really know.

429
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,914
I all I can say is that

430
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,320
yeah,

431
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,356
I mean, one thing you definitely gain

432
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,626
is that if you I mean, this thing,
it's kind of hopeless.

433
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,262
Like if you would really

434
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,968
if you
if we would need the particle physics

435
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:16,741
equation, then

436
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:21,513
we would probably never be able
to identify it.

437
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,583
Agents Because the particle, I mean, it's

438
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,953
just too complicated and complex

439
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,721
to say much about it.

440
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,858
But so here this gives us kind of
we can kind of say, okay,

441
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,262
I can ignore a lot of stuff
and all I have to find

442
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,098
is some kind of part of the system that

443
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,735
obeys

444
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,038
some kind of approximate equation,
basically.

445
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,642
And this can be enough.

446
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,845
So this is, I guess, this one

447
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,719
one advantage.

448
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:01,052
Yeah.

449
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,788
I mean, like, there's one other thing
I'm not sure.

450
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,691
I mean, there's one other thing
I sometimes think

451
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,929
where this might be useful for and that's

452
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,533
so what we what we kind of want

453
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,604
is that

454
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:23,208
this agent theory,
I mean, if you think about it, basically

455
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,777
a billion

456
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,413
yet like a few at some point,

457
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,484
there probably weren't
any agents inside the universe.

458
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,155
So, so at that point.

459
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,725
So so agents kind of

460
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,228
like a full blown theory of agents.

461
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,129
They should

462
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,799
it should allow trajectories

463
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:52,270
with within which agents appear
and basically disappear,

464
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,939
or at least
they have to be able to appear,

465
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,243
because that's kind of what we think

466
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:02,213
the universe happened in the universe.

467
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,683
And but this is not

468
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,153
this kind of appearance and disappearance

469
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:11,189
is actually not so easy to to do,

470
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,226
especially if you would just kind of

471
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,662
naively split up this system,

472
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,298
the whole system into two parts

473
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,302
and say it is one part the agent and one

474
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,872
the environment, because then you split
it basically all the time

475
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,209
and this kind of weird

476
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:35,013
because how because you
you would want that

477
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:39,651
the split only works for a short time
or once they actually

478
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,620
is an agent.

479
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:47,492
So sometimes I think okay maybe
maybe this is the approximate equation

480
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:52,230
only works for a short time
and that's an advantage of this also that

481
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:57,535
there might be short time frames
where this equation works and with it

482
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,071
and others where it doesn't work
and then we could get

483
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,975
we could think about whether this means

484
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,213
the agent appears or not.

485
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,949
But actually, I'm not so sure
what you see and what the details.

486
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,352
So yeah,
that's all I can really say it is.

487
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,555
I mean, I think yeah, it's,

488
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,591
but it's a very good question.

489
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,826
I think.

490
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:26,664
Thanks.

491
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,565
Okay.

492
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:28,533
Any other questions?

493
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,102
Because it would be a reasonable point.

494
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,073
But not
yet, but anyone is welcome to do so.

495
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,776
Thank you though.

496
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,443
Okay.

497
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,348
So how does the FP construct agents?

498
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,318
I'm not going to talk about this a lot,

499
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:51,456
but just maybe I'm only going to
maybe mention the things

500
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:57,295
that are relevant later.

501
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,898
And this is basically just the district

502
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,001
I am free energy minimizing agents.

503
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,171
So in the free energy

504
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,773
front, in the literature, especially

505
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,910
the early ones, you also have

506
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,412
a continuous time

507
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,982
free energy minimizing agents. But

508
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,285
yeah, I'm going to mostly for them.

509
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,086
Yeah, they're not very

510
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,423
there's nothing in particular
I want to say about them.

511
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,058
But then

512
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,794
so in this discrete time

513
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:34,332
energy, in this good time FP agents,

514
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,069
the agents state you

515
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,373
consists of

516
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,809
hyper perimeters.

517
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:49,080
Basically
I put parameters for the conjugate price

518
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,020
of the model that this agent is

519
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,160
constructed to

520
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,399
use basically.

521
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,568
And these hypothermia just they insult

522
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,270
the beliefs of

523
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,440
both the environment state

524
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,609
that basically
a model of the environment and

525
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,947
a model of the dynamics.

526
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,884
Sometimes there's no model
of the environment dynamics, but it's

527
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,653
so this kind of important.

528
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,555
I mean, they basically yeah.

529
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,057
So the actual state consists

530
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,262
of these hyper parameters.

531
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:42,433
Um, and then what happens,
what happens with this

532
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:46,271
is that in response
to some observation and action,

533
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,306
the agent updates

534
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,275
the beliefs.

535
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:55,847
And actually that just means
that it updates these type of parameters.

536
00:31:55,847 --> 00:32:01,953
And this is under variation of base.

537
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:05,356
And then the agent basically

538
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,093
it also has a

539
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,229
belief over actions
and this also gets update

540
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:16,968
and this is done in such a way that it
minimizes the expected free energy,

541
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:21,439
which I think I've mentioned this
before, maximizes information

542
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,475
gain and kind of minimizes
the divergence from these

543
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,181
maybe somewhat relevant.

544
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:34,018
Instead, if the model class

545
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:38,089
that the agent maintains

546
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,459
contains the true

547
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,395
content, basically the true

548
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,466
the truth, the true model, then

549
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,203
what exact model of the involved island
and so on.

550
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:57,442
Then the belief update
this variation of belief update actually

551
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:03,314
is the same as the exact page number.

552
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,117
Okay, so that's already all I say about

553
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,123
the FP Agent Construction.

554
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:16,260
And now I talk a bit about how the FP

555
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:22,500
agent ID works.

556
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,503
So the the main

557
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,006
relevant literature

558
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,374
on this

559
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,945
agent ID

560
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,848
wallpapers, papers as far as I can see.

561
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,883
And the first one is life as we know it,

562
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,753
interest on 13.

563
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,721
And then there's a

564
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,557
monograph

565
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,526
quite a long

566
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:51,562
paper

567
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:55,366
thing on an 80 page
something or 80 page, lots of pages.

568
00:33:56,401 --> 00:34:00,905
And that's called a free energy
principle for particular physics.

569
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,673
And there's

570
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,410
kind of an extract

571
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,313
from that, but it's small differences
and it's called

572
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,450
Markov think it's information,
geometry and dynamics.

573
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,319
I'm as far

574
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,991
and you know

575
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,129
and also first and

576
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,664
hello

577
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,903
and then there's also a paper

578
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,772
which is written in response
to our criticism.

579
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:35,973
That's

580
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,010
some interesting

581
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:43,081
observations on the free energy
principle.

582
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,750
It's a question.

583
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,985
No, sorry.

584
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,053
Yes. So

585
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,559
okay, so this

586
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,361
this last paper was in response or.

587
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:57,929
Correct.

588
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:01,699
So these I think these contain basically
what the

589
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,838
these contain
all the things relevant to this

590
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:12,110
agent ID them.

591
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,479
And basically, they're the main paper.

592
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,714
It's not it's not I could think

593
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:20,718
there are also some other ones,
but I think actually these ones are the

594
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:26,257
essentials.

595
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,060
Okay.

596
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,231
Yeah, our the paper we wrote, it's
mainly concerned with life as we know it

597
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,033
because the second
none of the other papers existed

598
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:39,537
when we started writing it, the,

599
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,373
this one and every principle

600
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,978
before particular physics came up
and we were and we

601
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:53,951
and when we were writing it.

602
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,087
But yeah, as I said, I would try,

603
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,723
I would try to

604
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:05,329
give a fact if that also includes

605
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,066
the newer

606
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,802
constructional approach of for papers.

607
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,741
Okay.

608
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,108
Yeah.

609
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,644
So what is the rough idea of this?

610
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,947
I can't go through this in detail mainly

611
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,583
or among other reasons for this

612
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:30,121
is that I don't really know.

613
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,224
I don't really understand how it works.

614
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,560
And it's like I I'm still not

615
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,764
I haven't gone through
the whole construction

616
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:42,500
because I get

617
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,670
usually I, it's just stuck before
I'm through.

618
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,140
Okay.

619
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,376
So the rough idea is so

620
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,346
we have our universe

621
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,849
and like I said, we find this

622
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,351
subsystem

623
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:06,991
that okay, it's
the length of an equation.

624
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:10,161
Omega
is some kind of markov and white noise.

625
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:14,198
Then we also require that this

626
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,103
subsystem or Yeah.

627
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:22,740
Is such that not only does it
obey this equation,

628
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,876
but also that this equation

629
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,915
has a steady state distribution.

630
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,283
P star

631
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:37,521
okay.

632
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,658
I think there's just going to be
the same thing in response.

633
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,059
Oh, okay.

634
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,529
So now what we're going to do
is we find this subsystem

635
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,332
basically, let's say

636
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,469
we have this system and it appears this

637
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:54,438
equation, things are basically

638
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,209
imagined environment with this animal

639
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,779
and now with further split up this

640
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:03,748
system.

641
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,851
So well, I thought
there was going to be some answer.

642
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,220
So we further split up the system.

643
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,622
Basically, we are

644
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,691
we split it up into here.

645
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,661
You you basically
I hope you can kind of see that this

646
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:20,598
central nervous system of this animal

647
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:21,966
and we kind of

648
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,770
split that up, this whole system

649
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:31,609
into relevant into parts
that are aligned with agents in some way.

650
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,843
That's sort

651
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,913
of like

652
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,018
now, okay,

653
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,087
that's what we're going to do afterwards

654
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,323
in one step.

655
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,524
But first,

656
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,195
I understand it's confusing, but

657
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,763
there is

658
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,467
one nice fact

659
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,638
about
so this should have been before this.

660
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,372
And I just

661
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,976
there's one nice fact
about these kind of equations.

662
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:09,013
So I just go back

663
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:13,150
to about these kind of equations
if they have a steady state distribution

664
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,587
and only if they have a steady
set distribution.

665
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:21,559
If they don't,
then you can't do the following.

666
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:28,499
So, so in that case,

667
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,069
if they have a steady distribution,
then you can write F of X

668
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,704
as this

669
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,342
kind of gradient descent

670
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,145
or SNF,

671
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,047
which I

672
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:44,882
formulated

673
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,785
of the log probability of the log

674
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:54,291
of the stationary distribution.

675
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,428
And yeah, so then you also

676
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:00,931
get these two matrices here in front

677
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:06,270
and are symmetric and symmetric.

678
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,372
And also yeah, you can write this

679
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,109
here, the log for the log

680
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,280
they said probability

681
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:20,151
you can write it or turn it into this

682
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:25,356
negative log probability
and that's the definition of this.

683
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,792
I you've maybe seen in the

684
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:33,798
the surprise.

685
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,167
Okay yeah.

686
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,270
That this is not really trivial of this

687
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,007
when exactly you can
write it's not really trivial

688
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,876
especially

689
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:50,514
when this come up

690
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,383
matrix and our matrix don't

691
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,052
depend on the position
x, which is something that

692
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,923
is usually assumed in the FIP

693
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,960
literature.

694
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,196
Yeah. I mean if if the force is linear

695
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,431
or if

696
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:14,138
the vector fields or something
sort of got lowest anyhow, then

697
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:15,973
it works.

698
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,876
And this also means
that there are six points

699
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,179
of a nonlinear active field.

700
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:22,980
It books.

701
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,483
Okay.

702
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,518
I asked a question on that last slide,
Martin.

703
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,889
If I'm maybe giving an example

704
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:36,427
of a kind of system
that people apply it to, what is X here?

705
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,897
And then what does it mean
that R is anti symmetric and that gamma

706
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:43,200
is symmetric?

707
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,968
Okay.

708
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:48,272
So I actually don't know.

709
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,108
I don't think anybody applies this
to anything

710
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:53,911
that you think

711
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,047
at least.

712
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,783
Yeah, I mean, like that's
actually one of the criticisms I have,

713
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,655
but we can definitely apply it to some

714
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,792
systems and maybe I'm going to

715
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,130
look somewhere deep on there up there was

716
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,968
on these pictures that snow

717
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,304
is get trapped in those

718
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,373
I thought okay yeah yeah.

719
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,075
Okay so

720
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,312
here's a 2D example of such an equation

721
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:33,284
and with the comma and the R,
so we say this

722
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:37,221
falls, let's say this forces
or this vector, this linear.

723
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:43,360
So it's just the matrix times the vector.

724
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,762
So then exactly.

725
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,931
Then we have this matrix
types of state and

726
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:52,469
we get this equation and we can

727
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,372
find Gamma and R.

728
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,575
You can compute them
this way in the literature.

729
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:58,309
Sure.

730
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,878
You can also see it
and it's also mentioned in our paper

731
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,149
out computers.

732
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:09,153
And you can and we can compute
the stationary distribution.

733
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,857
It's some kind of Gaussian in this case.

734
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,993
And it looks like this.

735
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,031
And you see, here's the on the left,
you see this vector field

736
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,602
and on the right you see the steady state

737
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:26,370
distribution.

738
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,808
He had got ecologic density,
but that's the same thing.

739
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,210
And how do they split up slope?

740
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:40,951
So if you look at the component, gamma

741
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,954
times, the gradient,
you get this vector field.

742
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:47,191
And if you look at the control and

743
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,292
this should be

744
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,962
there are sometimes it's called.

745
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,131
Q But that's the same thing.

746
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,700
Just in case you're wondering,

747
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,369
if you look at the

748
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:01,138
component R, then it has this

749
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:05,342
it's basically this circular

750
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,879
component of

751
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:10,481
this vector.

752
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,218
It's hard to see that
this vector has this circular component,

753
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:19,123
but if you see it roughly here,
you see that they actually aren't.

754
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,091
So this one is actually straight always

755
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:22,893
or so.

756
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:26,830
The left one is the hill climbing aspect
and the right side is the

757
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,067
is it sometimes called solenoid L
or the ISO contour?

758
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,369
Yes. So exactly.

759
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:36,240
And so there is one
interesting thing about this,

760
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,975
and that's that

761
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,278
this is the

762
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:45,182
so whether this matrix R is

763
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,986
everywhere, zero or not, two sides,
whether

764
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:54,258
the steady state
is the Non-Equilibrium state

765
00:44:54,258 --> 00:45:00,130
or an equilibrium steady state.

766
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,766
And this is due to

767
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,169
the I mean, so the standard definition of

768
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,605
non-equilibrium
steady state and equilibrium

769
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:12,142
or distinction between non-equilibrium
steady state and

770
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,778
equilibrium state.

771
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,880
Is it is that

772
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,817
in the equilibrium steady state,
you have to balance that

773
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:26,657
in the non-equilibrium that it's not.

774
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,193
And if you have this cylindrical flow,

775
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,996
then you don't have to you.

776
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,631
That's exactly when you don't have

777
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,167
it basically destroys

778
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:41,638
that it's a advance.

779
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,139
Thanks.

780
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,407
Yeah yeah.

781
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,709
So it's a balance means that

782
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,280
basically if you
if you make a square, small square here

783
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,183
and the flow

784
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,520
or two let's take two neighboring

785
00:45:58,522 --> 00:45:59,723
squares

786
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:04,261
and then if it had teacher balance,
then the flow from one square to

787
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,831
the other would always be
the same as the square

788
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:10,567
from the other to the first,
from the second to the first.

789
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,370
But since here,

790
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,240
this flow always goes in, in this

791
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,210
horizontal direction. I'm

792
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,881
not horizontal in this side direction.

793
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,851
What goes in from
the one side is never compensated

794
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,055
in the other direction.

795
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,558
So then you can say here,
but on the left side

796
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,562
it also doesn't
look like it's compensated.

797
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:41,298
And that's that's that's true.

798
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:46,403
But it is actually compensated by the
noise because this is only a

799
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:48,105
this is

800
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:52,276
only the the vector field
and without the noise factor.

801
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,478
So this only F of X
without the most factor

802
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,714
and the noise factor in this because it's

803
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,652
the noise factor is also it has no curve.

804
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:07,491
So this is why you

805
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,928
so the noise can compensate.

806
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,630
There's this

807
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,433
component, but it cannot.

808
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,100
All right,

809
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,803
maybe that was a bit

810
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,005
maybe I shouldn't
have taken that much expense, but

811
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,109
it's kind of nice

812
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,012
and we're very.

813
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,583
Yeah, okay.

814
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,319
Yeah. So

815
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,122
this is what we get,
this nice composition

816
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:44,194
and it's kind of needed oil.

817
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,064
We only get it if we have this
the steady state. It's

818
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,603
and it plays a reasonably important role
in the

819
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:55,038
literature.

820
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:55,806
Okay.

821
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,877
So this other thing

822
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:03,614
that we do

823
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:08,285
with our subsystem
is we split it up in some way.

824
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:14,691
And this is kind of what the Markov,
the so called Markov

825
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:18,829
think it does.

826
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,665
So the but I'm just going to
I'm not going to talk about what to

827
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:22,532
make of this yet.

828
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,601
I'm just going to

829
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,603
say what it's

830
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,173
so about the work
that it's supposed to do.

831
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,377
So it will give us

832
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,281
this split of the state

833
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:41,952
into all of the state coordinates
into four parts,

834
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,223
basically a partition of the coordinates

835
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,958
and and

836
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,494
we will then call

837
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,665
each to the external states

838
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,634
as to the sensory state and the active
and actually states

839
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,370
at the internal state. State

840
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:04,274
and then also so

841
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,943
sorry, someone else just joined.

842
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,244
We'll set a question.

843
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,845
Oh, no, no, no.
Someone else just joined in.

844
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:12,249
Not actually sure, but still, Avi
and I'll add a little

845
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:17,287
password
just so that no one else joins in.

846
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,324
You have to go for it.

847
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,091
Okay.

848
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,594
So so then

849
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:28,231
what the microphone also does
basically it does all kinds of

850
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,901
it does a lot of work.

851
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:35,005
Let's put it this way,
because all you need is that you

852
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,709
have this subsystem and you have
the study set at the mark of blanket.

853
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,713
And then what you get
is that the internal, active

854
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,514
and sensory states

855
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:49,052
in this system appear to

856
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,621
and this is important actively

857
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:54,658
resist

858
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,561
the dispersion of its mark of packets.

859
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:00,497
Okay, well,

860
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,199
there's split microphone and again,

861
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:06,336
so here you should read boundary
or you can also read individuality.

862
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:10,073
That's what this means in this case,

863
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,075
by engaging in approximate

864
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:16,313
Bayesian inference. So

865
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:21,885
so these this statement
basically has all these features

866
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,755
that we kind of
want from an agent, identify, location

867
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,192
theory

868
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,630
because it tells us that if we have this

869
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,066
under these conditions

870
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,904
and by naming these

871
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:44,007
variables in this way,
then we see that these

872
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,911
mean basically it's it makes sense

873
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:54,017
to name these variables in this way
because they

874
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,087
we have some kind of goal.

875
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,423
The goal is

876
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,926
to resist dispersion of the microphone,
I guess.

877
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:06,363
So basically it's the goal,
this kind of persistence

878
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:10,200
and the agent acts

879
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,737
to pursue this thought
because it actively resists

880
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:17,741
this distortion.

881
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,175
Yeah.

882
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,311
And it is individuated because we have to

883
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:27,050
we know which states belong to it
and which basically top it off it.

884
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:32,055
It's this distinction
between external and internal.

885
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:32,355
Yeah.

886
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:36,326
And then additionally, which is also
kind of nice that this all this agent

887
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:40,330
is also doing some kind of approximate
Bayesian inference, which is a

888
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:41,965
bonus, I guess.

889
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,302
So this is why I,

890
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,238
I say that

891
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:53,376
the FCP basically is contains

892
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,546
the theory of agent ID and

893
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:00,784
yeah.

894
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,885
That this is yeah.

895
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,888
And this is also
this is basically the part

896
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:08,425
that interests me the most about the

897
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:12,963
standard treatments.

898
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,598
It's okay.

899
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,100
It's kind of a

900
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,370
maybe a unique selling point

901
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,806
compared to all other kinds of

902
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,411
sort, to most other approaches, to

903
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,481
obstructing

904
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,552
logical agents.

905
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,588
And it's also I mean, there are not many
there are not many

906
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:41,825
agent ID theories

907
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:47,063
that I know of,
and I actually hope that I know of them.

908
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,799
But yeah, actually that yeah.

909
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:53,236
It's quite a these aren't common.

910
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:56,706
Okay.

911
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:56,973
Yeah.

912
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:03,213
I said what this is, it's okay.

913
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:06,149
Yeah. So in summary,
we just make three assumptions.

914
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:09,753
We say, well,
some subsystem has dynamics,

915
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,657
it has a sense that this region
and it has Marcos think that Eduardo

916
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:15,759
we have identified

917
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:21,731
an edge.

918
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,066
Yeah, nice.

919
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:26,703
Sounds good.

920
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,273
Okay, so let me.

921
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,676
Is there any question up to now?

922
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,213
There's a few more general ones,
but feel free to continue

923
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,547
and we'll get them, I think, at the end,

924
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,217
because this next section
will probably very helpful.

925
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:41,885
Okay.

926
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,422
So so now

927
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,490
let's talk about

928
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:52,562
what the relation between this FP
agent construction and FP agent ID

929
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,600
parts of the F in the literature

930
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:02,973
are according to the literature.

931
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:06,509
So the

932
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,714
these I kind of said this already, but

933
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,116
the thing that makes FP

934
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:17,387
more active inference,

935
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,856
those are actually the same thing
as far as I know

936
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,860
agent special it is that

937
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,898
lots of things are at least two things.

938
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:32,836
I mean, there might be more,
but I think these are the main ones

939
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:35,872
or the most important

940
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:39,709
ones to this.

941
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,012
These are

942
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:46,783
FP agents, the construct
they've constructed, FP agents

943
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:51,388
that I talked about before.

944
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:54,157
They can be seen as kind of a class
or used.

945
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:57,427
They are used kind of
as a plausible model in neuroscience.

946
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:02,866
And this relates
to predictive coding and based frame.

947
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:06,603
But I actually I'm not qualified
to talk about this because I don't know

948
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:10,607
enough about neuroscience.

949
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,376
But the other thing that makes them
special is

950
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,380
one of the main points
I mean, of this talk is

951
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:22,819
that they are claimed
to be based on first principles.

952
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:28,124
And when the statement
that they're based on first principles

953
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:32,162
actually means refers exactly to this

954
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,199
the this FP
ancient identification method.

955
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,635
So the first principles
are basically what I just

956
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:43,740
talked about that the

957
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,509
last equation and the steady state
and the mark of

958
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,412
it gives you this agent.

959
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,082
So let's

960
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,819
in order to make sure
we're not putting words

961
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,356
into the mouth of the literature
that's read this quote once

962
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:03,493
that's from the also sophisticated

963
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:09,132
paper that just came out.

964
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:13,903
The key distinction is that base
adaptive enforcement learning considers

965
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:17,507
arbitrary what functions
by a sophisticated active inference

966
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:22,545
optimizes an expected free energy
that can be motivated from

967
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:25,615
okay, actually here

968
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,051
it doesn't say best
but actually in another like you can

969
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,989
get this paper in

970
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,493
in another place it says based on first

971
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,396
and also this is not only
this is not only

972
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:43,833
mentioned
for the sophisticated inference agents

973
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,137
you will see some statements
in the literature,

974
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,940
in other tests.

975
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,675
So this is I mean, this kind of

976
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,813
in some
way, it's super cool if it's true.

977
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,883
I think.

978
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:03,386
But I'm not so sure it's true.

979
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:03,653
Okay.

980
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:09,559
So some notes.

981
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,393
Yeah.

982
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:11,995
Okay.

983
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,531
So, so this is about

984
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,101
whether actually this

985
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,203
how important is that is

986
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,740
how important is it for
the constructed agents

987
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:27,610
to be based on this first instance?

988
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,012
So in this

989
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:34,551
kind of sophisticated inference paper,

990
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,586
the authors say that

991
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,790
the agents expected free energy

992
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:46,463
at expected free energy,
which is the thing that many of us

993
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:51,501
can be motivated from first.

994
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,403
But they also

995
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,673
seem to say
that the expected free energy can also be

996
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,876
I mean, yeah, actually,
I mean, they say in one

997
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,080
they say that it can also be motivated
by the information we don't.

998
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:08,551
And they are all

999
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,721
I mean, there's
there's one part that this refers to.

1000
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:17,460
So as far as I understand it, they are
there's a there are two ways to motivate

1001
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,364
this expected free energy minimization.

1002
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:25,802
And one is via
these first principles and one is via

1003
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:32,442
some other derivation
that involves information.

1004
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:35,912
Now, I would say
I understand these derivations

1005
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,215
the statement completely, but

1006
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:43,653
I do know that there's a paper by Cohen

1007
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,723
and Tarter

1008
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:51,661
and they show that if you that there's a

1009
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,998
that that basically some combination

1010
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,133
of information gain and reward
maximization

1011
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,570
is you can prove

1012
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:04,874
that it's optimal in some sense.

1013
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,877
So since this expected free energy

1014
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,581
is kind of a combination
of those two things,

1015
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,018
I kind of think,

1016
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,453
let's put it this way,
I'm not surprised that it has

1017
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:20,490
it shows good performance
or something like this because maybe it's

1018
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:24,561
actually so closely
related to the method by Cohen that.

1019
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,261
It just works.

1020
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:27,630
So all I'm saying,

1021
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:31,434
I guess what I want to say is that

1022
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,537
in case
the motivation of first principles

1023
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:40,176
fails, the FP construction of

1024
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,813
agents may still be of interest
and might still work.

1025
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:49,018
And this also means that all these
all publications, I think they are some.

1026
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:52,922
But yeah, I think that maybe quite a few

1027
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,093
of these publications that

1028
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,897
that are basically based on this

1029
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:02,732
expected free energy

1030
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:05,835
of minimum minimizing agents

1031
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:07,470
are they

1032
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,607
they need not be without merit
just because the

1033
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:15,178
first principles motivation fails

1034
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,749
so or in other words

1035
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:24,621
they can still they
they can still make as much sense

1036
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:28,591
basically even if this free energy

1037
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:32,228
principle agent ID is wrong.

1038
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,231
If I could ask a question here, Martin,

1039
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:38,968
What what kind of first principles
are you most interested in?

1040
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:43,773
And then what kind of a theory of agents
or agency would be satisfying,

1041
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:50,013
given your interest in first principles?

1042
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:55,051
Yeah, I mean, I, I, I think so.

1043
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,019
So if you

1044
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,923
like the,

1045
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:03,326
I'm interested in the first principles
that work.

1046
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,829
I don't know what
the first principles are,

1047
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:12,201
but like maybe one, one sentence
is that you can start from physics.

1048
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:15,972
Like that's like you can you
you start with some well

1049
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,574
I don't know where I'll have to go
up. Yeah.

1050
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:21,577
Some of that is, is
you start with the dynamical system

1051
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,279
and you then

1052
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:28,951
derive using only

1053
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,723
notions
that are well-defined for dynamic systems

1054
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:37,860
or within such dynamical systems

1055
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,698
to show that

1056
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:47,570
this thing,
this system contains agents or not.

1057
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,808
Or so I guess the first principles for

1058
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,211
the first principles here are that,

1059
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:00,183
okay, all we have to believe is

1060
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:04,320
that there are such subsystems

1061
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,523
that obey the laws of equations.

1062
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:12,261
And I guess since the laws
of equation has been quite

1063
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:17,967
popular in physics, it has

1064
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,737
this, has this, this,
this has some strong support.

1065
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:24,407
And maybe that's sufficient

1066
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:28,144
to be your first principle.

1067
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:31,814
Also, having steady state is fine.

1068
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:36,753
It's rare to find there's no I mean,
that's a mathematically fine thing.

1069
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,822
We can in principle

1070
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:40,957
check this

1071
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,730
so yeah.

1072
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,767
Then the other thing that's used in
the literature

1073
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:55,271
is the Markov linkage.

1074
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,540
And I think that's also yeah, it's a

1075
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:01,878
it could be a well-defined thing.

1076
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:05,782
I think it's a bit of a like

1077
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,318
what it means in the FP literature

1078
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,354
is kind of not, it's

1079
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:14,791
not really clear and it changes
and maybe it has to change again,

1080
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:22,498
but at least the original.

1081
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,834
So it depends.

1082
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,903
Yeah, I guess I have to

1083
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,238
I would have to solve it more, but

1084
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:37,914
Markov thank you.

1085
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:41,818
But yeah, I would say

1086
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:45,421
I yeah, for first principle for me means

1087
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,658
probably just that you have to be able

1088
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,060
to define it for

1089
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:52,762
dynamic.

1090
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,832
It has to be like all the notions of use.

1091
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,901
You can only use notions
that are defined for dynamic. It

1092
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,437
totally makes sense.

1093
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:05,074
It's like if you're going to play
the game of dynamical systems analysis,

1094
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:07,276
you can only use those rules.

1095
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:10,213
Exactly.

1096
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,982
You can only things like you have to

1097
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,084
you have to construct everything
from there.

1098
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,452
You don't get anything else.

1099
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:16,919
That's it.

1100
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:19,555
You get the dynamic sense of

1101
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,090
That's it.

1102
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,557
Yeah.

1103
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:32,835
Okay,

1104
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:33,603
that's.

1105
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,310
Yep. That's

1106
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,280
yep, that's is it.

1107
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,314
Not even.

1108
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,783
Yep. Okay. So now.

1109
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:48,951
Oh, okay.

1110
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:49,952
So that's

1111
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:52,822
a big part of the talk.

1112
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,591
That's
kind of that was kind of my personal,

1113
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,862
my current personal view on what's

1114
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:01,797
yeah.

1115
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,901
And how I
yeah, how I look at the FP literature and

1116
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,704
what it is I guess, and

1117
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:14,410
yeah, so now I would go and talk about

1118
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,781
the issues I see with this.

1119
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:23,252
FP interest identification method,
but if there's any questions now

1120
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:26,789
might be, what's the point?

1121
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,659
That's it for now, definitely.

1122
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,994
After this,
we'll see if anyone has any questions,

1123
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:39,001
but feel free to type them
in the live chat if anyone has it.

1124
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,736
Okay, so

1125
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:45,141
the first is, should I have instead
this Markov blanket assumption

1126
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:49,345
is known to be insufficient

1127
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,549
and now it's not very interesting.

1128
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,986
Maybe in the

1129
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,690
maybe at the for the very first paper,

1130
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:04,026
it was known to be

1131
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,296
okay actually for the papers.

1132
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:07,530
Maybe

1133
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:12,902
now I don't know.

1134
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,004
Yeah, I can't really say
because it wasn't me.

1135
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:18,708
But it's fair to say that

1136
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:22,745
the first two papers
that might not have known this.

1137
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,881
Okay. Yeah.

1138
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:30,419
So, so, so I'm going to kind of
go through the Markov

1139
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:33,689
blanket evolution a little bit,
not not another energy term, but

1140
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,959
the mark of blanket evolution

1141
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:43,165
in the FP literature.

1142
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:47,670
Or maybe I should say that originally I,

1143
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:51,841
I think I'll have to see you.

1144
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,976
I mentioned it on the okay.

1145
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:58,147
So originally the term
I think it comes from Judea Pearl

1146
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:04,120
from this 19 aged book.

1147
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:04,720
Yeah.

1148
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:09,525
So it's a, it's a technical term

1149
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:13,829
that had a definition before
it was used by the ethical literature.

1150
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:15,331
Okay.

1151
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:18,534
So and in this, in this original paper,
the knife as we know it,

1152
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:23,339
there is actually no definition of like
there's no no, it's no, we're clear.

1153
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,975
It's it's not clearly said what is meant.

1154
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,544
What kind of mark of blanket is meant.

1155
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:30,346
I mean, there's some kind of graph

1156
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,917
but Markov blankets

1157
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,387
come from directed acyclic graphs

1158
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,924
and the graph is cyclic, so
it's actually not know what it's meant.

1159
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:45,694
I mean there is,
but it clearly states that

1160
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:48,330
that's the mark of blankets that

1161
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,535
are should imply this equation

1162
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,273
that the vector field

1163
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,942
when we split it up
into the four coordinates

1164
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:03,379
also edge it.

1165
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:08,884
So it's kind of nice also that there are
these four you can split up the fact

1166
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,888
that the corner four sets
of all the coordinates

1167
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,091
into four sets of corners

1168
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:18,427
and the vector field

1169
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,963
then as can be

1170
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:26,368
has a certain shape form

1171
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:31,607
namely at the

1172
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,742
internal and sensory states do not

1173
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:39,482
that the vector field components

1174
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:42,518
of the internal and sensory states do not

1175
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:49,058
directly depend on the internal state
and the vector field components

1176
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:53,129
of the action and excellent active

1177
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:57,800
internal states do not depend
directly on the external. This

1178
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:00,736
maybe.

1179
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,172
But yeah,

1180
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,074
and we call this

1181
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:08,511
a we we we call this vector condition or

1182
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,547
or I mean, I call

1183
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,883
this because it's
the condition of the vector C

1184
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,553
and in our paper this is conditional.

1185
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:19,021
Okay?

1186
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:22,591
This is kind of, I think in life
as we know it, this is kind of

1187
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,860
this is the only

1188
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,763
real thing

1189
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,131
is where

1190
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,036
the macro blanket plays a role.

1191
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:36,472
And by the way,
this is not a michael Frank.

1192
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:39,241
I mean, not technically this
not the thing.

1193
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:46,682
I mean, this is a purely
and mark of its condition.

1194
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,617
Then in

1195
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,754
at least in and Thomas

1196
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:55,958
Price paper in 2020,

1197
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:58,561
the mark of blanket is said to imply

1198
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,530
this condition

1199
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:04,833
independence of the

1200
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,102
external states

1201
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:11,774
given blanket, which are the sensory
and the actual states.

1202
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,877
So we get this factorization
of the stationary distribution

1203
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,414
or a steady state distribution

1204
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,349
and that's

1205
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:23,185
also considered
a condition of the mark of

1206
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,791
this thing is also implicit in the

1207
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,794
this condition is also implicit.

1208
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,063
It's in the

1209
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,432
free energy principle

1210
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,835
for particular physics,

1211
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:43,072
but it's not explicitly referred to
as the Marcos make sense of it.

1212
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:48,244
But this is actually a mark of locus
in the sense of true.

1213
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,813
Therefore this condition is a true mark

1214
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,717
and it has

1215
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,752
come to be called

1216
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:58,921
not only by me,

1217
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:03,125
the time synchronous,
synchronous mark of condition.

1218
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,962
And in our paper this is condition.

1219
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:10,532
Those two conditions,
this one and condition one.

1220
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:15,437
They are independent of each other
like they are systems that obey this one

1221
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:17,706
and not this one.

1222
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:23,612
And system the systems that obey this one
and not this.

1223
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,714
And those systems are not

1224
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:27,916
complicated.

1225
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,219
They are actually linear systems.

1226
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,422
So they are this constant. One factor

1227
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:36,759
first, since they can easily compute

1228
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:40,029
this stationary distribution
and it's a gas.

1229
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:44,333
So you can look this in the in the paper.

1230
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,835
And I think I think one of the I mean,

1231
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,639
this is why it's speculation, but

1232
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:55,210
I think that the

1233
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,746
the authors

1234
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,617
are confused

1235
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:04,520
because the only offer

1236
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:09,591
kind of thought that this equate that
this condition implies this condition.

1237
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:12,728
I it seems to me

1238
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,397
there are various reasons, but

1239
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:19,768
and I'm not going to go into it,
but this seems to be the case

1240
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,872
and maybe you could think I mean, I can
you could think this.

1241
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:27,376
I mean, not completely of

1242
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:32,214
question, but yeah.

1243
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:33,349
So then

1244
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,051
we wrote we wrote this paper

1245
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,090
after we wrote this paper in 2000, 19

1246
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:44,960
and complained

1247
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,798
about some,

1248
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:53,569
some thing in the

1249
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,305
some things in the

1250
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,243
free energy

1251
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:04,246
for fairness
principle for particular physics,

1252
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:10,719
paper, namely

1253
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,789
this thing called
the conditional independence corollary,

1254
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:19,194
which is supposed to follow
from the vector of your condition.

1255
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:19,962
I think

1256
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:27,035
is to I mean, I think that's the claim.

1257
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,470
But we showed that it doesn't.

1258
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:32,541
And so then the mark of blanket by then

1259
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:37,045
the and an additional condition
was presented

1260
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:40,315
in this paper called

1261
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:44,052
some interesting observations.

1262
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,523
Oh about the energy
principle of something.

1263
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,360
This is the responsible paper

1264
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,731
that this condition
is that the sun needle

1265
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,401
component matrix

1266
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:04,039
are or Q as this shape.

1267
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,108
Okay that's why
I mean I'm going to call this

1268
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:10,279
first line condition if I ever need
it again in this so but okay

1269
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,483
yeah since this came out after I mean,

1270
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:17,252
this was in response to our paper,
so we don't really talk about this.

1271
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,289
Okay? So

1272
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:24,893
this is just some additional condition

1273
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:28,063
and then I think so,

1274
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:29,698
yeah.

1275
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,835
So you can kind of see all of these

1276
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:36,572
like these conditions are all used in

1277
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:42,511
to derive this statement here that

1278
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:48,317
that this statement here,

1279
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:53,822
the FP agent identification method

1280
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:57,759
basically that you get to identify

1281
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:04,366
that we actually get

1282
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,769
we can identify an agent that actively

1283
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,243
acts to that, that acts to

1284
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:19,414
assist
basically with the goal of just, okay,

1285
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:22,484
so we have this addition as well.

1286
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,320
And then in,

1287
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,824
in part in the first paper

1288
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:36,098
and also in the monograph,

1289
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:39,535
if we look closely, there's
actually an additional assumption made

1290
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:44,439
in the free
energy principle for particular physics.

1291
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,643
It's claimed to be a consequence

1292
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:55,817
of the other conditions,
but that's not true.

1293
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:56,852
We can show this.

1294
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,554
It's kind of easy.

1295
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:01,723
And in the pop space, it's

1296
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:05,294
actually said that it's an assumption.

1297
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:08,897
So we've known that
this is an additional assumption.

1298
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,800
And this assumption
is that there's some function sigma

1299
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:16,471
and this function
sigma relates to variables.

1300
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:19,508
And these two variables are

1301
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:24,146
the most likely,

1302
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:27,783
except that both it's a given the

1303
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:32,054
like a s estimate

1304
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,489
and the most likely internal state

1305
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,992
given the and

1306
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:39,761
according to citation or

1307
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,730
of the states statistics

1308
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:44,633
and the

1309
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:49,438
and so sigma is the assumption
is that that

1310
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:53,675
that there exists a function
sigma that maps one that maps

1311
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,111
the most likely

1312
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:58,413
internal state to the most

1313
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,716
likely external state

1314
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:10,425
and that that this function
doesn't need to exist.

1315
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:11,994
You can see,

1316
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,931
for example,
I mean, it's it's not in our paper,

1317
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:21,970
we should have probably put it
in our paper, but we didn't.

1318
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,340
The contact sample is you can use

1319
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,744
basically the system we have.

1320
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,546
We show an appendix T

1321
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:34,216
and then we show one of those linear

1322
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:38,820
video systems again.

1323
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,424
And for this, the both view is just

1324
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,194
one half a

1325
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:51,333
and the both it has one half s

1326
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,736
and since s of T it's

1327
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:58,106
not a function of MFT and basically

1328
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:03,545
so they are kind of
so every combination of SMP can occur.

1329
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:06,148
So there is no functional relation
between the two.

1330
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:10,018
And that means they also kind of
cannot be any function

1331
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:14,222
sigma.

1332
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:18,193
So so this means we kind of have
to additionally assume sigma

1333
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,429
and also, you know.

1334
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:25,200
Yeah, and the thing is in my opinion,
this sigma might actually be

1335
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:29,037
a much stronger,
the strongest of all of these functions

1336
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:33,542
that are made make stronger than any

1337
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:35,644
of the other conditions.

1338
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:40,115
And these other three conditions,
the vectors, the TSMC and the just

1339
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:43,351
and linear condition,

1340
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,587
I think that's probably the most work.

1341
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:48,824
But since I don't really understand
the whole picture,

1342
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:52,594
I really tell for sure. But

1343
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:54,329
so yeah, we'll just.

1344
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:58,467
Just summary that Sigma
is sort of the proposed function

1345
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:02,604
that's literally
linking internal and external.

1346
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:04,372
So when we're talking about agents

1347
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,575
and the way
that their internal generative model

1348
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:10,378
is being linked to generative processes
in the outside world,

1349
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:13,014
that's like the key link. That's
what we're all about.

1350
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:15,417
So I totally
I totally see where you're coming from.

1351
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:17,486
Thank you.

1352
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,021
That's a good
that's a good way to say it. Exactly.

1353
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:23,492
I mean, yeah, think I would
I would say this later again.

1354
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:25,994
But let me just say, it's already

1355
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,397
these three conditions.

1356
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:32,100
They are all trivially satisfied

1357
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,503
by four independent stochastic processes.

1358
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:39,541
So like it seems

1359
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:41,710
kind of

1360
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:44,780
unrealistic,

1361
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,549
let's put it this way,
that any of these conditions

1362
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:51,052
by themselves or even their combination,

1363
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:53,922
would be sufficient to

1364
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:58,093
give us

1365
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:03,465
this kind of active,
active resistance to anything.

1366
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:07,536
It's like modeling of the environment
or on

1367
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,839
occasion inference about the environment
because

1368
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,310
for independence, suggested processes

1369
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:17,846
don't seem to.

1370
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:21,750
I mean, it would be hard to argue
that any of those is doing

1371
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,519
anything is modeling
any of your thoughts.

1372
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,922
So yeah, exactly.

1373
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:27,722
This is

1374
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:31,893
but if you have such a relation

1375
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:32,427
then yeah.

1376
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,596
Then yeah,
there might be something going on.

1377
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:36,731
Okay.

1378
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,867
So in summary,
we have these four conditions,

1379
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:42,070
the vector field condition,
the MVC, the sign

1380
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:48,543
and the sigma function exists.

1381
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:53,748
And I would say
maybe of those the FIP blanket together.

1382
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,518
Okay.

1383
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,653
Okay. Here, I say this though.

1384
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,656
Apart from the sequence function,
all the conditions are satisfied

1385
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:05,227
by four independent linear
stochastic processes because once

1386
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:08,930
yeah.

1387
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,499
So of probably sickness.

1388
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:12,200
The most

1389
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,437
significant assumption

1390
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:17,305
and yeah,

1391
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:21,042
I mean it's maybe a petty point
but I kind of think that calling

1392
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:23,612
the combination of these conditions
blanket is

1393
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:29,017
at least I mean,
but by now it is definitely misleading.

1394
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,186
I mean, I think the use of this word,
Michael

1395
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:34,256
think it was misleading before,
but I think

1396
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:39,227
it should probably be dropped.

1397
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,229
But anyway, I'm going to call it
FIP, Blanket

1398
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,967
upset this

1399
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:48,603
so and one more thing.

1400
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:49,938
I am not

1401
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:54,643
I, I cannot say that these conditions,
these four conditions together

1402
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:57,679
together are sufficient for

1403
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,315
the whole

1404
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:03,351
FIP agent ID argument

1405
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:09,224
just because I don't, I haven't really

1406
01:22:09,224 --> 01:22:11,293
gotten through the whole thing.

1407
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:14,663
But we know

1408
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:17,465
that they are necessary.

1409
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:19,834
I mean, they are
used in these agreements.

1410
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:24,839
Okay.

1411
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:30,111
So that's the first
that was the first issue.

1412
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:35,050
How am I doing in time
since I've already on?

1413
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:40,221
You can go for as long as you want
and we can go as long as you are already.

1414
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:44,025
At one hour, 20.

1415
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:44,559
Well.

1416
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:46,828
You can go
as long as you want today, MARTIN

1417
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:49,731
And then we can always schedule
another time to speak.

1418
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:51,199
But this is really, really helpful.

1419
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,334
And I'm sure that a lot of people

1420
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,769
are going to digest it,
have a lot to talk to you about.

1421
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:57,005
Okay. Okay.

1422
01:22:57,005 --> 01:23:02,377
And I'm just asking and to okay,
all right.

1423
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:06,181
Next one,

1424
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:11,653
this point is not in our paper.

1425
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,788
I guess
it has been in the back of our heads.

1426
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:17,859
But I mean, I think it's it's
really also it's become much more

1427
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:21,663
I've become much more convinced about it.

1428
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,798
And so I'm going to just mention it.

1429
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,002
And I think the it would

1430
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,070
yeah,
I think it's a kind of challenge to the

1431
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,744
FIP community maybe.

1432
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:41,049
And I kind of thought, yeah,
I think they are kind of aware of this

1433
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:45,253
now or so.

1434
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:51,059
The thing is that there is no example
for which all of the fip

1435
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:54,629
blanket conditions
the for the four conditions I mentioned

1436
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:58,666
have been proven to hold.

1437
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:03,171
So we don't know any one equation
that appears

1438
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:06,408
all of these conditions

1439
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:09,544
are actually I forgot the statistic
maybe should be

1440
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:10,478
but yeah

1441
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,850
there's no loss of any equation
with the steady state that

1442
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:17,852
okay so

1443
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:22,791
so what this means is

1444
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:27,429
we don't even know if there's any system

1445
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:33,902
that the FIP ID method applies

1446
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:37,305
or that this statement that

1447
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:40,208
in very short

1448
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:43,945
that the FIP blanket implies

1449
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,815
an agent,

1450
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:49,084
that this is

1451
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:55,757
like we don't know that there's a system
for which this is true.

1452
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:59,494
So this also means we cannot we can never

1453
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:04,232
check like there's no system
we could look at and check if

1454
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,936
there is actually something to invasion
inference and in what way is doing it

1455
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,839
and that it's actively this version.

1456
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:15,143
So this is kind of

1457
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:18,313
it's it's not yeah.

1458
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:21,783
I mean, like it would be kind of cool to

1459
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:24,953
like say in some way this is the whole

1460
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:29,224
Marco of bank story or yeah, the whole

1461
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,994
is like FIP agent ID

1462
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:35,730
story might not might be vacuous.

1463
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:37,765
Like this is what this says.

1464
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,102
And I think it's kind of a

1465
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:43,505
serious point and it should be

1466
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,275
addressed, I think.

1467
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:51,246
Okay, so maybe some notes on this.

1468
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:55,650
So there's this primordial soup example
in the origin of API and it's used,

1469
01:25:55,917 --> 01:26:00,655
I mean the life as we know it
and it's also used in the monographs,

1470
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:04,859
but there's no proof that this thing has
a steady state or that this steady state

1471
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,329
or based MVC

1472
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:10,698
type time synchronous.

1473
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:11,900
Michael Microphone

1474
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,339
and also of course, there's no proof
that it has a sigma since

1475
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:26,514
because in life as we know,
it wasn't even any sigma function.

1476
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:28,716
Also this the

1477
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:32,554
like you could say
maybe the constructed FIP agents

1478
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:35,123
are systems that

1479
01:26:35,657 --> 01:26:38,059
obey all these conditions but and

1480
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:40,628
I mean maybe they are even some of that,

1481
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,931
but this connection is never made
explicitly.

1482
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:46,801
It's always just there's
this claim that they are based on this,

1483
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:49,370
on these first principles

1484
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,873
of this, all of this, but

1485
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:56,311
it's never shown, for example,
that the agent environment

1486
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:59,614
combination,
which forms this Markov process,

1487
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:04,252
that it has a steady state distribution.

1488
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:08,489
And it's actually very unlikely
that in all of them

1489
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:13,494
it has a steady state distribution.

1490
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:17,298
And actually, you can kind of think
I would argue that it's actually not

1491
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:17,799
true.

1492
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:22,003
Definitely not for all of them.

1493
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:24,772
And also, even if

1494
01:27:25,173 --> 01:27:26,608
this agent environment

1495
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:28,610
pair would have a steady state
distribution,

1496
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:31,412
we would still

1497
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,250
want to see that it appears to us.

1498
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:37,785
MVC Right.

1499
01:27:37,785 --> 01:27:41,623
And also that it's kind of question

1500
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:45,827
So I should mention that this

1501
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:48,296
this is like the second file

1502
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:50,531
that checking that the ABC holds

1503
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:52,467
is an idea.

1504
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:55,737
That's right. And that's anywhere. Well,

1505
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:58,106
and there's some

1506
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,575
arguments about it,
but I won't go into it

1507
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:08,750
the so furthermore
it is never checked like

1508
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:12,954
we never look at the sigma function
which appears to play a significant role,

1509
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:16,858
but we never look at the sigma function
in these constructed

1510
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,928
FP agents.

1511
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:25,233
What's what is kind of what I'm
pretty sure that it says it's

1512
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:27,902
satisfied in a reasonable way
is the vector field condition.

1513
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:32,540
Okay Yeah.

1514
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,076
And maybe this

1515
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:40,248
I don't know why I say this here, but

1516
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:46,487
yeah.

1517
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:49,357
Like, okay, so you could you could

1518
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:53,461
so you could maybe so since we had Felix

1519
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:57,332
or we used to on one
because this is to show various

1520
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:01,669
things about

1521
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:02,937
the free energy

1522
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:07,108
and we, we know that it

1523
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:08,776
satisfies

1524
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:13,047
quite a few of it
satisfies, three of these assumptions.

1525
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:17,218
So since first effect of your condition,
we can make it so that it satisfies

1526
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:21,322
the NBC and the solid either condition,

1527
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:26,728
but there is no such system like a
so basically I'm like

1528
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:30,465
if you want to, there's no such system
that has the signal function.

1529
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:32,233
So if you wanted to search

1530
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:35,636
for an on central back process

1531
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:39,374
that base,
that is basically an existence proof.

1532
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,943
Then I can tell you it's impossible.

1533
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:46,080
So this proof is kind of unpublished, but

1534
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,416
and it's mostly due to Felix, but

1535
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:52,453
you know, maybe, maybe I'm going to,

1536
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,722
maybe you're going to put it on archive
at some point.

1537
01:29:55,623 --> 01:30:00,695
It's really not.

1538
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:03,030
Okay. So that's this point.

1539
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:05,700
Now I want to make another point

1540
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:08,369
that is not in our paper

1541
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:12,673
and then we're going to slowly

1542
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:15,877
get to the end
because the last point isn't

1543
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:17,145
substantial.

1544
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:18,780
Okay. So

1545
01:30:20,348 --> 01:30:21,215
yeah, what I want to say

1546
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:24,185
is that there are agents
in the literature

1547
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:29,490
for which the

1548
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:35,396
the system that they are contained in.

1549
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,266
So if we form the environment,

1550
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:41,903
if we look at the environment,
at the agent combination

1551
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:45,173
as a markov process,
what I talked about in the very beginning

1552
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,978
then and, and the

1553
01:30:51,412 --> 01:30:55,249
the agent is this FP agent

1554
01:30:57,819 --> 01:31:00,922
then for some of them it's

1555
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:04,492
straightforward to show

1556
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:07,228
that they that this combination, this

1557
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:10,398
this resulting Markov process

1558
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:13,501
does not have a steady state.

1559
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:16,537
And the first thing to note
is that if you have some kind of some

1560
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:21,509
monotonously increasing counter,
it can never

1561
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:25,146
if your state contains
a more monotonously increasing

1562
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:28,382
counter, it means you can never return
to the previous state.

1563
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:31,319
And this means
you cannot have a state state

1564
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:35,189
because the states are not recurrent.

1565
01:31:35,189 --> 01:31:40,094
And that means there's no steady state.

1566
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:44,966
So as I mentioned before,
the internal state,

1567
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:48,035
the entire age and state of FP

1568
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:50,104
agents, hyper parameters

1569
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:53,508
and updated

1570
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:56,477
using Bayesian inference
variation of Bayesian inference,

1571
01:31:56,477 --> 01:31:58,880
but that also

1572
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:02,250
includes exact patient inference.

1573
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:05,286
And so

1574
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:10,291
these hyper parameters of expectation
inference, they accumulate evidence,

1575
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:15,196
which means they count
occurrences of events

1576
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:18,866
and they only count up

1577
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:23,137
and they count every and for every event
they count something.

1578
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:27,241
So they are contested always.

1579
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:32,947
They are monotonously increasing.

1580
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:37,451
And for example
in the sophisticated inference paper

1581
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:41,923
is if you look at equation 4.5,
there is one

1582
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:45,660
there's an explicit equation
for the updating

1583
01:32:46,861 --> 01:32:51,032
of one of the parameters which counts
the occurrences of transitions

1584
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:53,801
from, expected environment, space
to observations,

1585
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,805
and no such counter

1586
01:32:57,805 --> 01:32:59,974
can be obtained within

1587
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:03,110
any Markov chain that has a steady state.

1588
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:09,083
So this means that this agent,
this particular agent

1589
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:12,153
in the sophisticated inference paper,

1590
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:15,556
is not within

1591
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:20,761
such a system that has a steady state.

1592
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:21,796
So it's not within

1593
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,533
the system that

1594
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,336
as subsystem

1595
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:32,473
it cannot exist
within a subsystem database.

1596
01:33:32,473 --> 01:33:35,242
The conditions of the

1597
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,613
the identification.

1598
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,749
Okay.

1599
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:43,951
So this

1600
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:47,254
so the be aware that this statement also

1601
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:49,423
published

1602
01:33:50,091 --> 01:33:51,993
that I kind of want to

1603
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,195
put this out there
because it would be boring

1604
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:57,131
if I just talked about it's already
published. And

1605
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:00,368
so, I mean,

1606
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:03,471
there's
some constant advice of what I think. But

1607
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:06,774
if you want to look at this
at a very simple example of this,

1608
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:13,914
I published a paper last year on this.

1609
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:17,852
And so I'm pretty sure I mean this
it seems pretty straightforward.

1610
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:21,956
This argument.

1611
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:25,092
And then one I think that so
in this paper sophisticated inference

1612
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:28,329
also there is some

1613
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:31,399
argument about steady state

1614
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:34,869
in the appendix A to

1615
01:34:35,102 --> 01:34:37,505
but that steady state just kind of

1616
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:42,276
just it ignores in terms of the
it only looks at the other variables.

1617
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:44,545
So I think

1618
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:47,748
and I think that's actually necessary.

1619
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:50,151
I think there's just no steady state
if you're increasing

1620
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,386
the intensity of the edge.

1621
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:54,889
So maybe if you have this stent

1622
01:34:58,926 --> 01:35:01,595
Yeah, the consequences of this are that

1623
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,800
FP agents

1624
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:11,205
are not identified by the FP agent ID

1625
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:13,374
methods

1626
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:16,243
and T and this also means

1627
01:35:16,243 --> 01:35:19,447
that the FP agents cannot be modified

1628
01:35:20,948 --> 01:35:22,149
by this

1629
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:27,188
FP agent ID or or by first principles

1630
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:30,558
because they think they violate
these first principles.

1631
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:32,727
In this case

1632
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:34,462
at least this.

1633
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:36,630
Okay, I think that was

1634
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:42,503
at this point, the last point is kind of
being a bit nit picky,

1635
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:46,574
but I think it's also kind of important
for some people, and that is that this

1636
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:50,911
identification
method is changing in the literature.

1637
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:55,716
And you shouldn't think, for example,
that the original F as we know

1638
01:35:55,716 --> 01:35:58,819
it, a paper

1639
01:35:58,819 --> 01:36:02,590
comes from tense, a method
that's very similar to the nuance.

1640
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:07,862
I mean, the is constructions of the most
like the internal and external state.

1641
01:36:07,862 --> 01:36:13,634
They don't appear there's
no sigma function.

1642
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:16,070
But in the later
versions of these things,

1643
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:17,972
these constructions play a central role.

1644
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:22,042
So these two, they are two

1645
01:36:22,476 --> 01:36:24,411
different methods and

1646
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:28,983
okay and

1647
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:31,919
and they are one of these things
we did in our papers, we showed that

1648
01:36:31,919 --> 01:36:35,256
this original method in life
as we know it is kind of form.

1649
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:36,590
But well,

1650
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,528
well, where did I go?

1651
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:43,631
This is and so

1652
01:36:45,866 --> 01:36:47,101
okay, don't worry.

1653
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:55,476
We're not going to look at all
these slides.

1654
01:36:55,476 --> 01:36:59,880
Okay, here we go.

1655
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:00,214
Okay.

1656
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:03,551
So we we've kind of looked at this
and we think it's wrong,

1657
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:08,823
at least the way it stated.

1658
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:13,394
LDA okay, so,
so be aware that if you look at this

1659
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:17,498
method, I thought maybe,
maybe just ignore the life as we know it.

1660
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:19,900
Paper. Let's think of what I want to say.

1661
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:24,038
And also like
you can't tell from the literature that

1662
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:28,509
this method is very different.

1663
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:33,747
I mean, it's of they never say why
they changed it and kind of

1664
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:37,551
still are mentioned
as the basis of these things.

1665
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:40,287
So be aware, it's kind of

1666
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:44,859
maybe it's a waste of time
reading this thing.

1667
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:48,829
Okay, that's it.

1668
01:37:48,829 --> 01:37:52,299
In summary,
what I said is that we can separate the

1669
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:55,736
literature into agent ID,

1670
01:37:56,403 --> 01:38:04,078
FP, Agent ID and FP Agent Construction,
and that the FBI agent identification

1671
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:08,315
method requires
significantly more assumptions than just

1672
01:38:08,949 --> 01:38:11,552
whatever the mark of length
it was in the beginning

1673
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:18,158
that this

1674
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:20,427
agent identification method,

1675
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:25,499
this is an example
that would prove that that such systems

1676
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:29,403
actually exist, such systems

1677
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:32,640
with agents, that systems

1678
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:36,810
with such agents actually exist.

1679
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:40,381
And it requires a steady

1680
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:43,317
state
that at least some of the FBI agents

1681
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:47,788
definitely don't satisfy.

1682
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:50,090
The method has changed from its original,

1683
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:52,159
but also not.

1684
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,261
It could still be correct.

1685
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:54,962
I don't know.

1686
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:56,997
Like maybe there are enough assumptions

1687
01:38:56,997 --> 01:38:59,333
you can make
and maybe that also systems that

1688
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:05,472
contain situations,
it could all still work out.

1689
01:39:05,472 --> 01:39:08,309
But I haven't made it
through all of these derivations.

1690
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:12,646
So there may also be
I guess there may be even more

1691
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,882
some that's okay

1692
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,152
at the last point

1693
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,854
that FP agent construction

1694
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:24,224
the FBI agent is probably unaffected

1695
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:27,428
by any of these problems of the FP agent

1696
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:29,296
ID that

1697
01:39:30,497 --> 01:39:34,401
all the good stuff if you want

1698
01:39:35,269 --> 01:39:39,340
okay and it can be okay.

1699
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,942
And this method can be probably
independently motivated

1700
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:45,546
by some other arguments
that are first principles, if you like.

1701
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:49,583
Okay, that's it.

1702
01:39:49,583 --> 01:39:52,920
I think a lot of people are looking to me

1703
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,923
about this stuff.

1704
01:39:55,923 --> 01:39:57,257
Yeah, and that's it.

1705
01:39:57,257 --> 01:39:59,126
Thank you very much for your attention.

1706
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:00,194
If you made it all the way,

1707
01:40:01,195 --> 01:40:05,065
especially if you made it all the.

1708
01:40:05,065 --> 01:40:06,767
Thank you, Martin.

1709
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:10,671
Maybe you can share and I'll just ask
a few of the questions from the chat.

1710
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:13,707
In closing.

1711
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:14,408
Okay.

1712
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:17,044
Well, it's it's it's

1713
01:40:17,044 --> 01:40:21,415
the last day, I'm sure.

1714
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:23,317
Is it the same as.

1715
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:26,253
Maybe
go back to the GC and just on share.

1716
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:30,891
Sheets.

1717
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:32,693
Yeah. Cool.

1718
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:34,728
That's great. Great.

1719
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,531
Nice. Cool.

1720
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:40,701
Okay, perfect. So great.

1721
01:40:40,834 --> 01:40:41,301
Thanks again.

1722
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:43,537
That was really awesome and I hope people

1723
01:40:44,772 --> 01:40:45,739
paid attention.

1724
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:48,575
So the first question is from Peter.

1725
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:52,212
And Peter asked The distinction
between agent

1726
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:55,282
identification
and agent construction is very nice.

1727
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:59,620
If I wanted to use that distinction
in my own work, should I cite your paper

1728
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:02,222
or is this distinction made elsewhere to.

1729
01:41:16,804 --> 01:41:18,872
I'm wondering if I

1730
01:41:20,474 --> 01:41:29,850
if I mentioned this anywhere.

1731
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:31,785
I don't know. Actually, I don't know.

1732
01:41:31,785 --> 01:41:34,088
I mean, like it's in some way

1733
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:39,560
it's just yeah, it's kind of like a

1734
01:41:39,993 --> 01:41:43,097
yeah, it's kind of like an observation
that makes most sense.

1735
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:45,732
And it's been yeah, I don't know. No.

1736
01:41:45,732 --> 01:41:51,071
I think if I, if I think of something,
maybe, I don't know what can I see.

1737
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:57,111
I on Twitter, I mean maybe I've got
it posted on Twitter.

1738
01:41:57,144 --> 01:41:58,879
Follow me on Twitter.

1739
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:01,448
Sounds cool. But yeah, I'm not sure.

1740
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:03,984
And I think it's kind of an obvious thing

1741
01:42:04,651 --> 01:42:08,422
I'm not the only one who has

1742
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:12,459
I'm definitely not the only one who has

1743
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:13,560
observed this.

1744
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:18,966
I yeah, probably there's somebody
in the literature that did it in 1950.

1745
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:23,103
But yeah,
I think I'm not going to be mad at you

1746
01:42:23,103 --> 01:42:25,806
if you don't say it is.

1747
01:42:26,306 --> 01:42:27,708
Thanks for the response.

1748
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:31,778
Another question from Peter
is how much should

1749
01:42:31,778 --> 01:42:36,283
the agent's ID and agent construction
depend on each other?

1750
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:39,453
In other words,
how big is the problem if they don't?

1751
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:45,392
And how important is it
that it comes from first principles?

1752
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:47,261
I was going to say
the first sentence saying.

1753
01:42:48,428 --> 01:42:50,998
How much should the agent's ID

1754
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:55,469
and agent construction
depend on each other?

1755
01:42:55,469 --> 01:42:58,572
Okay, so are those like
two separate lines or one integrated

1756
01:42:58,572 --> 01:43:01,909
whole?

1757
01:43:01,909 --> 01:43:04,778
Yeah, good question. I mean,

1758
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:10,017
I guess, I mean, in

1759
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:13,520
I guess ideally there would be

1760
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,822
some kind of relation, but

1761
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:19,293
on the other hand, so

1762
01:43:19,293 --> 01:43:21,762
we want to construct agents like so.

1763
01:43:21,795 --> 01:43:27,167
So in my opinion, the bacteria agents.

1764
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:31,271
But when we do agent construction,
we don't really care.

1765
01:43:32,072 --> 01:43:34,341
We don't have to

1766
01:43:34,641 --> 01:43:39,079
follow the principle of bacteria
necessarily if we don't like either.

1767
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:43,283
We have I mean, we might be
we might have to because that's just

1768
01:43:44,017 --> 01:43:47,020
how physics work
or due to the constraints of physics.

1769
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:49,957
But if we don't have to,

1770
01:43:49,957 --> 01:43:53,360
then nothing should stop us
just constructing any kind of thing that

1771
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:54,294
we want. I mean, like

1772
01:43:55,262 --> 01:43:57,030
like if we

1773
01:43:57,331 --> 01:43:57,631
yeah.

1774
01:43:57,631 --> 01:44:01,101
So I guess they are not

1775
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:03,837
necessarily dependent.

1776
01:44:03,837 --> 01:44:04,905
I mean

1777
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:08,542
at least they can again see the so

1778
01:44:10,877 --> 01:44:13,680
on the other hand, I guess it would be

1779
01:44:19,486 --> 01:44:20,754
it would also be nice

1780
01:44:20,754 --> 01:44:25,459
if you have some kind of.

1781
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:25,726
Yeah.

1782
01:44:25,726 --> 01:44:31,431
If you still have some agent ID method
which comprises all possible agents,

1783
01:44:31,698 --> 01:44:35,235
like all agents that you construct
should be

1784
01:44:36,703 --> 01:44:39,306
examples of your like should be

1785
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:43,143
detectable identifiable by your agent.

1786
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:46,913
Identify.

1787
01:44:46,913 --> 01:44:49,650
Okay, now I'm
going to take back what I said before.

1788
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:51,418
They should be nuanced

1789
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:54,187
and I hope.

1790
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:56,590
I hope this helped a little bit.

1791
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:58,458
Yep. And, and I'll just give why I think.

1792
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,994
There's probably more to say,
but I can't at the moment.

1793
01:45:00,994 --> 01:45:02,562
I can really think of its. Yeah.

1794
01:45:03,597 --> 01:45:04,498
So here's one

1795
01:45:04,498 --> 01:45:09,403
final question and is a question I had,
but I'll use the phrasing of Peter here.

1796
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:11,438
And so this will be our closing question

1797
01:45:11,438 --> 01:45:15,509
and hopefully the beginning of something
new in the beginning of moving forward.

1798
01:45:15,876 --> 01:45:19,846
Peter wrote,
I suppose the mathematics in free energy

1799
01:45:19,846 --> 01:45:23,617
principle and, active inference
could be taken as a work in progress.

1800
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:27,754
Are there suggestions
for how to solve or work with the issues

1801
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:28,689
that you're raising?

1802
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:33,327
Just any thoughts on this could be nice.

1803
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:37,798
So where do we go as learners and doers
and practitioners and communicators

1804
01:45:38,031 --> 01:45:41,501
in active inference? So,

1805
01:45:42,703 --> 01:45:45,605
so yeah, like I said,
I mean, on the one hand you can

1806
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,909
if you if you construct agents,
you can just ignore

1807
01:45:49,376 --> 01:45:51,578
all of the stuff
I said because in my opinion

1808
01:45:52,279 --> 01:45:56,850
you're not relying on this
agent ID method anyway.

1809
01:45:57,584 --> 01:46:02,289
So, so there's no problem like of course
you could maybe wonder what this

1810
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:04,591
base optimal

1811
01:46:04,591 --> 01:46:08,128
that is sometimes mentioned
in the literature of the FP

1812
01:46:08,762 --> 01:46:11,865
what this really means
and where it comes from. Like

1813
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:15,202
I think that's I find it,

1814
01:46:15,902 --> 01:46:19,172
I always think it's a little bit vague
what it really means.

1815
01:46:19,172 --> 01:46:21,708
And it's actually such a trivial question
what based off

1816
01:46:22,175 --> 01:46:25,078
thoughts on what optimize.

1817
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:28,382
But yeah, mostly you can ignore

1818
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:28,615
this.

1819
01:46:28,615 --> 01:46:32,319
FP And ID, but if you are interested

1820
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:35,756
in the FP ID

1821
01:46:36,923 --> 01:46:39,359
then yeah, I mean, this

1822
01:46:42,295 --> 01:46:44,698
I guess the the thing is

1823
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:49,269
look at either,

1824
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:52,706
I mean, try to understand
where it's actually going.

1825
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:56,576
I mean like I still haven't
really understood these little parts

1826
01:46:56,576 --> 01:47:02,883
of the, the monograph

1827
01:47:04,384 --> 01:47:05,352
where

1828
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:09,289
everything is supposed to come together

1829
01:47:09,289 --> 01:47:11,858
because I always get stuck

1830
01:47:11,858 --> 01:47:14,127
before in some equations
that I don't understand.

1831
01:47:14,127 --> 01:47:18,965
And then I think they're wrong,
but I'm not sure they're wrong yet.

1832
01:47:19,299 --> 01:47:20,400
It's I would have mentioned that,

1833
01:47:21,835 --> 01:47:25,038
but there's some
way I don't and I suspect they're wrong.

1834
01:47:25,038 --> 01:47:27,774
But yeah I'm still not sure. And

1835
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:32,312
but yeah, I guess that's the like
I don't really see like

1836
01:47:32,312 --> 01:47:37,050
if you want to save something of this
method, then look at this.

1837
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:39,286
But another another.

1838
01:47:40,854 --> 01:47:44,624
So is maybe to think about or

1839
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,861
think about this for yourself.

1840
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:51,631
Think about what it
what are the conditions

1841
01:47:51,631 --> 01:47:54,835
you think under which something is doing.

1842
01:47:54,835 --> 01:47:58,605
Bayesian inference or something like this
and ignore all the math

1843
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:02,209
by the end
that's already in the literature

1844
01:48:03,677 --> 01:48:05,712
and then try like once you've figured it

1845
01:48:05,712 --> 01:48:07,914
for yourself, maybe try to

1846
01:48:08,915 --> 01:48:11,151
come back to the literature
and compare it or something.

1847
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:14,087
Because I sometimes think

1848
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:16,256
people will like too much

1849
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:20,260
on what this what the literature says.

1850
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:23,463
And I'm not really sure that actually

1851
01:48:23,463 --> 01:48:27,300
what's in the literature
is like it doesn't strike me

1852
01:48:29,402 --> 01:48:32,405
as a very straightforward argument

1853
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:36,243
and I like straightforward arguments.

1854
01:48:36,243 --> 01:48:40,013
I think straightforward
arguments are usually better.

1855
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:43,483
I think maybe there isn't
a straightforward argument,

1856
01:48:43,483 --> 01:48:46,253
but I kind of think I always think
there's a straightforward argument.

1857
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:49,589
That's just my opinion. You know so.

1858
01:48:49,589 --> 01:48:49,990
Well.

1859
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:53,894
It's a nice point that the literature
is a scaffold for our own

1860
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:54,995
thinking in development.

1861
01:48:54,995 --> 01:48:59,065
The literature is not a road
that's been with gold,

1862
01:48:59,065 --> 01:49:00,700
and it's just perfect in the past.

1863
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:03,670
It's actually always a work in progress
and always a scaffold.

1864
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:07,841
So thanks so much for sharing
this really work.

1865
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:08,675
Progress.

1866
01:49:08,675 --> 01:49:11,778
Not that it isn't with landmarks
that you've published, but

1867
01:49:12,012 --> 01:49:14,414
it is a work in progress
in the bigger sense.

1868
01:49:14,848 --> 01:49:19,653
So also, thanks for staying up late
to bring us this information

1869
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,057
and we hope that in future livestreams
we can unpack this

1870
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:27,627
more and hear updates as you continue
to progress on this line of research.

1871
01:49:29,462 --> 01:49:30,063
Okay.

1872
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:31,698
Thank you very much for having me.

1873
01:49:31,698 --> 01:49:32,966
Thank you, Martin.

1874
01:49:32,966 --> 01:49:33,767
Peace!

1875
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:35,600
Bye.

1876
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:48,800
Peace!
