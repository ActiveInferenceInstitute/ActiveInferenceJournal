1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,520
great

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,960
hello and welcome everyone to actin flab

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,719
today is april 28 2021

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,839
it's actin flab guest stream number 5.1

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,359
with martin beale

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,000
martin thanks so much for joining us on

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,960
today's stream

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
and we're really looking forward to

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,400
hearing about your perspective and what

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,840
you have to share here

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,160
so uh if anyone in the live chat would

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,039
like to

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,519
ask questions we'll be relaying those to

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,760
you during and at the end of the stream

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,239
other than that please take it away and

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,360
thanks again for coming on

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,399
uh thank you daniel um

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,120
welcome to my talk everybody uh i will

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,600
talk

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
about uh

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
or i will talk about at least in the

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,800
background

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
about the paper i wrote with felix

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,079
pollock and

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,359
rio techni which is called technical

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,800
critique of some parts of the free

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,600
energy principle

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,520
but i will not go directly through this

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,240
paper

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,400
i will kind of try to give a more

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
updated perspective

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
um yeah what else to say i work at uh

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,799
aurier in tokyo

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,799
and this work is also funded by

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,560
temperature world charity foundation

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,280
and fedex was supported by the monash

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
university

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,159
okay so here's the

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,960
content of this talk first i'll make

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,720
some preliminary remarks and then

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,320
then talk about my perspective basically

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
on the free energy principle and how

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
it can maybe maybe split into two parts

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,240
uh the construction of agents and the

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,640
identification of agents and

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,880
then talk about what

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,439
the fep agent construction is and what

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,240
the fvp

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,759
agent identification method kind of is

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,440
and then i'll talk about the relation

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
between those or at least the claimed

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
relation between those

53
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
and then i'll go through some issues

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
with this agenda identification method

55
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,879
and also with this relation

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,239
okay um so yeah like i said the main

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,520
publication

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,720
uh is

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
same name as the has the same title as

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
the stock and

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,519
um came out this year

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,640
and it resulted from an effort with

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,120
uh felix where we we actually set out to

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
do like a discretized uh version of the

65
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,160
life as we know it paper from 2013

66
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,959
but we failed and then in the end we

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,480
wrote this

68
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,959
critique

69
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,519
um so yeah i will i will give this a

70
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,120
in this talk i will give a

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
my personal view a little bit of the

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,480
free energy principle

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,120
and why i find it interesting and like i

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
said i want to go through the paper in

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,840
detail

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
um and instead summarize

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,840
uh how i currently see

78
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,519
the issues also the issues that we

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,120
mentioned in the paper um

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,159
but the ffp the free so fvp meets free

81
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,879
energy principle

82
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,879
as while we were writing this paper it

83
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,000
has changed and so

84
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,119
my perspective has also changed

85
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,319
and but uh if you have questions uh

86
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,440
particular questions

87
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,239
uh about the paper then you can of

88
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,120
course ask me

89
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
afterwards

90
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,230
okay so here's the

91
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,640
[Music]

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,599
maybe a little bit more detailed

93
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,640
overview

94
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,120
so in my opinion the free energy

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,640
principle

96
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,000
can be viewed as two parts um

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,279
and the first part is basically what

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,079
uh maybe you've heard this kind of this

99
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,918
statement that markov blanket

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,280
implies uh markov blankets imply

101
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,840
bayesian inference

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
and i so from my perspective this is

103
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,639
kind of a way to

104
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,040
identify agents in stochastic processes

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,960
so this is one part

106
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,000
that is contained in the fep literature

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,040
and another part is about how to

108
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,520
construct artificial agents for

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,120
for example for reinforcement learning

110
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759
or partially or observable

111
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,960
markov decision problems and i call this

112
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,800
the constructing agents part

113
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
and the claim

114
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,240
the claim is that uh

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,600
like if you read papers about this

116
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
constructing agent pod

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
the claim is that they that this

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
construction is based on

119
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,919
this identifying agent spot so the

120
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,960
construction is based on this

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
markov blanket's employability and

122
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,600
inference um

123
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
part of the literature and i will kind

124
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,680
of argue that this

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,960
is has not been established and i also

126
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,720
kind of think it's questionable

127
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,000
hey at least in the current

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,919
state then i also present some other

129
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:44,800
issues with the

130
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
fep among those those that i mentioned

131
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,080
in the paper

132
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
and these issues so yeah one thing i

133
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,919
want to say is that these issues

134
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,639
they kind of affect would affect i mean

135
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:58,960
if

136
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
if they are if i'm if i'm correct about

137
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,600
those issues then they

138
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
affect the usefulness of the free energy

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,479
principle

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,319
or agent identification so so then we

141
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:12,800
couldn't

142
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
uh identify agents using the fep

143
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,919
and this also would question it as a

144
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,520
theory of what life is or

145
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,000
of life general or life as we know it if

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,319
you want

147
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
and then um

148
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
it would also affect this claim that

149
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,639
uh these three these constructed free

150
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,240
energy

151
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,360
principal agents are somehow based on

152
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,720
first principles

153
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
more than let's say some other

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,960
reinforcement learning agents

155
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,000
what uh what all of this what all of

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,759
these points in my opinion won't

157
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,960
affect is um

158
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,919
that free that these free energy uh

159
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,880
principal

160
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,960
agents like free energy minimizing

161
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
agents that are constructed

162
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,599
in the literature that they work or

163
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,280
uh that they work at all basically or

164
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,800
that they can be useful for

165
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,440
some research i mean i think i think

166
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,639
those

167
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
i think that these agents work is uh

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,319
kind of independent of this whole

169
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,840
markov blanket implies basically

170
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,479
inference part

171
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,599
but maybe i'm wrong but okay

172
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,759
so what's this uh what are these two

173
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,360
things uh

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,840
in the construction of agents and the

175
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,880
identification of

176
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
agents so like i said i think the

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,680
literature can be split into these two

178
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,199
parts

179
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,440
and like how to construct

180
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,080
an agent or a controller

181
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,919
and the other one is how to identify

182
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,120
basically an agent

183
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
in a stochastic dynamical system

184
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,560
and yeah so

185
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,879
and like i said also before the the

186
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,479
this first method how to construct um

187
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,400
agents or controller is claimed to

188
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,280
inherit from the second method

189
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,479
and these are still claims that are uh

190
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,360
current so there's a paper that came out

191
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,720
just this year or actually

192
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,599
a week ago so i think it's called

193
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,960
sophisticated inference

194
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,360
okay so what do i mean by construction

195
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,719
of agents or what is this uh what is the

196
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,760
problem of

197
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,200
construction of agents um because that's

198
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,440
a

199
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,519
yeah a different problem than the

200
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,279
identification of ages

201
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,360
that's kind of the first point i want to

202
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
make at least two

203
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,120
um problems are different

204
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
in general

205
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,760
so yeah in in artificial intelligence

206
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,040
research what

207
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,399
what people are occupied with

208
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,360
uh is the construction of intelligent

209
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,640
agents

210
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
for some given environment or task or

211
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
like

212
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,680
um and uh yeah so basically what what

213
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,040
these people do in artificial

214
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,080
intelligence

215
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
research or engineering is programming

216
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,279
robots

217
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,160
or virtual agents and of course the

218
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,800
robot

219
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,480
is then kind of fixed

220
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
a fixed environment or if you have a

221
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
virtual world

222
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,720
then this is also a fixed environment

223
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,320
and then if you have some

224
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
reinforcement learning problem then you

225
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,399
have kind of a task

226
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,519
okay so um

227
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,000
like i said we in these cases what we

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
have is

229
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,959
some environment uh that is given and i

230
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,279
uh i write this here as a bayesian

231
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,600
network

232
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
and then we construct a controller and

233
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,880
then this what this basically does is we

234
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
have some environment states

235
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
that i call eater and sensor values

236
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,560
that depend on each other and

237
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,800
we have dynamics of each other so so

238
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,240
basically towards the right the

239
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
time increases time step increases um

240
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
so we have uh we have some dynamics of

241
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,320
this

242
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
environment which tells us how each

243
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,440
changes under the influence of actions

244
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,480
and depending on its previous state

245
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,959
and the environment produces sensor

246
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,480
values and what an agent does

247
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,079
is it takes these sensor values

248
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
and updates its uh internal state

249
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,279
which is called mu and produces actions

250
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,880
accordingly so as you see here mu

251
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,959
depends on both the sensories and the

252
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,360
actions

253
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,279
how exactly these edges are

254
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,279
look there's some variability in it but

255
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,320
it's roughly one

256
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,440
one idea like yeah

257
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
most of them are roughly equivalent

258
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
so like i said or a bit more formally

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
maybe uh each of t is an environment

260
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,440
state

261
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
or an environment or a task is defined

262
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,200
as

263
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,560
by an environment state

264
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,959
sensor values some kind of action

265
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,959
interface

266
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,800
so some dependency on the external

267
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
variable so this dependency of the

268
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
update of eta on the action

269
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,120
and the dynamics which means

270
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,720
if we have a if we are in discrete time

271
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
then the dynamics can be specified as

272
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,399
this

273
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
markov kernel or conditional probability

274
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,440
of the next or the yeah the next

275
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,920
internal state the next sensor produces

276
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,200
sensor value

277
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,680
conditioned on the pressed internal

278
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,480
state

279
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,079
past sensor value and the action

280
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,320
which is the influence from the patient

281
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,200
and in continuous time we could also

282
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,399
formulate this

283
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,560
and one way to formulate this looks like

284
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,639
this we give the

285
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,760
uh time derivative of the internal state

286
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,040
as some function on its own

287
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,000
uh state and the sensor and the action

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,959
plus some noise

289
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,239
and similarly for the

290
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,439
sensor dynamics

291
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,680
and maybe it's not so important but

292
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,800
in general you can have and

293
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
an environment can have some kind of

294
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,000
reward

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,160
that it gives to the agent as part of

296
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,920
the sensor value or

297
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,160
um it may not

298
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,040
okay and then what's an agent so an

299
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,920
agent has this

300
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,800
uh internal or memory state and it

301
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,160
produces actions

302
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
and it also has an interface for

303
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,160
accepting

304
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,480
or sensors that are produced by the

305
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,399
environment

306
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,000
and its dynamics this can also be

307
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,360
written as this kind of conditional

308
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
probability

309
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,000
or similarly with time derivatives

310
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
in the time continuous state and maybe

311
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,079
the

312
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,760
the main part uh that's going to be

313
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,720
relevant for

314
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,279
some something later in this talk is

315
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,160
that

316
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,680
we can combine the we can combine such

317
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
environments and

318
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,079
uh agents

319
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,720
and then they form a markov process so

320
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,519
then we have

321
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,800
uh some joint variable x and the product

322
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,760
of these two

323
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,760
uh conditional probabilities the one for

324
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,120
the environment and the one for the

325
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
agent

326
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,000
they induce this um

327
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
markov kernel of the joint process

328
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
and similarly in the continuous case we

329
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,519
can uh

330
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,760
see the whole thing as one the

331
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,720
combination of the

332
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,839
environment and the agent as all as a

333
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,480
single

334
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,160
uh very as a single

335
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,319
markov process with uh

336
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,959
state x

337
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
okay so that's kind of what we

338
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,959
maybe should keep in mind um

339
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,600
some remarks uh on this usually we have

340
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
we construct these agents to solve some

341
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,440
problems so we have some kind of reward

342
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560
um so this is the case in reinforcement

343
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,279
learning for

344
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,120
po mdps but we can also have agents that

345
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,920
have just

346
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,160
intrinsic goals and they don't need any

347
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,240
reward from the environment

348
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,600
these things are usually called

349
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,880
intrinsic motivations

350
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,639
and the

351
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,199
these the fep agents from the literature

352
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,920
they actually kind of have both

353
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,600
uh in within them so they have a

354
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,759
they contain some part that's like an

355
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,639
intrinsic

356
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,160
motivation and they also can um

357
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,519
they have some part that is

358
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,040
similar to a reward and so basically the

359
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,680
entrance motivation part is is like a

360
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,519
maximization of information gain

361
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,920
and the uh instead of reward

362
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,720
maximization we minimize some divergence

363
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,839
from

364
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,160
uh a desired distribution which is good

365
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,079
but at least on a high level

366
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,839
this can be seen as uh

367
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,199
so these two things are kind of combined

368
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,440
in the free energy in the expected

369
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
free energy

370
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,160
yeah i mean there are some tricks to

371
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,199
this but

372
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,560
roughly this is true

373
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,839
okay so um

374
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,360
so that that's that's what uh i

375
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,680
i hope it came across uh what i mean by

376
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,639
construction of agents

377
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,199
i don't know if there were any questions

378
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,560
uh already

379
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,759
and it's not yet continue thank you

380
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,959
not yet okay so then uh what do i mean

381
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,720
by identification of agents

382
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,360
which is maybe a bit less

383
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,160
uh common practice

384
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,199
so first maybe let's ask the question

385
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,119
what what is an agent

386
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,400
uh in general um

387
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,760
and uh so very roughly

388
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,199
there's a definition by uh

389
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,720
and they say um to be an agent you have

390
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,440
to be

391
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,280
something that's individuated

392
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,919
that can act and make things happen and

393
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,919
can act which just means to make things

394
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,440
happen basically

395
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,799
and uh

396
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,520
it can act to achieve the these actions

397
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,240
are

398
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
are performed in order to achieve some

399
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,559
goal so an agent has

400
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,679
also a goal maybe something that has a

401
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,160
goal

402
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,640
an x to achieve actively pursues this

403
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,880
goal

404
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,240
and these these agents that i just

405
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
talked about these constructed agents

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,120
that we construct in artificial

407
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
intelligence

408
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,360
but also in the fvp literature

409
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,640
they are agents because they are kind of

410
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
by construction

411
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
they are individuated because we kind of

412
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,240
know where their boundary is

413
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,280
uh like if you ask some engineer

414
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,799
what they have to do to construct the

415
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,520
agent they know exactly what to do so

416
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,880
they they seem to know

417
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
where the agent uh is or what the agent

418
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,160
is

419
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,039
and of course since we program into them

420
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,080
uh

421
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,400
the intrinsic motivation or some kind of

422
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,320
reward maximization mechanism

423
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,160
they are also co-directed

424
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,480
by construction

425
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,679
um okay so but then

426
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,600
this is not this is just what what

427
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
agents are so what's

428
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,760
what's what about identification of

429
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,240
agents

430
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,360
so the the at least for me the

431
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,240
origin of this question is uh the kind

432
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,240
of the problem of agents in physics

433
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
so the physicists they tell us that

434
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,600
everything is uh determined

435
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
by the laws of physics so that means

436
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,280
everything that happens is made happen

437
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,000
by the laws of

438
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
physics and not by any thing

439
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,840
within this

440
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,559
uh within the universe

441
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,799
so in this if they are correct then

442
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,320
nothing within the universe can make

443
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,960
anything happen

444
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
but that also means that nothing can act

445
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,039
to achieve a goal because nothing can

446
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,000
make anything happen so

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
you can't act to achieve some goal

448
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,799
because you can't act in the first place

449
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,679
so this seems to suggest that basically

450
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,400
there are no asians in the universe like

451
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,080
it must be some kind of illusion

452
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,919
at the same time i mean we are here uh

453
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,039
we are agents and we kind of

454
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,320
want to we kind of have goals or at

455
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,840
least it seems extremely

456
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,679
likely and it also seems like there are

457
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,760
things that don't

458
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,799
and we built these robots and they seem

459
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,640
to be quite real things and

460
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,880
um have goals also so it's kind of

461
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,120
so maybe there is some way there should

462
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,879
be some way to make these two things

463
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,480
compatible

464
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,360
um so what we want is uh

465
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,400
at least if you're if you like the uh

466
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,600
physicist's perspective um

467
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,320
and also you like you like to think

468
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,360
about agents then

469
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,600
you maybe you what you want is a formal

470
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
theory

471
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,840
of agents that is compatible with

472
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
physics

473
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,840
and then so one

474
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,640
one problem that such any such theory

475
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
should

476
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,559
be able to solve is that if you have

477
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,240
some kind of universe

478
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
and in physics that's basically just a

479
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,520
dynamical system

480
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
uh then what and where are the agents so

481
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,640
if you have

482
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,679
if you have a formal definition of

483
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,720
agents or former

484
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,679
theory of agents then this is the

485
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,280
question that it should probably

486
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,360
be able to answer so

487
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,080
here's the universe um

488
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,799
and what we want to do is we want to

489
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,200
check

490
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,880
where inside this long history of the

491
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,679
universe

492
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,280
or uh there are these things

493
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,840
that are maybe can be called agents like

494
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,559
this

495
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,280
animal here

496
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,720
a bit more formally so we have some kind

497
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,000
of

498
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,120
in physics we have some kind of

499
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,039
dynamical system we have a state space

500
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,120
and states and we have a dynamical law

501
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,000
that is looked maybe looks like this uh

502
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,679
the time derivative of y is

503
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,080
some function of the so the time

504
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,760
derivative of the state of the universe

505
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,159
is a

506
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,520
function of the current state of the

507
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,840
universe

508
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,280
and then we have

509
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,240
so these things

510
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,360
have trajectories and if we

511
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,799
select one of those trajectories

512
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,200
by some initial condition y 0

513
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,000
then what we would expect from a theory

514
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
about a

515
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
theory about agents and one that can

516
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,080
also

517
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
identify agents then what we would want

518
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
is that

519
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,120
this theory gives us like once we give

520
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,880
it such a trajectory of the dynamical

521
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,840
system

522
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
or maybe the trajectory and the

523
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
dynamical system

524
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,840
that this theory tells us what is the

525
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
set of agents

526
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,000
contained in this trajectory and it

527
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,360
should tell us this

528
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,159
including what is basically its body or

529
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:20,880
its

530
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
individual the what is the individual

531
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,039
uh what are the actions and what are the

532
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,799
goals

533
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,320
okay so this is what i

534
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,320
this is kind of the agent identification

535
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,960
problem maybe

536
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,120
and uh the fvp

537
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,360
um does something like this

538
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,000
they start not directly maybe with a

539
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,120
deterministic

540
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,679
dynamical system as the physicists maybe

541
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,120
like but they instead start with

542
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,480
something that's

543
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,159
usually considered as a subsystem of

544
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,159
such a deterministic universe

545
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,799
and this subsystem should obey this kind

546
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,918
of longing equation

547
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,840
um and then the fep

548
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,760
kind of tells us what uh

549
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,400
how to like conditions under which

550
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,960
there's an

551
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,559
agent inside such a thing

552
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,440
so i'm not 100 sure how this relates to

553
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,000
this

554
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
to the exact formulation i gave here

555
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
where you just get a trajectory and the

556
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,400
system

557
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,120
and it tells you where the agents are

558
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,760
there are

559
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,640
some subtleties to this but but roughly

560
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,600
i think

561
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,799
the free energy principle is definitely

562
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,679
a step towards such a

563
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,960
theory and this part of the free energy

564
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,480
principle

565
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
is what i call the free energy principle

566
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,200
identification

567
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,720
[Music]

568
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,679
the free the fep agent identification

569
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,880
method

570
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,679
and it is uh if you're familiar with the

571
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,440
literature

572
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,279
then this is where uh the markov blanket

573
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,240
placed the

574
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,799
fundamental the so-called mark of

575
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,840
nucleation maybe say

576
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,360
okay martin can i ask um

577
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,960
what do we gain or lose by by going to

578
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,919
the lying given

579
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
equation what is what is gained or lost

580
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
in in that

581
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,159
maneuver relative to the more general

582
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,760
phrasing you had on the previous slide

583
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,159
yeah good question

584
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,320
so i well i i i don't really know

585
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,440
um i all i can say is that

586
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,760
uh

587
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,000
yeah i mean one thing you definitely

588
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,200
gain is that if you

589
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,039
i mean this thing it's kind of uh

590
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,120
hopeless like if you would really

591
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,360
uh if you if we would need the particle

592
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,520
physics

593
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,080
equation

594
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
then we would probably never be able to

595
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,520
identify uh

596
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,559
agents because the particle i mean it's

597
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,919
just too complicated and complex

598
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,279
uh to say much about it but

599
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,880
so here this gives us kind of we can

600
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
kind of say okay i can ignore a lot of

601
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,159
stuff

602
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,799
and all i have to find is some kind of

603
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,320
part of the system that

604
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,080
uh obeys

605
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,480
some kind of approximate uh equation

606
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
basically

607
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,720
and this can be enough um so this is

608
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,200
i guess this is one one advantage

609
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,600
uh

610
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,200
yeah i mean like there's one other thing

611
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,000
i'm not sure

612
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,919
i mean there's one other thing i

613
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,120
sometimes think

614
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,480
uh where this is might be useful for

615
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,520
and that's so what we what we kind of

616
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,400
want

617
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,640
um

618
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,200
is that this agent theory i mean if you

619
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,320
think about it

620
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,080
uh basically a billion year

621
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,600
like a few at some point

622
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,840
there probably weren't any agents inside

623
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,399
the universe

624
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,760
so so at that point

625
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,279
uh so so agents kind of uh

626
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,360
like a full-blown theory of agents they

627
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,960
should

628
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,799
it should allow trajectories

629
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,279
with uh within which agents appear and

630
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,799
basically disappear

631
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,480
or at least they have to be able to

632
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,159
appear

633
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,399
because that's kind of what we think the

634
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,279
universe

635
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,679
happened in the universe and

636
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,960
but this is not um this kind of

637
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
appearance and disappearance is actually

638
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,000
not so easy to

639
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,600
to do especially if you would

640
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,039
just kind of naively split up this

641
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,080
system

642
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,399
the whole system into two parts and say

643
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,480
is one part the agent and one the

644
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,399
environment because then you split it

645
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,039
basically

646
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,360
for all time and this is kind of weird

647
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,559
uh because how because you you would

648
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,960
want that the split only works for

649
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,320
a short time or or once they actually

650
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,080
uh is an agent so sometimes i think okay

651
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,720
maybe

652
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,520
maybe these this approximate equation

653
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,159
only works for a short time

654
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,000
and that's an advantage of this also

655
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,279
that

656
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,600
uh there might be short time frames

657
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,760
where this equation works and where they

658
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,200
and others where it doesn't work and

659
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
then we would get uh

660
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,399
we could think about whether this means

661
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,159
um the agent appears or not

662
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,760
but actually i'm not so sure what these

663
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,159
d and what the details so

664
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,399
yeah that's all i can really say this i

665
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,080
mean i think

666
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,200
yeah it's uh but it's a very good

667
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,840
question i think

668
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,640
thanks

669
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,200
okay uh any other questions because it

670
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,080
would be

671
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,840
a reasonable point uh not yet but anyone

672
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,279
is welcome to do so

673
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,840
thank you though okay

674
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,520
um so how does

675
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,799
the fep construct agents

676
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,679
i'm not gonna talk about this a lot but

677
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,440
uh just maybe

678
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,200
i'm only going to maybe mention the

679
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,960
things that are relevant

680
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,840
later

681
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,640
and this is basically just the discrete

682
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,080
time free energy minimizing agents

683
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,200
so in the free energy friends in the fep

684
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,240
literature

685
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,559
especially the early ones you also have

686
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:10,930
um

687
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,159
[Music]

688
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,840
continuous time free energy minimizing

689
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,880
ages but

690
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,240
uh yeah i'm gonna mostly ignore them

691
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,200
here they're not really

692
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,880
there's nothing in particular i want to

693
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,520
say about them but um

694
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,960
so in this discrete time free energy

695
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,000
the in this discrete time fep agents

696
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,919
the agent state mu

697
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,960
consists of hyper parameters

698
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,080
um basically hyper parameters for the

699
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,840
conjugate priors

700
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,840
of the models that this agent is

701
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,559
constructed to

702
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,399
uh use

703
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,840
basically and these hyper parameters

704
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,600
they encode the beliefs or um

705
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,159
both the environment state the basically

706
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,360
a model of the environment

707
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,840
and

708
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,440
a model of the dynamics sometimes

709
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,720
there's no model of the environment

710
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,519
dynamics but

711
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,720
sometimes so that's kind of important i

712
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,480
mean they basically yeah

713
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,919
so the actual state uh consists of these

714
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,720
hyper parameters

715
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,640
um and then what happens

716
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,760
uh what happens with this is that uh in

717
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,360
response to some observation

718
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,199
and past action the agent updates

719
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
the beliefs and actually that just means

720
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,120
that it updates these hyper parameters

721
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,840
and this is done via variation of base

722
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,080
and um then the agent basically

723
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,240
uh it also has a belief over actions and

724
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,080
this also gets updated and

725
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,880
this is done in in such a way that it

726
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,080
minimizes the expected free energy

727
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,159
which i think i've mentioned this before

728
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,080
maximizes information gain and kind of

729
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,000
minimizes the divergence from desired

730
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,480
release

731
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,039
um maybe somewhat relevant is that

732
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,039
uh if the model class

733
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,020
that the agent maintains

734
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,360
[Music]

735
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,960
contains the true basically the true

736
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,640
or the truth the true model then

737
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,200
um or an exact model of the

738
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,600
environment and so on then

739
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,320
the belief update this variational

740
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,000
belief update actually is

741
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,240
the same as the exact bayesian update

742
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,530
okay so that's already all i say about

743
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,840
[Music]

744
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,080
the fvp agent construction

745
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,440
and now i'll talk a bit about how the

746
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,519
fep agent identification works

747
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,519
so the the main

748
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,519
relevant literature on this

749
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,120
uh agent identification

750
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,799
are four papers as far as i can see

751
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,159
and the first one is live as we know it

752
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,200
from 2013 and then there's the

753
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,679
monograph uh quite a long

754
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,919
paper i think 180 pages something or 80

755
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:54,640
page i don't know

756
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,200
lots of pages and that's called the free

757
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,640
energy principle for a particular

758
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,960
physics

759
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,880
then there's a kind of an

760
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,000
extract from that but with small

761
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
differences and it's called

762
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,199
markov blankets information geometry and

763
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,280
stochastic thermodynamics

764
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,240
by thomas parr

765
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,918
and

766
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,399
and then there's also a paper

767
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,000
which is written in response to our

768
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,879
criticism that's

769
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,918
called some interesting observations on

770
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,040
the free energy principle

771
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,879
say a question nope

772
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,359
sorry okay so uh

773
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,918
okay so this this last paper was in

774
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,119
response to

775
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,079
our criticism so these i think these

776
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,800
contain basically what the

777
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,560
these contain all the things relevant to

778
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,440
this agent identification problem

779
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,440
um and basically they are the main

780
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,839
papers concerning this mark of naked

781
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,640
thing

782
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,200
there are also some other ones but i

783
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,599
think actually these ones are the

784
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,400
essential ones

785
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,040
okay uh yeah our the paper we wrote

786
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,960
it's mainly concerned with life as we

787
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,240
know it because the second

788
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
none of the other papers existed when we

789
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,800
started writing it

790
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,880
uh the this one we energy principle

791
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,960
for particular physics came out while

792
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,480
while we were

793
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,520
maybe yeah while we were writing it

794
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,280
um but yeah as i said i

795
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,839
i will try i will try to

796
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,720
um give a uh my perspective that also

797
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,240
includes

798
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,079
uh these newer constructions or

799
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,680
approaches or papers

800
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,000
okay

801
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,680
yeah so what is the rough idea of this

802
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,480
uh

803
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,880
i can't go through this in detail mainly

804
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,240
or among other

805
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,040
re the reasons for this is that i

806
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,079
don't really know i don't really

807
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,200
understand how it works

808
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,640
in detail like i i'm still not

809
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,119
still haven't gone through the whole

810
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,040
construction

811
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,599
um because i get usually i get just

812
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,880
stuck

813
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,800
before i'm through okay

814
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,280
um the rough idea is so

815
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,960
we have our universe and like i said we

816
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,480
find this

817
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,320
uh subsystem that obeys

818
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,839
the language equation

819
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,200
um omega is some kind of markov

820
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,880
and white noise and we also

821
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,079
require that this

822
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,640
subsystem or yeah is such that

823
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,520
not only does it obey this equation but

824
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,200
also that this

825
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,759
equation

826
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:36,880
has a steady state distribution p star

827
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,720
okay i think this is just going to be

828
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,359
the same thing again we already saw this

829
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,240
ah okay so now what we're going to do is

830
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,520
we find the subsystem

831
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,960
basically let's say uh we have this

832
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,040
system and it obeys this

833
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,119
um equation i mean so basically

834
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,640
imagine this environment with this

835
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,160
animal

836
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,359
and now we further split up

837
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,560
this cis some

838
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,000
oh actually i thought there was going to

839
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,160
be something i'm sorry so we further

840
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
split up this system basically we

841
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,520
uh we split it up into

842
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,760
here you you basic i hope you can kind

843
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,640
of see that there's

844
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,480
a central nervous system of this animal

845
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,839
and we kind of split split

846
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,440
up this whole system into relevant

847
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,040
into parts that are aligned with agency

848
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,760
in some way

849
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,960
let's go this way okay okay

850
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,560
now okay

851
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,240
that's what we're gonna do afterwards

852
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,760
in one step but first uh

853
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,359
sorry it's a little bit confusing but

854
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,839
there is uh one

855
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,280
nice fact about

856
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,640
so this should have been before these

857
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,359
images there's one

858
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,400
nice fact about these kind of equations

859
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,680
sorry let me just go back here

860
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
about these kind of equations if they

861
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,320
have a steady state distribution

862
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,000
and only if they have a steady state

863
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,680
distribution if they don't then you can

864
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,000
do

865
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,640
the following

866
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
so in that case if they have a steady

867
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
state distribution then

868
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,880
you can write f of x as this

869
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,680
uh kind of gradient descent

870
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,440
or ascent you

871
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,040
you formulated of the log probability

872
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,880
of the log of the stationary

873
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,520
distribution

874
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,680
and uh yeah so then you also get these

875
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,400
two matrices here in front

876
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,359
uh and r is antisymmetric and gamma is

877
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,200
symmetric

878
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,440
um and also yeah you can write this

879
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,319
here the the lower probability the log

880
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,760
uh

881
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,280
a state probability um

882
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,400
you can write it or turn it into this

883
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,079
uh negative log probability and that's

884
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,280
the definition of this i you've maybe

885
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
seen in the papers

886
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,000
the surprise

887
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,200
okay um yeah yeah

888
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,240
like this is not really trivial this

889
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
when exactly you can write this it's not

890
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,160
really trivial um

891
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,720
especially

892
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,640
when this gamma

893
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,280
matrix and r matrix don't depend on the

894
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,000
position x which is something that

895
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,960
uh is usually assumed in the fvp

896
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,520
literature

897
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,480
yeah i mean if if the force is linear

898
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,440
or if f yeah

899
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,880
the vector field or sometimes also

900
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,119
called flow is linear then

901
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,240
it works and this also means that around

902
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,520
fixed points of a non-linear

903
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,680
vector field it works okay

904
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,960
can i ask you a question on that last

905
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,920
slide martin yeah um

906
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,319
maybe giving an example of a kind of

907
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,599
system that people

908
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,880
apply it to what is x here and then what

909
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,000
does it mean that r

910
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,920
is anti-symmetric and that gamma is

911
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,480
symmetric

912
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,640
okay so

913
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,200
i actually don't know i don't think

914
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,640
anybody applies this to anything

915
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,759
uh let me think

916
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,920
at least yeah i mean like that's

917
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,359
actually one of the criticisms

918
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,200
i have um but we can definitely

919
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,720
apply it to some uh

920
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,640
systems and maybe i'm gonna

921
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,880
look somewhere deep down there oh that

922
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,079
was

923
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,839
i know these pictures they're slow

924
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,960
always get trapped in those right i saw

925
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,920
it okay yeah

926
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,599
here okay so

927
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,040
here's a 2d example of such an equation

928
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,400
and with the gamma and the r so

929
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,560
we say this false let's say this force

930
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,599
is

931
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,599
or this vector field is linear so it's

932
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,200
just a matrix

933
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,240
times the vector

934
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,760
so then exactly then we have this matrix

935
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,640
times the state

936
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,079
and we get this

937
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,839
equation and we can uh

938
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,240
find gamma and r you can compute them

939
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,240
there's a way in the literature

940
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,000
you can also see it in it's also

941
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,680
mentioned in our paper

942
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,640
how to compute those

943
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,599
and you can and we can compute the

944
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,400
stationary distribution

945
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,839
it's some kind of gaussian in this case

946
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,599
and it looks like this

947
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,000
and you see here's the on the left you

948
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,280
see this vector field

949
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,240
and on the right you see the steady

950
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,680
state

951
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,200
distribution here it's called ergodic

952
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,480
density but that's the same thing

953
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,560
and how do these split ups look so

954
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,839
if you look at the

955
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,680
component gamma times the

956
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,480
gradient you get this vector field and

957
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,880
if you look at the component

958
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,240
oh this should be oh yeah

959
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,560
r sometimes this is called q but that's

960
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,160
the same thing

961
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,960
just in case you're wondering if you

962
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,640
look at the

963
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,920
component r then it it has this it's

964
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,200
basically the circular

965
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,680
uh component of

966
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,280
this vector field it's hard to see that

967
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,880
this vector field here is

968
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,560
has this circular component but if you

969
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,400
see roughly here you see that they

970
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,040
actually aren't

971
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,319
so this one is actually straight always

972
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,160
cool so the left one is the hill

973
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,359
climbing aspect

974
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,359
and the right side is the is it what's

975
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,960
sometimes called solenoidal

976
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,400
or the iso contours yes so exactly

977
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,520
and um so there is one interesting thing

978
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,240
about this

979
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,839
and that's that uh

980
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,960
this is the so whether

981
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,200
this matrix r is everywhere zero or not

982
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,480
decides whether uh

983
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,359
the steady state is a non-equilibrium

984
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,800
steady state or

985
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,000
an equilibrium steady state

986
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,720
um and this is due to

987
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,680
the i mean so the standard definition of

988
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,319
uh

989
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,000
non-equilibrium steady state and

990
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
equilibrium or distinction between

991
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,119
non-equilibrium

992
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,960
steady state and equilibrium state

993
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,000
state is that in the equilibrium

994
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,599
steady state you have detailed balance

995
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,599
and in the non-equilibrium

996
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,720
steady state you don't

997
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,640
and if you have this solenoidal flow

998
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,280
then you don't have you you that's

999
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,720
exactly when you don't have

1000
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,599
uh it basically destroys the detailed

1001
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,920
balance

1002
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,440
um yeah detail yeah

1003
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,720
so detailed balance means that

1004
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,280
basically if you if you make a square

1005
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,359
small square here

1006
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,040
then the flow uh or two

1007
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,839
let's take two neighboring uh

1008
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,680
squares and then if it had detailed

1009
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,880
balance then

1010
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,640
the flow from one square to the other

1011
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,319
would always be

1012
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,480
the same as the square from the other to

1013
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,440
the first from the second to the first

1014
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,839
but since here this flow always goes in

1015
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,440
in this horizontal direction

1016
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,359
or not horizontally in this organization

1017
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,640
direction

1018
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,880
what goes in from the eye one side is

1019
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,640
never compensated

1020
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,000
uh in the other direction

1021
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,160
so then you can say hey but on the left

1022
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,240
side

1023
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,760
it also doesn't look like it's

1024
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,160
compensated and that

1025
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,880
that's that's true but it is actually

1026
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,400
compensated by the noise

1027
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,680
because this is only uh

1028
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,880
this is only the vector field and

1029
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,880
without the noise factor so this is only

1030
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,599
f of x without the noise factor

1031
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,440
and the noise factor in this because

1032
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,160
it's gaussian the noise factor is also

1033
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,520
it has no curl so

1034
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,960
uh this is why

1035
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,880
you um so the noise can compensate

1036
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,640
this this uh component but it cannot

1037
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,400
compensate

1038
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,760
all right maybe that was a bit

1039
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,960
maybe i shouldn't have taken that much

1040
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
time to explain this but

1041
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,480
it's kind of nice

1042
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,520
yeah where are we yeah

1043
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,240
okay uh yeah so

1044
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,319
this is what uh we get this nice

1045
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:39,440
decomposition and

1046
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,079
uh it's kind of needed earlier

1047
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,319
we only get it if we have this a steady

1048
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,440
state

1049
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,119
uh and it plays a

1050
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,319
reasonably important role in the

1051
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,359
literature okay so

1052
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,160
this other thing

1053
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,440
that we do with our subsystem is we

1054
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,480
split it up

1055
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,839
in some way and this is kind of

1056
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,160
what the mark of the so-called

1057
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,359
markov blanket does

1058
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,720
so the but here i'm just going to i'm

1059
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,599
not going to talk about what the

1060
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,200
marketplace is yet

1061
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,839
i'm just going to say what it's uh

1062
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,000
so about the work that it's supposed to

1063
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,880
do

1064
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,400
so it will give us um

1065
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,079
this split of the state into

1066
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,599
four of the state coordinates into four

1067
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,040
parts

1068
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,640
basically a partition of the coordinates

1069
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,200
and uh we will then call

1070
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,040
uh each of the external states as the

1071
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,000
sensory states

1072
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,400
a the active and action states and mu

1073
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,839
the internal states

1074
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,319
sorry someone else just joined was that

1075
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,319
a question oh no no someone else just

1076
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:08,880
joined in

1077
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,440
not actually sure but c'est la vie and

1078
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,880
i'll add a little

1079
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,640
uh password just so that no one else

1080
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,200
joins him

1081
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,160
yep go for it

1082
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,559
okay uh so so then

1083
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,480
what the mark of blanket also does

1084
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,319
basically it does all kinds of it does a

1085
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,520
lot of work let's put it this way

1086
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,119
because all you need is that you have

1087
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,040
this subsystem and you have the steady

1088
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,520
state

1089
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,319
at the mark of blanket and then what you

1090
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,359
get is

1091
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,280
that the internal active and sensory

1092
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,839
states

1093
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,440
in this system appear to and

1094
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,520
now this is important actively

1095
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,119
resist the dispersion of its markov

1096
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,240
blanket okay

1097
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,160
there's this word markov flanked again

1098
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,839
so here you should read boundary

1099
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,480
or basic you can also read individuality

1100
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,200
that's what

1101
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,400
this means in this case um by

1102
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,800
engaging in approximate vision inference

1103
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,359
so so this

1104
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,280
this statement basically has all these

1105
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,280
features that we kind of want from an

1106
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,839
agent identification

1107
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,200
theory because

1108
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,880
it tells us that if we have this

1109
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,000
under these conditions

1110
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,760
and by naming these variables in this

1111
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,480
way then

1112
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,599
we see that these

1113
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,240
i mean it basically it it makes sense to

1114
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,040
name these

1115
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,319
variables in this way because

1116
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,000
they we have um some kind of goal

1117
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,160
the goal is to to resist dispersion of

1118
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,520
the mark of blankets so basically it's

1119
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,839
the goal is kind of persistence

1120
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,839
and uh the agent

1121
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,640
acts uh to pursue this goal because it

1122
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,839
actively resists

1123
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,640
this dispersion

1124
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,720
um yeah and it is individuated because

1125
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,720
we have this uh we know which states

1126
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,319
belong to it and which states basically

1127
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,000
don't belong to it if this distinction

1128
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,119
between external and internal

1129
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,760
um yeah and then additionally which is

1130
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,440
also kind of nice that this whole

1131
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,520
this agent is also doing some kind of

1132
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,760
approximate vision inference which

1133
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,200
is a bonus i guess

1134
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,640
so um this is why i

1135
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,599
i say that uh the fep

1136
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,880
basically is contains a theory of agent

1137
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,160
identification

1138
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,040
and um

1139
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,040
yeah and this is yeah and this is also

1140
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,520
the

1141
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,119
this is basically the part that

1142
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,559
interests me the most about the

1143
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,839
free energy principle

1144
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,800
it's yeah okay it's kind of uh

1145
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,960
maybe a unique selling point compared to

1146
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,079
all other

1147
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,119
kinds of uh

1148
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,160
to to most other approaches to

1149
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,839
constructing art

1150
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,480
artificial agents and it's also i mean

1151
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,680
there are not many

1152
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,000
there are not many agent identification

1153
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,760
theories

1154
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,319
that i know

1155
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,880
and i actually hope that i i know all of

1156
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,160
them but

1157
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,359
uh yeah actually yeah it's quite uh

1158
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:56,078
these aren't common okay um

1159
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,839
yeah i said what this i said this okay

1160
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,520
yeah so in summary we just make three

1161
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,040
assumptions we say

1162
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,079
ah some subsystem has lagerman dynamics

1163
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,680
it has a steady state distribution and

1164
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,119
it has a markov banklet

1165
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,240
and return we have identified an agent

1166
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,880
um

1167
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,598
yeah nice sounds good

1168
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,160
okay so let me uh

1169
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,200
is there any question up to now there's

1170
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:33,839
a few more

1171
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,160
general ones but feel free to continue

1172
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,520
and we'll get them i think at the end

1173
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,000
because

1174
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,839
this next section will probably be very

1175
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,440
helpful

1176
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,040
okay so so now

1177
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,319
um let's talk about what the relation

1178
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,119
between this

1179
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,760
fep asian construction and the fep agent

1180
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,440
identification

1181
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,440
parts of the feb literature

1182
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,160
are according to the fvp literature

1183
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,118
uh so

1184
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,920
the these i kind of said this already

1185
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,319
but

1186
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,319
uh the thing that makes uh fep

1187
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,000
or active inference those are actually

1188
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,960
the same thing

1189
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,200
as far as i know agent special

1190
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,839
is that

1191
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,960
not two things or at least two things i

1192
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,359
mean

1193
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:32,000
there might be more but i think these

1194
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,800
are the main ones

1195
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,680
or the most important ones at least

1196
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,000
these

1197
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,119
fep agents that constructed the

1198
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,200
constructed fvp agents

1199
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,319
that i talked about before

1200
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,359
they can be seen as kind of a plausible

1201
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,400
or used

1202
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,240
they are used kind of as a plausible

1203
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,319
model in neuroscience

1204
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,319
and this is related to predictive coding

1205
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,880
and the patient brain

1206
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,359
but i actually i'm not qualified to talk

1207
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,359
about this because i don't know

1208
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,880
enough about neuroscience uh but the

1209
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
other thing that makes them special

1210
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,160
is the one of the main points

1211
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,160
i mean of this talk is that uh

1212
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,240
they are claimed to be based on first

1213
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,839
principles

1214
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,960
and when this statement that they are

1215
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,960
based on first principles

1216
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,599
actually means uh refers exactly to this

1217
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,240
this uh fap agent identification method

1218
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,920
so the first principles are basically

1219
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,079
what i just

1220
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,680
uh talked about that the

1221
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,839
larger equation and the steady state and

1222
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,960
the markov

1223
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,559
blanket gives you this agent

1224
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,319
so let's uh in order to

1225
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,559
make sure we're not putting words into

1226
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,000
the mouth of the literature

1227
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,200
let's read this quote once that's from

1228
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,400
the

1229
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,040
also sophisticated inference paper that

1230
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,759
just came out

1231
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,359
the key distinction is that base

1232
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,280
adaptive reinforcement learning

1233
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,280
considers arbitrary reward functions

1234
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,520
while sophisticated active inference

1235
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,960
optimizes an expected free energy that

1236
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,720
can be motivated from first principles

1237
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,640
okay actually here it doesn't say based

1238
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,040
but actually in another like you can

1239
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,839
look at

1240
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:33,680
this paper and um

1241
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,440
in another place it says based on first

1242
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,760
principles and also this is not

1243
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,599
only this is not only mentioned for the

1244
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,960
sophisticated active

1245
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,359
insurance agents you will see similar

1246
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,319
statements

1247
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:50,640
in the literature in other places

1248
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,319
so this is i mean this is kind of

1249
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,799
in some way it's super cool if it's true

1250
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,839
i think

1251
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,280
but i'm not so sure it's true um

1252
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,400
okay so some notes

1253
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,280
yeah okay so

1254
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,400
so this is about

1255
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,200
whether actually this how important is

1256
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,359
that is this

1257
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,280
how important is it for the constructed

1258
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,359
agents to be based on these first

1259
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,520
principles

1260
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,520
so in this also in the sophisticated

1261
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:37,520
inference paper the authors say that

1262
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,200
the agents expected free energy

1263
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,240
expected free energy

1264
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,440
which is the thing they minimize can be

1265
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,680
motivated from first place

1266
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,520
principles but they also

1267
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,440
seem to say that the expected free

1268
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,359
energy can also be

1269
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,520
i mean yeah actually i mean they say in

1270
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,119
in one place they say that it can also

1271
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,680
be motivated via information gain

1272
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:09,200
don't and they or

1273
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,880
i mean there's there's one part that

1274
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,880
this refers to so

1275
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,960
as far as i understand it they are

1276
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,359
there's a there are two ways to motivate

1277
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,440
this expected free energy minimization

1278
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,960
and one is

1279
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,359
via these first principles and one is

1280
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,319
via

1281
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,480
some other derivation that involves

1282
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,119
information

1283
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,280
now i wouldn't say i understand these

1284
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,400
derivations

1285
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,760
this direction completely but

1286
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,280
i do know that there's a paper by cohen

1287
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,520
and hotter and they show that

1288
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,640
if you that there's a

1289
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,119
that that basically some combination of

1290
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,400
information gain and reward maximization

1291
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,520
uh is you can prove that it's optimal in

1292
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,880
some sense

1293
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,440
so since this expected free energy

1294
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,200
is kind of a combination of those two

1295
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
things

1296
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,680
i kind of think let's put it this way

1297
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,960
i'm not surprised that

1298
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,720
it has it shows good performance or

1299
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,480
something like this because maybe it's

1300
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,319
actually so closely related to

1301
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,720
the method by cone that it just works

1302
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,480
so all i'm saying i guess what i want to

1303
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,240
say here is that

1304
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,920
in case the motivation via first

1305
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,599
principles

1306
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,799
fails uh

1307
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:41,920
the fep construction of agents may still

1308
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,000
be of interest and might still work

1309
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,400
and this also means that all these all

1310
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,160
publications

1311
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,520
i think there are some but yeah i think

1312
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,240
there may be

1313
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,680
quite a few all these publications that

1314
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,520
uh that are basically based on this

1315
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,240
expected free energy minimizing agents

1316
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,520
they they need not be without merit just

1317
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,599
because the

1318
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,839
first principle's motivation failed

1319
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,280
so um or in other words

1320
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,760
they can still they they can still make

1321
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,040
as much sense

1322
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,559
basically even if this uh free energy

1323
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,319
principle agent identification is wrong

1324
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,960
if i could ask a question here martin um

1325
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,760
yeah what

1326
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,920
what kind of first principles are you

1327
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,119
most interested in

1328
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,440
and then what kind of a theory of agents

1329
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,559
or agency

1330
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,880
would be satisfying given your interest

1331
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,680
in first principles

1332
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,720
yeah i mean i i i think so

1333
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,839
so if you

1334
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,079
see i'm interested in the first

1335
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,040
principles that work

1336
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,400
i don't know what the first principles

1337
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,240
are but like

1338
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,799
maybe one one first principle is that

1339
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:12,319
you can start from physics

1340
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,960
like that's like you can you you start

1341
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,839
with some

1342
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,319
well i don't know where five to go up

1343
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:19,839
yeah something like this

1344
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,839
you start with a dynamical system and

1345
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,839
you then

1346
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,400
derive using only

1347
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,640
notions that are well defined for

1348
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,319
dynamical systems

1349
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,520
or within such dynamical systems

1350
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,359
um to show

1351
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,640
that uh this thing this

1352
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,359
system contains agents or not or yeah so

1353
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:53,200
i guess the first principles for

1354
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,400
the first principles here are that

1355
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:01,680
okay all we have to believe is

1356
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,960
that there are such subsystems that

1357
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,799
obey the larger equation and

1358
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:11,440
i guess since the larger equation has

1359
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,319
been quite

1360
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:15,599
uh popular in physics

1361
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,960
um it has this has this

1362
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,319
this this has some strong support um

1363
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:24,799
and maybe that's sufficient to be your

1364
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,559
first principal

1365
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,280
uh also having steady state

1366
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,520
is fine it's well defined there's no i

1367
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,720
mean that's a mathematically

1368
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,760
well-defined thing we can

1369
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,319
in principle check this

1370
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,319
so yeah then

1371
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,319
the other thing that's used in the

1372
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:54,000
literature is the markov blanket

1373
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,319
and i think that's also yeah it's a

1374
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,760
it could be a well-defined thing um

1375
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,680
i think it's a bit of a like

1376
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,520
what it means in the fvp literature

1377
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,400
is kind of not it's not really clear and

1378
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,440
it changes

1379
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,079
and maybe has to change again but

1380
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,359
at least the original so if yeah it

1381
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:24,880
depends a bit um

1382
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,240
yeah i guess i have to i would have to

1383
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,839
show a bit more about the

1384
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,598
um

1385
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,680
markov blanket but yeah i would say

1386
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,640
i yeah for first principles for me means

1387
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,559
probably just that you have to be able

1388
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,520
to define it for

1389
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,799
uh dynamic assist it has to be like all

1390
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,480
the notions you use you can only use

1391
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,160
notions that are defined

1392
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,039
for dynamical systems totally makes

1393
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,640
sense it's like if you're going to play

1394
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,039
the game of dynamical systems analysis

1395
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,880
you can only use those

1396
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,160
rules exactly

1397
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,960
you can only yeah exactly you have to

1398
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,400
you have to construct everything from

1399
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:14,799
there

1400
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,720
now you don't get anything else that's

1401
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,280
it you get the dynamical system

1402
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,640
uh and that's it yeah

1403
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,839
okay uh

1404
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:35,118
oh suspense boss

1405
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,400
yep that's where i was now

1406
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,440
yep i said this need not be there

1407
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,640
yep okay so now oh

1408
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,799
okay so that's uh a big part of the talk

1409
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,799
that's kind of that was kind of my

1410
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,200
personal

1411
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,440
my current personal view on what's

1412
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,520
yeah and how i yeah how i look at the

1413
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,640
fvp literature

1414
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,000
and what yeah how i split it up like i

1415
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,720
said and

1416
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,240
uh yeah so now

1417
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,000
i would go and talk about

1418
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,880
basically the issues i see with this uh

1419
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,760
fep

1420
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,000
agent identification method but if

1421
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,280
there's any questions now

1422
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,520
might be what's a good point

1423
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,920
that's it for now um definitely after

1424
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,520
this we'll see if anyone has any

1425
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,039
questions but feel free to type them in

1426
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,839
the live chat if anyone has it

1427
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,880
okay so the first issue i have is that

1428
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,039
this markov blanket assumption is

1429
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,119
known to be insufficient

1430
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,880
uh by now it's known to be insufficient

1431
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,760
maybe in the

1432
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,200
maybe at the for the very first paper it

1433
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,880
wasn't known to be

1434
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,559
insufficient or actually yeah for the

1435
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,799
first two papers maybe

1436
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,839
no yeah i don't know

1437
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,480
yeah yeah i can't really say because it

1438
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,160
wasn't me

1439
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,240
but yeah you know it's it's it's fair to

1440
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,280
say that uh

1441
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,119
the first two papers they might not have

1442
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:22,400
known

1443
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,599
this okay uh

1444
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:29,119
yeah so so so i'm gonna kind of go

1445
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:29,920
through the

1446
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,920
markov blanket evolution a little bit

1447
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,039
not not not in any detail but

1448
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,839
the mark of blanket evolution in the fep

1449
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:40,400
literature

1450
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,400
um maybe i should say

1451
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,559
like originally i did i think i don't

1452
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,880
have this here

1453
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,920
uh i mentioned it down there okay

1454
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,000
so originally the the turmark of blanket

1455
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,400
comes from judea pearl

1456
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,880
from this 1988 book

1457
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,119
yeah so it's a it's a technical

1458
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:10,880
uh term

1459
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,799
that had a definition before it was used

1460
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,960
by the fap literature

1461
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,960
okay so and in this in this original

1462
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,119
paper the life as we know it

1463
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,039
there is actually no definition of like

1464
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,160
there's no no

1465
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,319
it's nowhere clear it's it's not clearly

1466
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:25,359
said what

1467
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,240
is meant what kind of markov blanket is

1468
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:28,960
meant

1469
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,079
i mean there's some kind of graph

1470
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,079
but markov blankets are

1471
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,640
come from directed acyclic grass and the

1472
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,880
graph is cyclic so it's actually not

1473
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,920
clear what is meant i mean there is

1474
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,200
but it's clearly stated that the markov

1475
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,680
blanket

1476
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,079
should imply this equation

1477
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,280
that the vector field

1478
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,280
when we split it up into the four

1479
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,920
coordinates

1480
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,480
also actually so it kind of implies also

1481
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,760
that there are these four

1482
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,240
we can split up the the coordinate into

1483
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:10,880
four

1484
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,280
sets of all the coordinates into four

1485
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,920
sets of corners

1486
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,920
and um the vector field then

1487
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,359
has can be uh has

1488
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:28,319
a certain shape form

1489
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:32,319
namely that the internal

1490
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,920
and sensory states do not um

1491
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,799
the the vector the vector field

1492
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:39,520
components

1493
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,839
of the internal and sensor sensory

1494
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,080
states do not

1495
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,520
directly depend on the internal states

1496
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,158
and the vector field components of the

1497
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:51,600
action and x

1498
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,960
action active and internal states do not

1499
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,759
depend directly on the external states

1500
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,279
maybe i said something wrong but yeah

1501
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,319
and we call this the so we we

1502
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,158
we call this the vector field condition

1503
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:09,359
or

1504
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,198
or yeah i mean i call this the vector

1505
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,198
field condition because it's a condition

1506
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,040
on the vector field

1507
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,560
and in our paper this is condition one

1508
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,359
okay so this is kind of i think in life

1509
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:22,719
as we know it this is kind of

1510
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,479
this is the only uh real

1511
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:31,278
play is where uh

1512
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,799
the markov blanket plays a role and by

1513
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,799
the way this is not a mark of blanket

1514
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,640
i mean not a technically this isn't a

1515
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,319
microphone i mean this isn't

1516
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,759
a pearlian markov blanket's condition

1517
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,198
um then

1518
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:50,319
in uh at least

1519
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:55,279
in in thomas past paper in 2020

1520
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,360
the markov blanket is said to imply

1521
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,480
this condition the

1522
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:07,920
independence of the external states

1523
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,400
given the blanket states which are the

1524
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,400
sensory and the action states so we get

1525
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,840
this factorization of the stationary

1526
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,199
or steady state distribution

1527
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,560
and that's also considered a condition

1528
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,719
of the markov blanket

1529
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:28,080
this thing is also implicit

1530
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:32,159
in the this condition is also implicit

1531
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:35,679
in the free energy

1532
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,679
principle for particular physics

1533
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:41,840
but it's not explicitly referred to as

1534
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,360
the mark of naked so it's a bit weird

1535
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,080
but um

1536
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,640
this is actually a markov blanket in the

1537
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,000
sense of

1538
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,400
judy airport so this condition is a true

1539
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,040
mark of

1540
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,800
markov link and it has

1541
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,320
come to be called not only by me

1542
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,840
uh the time synchronous thinkerness

1543
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,719
markov blanket condition and in our

1544
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,880
paper this is condition two

1545
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,760
those two conditions this one and

1546
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,800
condition one

1547
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,360
they are independent of each other like

1548
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,480
you they are systems that obey this one

1549
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,040
and not this one and system the systems

1550
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,239
that obey this one

1551
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,120
and not this one

1552
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,120
and those systems are not

1553
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,840
complicated they are actually linear

1554
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,440
systems so they are these orange time

1555
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,440
own background

1556
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,719
processes where you can easily compute

1557
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:37,520
this

1558
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,679
stationary distribution and it's a

1559
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:40,880
gaussian

1560
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,560
so you can look this up in the in the

1561
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,320
paper

1562
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,719
and i think i think one of the i mean

1563
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,719
like this is wired speculation but

1564
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,880
um i think that uh

1565
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,880
the the authors

1566
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,040
or carl fristen because he's the only

1567
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:03,679
author

1568
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:06,880
uh kind of thought that this

1569
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,199
equate that this condition implies this

1570
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,320
condition i think

1571
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,320
it seems to me there are various reasons

1572
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
but it's kind of like i'm not going to

1573
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,719
go into it but yeah this

1574
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,840
seems to me the case and maybe you could

1575
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,600
think i mean i can like you could think

1576
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,400
this i mean

1577
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,759
it's not completely out of the

1578
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,759
question but yeah

1579
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:37,440
so then um we wrote we wrote this paper

1580
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,320
uh after we wrote this paper here in

1581
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,040
2019

1582
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,519
and complained about some

1583
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,880
some uh

1584
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,920
thing in the some things in the

1585
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,159
um

1586
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,199
free energy prince principle for a

1587
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,199
particular physics

1588
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,599
paper

1589
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,480
namely this thing called the conditional

1590
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,800
independence corollary

1591
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,080
which is supposed to follow from the

1592
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,199
vector field condition i think

1593
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,480
um is the i mean i think that's the

1594
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,799
claim

1595
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,360
but we showed that it doesn't and so

1596
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,239
then

1597
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,440
the markov blanket or then

1598
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,400
there an an additional condition was uh

1599
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,600
presented

1600
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,800
in this paper called

1601
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:46,159
uh some interesting observations about

1602
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:48,880
the free energy principle or something

1603
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,520
this is the response to our paper and

1604
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,400
this condition is that the

1605
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,920
solenoidal component

1606
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:03,600
matrix r or q has this shape

1607
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,840
okay that's why i mean i'm going to call

1608
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,440
this the sony needle condition

1609
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,840
if i ever need it again in this talk but

1610
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,159
okay

1611
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,400
yeah since this came out after i mean

1612
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,000
this was in response to our paper so we

1613
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,280
don't really talk about this

1614
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,960
um okay so

1615
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,960
this is just some additional condition

1616
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,120
uh and then i think so

1617
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:33,280
yeah so you can kind of see all of these

1618
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,320
like these conditions are all used in

1619
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:44,320
to derive this statement here that

1620
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,520
that this statement here

1621
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,840
the fep agent identification method

1622
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,120
basically

1623
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,599
that you get to identify

1624
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,760
that we actually get we can identify an

1625
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,400
agent that

1626
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,360
actively

1627
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,719
acts 2 that that acts to uh persists

1628
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,800
basically with the goal of

1629
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,719
systems okay so we have this

1630
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:25,360
this condition as well and then in

1631
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,040
in par in the thomas past paper

1632
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,480
and also in the monograph

1633
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,239
if we look closely there is actually an

1634
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,000
additional assumption made

1635
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,600
um in the free energy principle for

1636
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,040
particular physics it's

1637
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,640
claimed to be a consequence

1638
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,719
of the other conditions but that's not

1639
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,840
true um

1640
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,600
uh we can show this it's kind of easy uh

1641
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,560
and in in the par paper it's it's uh

1642
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,280
actually said that it's an assumption

1643
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,400
so i've known that this is an additional

1644
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,280
assumption

1645
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,880
and this assumption is that there's some

1646
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,199
function sigma

1647
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,840
and this function sigma relates to

1648
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,640
variables

1649
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,480
and these two variables are

1650
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,159
the most likely

1651
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:29,440
external state both beta given the

1652
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,360
blanket states sna and the most likely

1653
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,400
internal state

1654
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,760
given the blanket state sna

1655
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,840
according to the stationary distribution

1656
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,120
the steady state distribution

1657
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,600
and the and so sigma is uh

1658
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,080
the assumption is that that that there

1659
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:50,719
exists

1660
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:54,719
a function sigma that maps one that maps

1661
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:58,159
the most likely internal state to the

1662
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:03,120
most likely external state

1663
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,159
um and

1664
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,000
that that this function doesn't need to

1665
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,719
exist you can see

1666
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,400
for example i mean it's it's not in our

1667
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,560
paper i think we should have probably

1668
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,840
put it in our paper but

1669
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,239
we didn't

1670
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,239
account example is uh you can use

1671
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:29,600
basically the system we pro we show in

1672
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,520
appendix d

1673
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,920
and then we show one of those linear

1674
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,560
linear systems again and for this

1675
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,760
the bold mu is just

1676
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,360
one half a

1677
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,280
and the both eta is one half s

1678
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,679
and since s of t is not a function of a

1679
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:57,120
of t

1680
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,120
and basically uh so they are kind of

1681
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,199
so every combination of s and t can

1682
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:04,640
occur so there is no

1683
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,120
functional relation between the two and

1684
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,800
that means there also cannot be

1685
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,080
cannot be any function sigma

1686
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,199
um so so

1687
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:16,560
this means we kind of have to

1688
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,239
additionally assume sigma

1689
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,280
and also yeah yeah

1690
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,840
it and the thing is in my opinion this

1691
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,960
sigma might actually be a much stronger

1692
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,400
the strongest of all of these

1693
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,719
assumptions

1694
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:34,560
that are made like stronger than any

1695
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,320
of the other conditions here these other

1696
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,239
three conditions the vector field the

1697
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,679
tsnbc and the

1698
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:43,280
traditional and the solenoidal condition

1699
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,600
i think it does probably the most work

1700
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,440
but since i don't really understand the

1701
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,480
whole

1702
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,159
picture i can't really self-care for

1703
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,230
sure but

1704
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:53,520
[Music]

1705
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,239
so yeah we'll just just start on that um

1706
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,400
sigma is sort of the proposed function

1707
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,640
that's literally linking

1708
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,960
internal and external states so when

1709
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,400
we're talking about agents

1710
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,679
and the way that their internal

1711
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,320
generative model is being linked to

1712
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,000
generative processes in the outside

1713
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,159
world that's like the key link that's

1714
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:14,000
what we're all about so i totally

1715
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,560
i totally see where you're coming from

1716
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,679
exactly

1717
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,280
that's a good yeah that's a good way to

1718
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,199
say it exactly i mean

1719
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,800
yeah i think i will i will say this

1720
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,480
later again but

1721
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,440
let me just say it here already these

1722
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,360
three conditions

1723
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,719
they are all trivially satisfied by four

1724
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,159
independent stochastic processes

1725
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,760
so like it seems

1726
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,120
uh kind of

1727
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:46,400
unrealistic let's put it this way that

1728
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,480
any of these conditions by themselves or

1729
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,960
even their combination

1730
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,080
would be sufficient to

1731
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:01,600
give us this kind of active

1732
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,840
active resisting to anything it's like

1733
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,280
or modeling

1734
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,639
of the environment or um

1735
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:10,400
asian inference about the environment

1736
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,719
because

1737
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,480
four independent stochastic processes

1738
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,120
don't seem to i mean like it would be

1739
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,639
hard to argue that

1740
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,199
any of those is doing anything he's

1741
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,040
modeling any of the other ones

1742
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:29,040
so uh yeah exactly this is um

1743
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,800
but if you have such a then yeah then

1744
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,000
yeah there might be something going on

1745
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,320
okay so in summary we have these four

1746
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,840
conditions the vector field condition

1747
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,560
the t as

1748
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,679
mbc the sony recognition and the sigma

1749
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,840
function existence

1750
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,760
and i would say maybe call

1751
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,400
those the fep blanket together but okay

1752
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,520
okay here i say this now apart from the

1753
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,040
sigma function all the conditions are

1754
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,120
satisfied by four independent linear

1755
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,960
stochastic processes with gaussian white

1756
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,280
noise

1757
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:12,719
yeah so oh probably sigma is the most

1758
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,159
significant assumption

1759
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:19,120
and yeah i mean it's maybe a petty point

1760
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:19,760
but

1761
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,120
i kind of think that calling the

1762
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,639
combination of these conditions markov

1763
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:23,280
blanket

1764
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:27,120
is at least i mean by

1765
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,120
by now it is definitely misleading i

1766
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,880
mean i think the use of this word

1767
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,840
microfling it was

1768
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,360
misleading before but i think

1769
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,120
uh it should probably be dropped

1770
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,280
but anyway i'm gonna call it fep blanket

1771
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,639
oh sorry this is

1772
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,880
so and one more thing i am not

1773
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,199
i i cannot say that these conditions

1774
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,120
these four conditions together together

1775
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,520
are sufficient for

1776
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,719
uh the whole

1777
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:05,280
fep agent identification argument

1778
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,600
uh just because i don't really i haven't

1779
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,199
really

1780
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:12,320
gotten through the whole thing but

1781
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,679
we know um that they

1782
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:18,639
are necessary i mean they are used in

1783
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:19,120
these

1784
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:24,800
uh arguments okay

1785
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,120
so that's the first that was the first

1786
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,440
issue

1787
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,920
how am i doing in time actually it's

1788
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,040
like already super long

1789
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,000
you can go for as long as you want and

1790
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,040
we can

1791
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,199
go as long as you want already at one

1792
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,839
hour on twitch

1793
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,320
you can go as long as you want today

1794
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,239
martin and then we can always schedule

1795
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:48,800
another

1796
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,719
time to speak but this is really really

1797
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:52,000
helpful and i'm sure that a lot of

1798
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,600
people are gonna digest it and have a

1799
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,400
lot to talk to you about

1800
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,199
okay okay then i'm just gonna i'm just

1801
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:00,080
kind of taking

1802
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:05,120
okay all right next one

1803
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,880
uh this point is not in our paper um

1804
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,520
i guess it has been in the back of our

1805
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,600
heads but i mean yeah i think it's

1806
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,920
it's really also it's become much more

1807
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,600
uh

1808
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,679
i've become much more convinced about it

1809
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,040
and yeah so i'm gonna

1810
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,400
just mention it uh and i think the

1811
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,239
it would yeah i think it's a kind of

1812
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,959
challenge to the

1813
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,760
fep community maybe

1814
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,360
and i kind of there if i yeah

1815
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,040
i think they are kind of aware of this

1816
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,920
by now also

1817
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,679
so the thing is that there is no example

1818
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:48,960
for which

1819
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,239
all of the fep blanket conditions the

1820
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:53,520
four i just mentioned the four

1821
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,239
conditions i mentioned

1822
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,360
have been proven to hold so

1823
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,239
we don't know any longer an equation

1824
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:02,560
that

1825
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,800
obeys all of these conditions

1826
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,560
oh actually i forgot the steady state

1827
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,000
maybe it should be but yeah

1828
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,040
there's no longer an equation with a

1829
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,710
steady state that obeys those

1830
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:20,080
[Music]

1831
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,360
so what this means is

1832
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:28,960
we don't even know if there's any system

1833
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,520
uh that the fep identification method

1834
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,400
applies to

1835
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:38,719
or that this statement that uh

1836
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,520
in very short that that the fvp blanket

1837
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,840
implies

1838
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,520
uh an agent

1839
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,700
that this is

1840
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,480
[Music]

1841
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,719
like we don't know that there's a system

1842
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:55,840
for which this is true

1843
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,960
so this also means we cannot we can

1844
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,880
never

1845
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,960
check like there's no system we could

1846
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,400
look at and check if

1847
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,840
there is actually something doing

1848
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,440
bayesian inference and in what way it's

1849
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,400
doing it

1850
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,840
and that it's actively resisting

1851
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,560
dispersion

1852
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,159
so this is kind of uh

1853
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,280
it's it's not there yeah i mean like it

1854
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,880
would be kind of

1855
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,320
cool to like so in some way this says

1856
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,080
the whole markov blanket story

1857
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,840
or yeah the whole as i call it fvp

1858
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,800
agent identification story might not

1859
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,560
might be vacuous

1860
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,600
like this is what this says and i

1861
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,880
i think it's kind of a serious point and

1862
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,960
it should be

1863
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,159
addressed i think okay so maybe some

1864
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:48,960
notes on this

1865
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:53,360
uh so there's this primary audio soup

1866
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,280
example in the original paper and it's

1867
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:55,840
used

1868
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,920
i mean the life as we know it and it's

1869
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,639
also used in the monograph

1870
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:02,880
but there's no proof that this thing has

1871
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,159
a steady state or that this steady state

1872
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:10,000
or base the gsmbc the

1873
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,199
time synchronous markov blanket

1874
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,800
um and also of course there's no proof

1875
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:17,360
that it

1876
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,199
has a sigma function because in life as

1877
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:20,960
we know it there wasn't even any sigma

1878
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,840
function

1879
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,760
also this uh

1880
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,600
like you could say maybe the constructed

1881
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,180
fep agents are systems that

1882
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:35,600
[Music]

1883
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,080
obey all these conditions but and then i

1884
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,560
mean maybe there are even some of them

1885
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,239
but this connection is never made

1886
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,400
explicitly like it's always just

1887
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,159
there's this claim that they are based

1888
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,000
on this

1889
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,760
uh on these first principles and this

1890
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,000
all of this but

1891
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,360
um it's never shown for example that the

1892
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,920
agent environment combination which

1893
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:58,480
forms

1894
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:02,159
this markov process that it has a steady

1895
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,239
state distribution

1896
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:07,440
and it's actually very unlikely

1897
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,120
that in all of them it has a steady

1898
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,920
state distribution

1899
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,199
and actually you can kind of like i will

1900
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,040
argue that it's actually

1901
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,040
not true definitely not for all of them

1902
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,120
and also even if uh

1903
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,360
this agent environment pair would have a

1904
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,679
steady state distribution

1905
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,120
we would still

1906
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,679
want to see that it obeys the tsnbc

1907
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,679
and also that is kind of question

1908
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,560
so i should mention that this this is

1909
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,239
like the second point

1910
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:51,760
that checking that the tsnbc holds uh

1911
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,800
is an idea that's by nathaniel virgo

1912
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,719
and uh yeah there's some arguments about

1913
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,199
it but i won't go further into it

1914
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,440
um

1915
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,000
the so furthermore it is never

1916
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,840
checked like we never look at the sigma

1917
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,080
function which appears to place a

1918
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,360
significant role

1919
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,800
but we never look at this signal

1920
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,960
function in these constructed

1921
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:20,320
uh fvp agents

1922
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,840
um what what is kind of

1923
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,280
what i'm pretty sure that it says is

1924
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,960
satisfied in a reasonable way is the

1925
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,679
vector field condition

1926
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,920
okay

1927
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,920
yeah and maybe this

1928
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,840
i don't really know why i say this here

1929
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,840
but

1930
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:49,120
yeah like the ah okay so you could you

1931
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,719
could yeah okay so so you could

1932
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:54,159
maybe so since me and felix

1933
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:55,679
we use the launch onscreen openback

1934
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,480
processes to show various

1935
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,600
uh things about um

1936
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,960
the free energy principle and we

1937
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,040
we know that it satisfies

1938
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,679
quite a few of like it satisfies uh

1939
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,040
three of these assumptions

1940
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,800
so it satisfies the vector field

1941
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,480
condition we can make it so that it

1942
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,360
satisfies the tsnbc and this solenoidal

1943
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,280
condition

1944
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,719
but there is no such system like

1945
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:28,400
so basically i'm like if you want to

1946
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,159
there's no such system that has a sigma

1947
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:31,760
function so if you wanted to

1948
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,600
search for an einstein openback process

1949
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,560
that obeys that is basically an

1950
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,120
existence proof then i can tell you

1951
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,679
it's impossible so this proof is kind of

1952
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,120
unpublished but

1953
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:49,440
uh and it's uh mostly due to fedex but

1954
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,719
uh yeah maybe maybe i'm gonna maybe

1955
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,159
you're gonna put it on archive

1956
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,159
at some point it's really not

1957
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,560
complicated

1958
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,920
um okay so that's this

1959
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,040
point now i want to make also

1960
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:10,320
another point that is not in our paper

1961
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,880
and then we're going to slowly get to

1962
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,480
the end because the last point isn't

1963
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,920
very

1964
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,320
substantial okay so

1965
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,679
yeah what i want to say is that there

1966
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:24,320
are agents in the fep literature

1967
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,799
for which

1968
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,280
the

1969
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,600
the system that they are contained in so

1970
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,239
if we form the environment

1971
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:40,639
if we look at the environment and the

1972
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:41,920
agent in combination

1973
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,320
as a markov process what i talked about

1974
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:48,159
in the very beginning

1975
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:51,360
then and and the

1976
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,800
the agent is this uh fep

1977
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,199
agent

1978
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,719
then for some of them it's

1979
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,920
straightforward to show that they that

1980
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:06,400
this

1981
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,639
combination this combine this resulting

1982
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,320
markov process

1983
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,440
does not have a steady state

1984
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,960
and the first thing to note is that if

1985
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,360
you have some kind of some monogamously

1986
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,320
increasing counter

1987
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:23,440
it can never so if your state contains a

1988
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:23,920
mono

1989
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,639
monotonously increasing counter it means

1990
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:28,480
you can never return to a previous state

1991
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,960
and this means you cannot have a state

1992
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,320
state

1993
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,280
because the states are not recurrent and

1994
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,239
that means

1995
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:39,280
there is no steady state

1996
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,840
so as i mentioned before

1997
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,000
the internal state the internal agent

1998
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,960
state of

1999
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:51,199
uh fep agents are hyper parameters

2000
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:54,639
and are updated uh using bayesian

2001
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:55,199
inference

2002
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:57,120
variation of bayesian inference but that

2003
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,840
also

2004
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:04,080
includes exact patient inference

2005
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,440
and so these hyper parameters of x exact

2006
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,480
bayesian inference

2007
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:11,760
they accumulate evidence which means

2008
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,080
they

2009
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:16,480
count occurrences of events

2010
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:20,400
and they only count up

2011
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,239
and they count every and for every event

2012
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,560
they count something

2013
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,760
so they are counters that always that

2014
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,800
are

2015
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,080
monotonously increasing

2016
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,560
and for example in the sophisticated

2017
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,440
inference paper days if you look at

2018
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,000
equation

2019
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,679
4.5 there is one there is an explicit

2020
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:46,719
uh equation for the updating

2021
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,520
of one of the parameters which counts

2022
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,679
the occurrences of transitions from

2023
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,120
expected environment states to

2024
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,679
observations

2025
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:59,440
and no such counter can be contained

2026
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,480
within any markov chain that has a

2027
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,840
steady state

2028
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,440
so this means that this

2029
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,199
agent this particular agent in the

2030
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:12,159
sophisticated inference paper

2031
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:15,679
is not within

2032
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:20,639
such a system that has a steady state

2033
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:24,970
so it's not within a system that

2034
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:26,239
[Music]

2035
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:30,239
a subsystem it cannot exist within a

2036
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,840
subsystem

2037
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:36,000
that obeys the conditions of the

2038
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,880
fap aged identification okay

2039
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,880
so uh this

2040
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,920
so be be aware that this statement also

2041
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,719
is not published uh but i kind of want

2042
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,000
to

2043
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,840
put it out there because it would be

2044
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,280
boring if i just talk about

2045
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,400
that's already published and um

2046
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,880
so but they i mean like there's some

2047
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,440
caution advice what i think but

2048
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,600
if you want to look at this at a very

2049
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,280
simple example of this

2050
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:12,159
uh i published a paper last year on this

2051
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,080
um and so i'm pretty sure and this

2052
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,000
it seems pretty straightforward this

2053
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,400
argument

2054
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,760
and then one more thing there so in this

2055
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,920
paper sophisticated inference also

2056
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:29,920
there is some argument about steady

2057
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,520
state

2058
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,040
the appendix a2

2059
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,239
but that steady state just kind of just

2060
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,760
it ignores the internal state of the

2061
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,760
agent it only looks at the other

2062
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:46,159
variables so i think and

2063
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:48,080
i think that's actually necessary like

2064
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,760
there's just no steady state if you

2065
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,719
include the internal state of the age

2066
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:57,199
so maybe be aware of this and uh

2067
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,280
yeah the two consequences of this are

2068
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,719
that

2069
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,880
um fep agents

2070
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,320
are not identified by the fep agent

2071
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,840
identification

2072
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,320
method and the and this also means that

2073
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,520
the fep

2074
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,960
agents cannot be motivated

2075
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:25,679
by this uh fvp agent identification or

2076
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,320
or by first principles because they

2077
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,119
actually violate these first principles

2078
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:34,320
or in this case at least this particular

2079
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:34,560
age

2080
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,840
okay uh i think that was yeah

2081
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,480
that was this point the last point is

2082
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:40,880
kind of

2083
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,600
uh a bit nitpicky but i think it's also

2084
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,440
kind of important for some people

2085
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,719
and that is that this uh identification

2086
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:49,360
method

2087
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,159
is changing in the literature and you

2088
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:53,040
shouldn't think

2089
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,520
for example that the original life as we

2090
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,840
know it

2091
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:01,199
a paper cons contains a method that's

2092
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:02,800
very similar to the neurons

2093
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,520
i mean the these constructions of the

2094
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,840
most likely internal and external states

2095
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,080
they don't appear there is no sigma

2096
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,480
function

2097
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,080
but in the later versions these things

2098
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,760
these constructions play essential roles

2099
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,480
so these two they are two completely

2100
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,839
different methods in

2101
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,400
okay and and yeah one of these things we

2102
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,080
did in our paper is we showed that this

2103
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,520
original method

2104
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,199
in life as we know it is kind of wrong

2105
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,520
but oh

2106
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,280
wow where did i go this was

2107
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:45,599
end so

2108
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,920
okay don't worry we're not gonna look at

2109
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:53,840
all these slides

2110
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:58,239
uh okay here we are

2111
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,320
okay so we we kind of looked at this and

2112
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,760
we think it's it's wrong

2113
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,560
uh at least the way it stated um

2114
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,560
and yeah okay so so be aware that

2115
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,040
if you look at this method like don't

2116
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,239
maybe maybe just

2117
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,560
ignore the life as we know in paper

2118
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,119
that's maybe what i want to say

2119
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:23,280
and also like you can't tell from the

2120
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:26,000
literature that

2121
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,639
this method is uh very different i mean

2122
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:29,679
it's kind of

2123
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:32,560
they never say why they changed it and

2124
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,199
it's

2125
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,920
kind of still repre like still mentioned

2126
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,040
as the basis of

2127
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:41,679
these things so be aware it's kind of

2128
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:43,199
maybe it's a waste of time reading this

2129
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:44,880
paper

2130
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,880
okay that's it uh

2131
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,440
in summary what i said is that we can

2132
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,199
separate the

2133
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:56,400
literature into agent identification

2134
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,800
fep agent identification and afep agent

2135
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,440
construction

2136
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,560
and that the fep agent identification

2137
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:05,119
method

2138
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:07,760
requires significantly more assumptions

2139
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,960
than just

2140
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,040
whatever the mark of blanket was in the

2141
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,519
beginning

2142
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:19,840
uh that this uh agent identification

2143
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,159
method misses an example that would

2144
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:23,360
prove

2145
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:28,080
that it that such systems actually exist

2146
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:32,560
such systems with agents that systems

2147
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,400
with such agents actually exist

2148
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,880
and it requires a steady state

2149
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,600
that at least some of the fvp agents

2150
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,880
definitely don't satisfy

2151
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,040
the method has changed from its original

2152
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:54,239
but also note it could still be correct

2153
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:56,320
i don't know like maybe there are enough

2154
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,080
assumptions you can make and maybe they

2155
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,119
are still systems that contain such

2156
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:03,440
asians

2157
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,679
uh it could all still work out but i

2158
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:06,800
haven't made it through

2159
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,000
all of these derivations so they may

2160
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:10,560
also

2161
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,280
be like i said there may be even more

2162
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,560
necessary

2163
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,639
okay and the last point

2164
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,080
that fep agent construction the fvp

2165
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,440
agent construction is probably

2166
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,719
unaffected

2167
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:27,040
by any of these problems of the fep

2168
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:30,400
agent identification method

2169
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:34,400
or the mark of blanket stuff if you want

2170
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:39,600
okay and it can be yeah okay and this

2171
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,080
method

2172
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,920
can be probably independently motivated

2173
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,520
by some other arguments

2174
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,280
that are not first principles if you

2175
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,600
like okay

2176
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,280
that's it i thank a lot of people

2177
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:54,960
for talking to me about this stuff

2178
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,679
uh yeah and that's it thank you very

2179
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,119
much for your attention

2180
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:01,760
if you made it all the way especially if

2181
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,560
you made it all the way

2182
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,239
thank you martin maybe you can unshare

2183
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:09,520
and i'll just ask a few

2184
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,880
of the questions from the chat in

2185
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,280
closing

2186
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:18,480
okay it's is this the

2187
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:23,040
where is the unshare is it the same as

2188
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,679
um maybe go back to the jitsi and just

2189
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,159
unshare

2190
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:34,840
it yeah cool it's great

2191
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,520
great nice cool

2192
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,800
okay perfect so great um

2193
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,719
thanks again that was really awesome and

2194
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,719
i hope people

2195
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:47,679
paid attention so the first question is

2196
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:48,159
from

2197
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:51,360
peter and peter asked the distinction

2198
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:51,840
between

2199
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,840
agent identification and agent

2200
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,440
construction is very nice

2201
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,360
if i wanted to use that distinction in

2202
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,600
my own work should i cite your paper

2203
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,840
or is this distinction made elsewhere

2204
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:05,840
too

2205
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,400
i'm wondering if i

2206
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:24,000
if i mention this anywhere

2207
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,840
i don't know actually uh i don't know i

2208
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,960
mean like

2209
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,320
it's in some way it's just

2210
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:39,519
yeah it's kind of like a

2211
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
yeah it's kind of like an observation

2212
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,719
that makes a lot of sense and it's been

2213
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:47,280
yeah i don't know no i like if i if i

2214
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,119
think of something

2215
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,760
maybe i don't know can i see you are you

2216
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,800
on twitter

2217
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,639
i don't know uh maybe i'm gonna post it

2218
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:00,000
on twitter follow me on twitter

2219
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:03,600
i think it's it's kind of an obvious

2220
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,159
thing uh and i'm not the only one who

2221
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:08,799
has uh

2222
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:11,360
i'm definitely not the only one who has

2223
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,520
uh observed this

2224
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,440
i yeah probably there's somebody in the

2225
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,800
literature that

2226
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,880
did it in 1950 but yeah i don't know

2227
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,040
like i'm not going to be mad at it's you

2228
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,480
if you don't cite me let's put it this

2229
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,239
way

2230
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,880
thanks for the response another question

2231
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,600
from peter

2232
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,320
is how much should the agent

2233
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,440
identification

2234
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,920
and agent construction depend on each

2235
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:36,480
other

2236
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,800
in other words how big is the problem if

2237
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,000
they don't and how

2238
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,760
important is it that it comes from first

2239
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,239
principles

2240
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,960
anyways can i say the first sentence

2241
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,199
again i'm sorry uh how much

2242
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:51,119
should the agent identification and

2243
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:52,400
agent construction

2244
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,440
depend on each other

2245
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,040
okay so are those like two separate

2246
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,800
lines or one integrated hole

2247
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:05,040
yeah good question i mean

2248
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,760
i guess

2249
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,880
i mean in i guess ideally

2250
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,639
there would be some kind of relation but

2251
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:19,760
uh on the other hand so we want to

2252
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,280
construct agents

2253
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,480
like so so i in my opinion the

2254
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:28,159
bacteria are agents but when we do

2255
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:31,520
agent construction we don't really care

2256
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,560
like we don't have to

2257
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,639
follow the principles of bacteria

2258
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:37,679
necessarily

2259
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:40,320
if we don't like either we have i mean

2260
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,280
we might be

2261
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,239
we might have to because that's just how

2262
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:45,440
physics works or

2263
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,840
due to the constraints of physics but if

2264
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,920
we don't have to

2265
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,760
then nothing should stop us just

2266
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,440
constructing any kind of thing that we

2267
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,280
want i mean like

2268
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:59,040
like if we uh yeah so i guess they are

2269
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,280
not

2270
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:06,239
necessarily dependent i mean

2271
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:10,400
yeah at least i can't i can see this so

2272
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,159
on the other hand i guess it would be

2273
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,080
it would also be nice if you have some

2274
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:24,480
kind of

2275
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,520
yeah if you still have some agent

2276
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,880
identification method which

2277
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,159
comprises all possible agents like all

2278
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:34,480
agents that you construct

2279
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:37,920
should be uh examples of

2280
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,679
your like should be detected or

2281
01:44:40,679 --> 01:44:42,239
identifiable

2282
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:46,320
by your agent identification method

2283
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:49,119
so okay now i'm gonna take back what i

2284
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:52,480
said before they should be independent

2285
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,440
i hope that i hope this helped a little

2286
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,280
bit yep and

2287
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,560
and i'll just give one i think there's

2288
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,480
probably more to say but that i can't

2289
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,600
at the moment i can't really think of it

2290
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,159
so here's one final question and is a

2291
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:08,080
question i had but i'll use the phrasing

2292
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:08,480
of

2293
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,239
peter here and so this will be our

2294
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:12,159
closing question hopefully

2295
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:14,320
the beginning of something new in the

2296
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,440
beginning of moving forward peter wrote

2297
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,840
i suppose the mathematics in free energy

2298
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,520
principle and active inference could be

2299
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:22,320
taken as

2300
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,280
a work in progress are there suggestions

2301
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,639
for how to solve or

2302
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:28,719
work with the issues that you're raising

2303
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:32,719
just any thoughts on this could be nice

2304
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,000
so where do we go as learners and doers

2305
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,320
and

2306
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,159
practitioners and communicators in

2307
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:40,799
active inference

2308
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:44,080
so so yeah like i said i mean

2309
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,040
on the one hand you can if you if you

2310
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,880
construct agents you can just ignore

2311
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:49,360
what

2312
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,119
all of this stuff i said because in my

2313
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:53,000
opinion you're not

2314
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,840
relying on this agent identification

2315
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,600
method anyway

2316
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,400
so so there's no problem like of course

2317
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,679
you could maybe wonder

2318
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,440
what this base optimal that is sometimes

2319
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,119
mentioned in the literature

2320
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:10,239
of the fep what this really means

2321
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:13,440
uh and where it comes from like i think

2322
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:14,400
that's

2323
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,040
i find it i always think it's a little

2324
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,159
bit vague

2325
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:19,760
what this really means and it's actually

2326
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,600
not such a trivial question what base

2327
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:22,719
optimize but

2328
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:26,000
or what optimize um but yeah mostly you

2329
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,320
can ignore

2330
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:31,679
this fep identification but if you are

2331
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:35,920
interested in the fep identification

2332
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:41,280
then yeah i mean that

2333
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:45,440
i guess the the the thing is

2334
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,879
look at uh either

2335
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:51,920
i mean try to understand where it's

2336
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:52,880
actually going

2337
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,800
i mean like i still haven't really

2338
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,239
understood these later parts of the

2339
01:46:58,239 --> 01:46:58,550
um

2340
01:46:58,550 --> 01:47:01,629
[Music]

2341
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:06,639
the monograph where

2342
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,280
everything is supposed to come together

2343
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,960
because i always get stuck

2344
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:13,600
um before in some equations that i don't

2345
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:14,960
understand and uh

2346
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:18,080
then i think they're wrong but i'm not

2347
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:19,199
sure they're wrong yet

2348
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:21,920
as i would have mentioned that but

2349
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:22,400
there's

2350
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,719
some way i don't i'm i suspect they're

2351
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:25,679
wrong but

2352
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:29,440
yeah i'm still not sure and

2353
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,440
but yeah i guess that's still like i

2354
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,800
don't really see like if you want to

2355
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:33,679
save

2356
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,719
something of this method then look at

2357
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:38,000
this but

2358
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,480
another another other way is maybe

2359
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,760
to think about uh

2360
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,000
think about this for yourself think

2361
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,960
about what it what are the

2362
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,600
conditions you think under which

2363
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,159
something

2364
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,080
is doing asian inference or something

2365
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,360
like this

2366
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:00,800
and ignore all the math by then

2367
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,920
that's already in the literature and

2368
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,679
then try like once you figured it out

2369
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:06,320
for yourself

2370
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:09,520
maybe uh try to come back to the

2371
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,119
literature and compare it or something

2372
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:12,080
because

2373
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,440
i sometimes think people rely

2374
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:19,040
too much on what this

2375
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,840
what the literature says and i'm not

2376
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,800
really sure

2377
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,400
that actually what's in the literature

2378
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,320
is like it doesn't

2379
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:29,119
strike me

2380
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:33,040
as a very straightforward argument

2381
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:36,159
um and i like straightforward arguments

2382
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:37,920
i think straightforward arguments are

2383
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,840
usually better

2384
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,480
um like maybe there isn't a

2385
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,000
straightforward argument but i kind of

2386
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,280
think i always think there's a

2387
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,480
straightforward argument

2388
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,639
um but that's just my opinion yeah it's

2389
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:50,000
off

2390
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,280
well it's a nice point that the

2391
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:53,920
literature is a scaffold for our own

2392
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,600
thinking and development the literature

2393
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,119
is not uh

2394
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:59,119
a road that's been paved with gold and

2395
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:00,719
it's just perfect in the past

2396
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,560
it's actually always a work in progress

2397
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,080
and always a scaffold

2398
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,960
so thanks so much for sharing this

2399
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,000
really work in

2400
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,320
progress not that it isn't uh with

2401
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,000
landmarks that you've published but

2402
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
it is a work in progress in the bigger

2403
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,599
sense so

2404
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:18,639
also thanks for staying up late to bring

2405
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:19,920
us this information

2406
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,400
and we hope that in future live streams

2407
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,280
we can

2408
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,360
unpack this more and hear updates as you

2409
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,119
continue to progress on this line of

2410
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,440
research

2411
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,960
okay yeah thank you very much for having

2412
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,960
