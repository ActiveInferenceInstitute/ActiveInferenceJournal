Hello
and welcome everyone to Active Inference

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,978
Lab, to the Gueststream -
the Active Iinference Gueststream number

3
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:16,750
2.1 on March 18th 2021
featuring Dimitris Bolis

4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:22,188
and this is going to be a really awesome
discussion on a wide variety of topics.

5
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:26,960
So I'll just pass it to Dimitris
to introduce himself and take it away.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,031
We're going to have a presentation first
and then we'll be documenting questions

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:31,798
from the live chat.

8
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,467
So please drop
any thoughts or questions in there

9
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,070
and then we'll have a discussion
after this presentation.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,972
So thanks again for coming on the stream.

11
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,374
We really appreciate the time
and please take it away.

12
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,913
Hello, everybody,
and very happy being here.

13
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,349
Thank you very much, the organizers for

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,086
organizing
and presenting such an interesting

15
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,589
series of short seminars.

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,493
So today I will like to present to you

17
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,830
a work that we have been doing

18
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,433
primarily in the last six years

19
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,769
in Munich

20
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,105
in collaboration with Zilber

21
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,974
and his group in my splint and

22
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,278
basically the title contractor

23
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:22,015
for AM Human Be Coming In
and Through Social Interaction

24
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,086
is the title of my piece,
the dissertation

25
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:31,324
that I was presented
last year about this month.

26
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,927
So for anybody

27
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39,132
that would like more details
at the end of the talk, the good,

28
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,235
the always go back to the document,

29
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,838
it's already published in ResearchGate.

30
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,807
And there, there you can find also the

31
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,044
already first papers

32
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,246
that came out from this work but

33
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,683
more are coming

34
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,918
in the way in the next few months.

35
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,823
So I will start by

36
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,327
presenting
the outline of this presentation.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,131
So first
we will go through the theoretical work

38
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:16,469
which consists of the dialectical human
hypothesis.

39
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,940
And then let me set human
hypotheses, which are both

40
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,844
focused and emphasize

41
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,413
the importance of social interaction

42
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,584
in human becoming across both contexts

43
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,221
from and various case from evolution

44
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,391
to cultural development
and psychopathology.

45
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,362
Then importantly, we will discuss

46
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,698
concrete empirical physiologies

47
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:49,502
with regards
to how we can put into the formal test

48
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,409
this kind of hypothesis and which we call
two person psycho physiology.

49
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,078
Because this work tries to extend

50
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,184
the traditional psycho physiology work

51
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,619
in the social domain.

52
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,322
So we will see how, based on

53
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,226
coming to research, for example,

54
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,595
we aim to create different streams

55
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,765
of studying

56
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,434
for monitoring,

57
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:27,073
recording and analyzing data
in high resolution from multiple people.

58
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:30,743
At the same time that we are able
to interact in real time,

59
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:35,882
then we will go through the
empirical work and the first two studies,

60
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,685
which is

61
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,689
about interpersonal attunement
in real time social interactions

62
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,227
and especially through JS, and second

63
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:51,664
about the interpersonal use of humans
in real life social relationships.

64
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:55,868
And this is with regard
to autistic traits

65
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,172
and interpersonal similarity.

66
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,176
And fourth,
we will discuss some scientific

67
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,246
and the societal implications

68
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,082
of this work and

69
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,751
we will conclude.

70
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:16,155
So the theoretical work is based on

71
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,026
two main pillars that's

72
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,629
a philosophical framework

73
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,733
developed across many centuries.

74
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:32,372
Going back to some years and in Greece
and also

75
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,708
in China or India

76
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,947
and we will go through
more details later.

77
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,951
But this was developed
further in more modern times,

78
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,820
especially in France, in Germany,

79
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,624
and also we lean

80
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,795
upon heavily
the mainstream brain hypothesis and

81
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:00,266
especially the framework of predictive
processing and active inference.

82
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,503
So I guess most of the people

83
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,839
here might be already familiar
with these frameworks

84
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,610
but I would like to go through
a simple example

85
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,247
and just to make clear the

86
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,450
principle

87
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,321
and implications
of this kind of frameworks.

88
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,991
So let us imagine,

89
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:31,197
Lady waking up late for her work and

90
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,233
so she cannot decide

91
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,602
what to wear for going to work

92
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,541
but based on her previous experience
and she lives in the south

93
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,644
part of Greece in Crete,
she believes that

94
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,915
most probably
the weather will be good and sunny.

95
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:53,886
So she decides to go out
without putting an umbrella or a coat.

96
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,523
However, these days, the sunlight

97
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,760
so this is

98
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,196
contrary to her predictions.

99
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:09,068
The weather was raining
and they should go with the second day,

100
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:13,473
even though she believes that
the probability for raining might be 5%.

101
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,408
So increase here.

102
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,811
The probability she believes
about the probability of raining

103
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,149
and how obviously still is deciding
not in umbrella.

104
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,651
This continues for a week

105
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,721
where you finally

106
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,591
have time to come to believe

107
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,762
the probability of raining
even in this period

108
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:40,933
and this place was 90%
and decided to carry an umbrella.

109
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:46,672
So we see here how she gradually updated
her beliefs based on the evidence

110
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,243
that we observed in real life
and gradually

111
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,980
let us imagine
another illustrative example.

112
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,950
The same lady goes for vacations to Japan

113
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:04,223
and she again is late to go out
and she has not decided

114
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,626
whether she needs to carry an umbrella
with or not

115
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,561
based on rumors.

116
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:13,599
In this time she again
believes that the weather will be good.

117
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,635
So she's slightly dressed.

118
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,172
However, again, she's a year unlucky
and the weather is raining

119
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,241
so already.

120
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:26,746
And in this case,
and the lady, for example,

121
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,950
and this is for this
from the second day already

122
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,988
she believes that
the probability of framing will be 90%.

123
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,490
So we see here in some

124
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,327
regarding the show

125
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,230
updating of the weather beliefs.

126
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:49,202
Why is that happening here
from aberration perspective

127
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,572
one could argue that in this case
that her beliefs

128
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,409
were formed
quickly through social rumors.

129
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,514
They were more or less confident
so more susceptible to change

130
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,784
when faced with contradictory evidence.

131
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,055
But a very important

132
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,558
factor in the base and been hypothesis.

133
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,229
So we'll go through
the mathematical details,

134
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,664
but with this very simple

135
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,602
and simplifying examples, we examine

136
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,405
two cardinal aspects of such account,

137
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,810
namely the updating of beliefs

138
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,680
and through integrating prior

139
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,251
knowledge and new data

140
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,821
and also

141
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,157
we examine the learning rate of

142
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,997
this procedure, which is thought of as

143
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,702
a way to precision prediction error,

144
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:02,041
which means that the more confident
we are about our previous beliefs,

145
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,344
the less likely we are to

146
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:09,115
update them
in face of contradictory information.

147
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,153
So this framework

148
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,355
to gain much attention
over the last two years.

149
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,192
First, because as we see, we can it's

150
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,797
useful in examining

151
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,600
various real life scenarios

152
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,837
and puts them into formal equations

153
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:36,309
and models which can be formally examined

154
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,479
and tested against one another

155
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,818
so of course, the

156
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:50,089
outline of this account that we've drawn
so far, it's rather simplistic.

157
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,192
So in this case,
we only examined the scenario

158
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,762
that one person observes

159
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,732
passively the world, and

160
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,638
their only choice
is to update their beliefs

161
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,574
according to what they observe.

162
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,010
So this is countries which have

163
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,481
mentioned resembles in some aspects

164
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,185
the old Plato's Cave allegory,

165
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:24,824
where two months were
and nothing else, that prisoners

166
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,861
from the whole
for the whole lives in a deep cave

167
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,598
where they never experience
the outer world.

168
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,501
And their only experience about the

169
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,905
environment was to projections

170
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,442
on a wall
through shadows of the real objects

171
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,445
that are reflected
on the wall in front of them.

172
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,216
So this we can imagine

173
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,517
in a way

174
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,287
humans or other organisms

175
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,657
experiencing the world in a manner

176
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,527
right,
such as we have specific sensory organs

177
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:07,767
where an information from
the world is projected

178
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,269
and we selectively experience

179
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,806
the reality of this.

180
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,709
Of course, this is just a partial

181
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,978
image of what is happening.

182
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,782
One already awake
and think of a second avenue

183
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,821
of an attunement
between the organism and the environment.

184
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,792
So as we said,
if I said the organism tries to

185
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,262
minimize prediction error
through perception of learning

186
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,799
by adjusting their own beliefs
to the environment, but of course

187
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,469
an organism can also update their beliefs

188
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,540
through action so that they selectively

189
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,376
transform

190
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,612
into some the world in a way
that it conforms

191
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,716
to their initial beliefs.

192
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,353
So this, I contend, constitutes

193
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,589
a more comprehensive

194
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,395
account of organisms, life
and especially human life.

195
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,567
But we will argue in line
with other recent accounts

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,570
in this talk that this is

197
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,606
occurring is still not enough on its own

198
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,676
because it considers individual organisms

199
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,278
out of context.

200
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,750
Out of their social context,
and especially with regards to humans,

201
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,086
out of the crucial cultural context
as well.

202
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,391
In our effort
to embed these kind of accounts,

203
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,527
we have leaned on

204
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,663
the political approach,

205
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,032
which is an we saw before.

206
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,836
It consists in constitutes
a school of thought,

207
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,741
which goes back to infant years
and continues until

208
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,213
this years, always
in reaching different historical context.

209
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,951
So the importance of this framework
is that it emphasizes

210
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,723
unity of phenomena and it doesn't neglect
inner contradictions

211
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,660
and emphasize
movement or phenomena or change

212
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,930
and so a

213
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,367
situation of crisis or radical changes,

214
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,504
it doesn't seem to
this account is problematic.

215
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,841
But also instances of

216
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,776
updating

217
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,145
and embracing.

218
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:37,716
So this kind of accounts try to overcome
the economies

219
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,420
such as the organism and the environment,
the individual collective,

220
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,790
or as we will see in our work,

221
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,127
even a patient versus their cultural

222
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,596
context

223
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,799
and special emphasis is given

224
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:59,205
not only in intro level courses,
but also between level processes

225
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,640
across various temporal states

226
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:07,012
so this account goes against

227
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,349
both dualism and reductionism

228
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,220
as it tries to examine

229
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,056
phenomena in the wholeness

230
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,959
but without

231
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,829
metaphysically assuming

232
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:27,566
independent levels of reality

233
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:32,137
and traditionally sciences

234
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,242
for good reasons, for some

235
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,878
for lack of tools

236
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:45,150
to focus on specific levels
of description of reality,

237
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,120
such as, for example,
the physical or biological level

238
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,223
or the psycho physiological level.

239
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,859
This kind of

240
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,162
studies to provided important insight

241
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:02,968
however, when examined
and isolated in a single level,

242
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:08,140
we will argue it doesn't provide
the whole picture of complex phenomena

243
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,176
such as psycho social, cultural

244
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,880
or psychiatric phenomena.

245
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,984
So in this work, we have argued that

246
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:24,456
even deploying simple research paradigms

247
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,560
will be crucial to try to

248
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,099
probe and monitor processes

249
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,269
that live on different levels

250
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,605
of description

251
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,375
based on this

252
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,478
assumption,

253
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:51,550
we have reviewed human becoming
as a dialectic of internalization

254
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,423
and externalization and more precisely
connected internalization processes

255
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:01,560
to predictive processing
with as we saw from

256
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,964
our examples, is the

257
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,400
mechanism of updating our own beliefs
in order

258
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,404
to conform
to the environmental regularities.

259
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,808
And we connect these externalization

260
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,844
processes and

261
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:23,716
especially collective externalization
of processes to active inference,

262
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,785
which is a process of co

263
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:31,090
regulating the outer world,
and especially the social world.

264
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,662
And according to our

265
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,500
inner beliefs,
but also according to our collective

266
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,068
inner beliefs.

267
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,208
And one can see a human

268
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,544
becoming this attunement with the world

269
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,182
and both physical worlds and others.

270
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,387
So here we see how we can or

271
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:05,557
how an organism such as animals or humans

272
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,827
and trying to regulate

273
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,263
the world, both physical

274
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:15,000
and social, will
and by acting on the world.

275
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,837
So, for example, in this case,

276
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,741
this this animal holds
the world against gravity first.

277
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,644
That means that already
in an embodied way,

278
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,915
captures the physical dynamics

279
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:34,920
of Earth's gravity
but also acts against social events

280
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,024
here and attempt to from somebody taking

281
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:39,858
the more

282
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,162
so we see

283
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,031
human becoming is

284
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,368
the little of human mean in our scale.

285
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,205
And in that cell,

286
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,509
as in their personal,
we say that in this kind of regularity,

287
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,813
same multi scale
model of on an individual

288
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,849
level and vice versa.

289
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,785
And this can happen from across
different scales

290
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:10,989
from the field of Genesis culture
in terms of tendencies

291
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,761
to everyday learning, decision
making perception and even so called

292
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,797
into automatic introspective process

293
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,734
our perspective

294
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,138
draws heavily on a victim perspective

295
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,374
who have famously declared

296
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,112
the claim that through others

297
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,647
we become ourselves.

298
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,418
So in order to

299
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,187
further illuminate this view,

300
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,724
let us imagine a simple

301
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,126
example.

302
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,928
Let us imagine a little baby that

303
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,198
am feeling

304
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:57,269
hungry as the intercept of systems

305
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,639
is out of balance and tries
to reach for food.

306
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,042
However, the motor repertoire of

307
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,313
such a human being,

308
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,884
it's not developed yet fully

309
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,790
and so

310
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,227
these babies are unable
to reach for food on its own.

311
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,732
So what happens
is that the usually the caregiver

312
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:32,804
will notice that kind of behavior in it.

313
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,342
And it will try to satisfy that,
for example, by placing the food

314
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,579
closer to the baby.

315
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,881
So in this case, we see

316
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:47,319
we can even imagine
how this kind of interpersonal relation

317
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,389
between the caregiver
and the baby results

318
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,326
may result in a internalization

319
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:59,831
and then both in its a symbolic level
of this kind of process.

320
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,001
So the baby both

321
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,306
across evolution and development,

322
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:12,177
might come to realize
that when extending the harmful

323
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,180
the index finger

324
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,583
and calls for attention

325
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:21,119
and pointing to a specific
object that they need

326
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:23,855
so we see how

327
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,792
an interpersonal relationship based on

328
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,796
natural needs for survival

329
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:36,235
might end up
being an internalization of it

330
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,637
in on a symbolic level

331
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,811
so here that example is important

332
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,450
talk because this illustrates
how a collective level,

333
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,621
a level of description of process
between people

334
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,323
might be transformed

335
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,693
into single brains
and single bodies processes

336
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,664
and actually makes us
what we are becoming

337
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:11,103
and that is humans and growing up

338
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,540
in these kind of accounts

339
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,213
are very much in line with the framework
of amateurism and especially

340
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,950
the account of participatory sense
making,

341
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,386
which has focused a lot

342
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,456
on the fundamental role
of social interactions

343
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:38,196
and both from individual sense making,

344
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:43,635
which is always affected
by coordination dynamics while we are in

345
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,205
embedded in social interactions
all the way to design.

346
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,810
Since making how that means,
how we and jointly with others

347
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,813
make sense of the world

348
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:03,121
however, this kind of account might seem

349
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,991
theoretical

350
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,460
so now here we will

351
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:14,733
ask the question
How can we apply this kind of ideas,

352
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:19,371
and why is it even important to reflect

353
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,641
on these processes and whether the

354
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,243
these processes lie on

355
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:30,882
lower level of descriptions
or collective levels or between?

356
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:35,687
So to illustrate an example,
we will use autism

357
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,790
as a paradigm example,

358
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,095
and we will try to illustrate

359
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:48,033
how these ideas can be concrete
and then concretely put into practice.

360
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,902
So autism spectrum condition

361
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,806
has been described
as a pervasive developmental condition,

362
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,877
which is characterized by difficulties
in social interaction and communication,

363
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:04,583
as well as restricted interest interests
and all sensory behaviors.

364
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,619
So that's the traditional

365
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,088
typical definition

366
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:15,627
of autism spectrum conditions
and to some predominant approaches

367
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:19,164
so far, so focused on difficulties

368
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:23,301
or so-called impairments
or theory of mind, these theories

369
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,839
describe autism as a condition

370
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,709
that individuals have problems with

371
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,146
an understanding of intentions.

372
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,881
Other them

373
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,383
or beliefs of other people.

374
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,087
So there's also
there are also alternative hypotheses

375
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,558
such as this social motivation hypothesis
which claims

376
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,761
that people with autism
have usually diminished

377
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,298
social motivation
to interact with others.

378
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,535
So in this case,
they might lack opportunities

379
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,905
in gaining and

380
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,909
more cognitive abilities.

381
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,278
We see also a weak

382
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,847
central coherence account

383
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:15,253
and or executive dysfunction,
which seems refers

384
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:18,890
to more individual characteristics
of individuals

385
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,693
with autistic individuals

386
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,463
such as difficulties with planning,

387
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,632
or you're paying more attention
to global,

388
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,703
sorry, local information
rather than information.

389
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,073
And we also see broken mirror on your own

390
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,242
hypotheses which

391
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,979
emphasize the difficulty of autism

392
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:46,051
and autistic people
when it comes to empathizing

393
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,057
and more recently,
we have computational approaches

394
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,126
such as the aberrant or inflexible
precision updating,

395
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,761
which

396
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,932
grounded in predictive
processing account,

397
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:06,304
and the claim that autism
might result from

398
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,709
an aberrant way

399
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,478
of updating precision and the

400
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,681
more concretely regulating

401
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,852
the updating of beliefs
as we so by integrating

402
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,489
previously getting experience
with in face

403
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,893
of newly income information.

404
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,829
So we see here that

405
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:36,601
this type of account there are either
more social accounts right.

406
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:37,068
Right.

407
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:41,072
This area of mine social deviation,
broken meter, new account,

408
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:45,010
or even the abrupt precision of dating
when it comes to the social world.

409
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,779
However, and

410
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,417
even in this case where others

411
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,220
into and into the frame,

412
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,791
the condition is exclusively attributed
and examined

413
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:03,962
within single individuals
and especially a single brain.

414
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,430
So the

415
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,402
most predominant causes of autism

416
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:15,140
focus on individuals and try to diagnose
or even treat

417
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,843
such conditions by paying attention

418
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,447
primarily on the individual

419
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,385
so for example, in research, it's
common to

420
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,624
identify two groups, for example, one
so called neurotypical

421
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,294
or non autistic group
and to one autistic group.

422
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,464
And then by

423
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:43,201
deploying a specific paradigm

424
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,337
we try to identify

425
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:50,642
traditionally differences
in behavioral patterns for brain function

426
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,078
and this kind of paradigms then

427
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,114
attribute these kind of differences in

428
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,518
the efficient functioning of the autistic

429
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,522
so however,

430
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,225
there's a lot to do here and in line with

431
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:11,029
and in the subjective term,

432
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,032
in the research of psychopathology

433
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,201
and specifically in autism,

434
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,771
we will see how

435
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,808
by including real time
social interactions

436
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,378
and social relationships

437
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,883
and we can expand this focus
from individual brains

438
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:38,056
to a process between people
and especially in communication so

439
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,825
this line of

440
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,829
work would suggest
that it's not enough to identify

441
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:50,535
two different groups of people
like neurotypical and autistic people.

442
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:55,106
But already by beginning examining
diets of people or groups of people,

443
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,943
one can not really see where we are

444
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,946
or have available here at least three

445
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,817
different broad categories of

446
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,485
partners, for example.

447
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,221
And now kids,
we have neurotypical partners,

448
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,591
we have autistic partners,
but we have also mixed

449
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,960
partners.

450
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,229
Which means consisting of

451
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:22,100
at least one autistic individual
and at least one neurotypical individual.

452
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,669
So in this case,

453
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,306
I hypothesis has been that

454
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,777
at least in certain levels,
especially in the exponential level,

455
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,880
the autistic individuals

456
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:41,252
will entertain similar levels
of smoothness, interactive smoothness

457
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:45,123
as they neurotypical partners,
where is makes

458
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:49,561
that might appear in certain levels
interacting less efficiently.

459
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,632
And if that hypothesis is correct,

460
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:59,003
then one can see that

461
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,341
the deficiency

462
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,211
doesn't lie
in the individual brain of the autistic.

463
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,248
But at least partially,

464
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,917
we can look at it in process
between individuals.

465
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,154
This is very much in line
with the problem

466
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,691
of Damian Middleton,

467
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,926
who have argued that the ideology

468
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:27,165
of accepting of him autism condition
does not lie in the individual,

469
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,101
but it comes from mismatches of

470
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,806
social abilities or expectations.

471
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,443
One can imagine even

472
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,112
I probing this further

473
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,252
by not necessarily
victimizing people in autistic

474
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:51,556
or non autistic or any other category
we can imagine, but rather

475
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,192
examining.

476
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,761
And so it's traits on a continuum
and then

477
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:01,199
examining the

478
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,301
interaction, smoothness based

479
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,472
on the distance of people

480
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,410
in a space of conditions rather than in
a single dimensional spectrum.

481
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:12,944
Of conditions.

482
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,513
Later we will see how

483
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,549
this can be operationalized.

484
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,251
So let's

485
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,354
I this example as we already

486
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,024
mentioned, the last decade

487
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,694
especially, but also before through

488
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,097
a more sociological account

489
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,301
we have seen

490
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,370
and in this objective term
in the study of autism

491
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,907
and other conditions
and just to give a few examples

492
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,911
and focus on the problem, this argues

493
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,347
that social difficulties

494
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,083
in autism arises

495
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:56,054
to a complication
and the military side in single brains

496
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,225
also, as we saw in activist
and participatory science

497
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:04,262
making account to claim
that atypical abuse can be

498
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:09,000
viewed as a different way of making sense
of others and interacting with a world

499
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,136
or second person.

500
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,940
And neuropsychology perspectives
have claimed that social difficulties

501
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,777
are more likely or even only

502
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,680
manifest themselves in real time
social interactions,

503
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:27,919
whereas more passive
scenarios might be less problematic

504
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,154
clinically

505
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,860
and finally,

506
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,197
a part of this work, the election,
which assumes hypothesis

507
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,369
has an bring together in the subjective
approaches and predictive quotient

508
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,239
pricing approaches
to reviews and conditions

509
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,776
such as autism's autism
but also other conditions.

510
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,145
Notice a disorder of the individual,

511
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:57,115
but rather
as a cumulative depression of humans.

512
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,786
So in a nutshell, in
the presence of human

513
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,025
can be thought of as disturbances
of a dynamic and reciprocal unfolding,

514
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:12,263
of an interaction across multiple time
scales, resulting in increasingly

515
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,566
divergent prediction
and interaction styles

516
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,670
or patterns and vice versa.

517
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,005
And we saw the hypothesis

518
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:26,110
aligned with our account holds
clear predictions.

519
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,980
And so before we start

520
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,283
experimenting empirically,

521
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,520
we make concrete hypotheses

522
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,656
in terms of interactions

523
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
which

524
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:45,263
we suggested as interaction
between homogeneous and non shown

525
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:50,935
dyads are expected to I'm sorry,
into autoimmune diets as

526
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:52,770
compared to

527
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,474
heterogeneous diets or non shown diets.

528
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,544
We will see later what we mean
by social attune

529
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,613
tend to be homogeneous or

530
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:07,885
more importantly,
we see here an interplay between levels

531
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,355
of description between the the subjective

532
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,524
community group

533
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,761
and individual prediction
and interaction styles,

534
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:21,232
which might appear diverse
across people of different conditions

535
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,936
and so we see how in initially
the subjective

536
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,439
community of group can result in

537
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,942
increasing individual

538
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,013
divergence,
the prediction and direction styles.

539
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,982
And so as we have people

540
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,553
of higher form diverse
social expectations about each other,

541
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:47,859
how this can result in increasing
subsuming the subjective community across

542
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,528
which case one can imagine, for example,

543
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,732
at the scale of a dialog

544
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,603
for example,
let's say I start with making a comment

545
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,472
that another person might take
is insulting.

546
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:02,940
Then the other person

547
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,210
replies
to me barking in an aggressive manner.

548
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,982
Then I'm sorry, I'm starting
feeling angry

549
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,686
and this can escalate
potentially in a major vicious human

550
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,358
in the scale of just few seconds
or a few minutes especially.

551
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,594
This can happen between people,
for example, that have cultivated

552
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:27,565
to distinct systems of beliefs

553
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,436
for some different cultures,
and they don't that have a chance

554
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:35,773
to get to know other systems of beliefs

555
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,310
and this

556
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,913
in the case of autism, for example,

557
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,215
this one can imagine that this kind of

558
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,653
interactions might play out during

559
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:50,788
a course development.

560
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:55,726
So a child in a school, for example,
that I would children

561
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,863
are not informed about

562
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,433
different communication styles

563
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,504
might isolate,
exclude and isolate this child

564
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,943
so I would term forcing this child to

565
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,746
develop with

566
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,316
decreased level of social interaction.

567
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,153
We see this
not only in terms with autism, also

568
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:27,925
about with regards to other social
communicative differences.

569
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,664
And people can be excluded, for example,
immigration

570
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,635
populations in new places

571
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,971
might be excluded initially

572
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,141
based on this kind of

573
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,409
in the subjective community of groups

574
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,213
so in our case,

575
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,750
going back to autism,
we will try to personalize

576
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:57,221
the homogeneity of diet of partners

577
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:01,592
the similarity
of in terms of autistic traits

578
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,794
we can which we can measure with standard

579
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:08,199
questionnaire tests and to we will

580
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,536
operationalize

581
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,739
in our experiments
the weakness of an interaction

582
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,942
based on the perceived friendship
quality,

583
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,611
again,
through questionnaires, for example.

584
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,715
But later
we will see how we can extend this work

585
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,052
in a more fine grained time scales.

586
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,522
For example,
in at the scale of milliseconds

587
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,493
when it comes to interpersonal behavior

588
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,763
or interpersonal social expression
behavior.

589
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:43,267
So our experimental methodology

590
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,604
takes the form of two person
cycle physiology

591
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:51,809
or collective psycho physiology,
which tries to expand the study of psycho

592
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:55,546
physiological phenomena
into the sociable collective domain

593
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,883
and here

594
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,920
our a study on
the interpersonal attunement in real time

595
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,257
social interactions
make use of this methodology

596
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,727
which is grounded in and second

597
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,829
personal neuroscience accounts

598
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:17,335
which which claim that in real time
social interaction,

599
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:22,306
the brain or other processes
might be fundamentally different

600
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,943
than a simpler passive

601
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,313
social, social,
passive observation of scenarios.

602
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,915
So when we really interact

603
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,417
with another in real time, for example,
in the discussion

604
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:38,522
of this account
and hypothesize that our brain

605
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:43,160
will function in different, qualitatively
different and quantitatively

606
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,032
different way as when we just sit back
and observe others,

607
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,470
we saw the opportunity
to feedback to each other.

608
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,872
We'll go

609
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,508
in detail
here about their brain processes

610
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,880
and our study here
will see mainly behavioral results.

611
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,984
So also our two persons physiology

612
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:11,088
framework is based on previous work

613
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,992
over the last couple of decades,

614
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,195
such as, for example, if MRI

615
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:21,032
or EEG hyper scanning,

616
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,235
you'll see
one of the seminal works of Duma,

617
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,469
which

618
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,774
connected to EEG systems

619
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:34,845
into into the same computer
in order to at the same time

620
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,682
examine the brain function of two people
while

621
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,451
interacting

622
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,522
through

623
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,491
hand movements

624
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,629
also other

625
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,298
networks, such as work from local

626
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,837
school coaching and have examined

627
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,374
the phenomenon, for example,
from deepening the brain with the use of

628
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,211
hyper scanning and all across development

629
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:14,218
our two to set up, it looks like both.

630
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:18,289
So I'll go here and also in detail,
just want to make clear

631
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,525
that our system is deploys

632
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,962
different in several different
recording modalities

633
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,533
and in a completely symmetrical way

634
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,171
in order to make sure that we in perfect
synchronicity, we can monitor

635
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,641
the individual processes of two
or more people

636
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:43,247
from decision making to eye movement
and facial expressions

637
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:47,051
into brain function all at the same time
so that we can interrelate

638
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,187
first processes

639
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,623
of different modalities
within the same person.

640
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,025
How decision making is

641
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,129
connected to our

642
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,632
emotional processing
or facial expressions

643
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,535
and how we, our brain function

644
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,738
modulate eye movements and

645
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:13,778
and how our perceived social information
modulates brain function.

646
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:18,082
And second, to interrelate
in the multimodal

647
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:22,119
processes of individuals
with one another.

648
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,455
So how my

649
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,958
visual information, for example,
influence your behavior

650
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:31,228
and how your behavior influenced me
in a closed loop

651
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,867
so in reality, our set up
looks like that.

652
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:41,071
So two persons are invited in the lab
and they sort of

653
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,677
simple visual tasks
while they are able to communicate

654
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:50,781
and interact through a micro camera
of the center of the screen,

655
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:56,587
which deploys
the face of the other person in.

656
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:01,926
So here in our first experiment,
the important manipulation was that

657
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:06,997
when people were able to communicate
in real time, like in a Skype manner

658
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,201
in half of a game, and people

659
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,137
could not communicate in real time

660
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,307
because they replayed

661
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,710
the part of the video
of the previous interaction

662
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,914
without letting people know
so in our game, the two people

663
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,051
so that they always communicated
in real time.

664
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,054
However,

665
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,957
contrary to their perception

666
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,093
in half of the game,
they really communicated.

667
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,930
But in half of the game they just observe
the video of the other person

668
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:44,235
and so in this case,
we will be able to disentangle

669
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:48,572
quantitatively the impact
of these social interaction dynamics,

670
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:52,376
even in the absence of conscious
interpretation of the situation

671
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,781
so here we can see our two main
conditions of the live video feed.

672
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,652
What allows the two people
to form a system, the one system

673
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:05,656
interacting system, and in the other case
we have two distinct systems,

674
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,026
cognitive systems. We test or observe

675
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,696
recorded
videos of the other without knowing

676
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,066
our them looks like that.

677
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,601
It's based

678
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,571
on a seminal work of Bardo

679
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,740
Bahrami and colleagues in London

680
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,910
it's a cycle physiological and

681
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,647
task where we ask people to identify

682
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,551
the odd object on the screen

683
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:38,722
without knowing that
there is no object object on the screen.

684
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,425
So because we have four possible

685
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,862
possibilities, left or right, up or down,

686
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:50,501
I we expect just a 25%

687
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,539
chance of coherence

688
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,577
between the decisions of the two persons.

689
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,213
So whatever, whatever weeks we observe

690
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:07,184
and above and beyond to 25%

691
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:12,456
am in a statistically significant manner
we can attribute.

692
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,960
And just on the dynamics
of the switching production,

693
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,963
because every other piece

694
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,998
of information
remains the same for the two people

695
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:26,036
except for the dynamics of
their interaction three years

696
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,075
so for example, here you can see Case one

697
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,878
and we have covered the eyes of people
for privacy reasons.

698
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:40,017
And but here you can see how people
in real time, even when they don't

699
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,053
see the face of her face
together, present

700
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,556
their synchronized and happy

701
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,827
interacting together at the same time.

702
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,865
Look here for some,
how perfectly aligned is even the

703
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,669
first two expressions

704
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,907
the same here we cannot see the eyes,
but the same will say about the eyes.

705
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,109
The same happens.

706
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,411
People tend to follow each other eyes.

707
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:12,683
But let's see now a second change
where people same game the same day.

708
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:17,321
After a few seconds, they played
a version of the game where without

709
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:21,859
knowing one person, see only the video
of the eyes of the other person.

710
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,262
So in this case, you see people
start being confused, like,

711
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,098
why don't you follow me
as they follow you?

712
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,300
ET cetera.

713
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,070
So this creates a mix of human
and artificial human.

714
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,673
Were people naive about our experiment?

715
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:38,909
Control cannot attribute to

716
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,546
a power manipulations, but

717
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,582
as we saw through questionnaires,
the asking group,

718
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,484
the through
psychological interpretations,

719
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:51,388
like the other person, was both all tied
so at some point or

720
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,092
two, for example,

721
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:59,630
we can see how the interpersonal
interpersonal of humans play out

722
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,666
in the behavioral domain and especially

723
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,969
here in how to gaze

724
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:10,874
transitioning to person coincides
and for each other like independent

725
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,644
interacting and better creatures

726
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,016
thank you for your results.

727
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,652
And based on our analysis of the again

728
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:25,689
strings here we can see
we formed three experimental conditions.

729
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,761
We said one sugar condition
where we suffered dyads

730
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:35,833
from different days and we see that
they're against continuation.

731
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,801
The green is the lowest there.

732
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:41,638
We see that when people really observe
the other person in the room,

733
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,174
the yellow them.

734
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,910
So the orange distribution,
we see that we have an increased

735
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,413
coordination

736
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,881
metric.

737
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,650
But what really made a difference
is when people are allowed

738
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,354
to really interact with each other,
we see that their gains space was

739
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,157
synchronized the most.

740
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,260
And very interestingly, we observe

741
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,462
exactly the same pattern

742
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,198
in terms of

743
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:11,502
of a completely different
level of description.

744
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,805
And we see the decision
making alignment again here.

745
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:19,843
We see that when we analyzed data
from people of different partners,

746
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,946
we see that in this either

747
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:27,618
the probability of agreeing on
the same object was around 25%.

748
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,921
We see here
the green distribution centers around 25.

749
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,491
Then we see that the orange distribution
already on the

750
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,929
about the observation
scenario is slightly increased.

751
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,499
But what it was an increase was the

752
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,701
decision making alignment in

753
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:47,771
the real time social interaction tonight.

754
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:51,341
Also this is reflected
in the interrelationship

755
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:55,445
between the two modalities we see here
both in the online and offline

756
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:01,819
conditions we see and statistical
in the relationship

757
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:06,423
between the two modalities
so the more the gains coordinate,

758
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:10,060
the higher the coordination, the higher
the decision making alignment.

759
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:14,698
And we also see that
the in the case of real tension

760
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:18,869
construction,
this interrelationship appeared stronger

761
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,308
also another interesting finding

762
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,544
is that the the confidence

763
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:30,080
difference between the two conditions
was significant.

764
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,051
So people, without even knowing
that there was two different conditions,

765
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:37,087
appear more confident
about their own choices.

766
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,291
And depending

767
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,862
in their real time
social interaction situations,

768
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,498
as opposed to the offline or

769
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,635
social observation scenarios.

770
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,471
So so here we see
how the social interaction dynamics,

771
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:58,876
even when we don't
we are not aware of them consciously it

772
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:04,681
influences us phenomena logically,

773
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,418
even to the level of our confidence
about our own decision

774
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,086
making.

775
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:18,462
So finally,
we also see a relationship between Gaze

776
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:22,733
coordination
and the perceived level of collaboration.

777
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,370
So the more people

778
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,438
follow each other, gaze

779
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,408
the more likely we are to report

780
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,244
a higher level
of satisfaction in collaboration.

781
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,517
So what we have established to

782
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,955
where we examine
the best memories of human

783
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:50,327
in this time in Real-Life
Social Relationships, here we try to move

784
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,331
our empirical studies
outside of the lab in the real world

785
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:58,535
without performing any manipulation,

786
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,273
just by collecting

787
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,243
registering the experiences,

788
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,513
the real life experiences of

789
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,748
people in the real world.

790
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,884
So here we study the link

791
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:16,954
more concretely between this similarity
of artistic traits

792
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,856
and friendship ratings along a continuum

793
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,294
and for that, to this end,
we invited virtual friends

794
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,163
to complete questionnaires

795
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:29,333
about their individual artistic traits
and the quality of their friendship

796
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:34,237
without being able to communicate
their replies, of course, to each other.

797
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,107
Then we analyzed this data

798
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:39,543
that we gathered from

799
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,279
140 for neurotypical adults,

800
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,051
which form to 72
same sex diets of friends

801
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,622
which whose

802
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:56,893
friendship duration of our age
alone from three months to 30 years,

803
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,630
and they're meeting frequency again,
whereas diverse

804
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,967
from a few times
per year to daily in the ages

805
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,572
of other wholes from 19 years old
to 15 years

806
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,809
and balanced in terms of sex

807
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:16,980
sample of participants here
we see the distributions

808
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,515
of their main

809
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,253
measures of our study

810
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:27,591
friendship quality friendship duration
autistic trace and opposite face mismatch

811
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:31,561
which is simply the difference
of my autistic traits

812
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:36,033
versus your basic traits
in a given value of friendship.

813
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,602
This study was

814
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:41,471
recently published, so

815
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:45,242
indices can go back into all the details.

816
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:51,715
So in a nutshell,
I what we find here is that

817
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,852
whereas individual autistic

818
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,055
traits were really related

819
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:03,760
with the principle quality in line
with previous studies

820
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:08,498
in our study of real life
social relationships, this

821
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,836
apparent relation was not significant

822
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,140
statistically, at least in the amount

823
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,609
of our sample size and

824
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,313
as we see, and it only appeared to show

825
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,684
a very weak interrelationship,
what was more

826
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:34,024
interesting was the as hypothesized,
the relationship

827
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:37,527
between the mismatch of autistic face
and the friendship quality.

828
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:42,232
And here we see that
the more the mismatch of autistic traits,

829
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,835
so the more different
the two people were in a given day,

830
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,804
the less satisfied appear in their

831
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,841
in their friendship

832
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:55,645
and this result was irrespective
of friendship, duration, age, sex

833
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:58,181
or even be able to say this these traits

834
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,618
and similar observations we found

835
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,921
with regard to

836
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:07,624
friendship duration,
we found no interrelation

837
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,192
in the relationship at all

838
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:12,529
between friends in duration,
individual autistic traits in our sample.

839
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,165
But we indeed found

840
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,167
an interrelationship between

841
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,603
mismatch of autistic traits
and friendship duration.

842
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:25,142
So the key consequence
of friendship quality that contributed to

843
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,845
this kind of results
were interpersonal acceptance, closeness.

844
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:29,679
And so

845
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,920
so based on our empirical observations,

846
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,791
we can speculate and suggest the future

847
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,828
directions of research, relevant work

848
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,031
which will examine the

849
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,369
dialectical phenomenon
between different levels

850
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:55,972
of analysis from the collective
to the individual and back.

851
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,142
So for example, in this case,
we can speculate that

852
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,445
potentially potential higher
interpersonal attunement

853
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,815
between people might lead
to smoother social interactions,

854
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:09,753
which in turn
might transform our interactions in

855
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,957
with another person
and in a more rewarding form.

856
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,627
So we are more happy to communicate
with a specific person.

857
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:18,662
And this

858
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:20,697
may have

859
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:24,501
been found to enhance
even interpersonal attraction about term,

860
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,938
and this attraction might increase

861
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:31,374
the motivation to interact further
and to more frequent.

862
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,110
The interaction with the other
might boost interaction with success.

863
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:38,014
And this impression of success might

864
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,318
contribute back to higher interpersonal
with humans.

865
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,688
Of course, such a process, simplification

866
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,656
and more experiments

867
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,725
are needed

868
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,595
to examine the different stages of such a

869
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,932
a procedure in real life.

870
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,238
So in our discussion, we'll examine

871
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,041
some limitations
and future direction of our work.

872
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,009
First

873
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,146
we can

874
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:13,783
and should measure
more finding mechanisms

875
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,220
in a more clearly modulatory experiments

876
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,223
using hyper scanning and computational

877
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:22,359
modeling

878
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:26,029
in order to tap into a more

879
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,098
detail mechanisms

880
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,367
of this kind of phenomenon.

881
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:34,070
Also, in the future, we can

882
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,840
deploy unmediated
face to face interactions

883
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,909
such as real life monitoring of
verbal thoughts and behavior.

884
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:45,348
We should
examine also a more heterogeneous

885
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:49,753
assumption of the population
for example, of mixed gender, population

886
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:54,090
or cross-cultural diets and groups
or even

887
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,894
groups of the same cultural,
but of different

888
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,563
socioeconomic background
or educational background.

889
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,667
Certain scales of social interaction

890
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,870
dynamics can be incorporated

891
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,439
and here we drawing on

892
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,209
the left instrument hypothesis,

893
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,613
we suggest to continue

894
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:21,351
with longitudinal tracking of two person
and collective psychopathology

895
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:24,888
so that we also monitor the

896
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,826
development of such kind of attunement
or resettlement

897
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:34,230
across several years in real life
scenarios.

898
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,301
Also,
clinical studies are needed in order

899
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:41,371
to examine these kind of hypotheses

900
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:46,643
across as we saw different types of dyads
or groups

901
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,679
which will include autistic
or other condition

902
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:54,317
dyads, typical ones, but also

903
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,853
mixed ones

904
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,690
indeed, which have already started

905
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,494
in collaboration
with victims, OK, and lexical cohesion

906
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:10,600
to deploying such studies in order to tap
into their brain mechanisms

907
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,270
using both EEG, hyper scanning,

908
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,173
ephemera, type scanning, and hopefully

909
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:19,843
shown in.

910
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:23,480
These are gone
when the situation stabilizes

911
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,517
in terms of the content

912
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,653
and also we at the same time

913
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,757
analyze for some expressions
between two people

914
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:39,062
and here
we also already saw how two people

915
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:42,332
might synchronize expressions
when they interact

916
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:44,634
in real time

917
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:48,071
potential ghost and similar along

918
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,240
with what we showed before.

919
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,308
So before concluding,

920
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:57,046
I would like to draw a sketch
of our future computational glance.

921
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,615
Here we have

922
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:02,752
on a paper which is called Beyond One
Base and Brain.

923
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:07,624
We have suggested that we should go
beyond an individual Bayesian

924
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,960
modeling of being isolated

925
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,164
brain towards and collective models

926
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:18,001
which will capture both interests,
objective beliefs and interests,

927
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:22,472
objective confidence of beliefs,
but also intersubjective coupling

928
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,041
here in this

929
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:26,576
paper

930
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,013
from 2007,

931
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:33,450
we were based on previous
work of Don Izzo

932
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:39,656
and Chris Mathis which is

933
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:44,294
developed around the metabolism
to level and

934
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,197
meters from skin

935
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,403
and for concluding if

936
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:57,307
we should to mention that then
especially in the last two

937
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,810
or three years, more and more evidence

938
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:05,348
appearing in favor of

939
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,518
a viewing psychopathology

940
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:12,155
as an interpersonal attunement

941
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,258
and not only as exclusively

942
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,760
a disorder of the brain

943
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:22,532
and to if this evidence,
at least in certain levels

944
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:27,103
of description, holds
so valid and robust, one can imagine that

945
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,440
apart from examining

946
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:35,345
and treating an individual

947
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:39,082
and diagnosing individuals,

948
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:44,721
we can pass through a more

949
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,690
comprehensive social approaches
where we will

950
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:52,161
at the same time treating an individual
with a certain condition.

951
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:55,732
But at the same time,
we will also inform the society about

952
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,835
these conditions.

953
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:02,305
So in a way, our approach points towards

954
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:06,042
not shunning only persons
with specific condition

955
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:11,080
into the incidental norm
of our current cultural context.

956
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,684
But tries to foster

957
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,453
an interpersonal meeting

958
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,990
as a model, if you will,

959
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,860
so for example, of course,
we don't suggest deploying,

960
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,063
for example, to psychopharmacology
in the general population,

961
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,399
but for example, with

962
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,269
informational campaigns in schools

963
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:36,639
and we did such and such

964
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:39,909
is a tuning of social expectations of

965
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:43,012
or enrichment, if you will,

966
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,380
in order

967
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:49,586
to provide a more inclusive society
for everybody

968
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,455
also approach approach

969
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:54,991
points towards

970
00:59:54,991 --> 01:00:00,363
a treatment of the into interaction
assets in line with on a participatory

971
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,733
sense making traditions where we envision

972
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,571
modern schools, for example,
that would care about

973
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,574
tuning the medium of communication
between people.

974
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,410
For example, in a previous work we have

975
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:18,848
suggested developing educational systems

976
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:24,020
mediated through computers
or even social robotics

977
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,256
or serious gaming
between two individuals,

978
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,694
which could alleviate
some initial social pressures

979
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:35,765
and allow people to communicate smoother
in the first steps of

980
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,102
development of communication between

981
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:40,203
two people

982
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:47,844
as we have seen before I in this

983
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:53,249
scheme, we can simply observe
our suggestion is

984
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:58,321
trying to treat
this kind of interpersonal attunement

985
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,891
between two individuals
who are autistic and autistic,

986
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:05,128
for example, which might diverge

987
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:08,431
if left unnoticed by treating

988
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:12,502
not only the autistic individual,
but also the neurotypical individual,

989
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:15,805
and also trying

990
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:19,175
to take care of their interaction
with training

991
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:23,579
and between them
but in a way that of the end result,

992
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,716
we are left with a tune deaf

993
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:29,519
and not tuned to individuals.

994
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:33,723
So what we see
is that people can communicate smoothly

995
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:38,961
into the other
and the we don't care about identifying

996
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,766
ideal normal against the weeds.

997
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,735
Other

998
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,605
types and styles of

999
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:53,209
communication should conform

1000
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,312
so in this work

1001
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:01,150
concluding, taken together,
we have argued that social interaction

1002
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:05,888
does indeed matter
across various contexts and

1003
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,157
timescales.

1004
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,927
And in fact we even consider the question

1005
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:14,397
of social interaction
as a fundamental philosophical question.

1006
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:19,902
And so argument
here is a genuinely existential one. Yes.

1007
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:23,306
Without social interaction,
we cannot even exist as humans

1008
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,211
thank you very much

1009
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:30,913
for your kind of attention,
and I would like to thank

1010
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:35,785
several people that have collaborated
with us across the last

1011
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:39,989
five or six years in order for us
to accomplish

1012
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,426
a vast amount of experiments

1013
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,063
of about 400

1014
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,465
people, and especially

1015
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:52,535
my academic advisor, Leonard Zilber,

1016
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:59,675
who assisted me
in the journey of the last six years.

1017
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:01,677
Thank you very much.

1018
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,080
I'll be happy now to receive any question

1019
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,849
and to happily discuss

1020
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:10,419
Excellent.

1021
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:13,456
Maybe you can share your screen
and we can take it from there.

1022
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:18,227
Well, thanks for this really amazing talk

1023
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:22,532
that was truly something special
and we got a bunch of questions.

1024
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:25,434
Maybe you can share
and then you'll return to regular mode.

1025
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,204
Back to me.

1026
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,273
You can share your screen in digits. Yes.

1027
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:31,374
Yeah. Hmm.

1028
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:36,045
So for everybody who's watching live,
we have a bunch of questions already,

1029
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:37,513
and you can ask more,

1030
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:40,049
and I'll just ask them just in the order
that they were presented.

1031
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,385
So, Alex, a question.

1032
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:46,689
What are the connections
or disconnections of the dialectical

1033
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:51,627
perspectives that you brought up
and Monism or Markovic and Monism?

1034
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,897
So can you please repeat this question?

1035
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:55,331
Yeah.

1036
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,201
How do we think about the similarities
and dissimilarities

1037
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:03,139
of the dialectical perspectives
that you address and mark Jovian Monism.

1038
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:07,210
Like, kind of remarkable
blanket everything Yes.

1039
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:10,479
So I have recently

1040
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:15,318
come across a couple of folks claiming

1041
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,821
in Monism and I think from

1042
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,358
your wisdom and colleagues and so on.

1043
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:26,696
But fortunately, to be honest,
I haven't had the opportunity here

1044
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:31,133
to go through these kind of accounts,
not to draw the similarities.

1045
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,502
But I can tell you, for example,

1046
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,939
our approach serves
a lot of commonalities.

1047
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:39,942
For example, we spoke of multiple

1048
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:44,914
states, for example, and colleagues
who have argued in favor

1049
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,817
of a multi scale and nested

1050
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,221
Markov blanket

1051
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:53,623
process.

1052
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:58,427
So our account serves commonalities
with these.

1053
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,329
So it's kind of multi scale approaches.

1054
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:05,668
How much of your research work
also goes through these kinds of

1055
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:07,970
directions?

1056
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:10,439
Perhaps one.

1057
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:13,542
One difference might be that in our case,

1058
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:20,750
we don't take the predictive active
inference account

1059
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,552
strictly or theologically,

1060
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:26,455
but we use it as a tool in order to model

1061
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:31,427
and capture
specific parts of the process.

1062
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:35,564
So we don't necessarily presuppose
and nested

1063
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:39,602
a blanket scene in reality,

1064
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,470
but we still view them

1065
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:45,775
as a very useful way of interrogating

1066
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,645
these kinds of processes formally.

1067
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:50,079
Nice.

1068
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,416
That really maps to the realism
instrumental ism

1069
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:57,153
discussion
we've been having in these discussions.

1070
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,655
So here's another question from Sasha.

1071
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:04,427
She wrote, What activities
or mental states are amenable

1072
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:07,363
to creating interpersonal attunement
for adults?

1073
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:10,766
What kind of activities?

1074
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,368
What kind of activities?

1075
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,303
What kind of improvizational

1076
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:18,107
or or synchronous or you're studying it
in a very specific case.

1077
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:21,310
But as far as just our day to day life,
what kind of activities

1078
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:24,547
do you think create that sort
of interpersonal two minute for adults?

1079
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:28,517
OK. Yeah. So

1080
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,519
as we saw in the presentation,

1081
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:33,622
I give a simple

1082
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:36,459
example of interpersonal humans

1083
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,895
between a caregiver and a child
in order to stress

1084
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:43,733
how this kind of interpersonal attunement
is crucial

1085
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,603
and not just about our interpersonal
with humans.

1086
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:49,238
But also about survival.

1087
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:51,240
So we are we cannot escape.

1088
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,745
I am actually interpersonal as human
because otherwise we don't exist

1089
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,482
neither biologically
but not even as humans.

1090
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:04,053
So what whatever we learn from language
and symbolic functions comes

1091
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:07,523
from developmentally acquired knowledge.

1092
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,893
And which has been, of course

1093
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:13,262
being possible through

1094
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:15,598
larger evolutionary schemes.

1095
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,734
But after we gather this kind of

1096
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,270
capacities,

1097
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,773
I think actually another important point
is that

1098
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:27,076
I feel that certain paradigms in the past

1099
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:33,282
have been helpful
but also constitute certain

1100
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,652
human functioning

1101
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:39,822
as starting a taking for some process

1102
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:43,492
minus a given start statically so,

1103
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,929
and then try to interrogate how

1104
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:50,900
these kinds of theories of mind process
play out in interactions.

1105
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,003
So we see here
that if we take a more historical

1106
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,172
developmental approach, we see that

1107
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,277
of course one feedback to the other,
the individual level, to the collective,

1108
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:07,183
what we see here, the primacy, you know,
we go to can we progress the collective.

1109
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,052
So first we are

1110
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,955
in tune with others
and then we build ourselves.

1111
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:15,524
And in the adult life,

1112
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:19,361
I believe social interaction itself
and the experience of the other

1113
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:23,432
is what can allow us to assume

1114
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:27,103
to others in different
in many different levels.

1115
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:31,340
For example,
yes, as I said before, in isolated

1116
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,810
places, the people do have the chance
to communicate with others.

1117
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:39,748
Might, if one you want to use
a Bayesian terminology,

1118
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:45,321
they might develop so six priors
in terms of their social expectations

1119
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:48,958
but when they experience
other people from other places,

1120
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:51,660
they're unable to

1121
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,697
tune their beliefs into one.

1122
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,966
Let's just freely speaking, for example,

1123
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:01,570
in this case of so strictly formed
beliefs,

1124
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:06,809
people might face
such a tremendous difficulty in updating

1125
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,679
and like they need to use so much
analysis of their prior prior beliefs.

1126
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,116
So they form the cross development,
which might even

1127
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:17,720
escape

1128
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,525
to other malicious strategies
in order to confirm their

1129
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:28,230
the inner expectations to the outer
world, even by, for example, violence

1130
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:31,534
or even killing, exterminating the other
because they cannot trust

1131
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:37,072
up their minds
around the existence of other

1132
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,377
and the manifestation of other types of

1133
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:42,511
belief systems.

1134
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,714
For example, you can see in the history,
for example, a lot of times when

1135
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:50,653
people from different belief systems or

1136
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,758
or even different

1137
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,728
economic interests

1138
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:03,899
close together,
and we see that many times, instead of

1139
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:07,970
being able to adapt to each other,
people find them through each other.

1140
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:12,041
So I think the key here is early AIDS

1141
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:15,945
exposure to various forms

1142
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:19,748
of life and to and beliefs.

1143
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:24,687
So naturally, organically,
people can assume to each other.

1144
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,557
I think as we saw, there are procedures
like language that might even be

1145
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:33,963
maybe more liberal, but still a window
of this kind of for a human.

1146
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,967
So I think we are more open
for tuning with others in the world

1147
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,803
in an earlier age than later, but still

1148
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,505
through experience

1149
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,776
and both

1150
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:52,081
through educating ourselves, for example,
but more crucially, such an approach

1151
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:58,120
would even go further, suggesting
that individual training is not enough,

1152
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:03,259
like even if we try to educate ourselves
and to

1153
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:08,430
and realize that we have acquired biases

1154
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,700
against other people,

1155
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:17,640
this might not be enough
even to eliminate all implicit biases

1156
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,011
and perhaps only in real practice
in the practice of real

1157
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,713
time social interaction. This these

1158
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:28,517
models, if you want them, can be rebuilt

1159
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:30,219
Mm hmm.

1160
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,121
Really important points.

1161
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,656
Thanks for sharing that.

1162
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:36,392
Another question
in the chat from Stephen is,

1163
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:40,863
is there a hypothesis
that people on the autistic spectrum

1164
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:45,267
exhibit different traits
due to perception and action dynamics

1165
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:49,104
being different rather than, for example,
just the brain structures

1166
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:52,207
limiting their generative model.

1167
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,809
Please repeat the question.

1168
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:54,877
I think so.

1169
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:55,711
Yeah.

1170
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:59,515
Is there a hypothesis that people
on the autism spectrum exhibit

1171
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:03,352
different traits due to their perception
and action dynamics being different

1172
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,088
rather than just their brain structures
being different?

1173
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,328
Can you hear me?

1174
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,063
Yes, sorry, but I'm sorry.

1175
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:17,599
But I'm losing connection
at certain points. Hmm.

1176
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,002
I can hear you. Perhaps.

1177
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,272
Perhaps
my internet connection is not good.

1178
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:25,574
How about just
if you could reload on your page.

1179
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,844
And how can I fix it up?

1180
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,546
Just hit the reload on your browser

1181
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,082
on the window.

1182
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:38,687
Nice.

1183
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:46,762
You know?

1184
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:48,764
Yep. Yep. Sound good?

1185
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:49,398
Good.

1186
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,768
OK, now I've seen you better and better.

1187
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:54,970
Could you please repeat
the last question? Great.

1188
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,539
Last question was, is there any

1189
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:01,043
hypothesis that people on the autism
spectrum have different

1190
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:05,147
traits due to their perception
and action dynamics being different

1191
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:08,851
rather than just brain differences.

1192
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:13,622
So if I understood correctly,
I disconnected my comment.

1193
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:14,390
That's what I'm thinking.

1194
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:19,061
Maybe I can hear a bit through the song
if I understand correctly.

1195
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:23,198
Is that
whether acoustic people might differ

1196
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:27,870
not only in terms of brain function,
but also

1197
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,874
actual and perceptual space? Yes.

1198
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:34,543
So yeah. Yeah. This exactly.

1199
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,645
This exactly

1200
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,315
what our hypothesis is putting upon.

1201
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,786
It argues that people,

1202
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,289
autistic people
and other so-called neurotypical people

1203
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:50,092
might differ

1204
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,462
across different levels of description

1205
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:56,865
from brain function to

1206
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,370
and so the way that they generate

1207
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:03,906
expectations,
especially about the social world

1208
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:07,743
and to the way
that they express this expectations,

1209
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,779
especially about others

1210
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:14,650
so grounded in individual accounts
of predictive

1211
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,520
processing and active inference we are
you hear that

1212
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:23,492
and in taking predictive
processing and active inference.

1213
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:28,931
So two main pillars we see here

1214
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,900
that when you conform to systems that

1215
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,771
entertain completely different complaints
about different

1216
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,541
styles of

1217
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:43,412
generating and expressing
social expectations, and

1218
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,015
this might create
images of human situation

1219
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:50,319
where this style is

1220
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,690
less spontaneous as we're currently

1221
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,727
evolving and more and more divergent

1222
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:02,931
situation.

1223
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:08,203
So starting from simply taking
the precision of dating single brains

1224
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:13,342
we can reach to through predictive
crossing, to generating

1225
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,346
of social expectations about others
to and through active inference.

1226
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:18,847
So the way we generate

1227
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:21,517
or express or

1228
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:24,353
express this expectation
through action for others,

1229
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,923
and especially when we take into account
the other, also we see

1230
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:32,327
how the similarity of the similarity
of these ways can contribute

1231
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:36,231
and in different scenarios.

1232
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,935
So for example,

1233
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,938
borrowing the terminology
of dynamical system, for example,

1234
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:48,911
one can see how this
how the how taking into how considering

1235
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:53,849
these dyad, this one system
and how this system

1236
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:57,019
can evolve

1237
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:59,154
very differently when even when

1238
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,723
a small mismatches up

1239
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:05,761
is in the beginning of an interaction.

1240
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:09,665
Banks and it just sort of

1241
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:13,435
cracked me up because we're almost
replicating your experiment.

1242
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:16,705
We're having a mediated
dialectic, a dialog

1243
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:21,443
and then now you can see me,
but I can't see your face.

1244
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,813
And yet there's even another level
of the affordance

1245
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:27,950
with our friends and colleagues
who can ask us questions

1246
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,752
and it's like everybody
has their own perspective.

1247
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,256
Every question is coming
to the top of the mind for someone.

1248
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:37,526
And then it's through that interaction

1249
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:41,430
that we're who we are as individuals
and as a lab.

1250
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:46,835
So just really cool to hear
how you brought complexity science

1251
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:50,672
and all these different world
knowledge tradition together

1252
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,009
to also address like very,
very prescient social issues.

1253
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,111
So another question from the chat.

1254
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,679
Yvonne asks

1255
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,882
How can I be sure that someone else's
social beliefs are actually the

1256
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:01,483
same as mine?

1257
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:03,952
How can I believe?

1258
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,722
How can
we how can I be sure that someone's

1259
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:10,092
social beliefs are the same as mine?

1260
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:11,193
OK. Yeah.

1261
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:14,162
So for that,

1262
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,832
I guess you can can never be sure

1263
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:18,767
like this. Exactly.

1264
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,936
The Bayesian framework also.

1265
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,704
That's the beauty of something.

1266
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:26,775
But we don't necessarily
dichotomized beliefs between for example,

1267
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:30,579
sure are true, but we place
on our beliefs different levels of

1268
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:35,884
different levels of confidence
or precision.

1269
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:41,857
And like in a recent collaboration
with some colleagues,

1270
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:45,160
as the legal case

1271
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:49,898
before we examine
conceptually the problem of trust.

1272
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:54,836
And there we argue, for example,
that trust in the personal trust

1273
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:58,173
is is

1274
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,942
is fundamental
in this kind of relationships.

1275
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:06,882
So based on our belief of predictability
of the other

1276
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:12,120
inconsistency and also that the other
would like to cheat as well.

1277
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,291
So on a belief of billions
and also on shared values.

1278
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:20,862
So we just accept that we have values
with some certain people

1279
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,130
based on these three

1280
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:24,032
points.

1281
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:29,071
We argue that people should necessarily
and the thing trust

1282
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,174
about others in social interactions

1283
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:34,876
in order to make our

1284
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,945
to make our

1285
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:40,916
trust interaction functioning well.

1286
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:45,320
We in fact argue with Christof more that

1287
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:52,294
this is inescapable
practice in real life social interactions

1288
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:56,665
because just because we are not able
to trust and monitor

1289
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,868
every possible

1290
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:02,704
incident around in our world.

1291
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:06,041
So the next possibility
is just to get paranoid

1292
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:10,011
and try to to control and monitor
the behavior of everybody

1293
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:13,682
in order to have access to everybody's
beliefs and actions

1294
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:18,019
but instead of
I think we as humans the trust,

1295
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:21,123
which of course sometimes

1296
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,759
we argue that's always crucial

1297
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,161
like already from there gathering

1298
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:31,166
from ancient societies,
like from Tomasello work,

1299
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:36,505
we see how people based on trust
were able to handle more complex,

1300
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:38,373
more complex

1301
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:40,909
scenarios and provide for themselves

1302
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,480
the means to survive
in ecological crisis.

1303
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:51,486
And but we also argue that trust
also can go wrong at certain times.

1304
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:56,024
And of course, in this in this case,
his betrayal of trust,

1305
01:19:56,024 --> 01:20:00,061
the whole them, the whole
the consequences can be dramatic

1306
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,398
and both in individual and social level.

1307
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:07,903
So these two, this work
where a little bit more is the first,

1308
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:13,842
but also all probably true
in a lot of the cool.

1309
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:17,913
Really nice point
about the trust in the sense making

1310
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:20,015
you know, you're giving sentence
after sentence.

1311
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:21,850
I just have to trust you.

1312
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,886
It just and anything cognitively
that demands

1313
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:28,256
more than just simply trusting you
is just not going to work.

1314
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,992
So here's a question from Laura
in the chat.

1315
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,528
Laura, writes, Thank you, Dr. Bolis.

1316
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:37,265
I would like to know
if it would be necessary to standardize

1317
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,301
the individuals from different cultures.

1318
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,703
Conform, composing a dyad

1319
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:44,539
to avoid distractors
when you evaluate the interaction.

1320
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:47,008
So how do we think about culture
and the dyad?

1321
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,810
How do we control or explore that?

1322
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,914
Yes. So on hypothesis, I

1323
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:56,551
would go beyond like

1324
01:20:56,785 --> 01:21:00,255
we used autism, I say paradigm example,
but go goes beyond that.

1325
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:04,326
And how it could accommodate

1326
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:09,464
any cultural or difference
or difference in beliefs

1327
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,334
in a simple way.

1328
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:17,472
Like I said, for example,
by the deploying dyad structure

1329
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:22,010
where we have homogeneous structure
they have structure, for example,

1330
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:26,381
people of the same
a cultural and people from the same

1331
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:29,451
because who and mixed for example groups

1332
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:36,224
and see how a different process play out
and then we can tease apart

1333
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:40,161
a place
a certain extent which processes are

1334
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:44,900
played out within specific countries

1335
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,802
or with what process might emerge

1336
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:51,439
out of just out of the communication
between cultures.

1337
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,642
And then we can maybe see how

1338
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:57,679
how the meeting of culture
can provide new possibilities.

1339
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:00,882
For example,
in some countries just one aspect

1340
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:04,719
in my mind, also

1341
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:07,622
socioeconomic background, it's
also of huge importance.

1342
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:11,159
So people are done differently

1343
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:14,596
in cultural practices,
but they differ a lot

1344
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:17,832
in their social economic background

1345
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:20,468
and their intentions and motivations.

1346
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:22,904
So some people

1347
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,942
try to change certain

1348
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:31,846
aspects of their social economic mix
because they are not satisfied.

1349
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:36,117
And even in the level
that they cannot survive

1350
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:39,754
as a group, other people try to preserve

1351
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:42,357
and maintain certain

1352
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,794
social, economic context, context.

1353
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:49,030
So I think it's a very
a very diverse market.

1354
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:52,934
And even in our case,
if we studied this the similarity

1355
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:57,973
of these traits and consider
this oversimplification, we found some

1356
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,742
interrelationship and friendship quality,

1357
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,945
but still that's just one factor.

1358
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:08,683
I think there are so many factors play
play out in interpersonal attunement,

1359
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:10,685
which

1360
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,989
is good
to try to isolate certain aspects.

1361
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:18,994
But I think at the end of the day,
we should try to make a choice

1362
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,129
to see the big picture in real life.

1363
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:22,998
More.

1364
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,735
It's almost like the ancients and their
different concepts of friendship,

1365
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:29,204
different kinds of friendship,
or different words for friendship.

1366
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:33,341
And so quality is going to be
a multidimensional attribute for student.

1367
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:37,712
So Tadd asks the question
One thing that humans seem to excel

1368
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:41,116
at is successfully interacting
with complete strangers.

1369
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,785
People
we have not yet had time to attuned to.

1370
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,755
How does your approach
explain or address this?

1371
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,991
Yes. So as I said,

1372
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:52,227
less interpersonal human
in the early development,

1373
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:55,163
I think and attachment
theories are very important here.

1374
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:56,464
So I think that

1375
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:58,500
we are

1376
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,970
embedded from day one to the social net

1377
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:04,506
and social cultural net of our world.

1378
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,977
And that's why we are able to communicate
with a complete stranger

1379
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:12,614
because just simply
because we both are quite

1380
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:15,517
common knowledge.

1381
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,153
This can be language, for example.

1382
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,321
So it's we can still communicate with

1383
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:24,059
an animal, for example,

1384
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,327
with our dog and

1385
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:31,299
but less successfully usually
than with other humans.

1386
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:35,670
But also we can see how dogs and humans
also came closer across evolution

1387
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:37,172
and we are more apt

1388
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:40,508
because we are in common ground here
and we are more able to communicate.

1389
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:44,145
So imagine other types of animals
in more ways than one.

1390
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:47,549
And usually we are more difficult
to communicate and make sense

1391
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:49,217
of these animals.

1392
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:51,319
But here again, trust
I think is very important.

1393
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:55,323
So we grew up in
completely different places that same

1394
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:57,926
completely different people.

1395
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,662
But and we don't know how each other

1396
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:03,498
grew up.

1397
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:07,102
So but just by sharing common values and,

1398
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:10,171
and common ground

1399
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:12,841
and just by being able

1400
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,844
to trust others,
this can make interaction functioning

1401
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:19,848
like when,
for example, people of different cultures

1402
01:25:20,882 --> 01:25:24,052
invaded other places that they see
for the first time people

1403
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:27,589
we saw atrocities, for example,
because people didn't trust

1404
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:30,892
the people that they met

1405
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:33,128
or they have, of course, other interests.

1406
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,731
But we see that when we meet an unknown
person,

1407
01:25:37,832 --> 01:25:40,435
of course, both possibilities are open.

1408
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:44,606
We can be kind and to functioning,
we can be also very vicious.

1409
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:49,344
I mean, this is human species
across our history. Yep.

1410
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,780
It's interesting
how you brought up the incentives

1411
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,782
and the intentions almost separately

1412
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:57,185
because there are situations
that could be win win,

1413
01:25:57,185 --> 01:25:59,654
but then the communication
or the narrative breaks down

1414
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:01,189
and then there's atrocity

1415
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:04,993
or there are cases when actually the game
theory is set up adversarial.

1416
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,062
I remember also reminds me of

1417
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:11,833
like our embodied
and cultured nature as humans

1418
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,002
and what we share
even when we don't share language,

1419
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:16,271
like when I've been traveling
and not spoken, the language

1420
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:19,374
I'll see some street food
and it's like it's

1421
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:22,610
you can communicate with your body
and with your actions that you think

1422
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,747
it looks like great food
or that you want the food

1423
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:29,083
and so it's like everyone tastes
the same taste molecules.

1424
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,487
Maybe it's a preference culturally,
whether it's spicy or sweet, but then

1425
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:36,324
that's still like a communication
and an interaction and an attunement

1426
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:39,928
that is with money that one person
is not familiar with a language

1427
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:43,531
and a context that's really nice.

1428
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:44,666
I mean, basically.

1429
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:46,801
I'll ask one more question
or is that cool?

1430
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:48,469
Yes, yes.

1431
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:50,972
Sure. OK, I have two more questions.

1432
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:53,908
First one is where does active inference
come into play?

1433
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:58,112
Or where do you see active inference
being able to sort of meet

1434
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:02,150
this very large philosophical tradition
that you're bringing here?

1435
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:05,453
You know, so

1436
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:08,256
and as we
saw in the beginning of the presentation,

1437
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:11,259
I, I see activity

1438
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:13,328
present, predictive processing as

1439
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:18,733
let's say
dialectical interplay of two strategies

1440
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,436
has suggested from conversation
with other people before.

1441
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:25,607
There's an interplay for making sense

1442
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:27,875
of that and acting upon the world

1443
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,545
in order for us to survive.

1444
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:34,449
So I see active inference
as there is then

1445
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:38,686
the active possibility we have

1446
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:42,690
in order to maintain our living form. So

1447
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:48,129
not just by conforming with environment,
but changing the environment.

1448
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:51,332
And I found this very neat.

1449
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:56,404
What I found when meeting this account is
that we can, with the same terminology,

1450
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:59,974
we can account for both perceptual
learning

1451
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,645
purposes and collective action.

1452
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:08,283
So we see how our perception, learning
and action becomes just one more process.

1453
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:11,686
That's
I see them as the electrical phenomena

1454
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:14,422
and are as inseparable.

1455
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:19,160
And what I try
when I start studying these processes,

1456
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:23,164
some a nine years ago

1457
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,902
in Zurich, this class and

1458
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,737
this completely transformed

1459
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:32,373
the way I see
even the world, say, myself,

1460
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:35,810
but gradually start feeling

1461
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:41,282
that just by focusing
on individual courses

1462
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:45,453
or even more sort of inference
practices, crossing might

1463
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:48,756
limit our scope of interpretation.

1464
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:52,593
So these are exactly my peers
they have tried

1465
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:56,731
to bring together different,

1466
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:58,533
different philosophical

1467
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,735
or scientific frameworks

1468
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,172
to try to embed

1469
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,708
this kind of account
in a more social, cultural,

1470
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,711
real life context.

1471
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:14,315
So in this in this effort, for example,
also of ecological

1472
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:17,952
and active approaches
that I felt are instrumental also.

1473
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,355
So, you know,

1474
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:25,193
so I, I can,
I would like to see in the future

1475
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,964
a fusion of philosophical approaches
that they see

1476
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:34,001
the wholeness of the real life
phenomenon, such as dialectics with more

1477
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:39,040
formal ways of interpreting data
such as active inference

1478
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:43,845
and also more ecological
and active approach and complexity

1479
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:47,281
approach dynamical system
in one in our study.

1480
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:53,154
And to see, as I say, for example,
a 11 way I have seen these companies

1481
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:58,726
that like simply perhaps
in one paper of ours, we suggested that

1482
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:01,596
we not

1483
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:05,867
bring together the Olympics
and then activism with active insurance.

1484
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:09,871
We can still keep our emphasis
on social interactions

1485
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:14,909
and the embeddedness or or of organisms

1486
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:18,846
in the social work, but also

1487
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:20,815
also using

1488
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:23,151
powerful computational tools

1489
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:27,588
to examine the individual brains
which are embedded in the system.

1490
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:31,159
So I think an extension of this kind
of active inference accounts,

1491
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:34,896
perhaps through one
such as Chris Matheson to Zamboni.

1492
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:38,366
So what if they have proposed
to level metabolism

1493
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,935
in approaches where

1494
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:45,740
by deploying this they have they
so this is this kind of framework

1495
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:49,410
for studying both learning and decision
making into levels.

1496
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:52,613
And we have suggested
that we can re-appropriate

1497
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:57,418
these kinds of models for studying
individual brains and collective action

1498
01:30:58,586 --> 01:30:59,720
in the same model.

1499
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:04,592
And this to our suggestion is here,
but these two levels

1500
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:07,361
might not even entertain
the same mechanisms

1501
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,565
so in, in the brain,

1502
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:14,502
we might have a certain way
of minimize prediction error

1503
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:17,672
and keep a consistent form
in social interactions.

1504
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:21,242
Between people might have different
mechanisms that might have been described

1505
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:25,813
more efficiently with an activist,
for example, for dynamical systems.

1506
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:30,384
But I think by bringing together
these tools and more complete

1507
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:35,389
picture of both the sociological

1508
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:40,027
processes and the actual mechanisms

1509
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:43,064
of the biological level might
and how this feedback

1510
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:46,767
to one
another might become more apparent.

1511
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:50,071
So while, you know, I was going to ask

1512
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:53,641
what the next research steps were,
that was quite an agenda.

1513
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:55,743
I mean, it's really awesome.

1514
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:58,646
Maybe just on a closing question, note,

1515
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:03,918
what would you like to just close with
or where are we going to go from here?

1516
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:06,120
What are your next research steps or what

1517
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:09,023
are you excited to see the community
be looking into?

1518
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:13,127
Yeah, I just mentioned
I would be very excited

1519
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:18,332
to see this kind of a school of folks
coming more closely together.

1520
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:23,771
I think more and more people are working
lately on this, bringing insights of

1521
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:28,743
how more social interaction
all approaches and more

1522
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:31,646
formal

1523
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:35,750
brain approaches together,
and also of philosophy and practice.

1524
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:39,353
I think it's very important here
is because you obviously do that

1525
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:43,324
and like a fact, these

1526
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,895
data are not never objective

1527
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:52,366
facts
so as soon as we gather specific data

1528
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:56,370
already we are in theory,
so only the way we deploy.

1529
01:32:56,637 --> 01:32:59,206
But I think philosophy is very important
here to

1530
01:32:59,707 --> 01:33:02,843
to form new experiments and new models,

1531
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:06,380
not only for interpreting

1532
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:10,017
data and also
this is from the research part,

1533
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:13,387
but also the practice is very important.

1534
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:14,989
So I would like

1535
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:19,627
really these kind of approaches
to be used in practice in real life.

1536
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,529
For example, in

1537
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:24,532
psychiatry, it's one domain where we can

1538
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:27,635
reexamine the more holistically certain

1539
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:31,105
kind conditions,
for example, in the past,

1540
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:36,010
which are more sociological,
more like social psychology examples.

1541
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,679
Also the external factors and

1542
01:33:39,947 --> 01:33:41,983
impacts
of society and specific conditions

1543
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:46,253
later, which have more cognitive model
where in biological genetic models

1544
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:48,856
where we try to identify

1545
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:51,492
redefine

1546
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:55,029
psychiatric condition
based on the genetics or

1547
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:58,165
cognitive abilities,

1548
01:33:58,165 --> 01:34:00,401
I would be very happy to see now

1549
01:34:00,935 --> 01:34:04,005
these two coming together
and one informs the other.

1550
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:06,674
So a more evidence based

1551
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:08,743
and holistic sociological approach

1552
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:11,312
in in concrete concrete,

1553
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,416
the applications of social policy

1554
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:19,854
such as psychiatry, education,
and other societal

1555
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:21,589
domains

1556
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:25,259
wow. Very cool.

1557
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:29,463
So thanks a lot for joining
this guest stream too.

1558
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:33,334
It was really a great discussion
and really we're looking forward

1559
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,803
to seeing what happens
with this line of research

1560
01:34:35,803 --> 01:34:38,939
and hopefully talking
to you and colleagues at future times.

1561
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:40,941
So we'll certainly see you around.

1562
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:42,543
Thank you very much.

1563
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:47,014
For inviting and thank you very much
for your great initiative and providing

1564
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:50,785
these seminars,
which are very illuminating so far.

1565
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:51,819
Awesome.

1566
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:52,853
Talk to you later

1567
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:55,156
So bye.

1568
01:34:55,456 --> 01:34:58,225
Bye, bye!
