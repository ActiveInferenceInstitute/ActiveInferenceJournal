00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
hello and welcome everyone to active inference lab to the guest stream the

30
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
active inference guest stream number 2.1 on march 18 2021 featuring Dimitris

40
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Bolis and this is going to be a really awesome discussion on a wide variety of topics

50
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
so i'll just pass it to Dimitris to introduce himself and take it away we're going to have a presentation first and

60
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
then we'll be documenting questions from the live chat so please drop any thoughts or questions in there and then

70
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we'll have a discussion after this presentation so thanks again for coming on the stream we really appreciate the

80
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
time and please take it away hello everybody

90
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
um i'm very happy being here thank you very much the organizers for um organizing and presenting such an

100
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
interesting series of short seminars so today

110
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
i will like to present you a work that we have been doing

120
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
primarily the last six years in munich

130
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in collaboration with leonard zilbach and his group in max planck and

140
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
basically the title i interact therefore i am human becoming in and through social

150
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
interaction is the title of my phd dissertation

160
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
that i was presented last year about this month

170
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so for anybody that would like more

180
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
details at the end of the talk they would always go back to the document it's already

190
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
published in researchgate and there you can find also the

200
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
already first papers that came out from this work but more

210
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
are coming in the way in the next few months so

220
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
i'll start by presenting the outline of this presentation so first we will go

230
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
through the theoretical work which consists of the dialectical and human

240
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
hypothesis and the dialectical missed human hypothesis which

250
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
both focus and emphasize the importance of social interaction

260
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
in human becoming across various contexts from and various scales from evolution to

270
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
cultural development and psychopathology then importantly we will discuss

280
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
concrete empirical methodologies with regards to how we can put into the

290
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
formal test this kind of hypothesis and which we

300
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
call to personal psychophysiology because this work tries to extend

310
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the traditional psychophysiology work in the social domain so

320
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we will see how based on hyperscanning research for example

330
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
we integrate different streams of studying

340
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
for monitoring recording and analyzing

350
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and data in high resolution from multiple people at the same time that they are able to interact in

360
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
real time then we will go through the empirical work and the first two studies

370
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and which is about the interpersonal achievement in real-time social interactions and

380
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
especially through js and second about the interpersonal

390
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
arms of humans in real life social relationships and this is with regards to artistic traits

400
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and interpersonal similarity and fourth we will discuss

410
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
some scientific and societal implications of this work and

420
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we will briefly conclude so the theoretical work is based on

430
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
two main pillars that's a philosophical

440
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
framework developed across many centuries going back to ancient

450
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
years in ancient greece and also ancient china

460
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
or india and we will go through more details later

470
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but this was developed further in more modern times in especially in france and germany

480
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and also we lean upon heavily the bayesian brain

490
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
hypothesis and especially the framework of predictive processing and active inference

500
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
so i guess most of the people here might be already familiar with these frameworks

510
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
but i would like to go through a simple example um just to make clear the

520
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
practical implications of this kind of frameworks

530
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
so let us imagine um lady waking up

540
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
late for her work and so she cannot decide what to wear for

550
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
going to work but based on her previous experience as she lives

560
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
in the south part of greece in crete she believes that

570
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
most probably the weather will be good and sunny so she decides to go out without carrying

580
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
an umbrella or a coat however these days is unlikely

590
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
so instead contrary to her predictions

600
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the weather was rainy and that day she got wet the second day even though she

610
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
believed that the probability for raining might be five percent so she increased her the

620
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
probability her beliefs about the probability of reigning and however she still

630
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
decided not to carry an umbrella this continues for a week

640
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
where she finally have come to come to believe that the

650
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
probability of raining even in this period in this place was 90 percent and decided

660
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to carry an umbrella so we see here how she gradually updated her beliefs based

670
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
on the evidence that he observed in real life and gradually

680
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
let us imagine another illustrative example the same lady goes for vacations

690
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
to japan and she again is laid to go out and she

700
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
has not decided whether she needs to carry an umbrella if you're not based on rumors in this

710
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
um time she again believes that the weather will be good so she's slightly dressed

720
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
however again she's again unlucky and the weather is raining

730
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
so already um in this case the lady for example

740
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
in this for this from the second day already she believes that the probability of framing

750
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
will be 90 so we see here example uh regarding the

760
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
updating of the weather beliefs why is that happening here from ebay

770
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
asian perspective one could argue that in this case that her beliefs were

780
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
formed quickly through social rumors they were more less confident so more

790
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
susceptible into change when faced with contradictory evidence

800
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that's a very important factor in the base and brain hypothesis

810
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
i will not go through the mathematical details but with this very simple

820
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
simplifying examples we examine two cardinal aspects of such accounts

830
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
namely the updating of beliefs through integrating

840
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
a prior knowledge and new data

850
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and also we examine the learning rate of

860
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
this procedure which is thought of as a

870
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
um a weighted precision prediction error which means

880
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
that the more confident we are about our previous beliefs

890
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
the less likely we are to update them in phase of contradictory

900
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
information so this framework

910
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
has gained much attention over the last years first because as we see we can it's

920
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
a useful in examining various

930
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
real life scenarios and put them into formal equations

940
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and models which can be formally examined and

950
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
tested against one another

960
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
so of course the outline of this account that we've drawn so far

970
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
it's rather simplistic so in this case we only examined this scenario that one

980
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
person observes passively the world and

990
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
their only choice is to update their beliefs

1000
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
according to what they observe so these scalpers have

1010
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
mentioned resembles in some aspects the old plato's cave allegory where humans

1020
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
were nothing else that than prisoners from the whole for their whole lives in

1030
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
a deep cave where they never experienced the outer world and their only experience

1040
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
about their environment was through projections on a wall through siders of

1050
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the real objects that are reflected on the world in front of them so this we can imagine um

1060
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
in a way humans or other organisms exam experiencing the world

1070
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
in a manner like that as we have specific sensory organs

1080
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
where information from the world is projected and we

1090
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
selectively experience the reality around us of course this is

1100
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
just a partial image of what is happening one

1110
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
right away can think of a second avenue of

1120
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
achievement between the organism and the environment so as we said it first said the organism tries to

1130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
minimize prediction error through perception and learning by adjusting their own beliefs to the environment but

1140
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
of course an organism can also update their beliefs through action so that they selectively

1150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
transform and some the world in a way that it conforms to their initial beliefs

1160
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
so so this is i con constitutes a more comprehensive

1170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
account of organismic life and especially human life but

1180
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
we will argue in line with other recent accounts in this talk that this is

1190
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
account is still not enough on its own because it considers individual organisms um

1200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
out of context out of their social context and especially with regards to humans out of the

1210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
crucial cultural context as well in our effort to embed this um kind of

1220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
accounts we have leaned on um the electrical approach

1230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
which as i am we saw before um it consists in constitutes a school of

1240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
thought which goes back to ancient years and continues until

1250
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
these years always enrich in different historical contexts so the importance of this

1260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
framework is that it emphasizes unity of phenomena

1270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
it does neglect inner contradictions and emphasize movement of phenomena or

1280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
change and so a situation of crisis or radical changes

1290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
it doesn't seem to this account as problematic but also as chances of

1300
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
updating and embracing so this kind of accounts try to overcome

1310
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
dichotomies such as the organism and the environment the individual in the collective

1320
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
or as we will see in our work even a patient versus their cultural

1330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
context special emphasis is given

1340
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
not only in intra-level processes but also between level processes across

1350
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
various temporal scales so this account goes against

1360
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
both dualism and reductionism as it tries to examine

1370
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
phenomena in the wholeness but without

1380
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
metaphysically assuming independent levels of reality

1390
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
um traditionally sciences

1400
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
for good reasons also for lack of tools have

1410
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
focused on specific levels of description of reality such as

1420
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
for example the physical or biological level or the psychophysiological level

1430
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
this kind of studies have provided important insights

1440
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
however when examined um isolated in single levels we will argue

1450
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
it doesn't provide the whole picture of complex phenomena such as psycho

1460
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
sociocultural or psychiatric phenomena so in this

1470
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
work we have argued that even deploying simple

1480
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
research paradigms will be crucial to try to

1490
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
probe and monitor processes that live on different levels

1500
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
of description based on this

1510
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
assumption we have reviewed human becoming as a dialectic of internalization and

1520
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
externalization and more precisely connected the internalization processes

1530
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
to predictive processing which as we saw from our examples

1540
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
is the mechanism of updating our own beliefs in order to

1550
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
conform to the environmental regularities and we connected the externalization

1560
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
processes and especially collective externalization processes to active inference

1570
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
which is a process of co-regulating the outer world and especially the social world

1580
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
according to our inner beliefs but also according to our

1590
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
collective inner beliefs

1600
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and one can see a human becoming as a human with a world

1610
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
both physical world and others so

1620
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
here we see how we can how organisms such animals or humans

1630
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
try to regulate the [Music] the world both physical and social world

1640
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and by acting on the world so for example in this case

1650
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
this little animal holds the ball against the gravity first that means that already

1660
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
in an embodied way captures the physical dynamics of earth with

1670
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
but also acts against the social influence for example here an attempt to

1680
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
from somebody taking the ball so we see

1690
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
human becoming as a dielectric human in in a large scale as a

1700
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
nutshell as an interpersonal we say that interpersonal statistical regularities say multi-scale

1710
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
hierarchical models on an individual level and vice versa and this can happen from across

1720
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
different scales from philogenesis culture and donald genesis

1730
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
to everyday learning decision making perception and even so-called

1740
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
automatic interceptive process our

1750
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
perspective draws heavily on a vegotian perspective who have famously declared

1760
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
the claim that through others we become ourselves

1770
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
so in order to further illuminate this view let us imagine a

1780
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
simple um example let us imagine a little baby

1790
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
that feeling hungry as

1800
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
their interceptive systems is out of balance and tries to reach for food however the

1810
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
motor repertoire of such a human being

1820
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
it's not developed yet fully

1830
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and so this baby is unable to reach for food on

1840
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
its own so what happens is that usually the caregiver

1850
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
will notice such kind of behavior and it and it will try to satisfy that

1860
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
for example by placing the food closer to the baby

1870
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
so in this case we see we can even imagine how this kind of interpersonal

1880
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
relation between the caregiver and the baby results may result in a

1890
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
internalization of in a symbolic level of this kind of

1900
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
processes so the baby both

1910
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
across evolutionary and development might come to realize that when

1920
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
extending the hands of the index finger

1930
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and calls for attention pointing to a specific object that they

1940
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
need so we see how an interpersonal relationship based on

1950
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
natural needs for survival might end up in internalization

1960
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:43,000
of in on a symbolic level

1970
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
so here that's that example is important uh in our talk because this illustrates

1980
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
how a collective level a level of description for of process between people

1990
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
might be transformed into single brains and single bodies processes

2000
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and actually makes us what we are becoming and that is humans you know

2010
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
growing up and these kind of accounts

2020
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
are very much in line with the framework of an activism and especially

2030
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
the account of participatory instance making which has focused a lot

2040
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
on the fundamental role of social interactions and um

2050
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
both from individual sense making which is always affected by

2060
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
coordination dynamics while we are in embedding social interactions or the way

2070
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
to join sense making how that means how we jointly with others

2080
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
make sense of the world

2090
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
however this kind of account might seem

2100
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
theoretical so now here we will

2110
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
ask the question how can we apply this kind of ideas and why is it

2120
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
even important to reflect um on these processes and

2130
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
whether the these processes lie on a lower level of descriptions or

2140
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
collective levels or between so to illustrate an example we will

2150
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
use autism as a paradigm example and

2160
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
we will try to illustrate how these ideas can be concrete and

2170
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
concretely put into practice so autism spectrum condition has been

2180
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
described as a pervasive developmental condition which is characterized by difficulties in social interaction and

2190
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
communication as well as restricted interested interests and all sensory behaviors so that's the

2200
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
traditional typical definition of autism spectrum

2210
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
conditions and some predominant approaches so far he focused on

2220
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
difficulties or so-called impairments of theory of mind these theories

2230
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
describe autism as a condition that individuals have problems with

2240
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
understanding the intentions um or beliefs of other people so there is

2250
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
also there are also alternative hypotheses such as the social motivation hypothesis

2260
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
which claims that people with autism have usually diminished

2270
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
social motivation to interact with others so in this case they might lack opportunities in gaining

2280
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
[Music] more accomplish abilities we see

2290
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
also weak central coherence account

2300
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and or executive dysfunction which is refers to more individual

2310
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
characteristics of individuals or autistic individuals such as

2320
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
difficulties with planning or paying more attention to global

2330
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
to sorry local information rather than global information and we also see broken mirror neuron

2340
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
hypotheses which emphasize the difficulty of autism

2350
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
of autistic people when it comes to empathizing

2360
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and more recently we have computational approaches such as the aberrant or

2370
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
inflexible precision updating which grounded in predictive processing

2380
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
accounts and they claim that autism might result from

2390
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
aberrant way of updating precision and

2400
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
more concretely regulating the updating of beliefs as we saw

2410
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
by integrating previous previously gained experience with in phase of

2420
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
newly incoming information so we see here that

2430
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
this type of accounts they are either more social accounts right like the

2440
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
theory of mind social motivation broken middle neuron account or even the upbring precision updating when it comes

2450
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
to the social world however and even in this case

2460
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
where others are into into the frame

2470
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
the condition is exclusively attributed and examined within single

2480
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
individuals and especially single brains so

2490
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
the most predominant approaches of autism focus on individuals and try to diagnose

2500
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:24,000
or even treat such conditions by paying attention primarily on the individual

2510
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
so for example in research it's common to

2520
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
identify two groups for example one so-called neurotypical or non-autistic group

2530
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and one autistic group and then by deploying a specific paradigm

2540
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
we try to identify traditionally differences in behavioral patterns or brain function and this kind

2550
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
of paradigms then attribute this kind of differences in a

2560
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
deficient functioning of the autistic

2570
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
so however as we will argue here and in line with an interactive and subjective

2580
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
turn in research of psychopathology and specifically autism

2590
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and we will see how by including

2600
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
real-time social interactions and social relationships

2610
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
we can expand this focus from individual brains to the process between people

2620
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and especially in communication so this line of

2630
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
work would suggest that it's not enough to identify two different groups of people

2640
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
like neurotypical and autistic people but already by beginning examining diets

2650
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
of people or groups of people one can naturally see that we are

2660
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
we have a variable here at least three different broad categories of

2670
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
partners for example in our case we have neurotypical partners we have autistic partners but

2680
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
we have also mixed partners which means consisting of

2690
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
at least one autistic individual and at least one neurotypical individual so in this case

2700
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
our hypothesis has been that at least in certain levels especially in

2710
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
the experiential level the autistic individuals

2720
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,000
will entertain similar levels of smoothness interactive smoothness as the neurotypical partners whereas mixed

2730
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
diets might appear in certain levels interacting less efficiently

2740
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and if that hypothesis is correct then

2750
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
one can see that the um the deficiency doesn't lie in the

2760
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
individual brain of the autistic but at least partially

2770
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
we can locate it in process between individuals this is very much in line with the double empathy problem

2780
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
of damian milton who have argued that the authority of exactly of the

2790
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
autism condition does not lie in the individual but it comes from mismatches

2800
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
of social abilities of expectations

2810
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
one can imagine even probing this framework further

2820
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
by not necessarily de-otomizing people in autistic or non-artistic or

2830
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
any other category we can imagine but rather examining

2840
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
such traits on a continuum and then examining the

2850
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
interaction smoothness based um on the distance of people in a space

2860
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
of conditions rather than in a single dimensional spectrum of conditions

2870
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
later we will see how this can be operationalized so as

2880
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
after this illustrative example as we already mentioned the last decade

2890
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
um especially but also before through [Music]

2900
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
more sociological accounts we have seen an endless objective turn

2910
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
in the study of autism and other conditions and just give a few examples um

2920
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,000
for example the dumpling of the problem has argued that social difficulties um in autism

2930
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
arises two-way complication and that does not reside in single brains

2940
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
but also um as we saw an activist and participatory since making accounts have

2950
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
claimed that atypicalities can be viewed as a different way of making sense of others

2960
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and interacting with the world or second person neuropsychiatry

2970
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
perspectives have claimed that social difficulties are more likely or even only

2980
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
manifest themselves in real-time social interactions whereas more passive scenarios

2990
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
might be less problematic clinically

3000
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
um finally a part of this work the electronics of human hypothesis has

3010
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
bring together in the subjective approaches and predictive process and processing approaches have reviewed in

3020
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
conditions such as autism but autism but also other conditions not as a disorder

3030
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
of the individual but rather as a cumulative in the personal misadhumen

3040
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
so in a nutshell interpersonal mix achievement can be thought of as

3050
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
disturbances of the dynamic and reciprocal unfolding of an interaction across multiple time scales

3060
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
resulting in increasingly divergent prediction and interaction styles or

3070
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
patterns and vice versa as we saw the hypothesis

3080
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
aligned with other accounts holds clear predictions and so before we start

3090
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
experimenting empirically we made concrete hypotheses in terms of the

3100
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
interactions which we suggested that interactions within

3110
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
homogeneous and non-tuned diets are expected to

3120
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and i'm sorry in human diets are expected to appear smoother compared to heterogeneous diets or non-tuned diets

3130
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:05,000
we will see later what we mean by socialization and homogeneous or heterogeneous

3140
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
importantly we see here an interplay between levels of description between the subjective

3150
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
communicative gap and individual prediction and interaction styles which might appear

3160
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
diverse across people of different conditions and here we see how an initially their

3170
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,000
subjective cognitive gap can result in increasing individual

3180
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
diverse diverse prediction interaction styles and how as

3190
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
we have people that have formed um diverse social expectations about each

3200
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
other how this can increa result increasing such an intersubjective community gap across various scales one

3210
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
can imagine for example at the scale of a dialogue and

3220
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
for example let's say i i start with making a comment that another person might take as insulting

3230
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,000
then the other person replies to me back in an aggressive manner and then i'm sorry i'm starting

3240
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
feeling uh angry and this can escalate potentially in a

3250
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
major missed human in the scale of just few seconds or few minutes especially

3260
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
this can happen between people for example that have cultivated distinct

3270
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
systems of beliefs for example different cultures and they don't didn't have a chance to

3280
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
get to know other systems of beliefs

3290
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
this in the case of autism for example this one can imagine that this kind of

3300
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
interactions might play out during across development so a child

3310
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,000
in a school for example that other children are not informed about

3320
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:08,000
different communication styles might isolate exclude and isolate this child

3330
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
so and forcing this child to

3340
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
develop with a decreased level of social interaction we see this not only

3350
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
with in terms of autism also about with regards to other

3360
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
social communicative differences um people are can be excluded for example

3370
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:41,000
immigration populations in new places might be excluded initially

3380
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
based on this kind of in the subjective community of gaps

3390
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
so in our case going back to autism we will try to personalize the homogeneity of

3400
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
diets of partners as a similarity of

3410
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
in terms of autistic traits we can which we can measure with standard questionnaire tests

3420
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and we will operationalize in our experiments the smoothness of an

3430
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
interaction based on the perceived friendship quality again through questionnaires for example

3440
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
but later we will see how we can extend this work in a more fine-grained time scale for

3450
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
example in at a scale of milliseconds when it comes to

3460
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
interpersonal gaze behavior or interpersonal facial expression behavior

3470
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
so our experimental methodology takes the form of two personal

3480
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
psychophysiology or collective psychophysiology which tries to expand the

3490
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
study of psychophysiological phenomena into the social collective domain

3500
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
here our first study on the interpersonal human in real time social interactions

3510
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,000
make use of this methodology which is grounded in second person neuroscience accounts

3520
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,000
which which claim that in real-time social interaction

3530
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
brain or other processes might be fundamentally different than

3540
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
simpler passive social social passive observational scenarios so when we

3550
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
really interact with another in real time for example in the discussion these accounts um

3560
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
hypothesize that our brain will function in different qualitatively different and quite quantitatively

3570
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
different way as when we just sit back and observe others

3580
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
without the opportunity to feedback to each other we'll not go

3590
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,000
in detail and hear about the brain process as we in our studies here we'll see

3600
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
mainly behavioral results so also our two-person psychophysiology

3610
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
framework is based on previous work of the last

3620
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
couple of decades such as for example fmri or eeg

3630
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:27,000
hyperscanning here you see one of the seminal works of gigan duma which

3640
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:35,000
connected two eeg systems into into the same computer in order to at the same time

3650
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
examine the brain function of two people while interacting

3660
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:50,000
[Music] through um hand movement

3670
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
also other later works such as work from wikileaks or

3680
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
hikokoi have examined phenomena for example from deeper in the

3690
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,000
brain with the use of fmri hyperscanning or across development

3700
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
our two-part setup is looks like that so i'll not go here also

3710
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
in detail i just want to make clear that our system is deploys different several different

3720
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
recording modalities and in a completely symmetrical way in

3730
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
order to make sure that we in prefer synchronicity we can monitor the

3740
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
individual processes of two or more people from decision making to eye movements

3750
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and fascial expressions and brain function all at the same time so that we can interrelate

3760
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:56,000
first processes of different modalities within the same person like for how decision making is

3770
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
connected to our emotional processing or facial expressions

3780
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and how we our brain function modulates eye movements

3790
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and and back how and how perceived social information modulates brain function and

3800
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,000
second to interrelate um the multi modal processes of individuals

3810
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
with one another so how my visual information for example

3820
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
influence your behavior and how your behavior influences me in a closed loop

3830
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
so in reality our setup looks like that so two persons are invited in

3840
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
the lab and they solve uh simple visual tasks

3850
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
while they are able to communicate and interact through a micro camera at the center of the

3860
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
screen which deploys the face of the other person

3870
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
in so here in our first experiment the important manipulation was that

3880
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
while people were able to communicate in real time like in skype manner

3890
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
in half of the game people could not communicate in real time because we

3900
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,000
replayed the part of the video of the previous interaction without letting people know

3910
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
so in our game the two people thought that they always communicated in real

3920
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
time however contrary to their

3930
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
perception in half of the game they really communicated but in half of the game they just observe the the video of the

3940
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
other person and so in this case we will be able to decent angle

3950
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
quantitatively the impact of the social interaction dynamics even in the absence of conscious

3960
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
interpretation of the situation so here we can see our two main

3970
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
conditions of the live video feed where allows the two people to form essentially one system uh

3980
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
interacting system and in the other case we have two distinct systems uh cognitive systems we just

3990
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
observe um recorded videos of the other without knowing

4000
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:21,000
our game looks like that it's based on a similar work of bajador baramin and

4010
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
colleagues in london it's a psychophysiological

4020
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
task where we ask people to identify the old

4030
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
object on the screen without knowing that there is no odd object object on the screen so

4040
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
because we have four possible possibilities left right up or down

4050
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
we expect just a 25

4060
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
chance of co-occurrence [Music]

4070
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
uh between the decisions of the two persons so whatever whatever weeks we

4080
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
observe above and beyond 25

4090
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
um in a statistical significant manner we can attribute

4100
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
just on the dynamics of the social interaction because every other piece of information

4110
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
remains the same for the two people except for the dynamics of their

4120
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
interaction three days so for example here you can see case one

4130
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
and we have covered the eyes of people for privacy reasons but here we can you can see how people

4140
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:46,000
in real time even when they don't see the face the whole face of the other person they are synchronized and happy

4150
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and interacting together at the same time look here for example how

4160
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
perfectly aligned is even their [Music] facial expressions

4170
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
the same here we cannot see the eyes but the same will see about the eyes the same happens people tend to follow each

4180
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
other eyes but let's see now a second place where people in the same game the same day after a

4190
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
few seconds they played a version of the game where without knowing one person

4200
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
see only the video of the eyes of the other person so in this case you see people start being confused like why

4210
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
don't you follow me as i follow you etc so this creates a missed achievement

4220
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,000
an artificial missed achievement where people naive about our experimental control cannot attribute

4230
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
to our manipulations but

4240
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
as we saw a few questions they had good through psychological interpretations like the other person was

4250
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
bored or tired at some points of the game here for example

4260
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
we can see how the interpersonal interpersonal achievement play out in

4270
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
the behavioral domain and especially here in how the two gay traces of the two

4280
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
persons coincide and follow each other like independent interacting

4290
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
little creatures and here are formal results

4300
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
um based on our analysis of the gauge trace here we can see we formed three

4310
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,000
experimental conditions we have one pseudo condition where we suffered diet from different days

4320
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and we see that their gas coordination the green is the lowest then we see that when people really

4330
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
observe the other person in the room the yellow the sorry the orange distribution we see that we have an

4340
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
increased um yes coordination metric but what really made the

4350
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
difference is when people are allowed to really interact with each other we see that their gaze trace was

4360
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
synchronized the most very interestingly we observe exactly the same pattern

4370
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
um in terms of of a completely different

4380
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
level of description and this is the decision making alignment again here we see that when

4390
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
we analyze data from people of different partners we see that indeed

4400
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
the probability of agreeing on the same object was around 25 we see here the

4410
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
green distribution centers around 25 then we see that the orange distribution already on the uh

4420
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:43,000
about the observational scenario is slightly increased but what was highly increased was the

4430
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
decision-making alignment in the real-time social interaction scenario also this is reflected in the

4440
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
interrelationship between the two modalities we see here both in the online and offline

4450
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
conditions we see and statistical interactions between the

4460
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
two modalities so the more the gauge coordinate the higher the gas coordination the higher was the

4470
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
decision-making alignment and we also see that the the in the case of real-time social

4480
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
interaction this interrelationship appeared stronger

4490
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,000
also another interesting finding is that the confidence

4500
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
difference between the two conditions was significant so people without even knowing that there was two different

4510
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,000
conditions appear more confident about their own choices

4520
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
depending in the real-time social interaction situations as opposed to the

4530
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
offline or social observation scenarios so here we see how the social interaction dynamics

4540
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
even when we don't we are not aware of them consciously

4550
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
influences us phenomenologically and even to the level

4560
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:14,000
of our confidence about our own decision making

4570
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
so finally we also see a relationship between gaze coordination and the

4580
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,000
perceived level of collaboration so the more people

4590
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,000
follow each other days the more likely we are to report a higher level of satisfaction in

4600
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
collaboration so

4610
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
we're going to start these two where we examine the personal

4620
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
misachievement and this time in real life social relationships here we try to

4630
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
move our empirical studies outside of the lab in the real world

4640
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:03,000
without performing any manipulation just by collecting and

4650
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
registering the experiences the real life experiences of

4660
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:16,000
people in the real world so here we started the link more concretely between this similarity

4670
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,000
of autistic traits and friendship ratings along a continuum and for that to this end we invited

4680
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
pairs of friends to complete questionnaires about their individual autistic traits and the quality of their friendship

4690
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
without being able to communicate their replies of course to each other

4700
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:43,000
then we analyzed this data that we gathered from 144 neurotypical adults

4710
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,000
which formed 72 same-sex diets of friends

4720
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
which whose friendship duration varied a lot from 3

4730
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,000
months to 30 years and their meeting frequency again was diverse from a few times per year to

4740
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
daily in the ages of fatherhood from 19 years old to 50

4750
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
years old and in a balanced in terms of sex

4760
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
sample of participants here we see the distributions of the main

4770
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,000
[Music] measures of our study friendship quality friendship duration

4780
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
autistic traits and autistic traits mismatch which is simply the difference of

4790
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
my autistic traits versus your autistic traits in a given diet of friendship

4800
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
this study was recently probably so people that are interested can go

4810
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
back and see all the details so in a nutshell

4820
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:57,000
what we find here is that um whereas individual autistic traits were

4830
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
related with the friendship quality in line with

4840
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:09,000
previous studies in our study of real life social relationships this

4850
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
apparent relation ship was not significant statistically at least in the

4860
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:24,000
amount of our sample size as we see and it only appeared the same

4870
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
very weak interrelationship what was more interesting was the

4880
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
as hypothesized the interrelationship between the mismatch

4890
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
of artistic traits and the friendship quality and here we see that the more the

4900
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,000
mismatch of autistic traits so the more different the two people were in a given diet the less satisfied appeared

4910
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
in their in their friendship um is and this result was irrespective

4920
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,000
of friendship duration aids sex or even the average they had the codistic traits

4930
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
similar observations we found with regard to

4940
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
friendship duration we found no interrelation in the relationship at all between friendship duration and

4950
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
individual autistic traits in our sample but we indeed found um

4960
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,000
an interrelationship between mismatch of autistic traits and french duration

4970
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:28,000
so the key constituents of friendship quality that contributed to this kind of results were interpersonal acceptance closeness

4980
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and help so

4990
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,000
based on our empirical observations um we can speculate and suggest the future

5000
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000
directions of research relevant work which will examine the

5010
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
dialectical phenomena between different levels of analysis from the collective to the

5020
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
individual and back so for example in this case we can speculate that potentially potential higher

5030
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
interpersonal achievement between people might lead to smoother social interactions

5040
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,000
which intent might transform our interaction in with another person more in

5050
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:20,000
in a more rewarding form so we are more happy to communicate with this specific person and these

5060
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:28,000
have been found to enhance even interpersonal attraction about each other and this attraction might increase the

5070
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
motivation to interact further and the more frequent interaction with the other might boost interaction with

5080
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
success and this interaction success might contribute back to higher interpersonal

5090
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
human of course such a process it's a simplification and more experiments

5100
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
um are needed to examine the different stages of such a

5110
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
dialectical procedure in real life

5120
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
so in our discussion i will examine some limitations and future direction of

5130
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,000
our work first we can

5140
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and should measure more fine-grain mechanisms in a more clearly modulatory

5150
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,000
experiment using hyperscanning and computational modeling

5160
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:30,000
in order to tap into more detailed mechanisms of this kind of phenomena

5170
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
also in the future we can deploy unmediated face-to-face

5180
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
interactions such as real life monitoring of verbal and touching behavior

5190
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
we should examine also more heterogeneous examples of the population for example mixed gender

5200
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:55,000
population or cross-cultural diets and groups or even

5210
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,000
groups of the same culture but of different socio-economic background or educational background

5220
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,000
further scales of social interaction dynamics can be incorporated and here we

5230
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,000
drawing on the dielectric human hypothesis

5240
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
we suggest to continue with longitudinal tracking of two-person and

5250
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:26,000
collective psychophysiology so that we also monitor the

5260
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,000
development of such kind of achievement or misachievement across several years

5270
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,000
in real life scenarios also clinical studies are needed in

5280
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
order to examine this kind of hypothesis across

5290
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,000
as we saw different types of diets or groups which would include autistic or other conditional

5300
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:59,000
diets neurotypical ones and but also mixed ones

5310
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
indeed we have already started in collaboration with wikileaks and takashiko koike

5320
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:12,000
to deploying such hyperscanning studies in order to tap into their brain mechanisms

5330
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
using both aeg hyperscanning and fmri hyperscanning hopefully

5340
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
shown in japan when the situation stabilizes

5350
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,000
in terms of the condemn also we at the same time analyze facial

5360
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:39,000
expressions between two people and here we also already saw how two people

5370
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
might synchronize in facial expressions when they interact in real time

5380
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
a hypothesis goes in similar lines as with with what we saw before

5390
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,000
so before concluding i would like also to enjoy a sketch of our future

5400
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
computational plans here we have on a paper which is called beyond one

5410
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:09,000
base and brain we have suggested that we should go beyond individual bayesian modeling of

5420
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,000
the isolated brain towards collective models which will capture

5430
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
both intra-subjective beliefs and intra-subjective confidence of beliefs

5440
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
but also inter-subjective coupling factors here in this

5450
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
paper from 2007 uh we were based on previous

5460
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:39,000
work of donnie zoe and chris mattis which

5470
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,000
is developed around the metabase and two-level [Music]

5480
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
computational scheme

5490
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,000
for concluding if we should mention that

5500
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:06,000
especially in the last two three years uh more and more evidence um appear in in favor of

5510
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:13,000
a viewing psychopathology as an interpersonal misadvent and not

5520
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
only as exclusively disorder of the brain

5530
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:26,000
and if this evidence at least in certain levels of description holds valid and robust one

5540
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
can imagine that apart from examining

5550
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,000
and treating individuals

5560
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
and diagnosing individuals we can [Music]

5570
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,000
pass through more comprehensive social approaches where we will

5580
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,000
at the same time treating an individual with a certain condition but at the same time we will also inform the society

5590
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
about these conditions um so in a way our approach point

5600
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
towards not showing only persons with a specific condition into the incidental

5610
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,000
norm of our cultural context but

5620
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
tries to foster an interpersonal meeting

5630
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
at the middle if you will so for example of course we don't suggest by deploying for example

5640
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:31,000
from psychopharmacology in the general population but for example with a

5650
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
informational campaigns in schools and we indeed

5660
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,000
suggest a tuning of social expectations of or enrichment if you will

5670
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
in order to provide a more inclusive society

5680
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:55,000
for everybody also our approach uh all um points towards

5690
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
a treatment of interaction as such in line with for example participations making

5700
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
suggestions where we envision modern schools for example

5710
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
that would care about tuning the medium of communication between people for example

5720
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
in a previous work we have suggested developing educational systems

5730
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:27,000
mediated through computers or even social robotics or serious gaming between two individuals

5740
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,000
which could alleviate some initial social pressures and allow people to communicate smoother

5750
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,000
in the first steps of development of communication between two

5760
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
people as um

5770
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:51,000
we have seen before i am in this scheme we can

5780
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
simply observe our suggestion is trying to treat this kind of

5790
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,000
interpersonal mis-achievement between two individuals or autistic and one narcissistic for example which might

5800
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,000
diverge if left unnoticed by treating not only the autistic

5810
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,000
individual but also the neurotypical individual and also

5820
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,000
trying to take care of the interaction tuning between them but

5830
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:28,000
in a way that at the end will result we are left with a tuned diet and not tuned

5840
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:36,000
individuals so what we hear is that people can communicate smoothly and satisfactory with each other and

5850
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,000
we don't care about identifying ideal normal

5860
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
against which other [Music]

5870
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:54,000
types styles of communication should conform

5880
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
so in this work concluding taking together we have

5890
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,000
argued that social interaction does indeed matter across various contexts

5900
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and time scales and in fact we even consider the question of social

5910
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,000
interaction as the fundamental philosophical question and our argument here is a

5920
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
generally existential one as without social interaction we cannot even exist

5930
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
as humans thank you very much

5940
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
for your kind attention and i would like also to thank several people that have collaborated

5950
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:41,000
with us across the last five six years in order to for us to accomplish a

5960
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:47,000
vast amount of experiments of about 400

5970
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
people and especially my academic advisor leonard zilbach

5980
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
who assisted me in the journey of the last six years

5990
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
thank you very much i would be happy now to receive any question and

6000
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:12,000
happily discuss excellent maybe you can unshare your

6010
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,000
screen and we can take it from there well thanks for this really amazing talk that was

6020
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:27,000
truly something special and we got a bunch of questions maybe you can unshare and then you'll return to regular mode

6030
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
excuse me you can unshare your screen in the jitsu yes yeah so

6040
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,000
um for everybody who's watching live we have a bunch of questions already and you can ask more and i'll just ask them

6050
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
just in the order that they were presented so alex wrote a question what are the connections or

6060
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:52,000
disconnections of the dialectical perspectives that you brought up and monism or markovian monism

6070
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:59,000
so can you please repeat this question yeah how do we think about the similarities and dissimilarities of the dialectical

6080
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
perspectives that you addressed and markovian monism like kind of marco

6090
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,000
blanket everything yes so i have recently

6100
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,000
come across a couple of works claiming mccoffee and monism

6110
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,000
i think from vania vise and colleagues and half prisoner

6120
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:30,000
but unfortunately to be honest i haven't had the opportunity yet to go through this kind of accounts in order to draw

6130
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:36,000
the similarities but i can tell you for example our approach serves a lot of

6140
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
commonalities for example with work of maxwell ramstadt for example

6150
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
and colleagues who have argued in favor of a multi-scale

6160
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
nested markov blankets [Music]

6170
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:59,000
processes um so our our account sells commonalities with such kind of

6180
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
multi-scale approaches i'm not sure if uh work also again goes

6190
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,000
through this kind of directions perhaps one

6200
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:18,000
one difference might be that in our case we don't

6210
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
take the predictive processing active inference account strictly autologically

6220
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:30,000
but we use it as a tool in order to model and capture specific parts of the

6230
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
of the process so we don't necessarily presuppose a

6240
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
nested markov blankets in reality but we

6250
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,000
still view them as a very useful way of integrating

6260
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:52,000
this kind of processes formally nice that really maps to the um realism

6270
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,000
instrumentalism discussion we've been having uh in these uh discussions so

6280
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,000
here's another question from sasha she wrote what activities or mental states

6290
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
are amenable to creating interpersonal attunement for adults

6300
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,000
what kind of activities what kind of activities what kind of uh improvisational or or synchronous or

6310
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,000
you're studying it in a very specific case but as far as just our day-to-day life what kind of activities do you

6320
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:27,000
think create that sort of interpersonal achievement for adults okay yeah so

6330
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
um as we saw in the presentation i gave a simple

6340
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
example of interpersonal human just between a caregiver and a child in order

6350
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
to stress how this kind of interpersonal achievement is crucial

6360
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:52,000
not just about our interpersonal achievement but also about survival so we are we cannot escape i am actually

6370
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,000
interpersonal at human because otherwise we don't exist neither biologically but not even as

6380
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
humans so what whatever we learn from language and symbolic functions comes

6390
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,000
from developmentally acquired knowledge and which has been of course

6400
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:17,000
being possible through largest larger evolutionary scales but after we gather

6410
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
this kind of capacities i think here actually another important

6420
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
point is that i feel that certain paradigms in the past

6430
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,000
have been helpful but also misconstitute certain

6440
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,000
human functioning as starting taking for example processes theory of

6450
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,000
mind as a given stat statically so and then try to

6460
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
interrogate how this kind of theory of mind process play out in interactions so we see here

6470
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:57,000
that if we take a more historical developmental approach we see that

6480
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:03,000
of course one feedback to the other the individual level to the collective but we see here a primacy

6490
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,000
in a regards can way privacy of the collective level so first

6500
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,000
we are in tune with others and then we build ourselves and in the adult

6510
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:23,000
life i believe social interaction itself and the experience of the other is what can allow us to

6520
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
attune to others in different in many different levels for example as

6530
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:36,000
i said before in isolated places that people didn't have the chance to communicate with others might

6540
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
in them if one you you want to use a bayesian terminology they might develop

6550
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,000
so strict priors in terms of their social expectations but when they face other people

6560
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,000
from other places um they're unable to turn their beliefs and

6570
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
one like here just freely speaking for example uh in in this case of so

6580
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:06,000
strictly formed beliefs people might face such a tremendous difficulty

6590
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
in updating like they need to use so much energy to update their prior prior beliefs that they formed across

6600
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
development which might even

6610
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:24,000
escape to other malicious strategies in order to confirm their the

6620
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
inner expectations to the outer world even by for example violence or even killing

6630
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,000
exterminating the other because they cannot just wrap their minds around

6640
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,000
the existence of other the manifestation of other types of

6650
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
belief systems for example as you can see in history for example a lot of times when

6660
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,000
people from different belief systems or um

6670
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:59,000
or even um different uh [Music] economic interests

6680
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:05,000
clash together and we see that many times instead of being able to adapt to each

6690
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:14,000
other people were violent to each other so i think the key here is early aids exposure to

6700
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,000
various forms of life and and beliefs

6710
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:27,000
so that naturally organically people can attune to each other i think as with other processes like language there

6720
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:34,000
might even be maybe more liberal but still a window of this kind of for a human so i think we

6730
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
are more open for a tuning with others in the world in an earlier age than later but

6740
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,000
still um through experience and

6750
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
both through educating ourselves for example but more

6760
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
crucially such an approach would even go further suggesting that individual

6770
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,000
training is not enough like even if we try to educate ourselves

6780
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and and realize that we have acquired biases

6790
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
against other people this might not be enough even to

6800
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
eliminate all implicit biases and perhaps only in in real practice in in

6810
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:30,000
the practice of real time social interaction this this these models if you want them can be revealed

6820
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,000
really important points thanks for sharing that another question in the chat from steven

6830
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,000
is is there a hypothesis that people on the autistic spectrum exhibit different

6840
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:49,000
traits due to perception and action dynamics being different rather than for example just the brain structures

6850
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,000
limiting their generative model can you please repeat the question one more time so there's some notes yeah is

6860
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:02,000
there a hypothesis that people on the autism spectrum exhibit different traits due to their perception and action

6870
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:11,000
dynamics being different rather than just their brain structures being different

6880
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,000
can you hear me yeah sorry but i'm sorry but i'm losing connection uh at certain points

6890
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
i can hear you perhaps perhaps my internet connection is not full how

6900
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
about just if you could reload on your page um how can i access that

6910
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:37,000
just hit the reload on your browser on the window

6920
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:46,000
nice

6930
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
yep yep sound good good now i think i'm seeing you better

6940
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:58,000
and hear you better could you please repeat the last question great the last question was is there any um hypothesis

6950
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:05,000
that people on the autism spectrum have different traits due to their perception and action dynamics being different

6960
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:12,000
rather than just brain differences so if i understood correctly i

6970
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:18,000
disconnected my camera so that i can maybe i can hear better the sound if i understand

6980
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,000
correctly is that whether autistic people might differ

6990
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:29,000
not only in terms of brain function but also

7000
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,000
action and perceptual styles yes yeah yeah yeah this is exactly this

7010
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,000
exactly what our hypothesis that is touching upon

7020
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:49,000
it argues that people autistic people and other so-called neurotypical people

7030
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:57,000
might differ across different levels of description from brain function to

7040
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,000
um to the way that they generate expectations especially about the social

7050
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:09,000
world and to the way that express these expectations

7060
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,000
especially about others so grounded in individual accounts of predictive processing and active

7070
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:22,000
inference we argue here that um and in taking predictive processing

7080
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,000
and active inference as our two main pillars we um

7090
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,000
see here that when you confirm two systems that entertain completely different not

7100
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
completely but different styles of

7110
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,000
generating and expressing social expectations this might create a mishearment

7120
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
situation where these styles if

7130
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:59,000
left spontaneous spontaneously evolve in a more and more divergent

7140
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:05,000
[Music] situation so starting from

7150
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
simply taking the precision of dating in single brains we can reach to through

7160
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,000
predictive crossing to um generating of social expectations about others to and through active

7170
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
inference to the way we generate or express or express these expectations

7180
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,000
through actions to others and especially when we take into account the other also we see how the similarity of the

7190
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
similarity of these ways can contribute

7200
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
in different scenarios so for example um

7210
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,000
borrowing the terminology of dynamical systems for example one can see how this how the how taking into

7220
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:55,000
uh how considering this diade one system how this system can

7230
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:01,000
evolve very differently when even when a small mismatch is

7240
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:07,000
up is present in the beginning of of an interaction

7250
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
thanks and it just sort of uh cracked me up because we're almost replicating your

7260
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,000
experiment we're having a mediated dialectic a dialogue and then now you

7270
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
can see me but i can't see your face and then there's even another level of

7280
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:30,000
the affordance with our friends and colleagues who can ask us questions and it's like everybody has their own

7290
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:37,000
perspective every question is coming to the top of the mind for someone and then it's through that interaction

7300
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,000
that we're who we are as individuals and as a lab so just really you know cool to

7310
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,000
hear how you brought complexity science and all these different world knowledge tradition

7320
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
together to also address like very very prescient social issues so another question from

7330
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
the chat yvonne asks how can i be sure that someone else's social beliefs are actually the same as

7340
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,000
mine how can i believe how can we how can i be sure that someone's social beliefs

7350
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:14,000
are the same as mine oh okay yeah so for that um

7360
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,000
i guess you can you can never be sure um like this exactly the old bayesian

7370
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,000
framework also that's the beauty also i think that we don't uh necessarily dichotomize uh beliefs between for

7380
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
example who are not true but we place on our beliefs different levels of um

7390
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
different levels of confidence or precision and like

7400
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,000
in a recent collaboration with some colleagues as a

7410
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
leo christophe moore we examine conceptually the

7420
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:58,000
problem of trust and there we argue for example that trust interpersonal trust is a

7430
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,000
is fundamental in this kind of relationships so um based on our

7440
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:10,000
belief of predictability of the other inconsistency and

7450
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
also that the other would like to treat as well so on a belief of belovedance and also on

7460
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:23,000
shared values so we just accept that we have certain values with some certain people based on these three

7470
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:31,000
points we argue that the people should necessarily entertain trust um about others in

7480
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:37,000
social interactions in order to make our um to make our

7490
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:44,000
social interaction uh functioning well we in fact argue with leo christophe

7500
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:50,000
moore that this is inescapable

7510
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
practice in real life social interactions because just because we are not able to

7520
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:03,000
track and monitor every possible incident around in in our world so

7530
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
the next possibility is just to get paranoid and try to to control and monitor the behavior of

7540
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,000
everybody in order to have access to everybody's beliefs and actions uh but instead of that i think we um as

7550
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:24,000
humans the trust which of course sometimes is we argue that's always crucial like

7560
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:30,000
already from hundreds gathering um from ancient societies like from

7570
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
tomatillo work we see how people based on trust they were able to hunt

7580
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:42,000
more complex in more complex scenarios and provide to for themselves

7590
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:48,000
the means to survive in ecological crisis and but we also

7600
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:55,000
argue that the trust also can go wrong in certain times and of course in this in these cases in a

7610
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
betrayal of trust the whole the whole consequence can be dramatic

7620
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,000
both in individual and social level so this this work where uh

7630
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,000
leo christophe moyes the first of uh author will publish soon in a

7640
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:17,000
book chapter cool um really nice point about the trust and

7650
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,000
the sense making we you know you're giving sentence after sentence i just have to trust you it just and anything

7660
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:30,000
cognitively that demands more than just simply trusting you is just not gonna work so here's a question from laura in

7670
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:37,000
the chat laura writes thank you dr bolas i would like to know if it would be necessary to standardize

7680
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
the individuals from different cultures conform composing a dyad to avoid

7690
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
distractors when you evaluate the interaction so how do we think about culture and the dyad how do we control

7700
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:54,000
or explore that yes so our hypothesis um

7710
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,000
would go beyond like we used autism as a paradigm example but goal goes beyond

7720
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
that and how it could accommodate any

7730
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
um cultural or difference or difference in beliefs

7740
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:18,000
in a simple way like i said for example deploying a diet structure where we have

7750
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:24,000
homogeneous structure diet structure for example people of the same

7760
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,000
a culture and people from the same b culture and mixed for example groups and

7770
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
see how different processes play out and then we

7780
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
can tease apart at least a certain extent which processes

7790
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:47,000
are out within specific uh cultures or with what process might

7800
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:54,000
emerge out of just out of the communication of between cultures and then we can maybe see how

7810
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,000
how the meeting of cultures can provide new possibilities for example and just culture is just one

7820
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:06,000
aspect um in my mind also a socio-economic background is also of

7830
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:14,000
huge importance so people also don't differ only in cultural practices but they differ a lot

7840
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:22,000
in their socioeconomic background and their intentions and motivations so

7850
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:28,000
some people try to change certain aspects of their

7860
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:35,000
socioeconomic needs because they are not satisfied um and even in the level that they

7870
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:43,000
cannot survive as a as a group other people try to preserve and maintain certain um um

7880
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:50,000
socio-economic context contexts so i think it's a very very diverse like um

7890
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:57,000
even in our case that we studied uh the similarity of autistic traits i consider it as oversimplification

7900
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:04,000
we found some inter-relationship in friendship quality but still that's that's just one factor

7910
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:10,000
i think there are so many factors play play out in in the personal achievement

7920
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,000
which is good to try to isolate certain aspects but i think at the end of the

7930
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:23,000
day we should try to make to see the big picture in real life

7940
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:29,000
it's almost like um the ancients and their different concepts of friendship different kinds of friendship or different words for friendship and so

7950
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
quality is going to be a multi-dimensional attribute so tad asks the question

7960
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:42,000
one thing that humans seem to excel at is successfully interacting with complete strangers people we have not

7970
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
yet had time to attune to how does your approach explain or address this

7980
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:53,000
yes so as i said like in the personal human in the early development i think and attachment

7990
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:02,000
theories are very important here so i think that we are embedded from day one to the social net

8000
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:08,000
social cultural net of our world and that's why we are able to communicate with a

8010
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:15,000
complete stranger because just simply because we both acquired common knowledge

8020
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:21,000
this can be language for example so it we can still communicate with

8030
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
an animal for example with our dog

8040
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,000
but less successfully usually done with other humans but also you see how

8050
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:39,000
dogs and humans also came closer across evolution and we are more because we gain common ground here and we are more

8060
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,000
able to communicate so imagine other type of animals more wild animals we

8070
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:50,000
usually we are more difficult to communicate and make sense of these animals but here again trust i think

8080
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:56,000
it's very important just we grew up in completely different places let's say

8090
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:02,000
with completely different people but and we don't know how each other

8100
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:08,000
grew up so but just by sharing common values and

8110
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,000
and common ground and just by being able to trust others this

8120
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:21,000
can make instruction functioning like when for example people of different cultures um invaded

8130
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:29,000
other places that they see for the first time people we saw atrocities for example because people didn't trust

8140
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:36,000
the people that they met or they have of course other interests but we see that when we meet an unknown

8150
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:43,000
person of course both possibilities are open we can be kind and functioning we can be also

8160
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:50,000
very vicious i mean as a human species across our history yep it's it's

8170
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
interesting how you brought up the incentives and the intentions almost separately because there's situations

8180
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,000
that could be win-win but then the communication or the narrative breaks down and then there's atrocity or there

8190
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,000
are cases when actually the game theory is set up adversarially um and then it

8200
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:12,000
also reminds me of um like our embodied and encultured uh nature as humans what

8210
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
we share even when we don't share language like when i've been traveling and not spoken the language i'll see

8220
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,000
some street food and it's like it's you can communicate with your body and with your actions that you think it

8230
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:29,000
looks like great food or that you want the food and so it's like everyone tastes you know same taste molecules

8240
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,000
maybe it's a preference culturally whether it's spicy or sweet but then that's still like

8250
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:40,000
a communication and an interaction and an attunement that is with money that one person is not familiar with a language and a

8260
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:46,000
context so that's really nice i'll ask one more question or is that

8270
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,000
cool yes yes sure well okay two more questions the first one is where does

8280
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:59,000
active inference come into play or where do you see active inference being able to sort of meet this very large

8290
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:05,000
philosophical tradition that you're bringing here yeah so

8300
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
um as we saw in the in the beginning of the presentation um i i see

8310
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,000
active interface and predictive processing as um as let's say

8320
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:23,000
the electrical interplay of two strategies has suggested from confusion with other people before as a

8330
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,000
an interplay for making sense of the and acting above the world

8340
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:35,000
in order for us to survive so i see active inference as the is the

8350
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:42,000
the active possibility we have in order to maintain our living form so

8360
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:48,000
not just by conforming with the environment but changing the environment

8370
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:55,000
and i found this very neat in this what i find very neat in this account is that we can with the same

8380
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,000
terminology we can account for both perceptual learning

8390
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
process and active action so we see how our perception learning induction

8400
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:12,000
becomes just one whole process that's why i see them as a the electrical phenomenon

8410
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,000
they are in ins inseparable and what i tried when i started studying these

8420
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
processes um some eight uh nine years ago

8430
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:30,000
um in zurich with classic stefan this completely transformed the way i

8440
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:37,000
see even the world myself but but they gradually start feeling

8450
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,000
that just by focusing on individual processes or even

8460
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:50,000
both active inference and predictive processing might limit our scope of interpretation so

8470
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:56,000
this exactly with my in my phd i tried to bring together different

8480
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:02,000
different philosophical or scientific frameworks

8490
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
to try to embed this kind of accounts in a more sociocultural

8500
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:13,000
real life context so in this in this effort for example also

8510
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:20,000
ecological and active approaches that i referred are instrumental also so

8520
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
um so i i can i i would like to see in the future

8530
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:31,000
um a fusion of philosophical approaches that they see the wholeness of the real life phenomena

8540
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:38,000
such as dialectics with more uh formal ways of interpreting data such as active

8550
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
inference and also more ecological and active approach and complexity approach such as

8560
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:51,000
dynamical system in in one in one story and see as i say for example one one way

8570
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:57,000
i have seen this happening is that like simply perhaps in one paper of ours we

8580
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:03,000
suggested that we that um bringing together dialectics and then

8590
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:09,000
activisms with active inference we can still keep our emphasis on social interactions

8600
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
and the embeddedness of organisms in the social world but

8610
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:24,000
also also using powerful computational tools to examine

8620
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:29,000
the individual brains which are embedded in the system so i think an extension of

8630
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
this kind of active inference accounts perhaps through works such as chris mattis and

8640
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:41,000
zandomizo where if they have proposed two-level metabase and approaches where

8650
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:47,000
by by deploying this they have they suggested this kind of frameworks for studying both learning

8660
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:53,000
and decision making in two levels we have suggested that we can reappropriate this kind of models for

8670
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:00,000
studying individual brains and collective action on this in the same model and these

8680
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:06,000
two our suggestions here that these two levels might not even entertain same

8690
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
mechanisms so in in the brain we might have a

8700
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:17,000
certain way of minimize prediction error and keep a consistent form in social

8710
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:22,000
interactions between people might have different mechanisms that might have been described more efficiently with an

8720
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:29,000
activist account for example or dynamical systems but i think by bringing together these tools

8730
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:37,000
more complete picture of both the sociological

8740
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
processes and the actual mechanisms at the biological level might and how this

8750
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,000
feedback uh to one another might become more apparent

8760
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:55,000
wow you know i was gonna ask what the next research steps were that was quite an agenda i mean it's really

8770
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,000
awesome um maybe just on a closing question no what would you um

8780
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,000
like to just close with or where are we gonna go from here what are your next research steps or what are you excited

8790
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:12,000
to see the community be looking into yeah yes i just mentioned i would be

8800
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
very excited to see this kind of uh school of thoughts coming more closely

8810
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:24,000
together i think more and more people are working lately on this bringing insights of uh

8820
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,000
of more social interactional approaches and more

8830
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:36,000
formal brain approaches together and also philosophy and practice i think it's

8840
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
very important here as because you always argue that

8850
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:47,000
like a fact is data are not never

8860
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
objective um in fact so as soon as we gather specific data

8870
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,000
already we imply theory so only the way we deploy like i think philosophy is

8880
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:03,000
very important here to to form new experiments and new models

8890
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:10,000
not only for interpreting um data and also this is from the research part

8900
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,000
but also practice is very important um so i would like really this kind of approaches to

8910
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,000
be used in practice in real life for example in

8920
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:29,000
psychiatry is one domain where we can re-examine more holistically certain

8930
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
conditions for example in the past we had more sociological more

8940
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
like social psychiatry examined also the external factors uh of like the impact of society in

8950
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:47,000
specific conditions and later we had more cognitive model where in biological genetic models where

8960
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:53,000
we try to identify redefine psychiatric condition based on the

8970
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:00,000
genetics or cognitive abilities i'll be very happy to see now

8980
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,000
these two coming together and one informs the other so a more evidence-based um

8990
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,000
holistic sociological approach in in concrete concrete

9000
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
applications of social policy such as psychiatry education

9010
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:26,000
and other associated domains wow very cool so

9020
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:33,000
thanks a lot for joining this guest stream too it was really a great discussion and really we're looking

9030
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,000
forward to seeing what happens with this line of research and hopefully talking to you and colleagues at future times so

9040
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,000
we'll certainly see you around thank you very much for inviting and thank you very much for your great
