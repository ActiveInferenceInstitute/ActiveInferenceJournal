number 21.1

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,480
it's april 21st 2022 and we're here with

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
shannon prox and shannon will be giving

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,199
a talk coordination dynamics of

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,279
multi-agent interaction

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,320
the talk

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,720
will happen for maybe around an hour and

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,640
then there'll be time for q a so feel

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,720
free to ask any questions in the chat

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
during so off to you shannon looking

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,800
forward to this talk and thanks again

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,239
for joining on acting flag

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,399
awesome thanks so much

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,800
um so i'm shannon daniel's already given

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,520
you

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,440
the title of our talk

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,640
and i'm coming to you from the

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
university of california in merced um

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,039
where i'm a phd candidate

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,719
and i'll actually be defending this

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,559
summer so maybe the next time you hear

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,680
from me

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,440
i'll be talking to you from

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,399
augustana university where i will be

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,239
starting a tenure track professor

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,680
position

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,438
later this fall as an assistant

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,880
professor of psychology and neuroscience

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
um

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,200
oh applause nice thanks

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,159
um

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,360
so that said i'm not going to talk to

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,960
you about neuroscience today i'm going

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,720
to talk to you a little bit about the

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,479
behavior of crowds

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,759
and i stole this roadmap idea from

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,799
previous active inference lab sessions

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,640
and this is kind of outlining

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,320
where we'll be going today

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
so first the first thing we're going to

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,280
do

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
is really dig into a little bit of

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,040
theory and data

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,560
i'm going to give a bit of a brief

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
introduction to multi-agent interaction

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,079
and what kind of human behavior i'm

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,600
interested in

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,280
and i'm going to walk through a couple

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
of ways that

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,479
active inference folks might be

52
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,840
interested in crowd dynamics and

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,040
behavior

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
but primarily i'm going to be focusing

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,640
on dynamical systems theory and the

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
notion of synergies and the tools that

57
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,280
come along with these concepts

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,479
and then finally i'm going to show you

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,160
a model system where we apply these

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,878
tools to a system of coupled metronomes

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
before i look at some empirical data

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
from real real-world interaction

63
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,720
of musical performance and also of uh

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
crowds

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,720
cheering at a basketball game

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
so first what is multi-age interaction

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
um this is simply an interaction that's

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,879
happening between two or more agents in

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,720
our case we're looking at people

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,319
and each of these people they'll have

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,800
their own personal goals and behaviors

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
but their individual behaviors are

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
influenced in some way by interacting

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,480
with other agents in their shared

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
environment

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,440
and i want to talk about two forms of

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
multi-agent coordination today

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
and the best way to introduce this is

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,239
through a short thought experiment

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,760
so

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
i'll just have you imagine the sounds of

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,519
a crowded coffee shop

83
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,280
consider how individuals in that coffee

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,560
shop might be interacting with each

85
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,599
other

86
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,440
there might be some small groups there

87
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,879
might be pairs

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,200
but mostly it's many individuals

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,920
engaging in small temporary interactions

90
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
and these individuals aren't

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
coordinating with every other individual

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
in some sort of cohesive coffee shop

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,959
group they're just a jumble of

94
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,560
individual individuals who are

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,280
cohabiting a shared space

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
now instead

97
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,480
imagine the audience on the floor of a

98
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
rock concert they're cheering or singing

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,440
along with the artists on the stage

100
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
and alternatively imagine the fan

101
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
section at your favorite sporting event

102
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
emerging into a synchronous chant or a

103
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,040
course of resounding booze

104
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,959
imagine how individuals in these large

105
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,400
crowds might be interacting with each

106
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,440
other

107
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,400
as they cheer sing chant or boo

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
they're all sharing in similar

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,239
behavioral states engaging in similar

110
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,560
actions they're likely sharing similar

111
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,319
physiological states like breathing

112
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,040
rates and neural states as well

113
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,799
these crowds are changing together in

114
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,560
time they're behaving and they're

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
coordinating like one large

116
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,120
interdependent group

117
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
and you could refer to these as shared

118
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,480
acoustic spaces

119
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
and they include various levels of

120
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,480
interaction from dyads pairs of

121
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,640
individuals or larger and larger groups

122
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,319
and i might even call these acoustic

123
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,079
social worlds

124
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,000
the acoustic signal that's generated by

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,320
these crowds it carries some information

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
about their behavioral dynamics that

127
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,520
were employed in creating that signal

128
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
and the sounds these crowd makes carry

129
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,720
some sort of information about the

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
status of that crowd either as an

131
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
internet incidental collection of lots

132
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,199
of individual coffee goers or an

133
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,520
integrated and coordinated crowd like a

134
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,000
crowd of concert goers

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,919
and there are of course many

136
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,680
important factors at play when we're

137
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,160
evaluating these acoustic social worlds

138
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
and we're trying to decide whether that

139
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,759
crowd is acting as one integrated

140
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,360
multi-agent system rather than a

141
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,840
collection of independent agents

142
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,000
and these include the social context a

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
coffee shop is different than a concert

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
arena

145
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,680
the development of pattern cultural

146
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
practices in these different contexts

147
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
and different scripts surrounding what

148
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,360
events happen and when these events

149
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
happen

150
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,759
and different regimes of shared

151
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,400
attention between each of these agents

152
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,759
and these are things you've talked about

153
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,000
in the inference lab before

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
um and basically this is all a rather

155
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,759
long-winded way of saying that we expect

156
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,840
coffee shop behavior in a coffee shop

157
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
and concert behavior in a concert arena

158
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
if i were going to talk to you

159
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
in the language of active inference i

160
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
might talk to you today about markov

161
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,759
blankets

162
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,600
and we might talk about this statistical

163
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
boundary um that might be behind a pair

164
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,440
of interacting individuals around a pair

165
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,600
of interacting individuals separating

166
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,280
their internal states of this

167
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,800
interaction with the rest of the

168
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
interactions happening in a coffee stop

169
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,600
crowd

170
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,880
and i might talk about how the

171
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,280
statistical boundary expands as we start

172
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,400
to engage or interact with larger groups

173
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
of people from three to four to maybe

174
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,759
100 people or more if we're in a large

175
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,440
group interaction

176
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,880
and while this can be a really useful

177
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,919
way

178
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,039
to model multi-agent interaction to talk

179
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,600
about a suite of nested markov blankets

180
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,840
we quickly run into questions

181
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
of how a researcher chooses where to

182
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
draw a markup blanket at any given

183
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
system

184
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,160
or where to draw each nested markup

185
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
blanket in a given system and this is a

186
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,400
topic that you've discussed a lot in the

187
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,560
active inference lab

188
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
you've spent some time

189
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,919
talking with yellow brunette berg and

190
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,280
colleagues

191
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
after their recent bbs article

192
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
commentaries and how there might be

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
differences from me as a researcher

194
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
applying some sort of markov blanket

195
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,560
around a system versus the actual

196
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,280
agents interacting in that system

197
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
but i just mentioned this idea of markov

198
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
blankets to situate the topic for the

199
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,919
audience of these interactive inference

200
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,080
lab live streams

201
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,639
as far as measuring uh the emergence of

202
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
an integrated interacting crowd

203
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,479
this is an empirical question that i'm

204
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,360
asking rather than a modeling question

205
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,599
and i'm not a mathematician or a modeler

206
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,680
so for this question about groups of

207
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
interacting people i found empirical

208
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,720
tools from dynamical systems theory and

209
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,080
with the concept of interpersonal

210
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,199
synergies

211
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,400
so that's what i'm going to introduce to

212
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
you guys next

213
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
so dynamical systems theory

214
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
this considers a trajectory of behavior

215
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
of a system over time

216
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,240
and the concept of synergies arises from

217
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,639
the field of motor control as a solution

218
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
to the degrees of freedom problem so

219
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
essentially the degrees of freedom

220
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
problem is that

221
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,039
fine and precise control of every degree

222
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,039
of freedom in a motor movement would be

223
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,800
computationally intractable for the

224
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
nervous system to solve

225
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
and what you see here is

226
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,599
a minor hammering

227
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,400
and you see these light patterns this is

228
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
really sort of the earliest sort of

229
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
motion capture that we had

230
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,919
and we're seeing the trajectory of his

231
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,879
arm

232
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,800
hammering here and you can see that even

233
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,160
though the hammer is hitting the same

234
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,240
place every time you'll have to trust me

235
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,840
that's hitting the same place every time

236
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,680
his arm is taking a slightly different

237
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,400
trajectory to get there but it generally

238
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,080
covers this one swinging behavior

239
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
and that's because the muscles in his

240
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,919
arm here are self-organizing

241
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,000
into coupled and locally constrained

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
degrees of freedom forming temporary

243
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,400
soft assemblies of motor function that's

244
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,319
enabling this flexible movement and

245
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,160
coordination here

246
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,319
put another way

247
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,919
synergies are identified by their

248
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,399
functional specific specificity

249
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,880
dimensional compression and reciprocal

250
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,240
compensation

251
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
what are those

252
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
well the need to perform a specific

253
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
function like hammering that anvil

254
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,560
that functional specificity

255
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
temporarily shapes the coordination of

256
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
several components into one system

257
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,640
that's dimensional compression

258
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,959
in which external and internal

259
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,680
perturbations are flexibly dealt with

260
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,240
via compensatory adjustments of

261
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,399
the components reciprocal compensation

262
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,080
so each muscle in his arm is

263
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,600
compensating for the activity of the

264
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
other muscle

265
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,519
and if he was bumped slightly there

266
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
would be compensation from other muscles

267
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,959
to ensure that anvil hits its location

268
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,720
and this is all done in order

269
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,800
to preserve the functionality of the

270
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,600
whole system for as long as it's needed

271
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
and that last comment for as long as

272
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
it's needed that gets to the notion of

273
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,399
soft assembly

274
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,000
um where

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
any of these units in this picture here

276
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,440
might be functionally

277
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,519
coupled just for as long as you need to

278
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,360
perform that task so if we're talking

279
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,440
about a group of people

280
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,680
these this group of people might form

281
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
some sort of complex system just while

282
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
they're interacting for that meeting

283
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
while they're at that concert until they

284
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,560
disperse

285
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,680
and are ready to move on

286
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,720
um

287
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,640
we can differentiate mere coordination

288
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,959
on which might happen between two people

289
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,800
as a result of engaging with the same

290
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,519
stimulus and similar patterns of actions

291
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,480
from a true interpersonal synergy

292
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,399
and you see here we might see the same

293
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,560
patterns of movement if we have two

294
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,720
individuals who are maybe just listening

295
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,200
to the same set of music

296
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
but if these

297
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
individuals are interacting with each

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
other where the action of one person and

299
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,040
the action of the second person

300
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
is constraining each other then this is

301
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,079
where an interpersonal synergy happens

302
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,800
these synergies are the result of these

303
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,600
micro scale structures of a system

304
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,440
giving rise to macro scale dynamics

305
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,519
when a synergy develops we no longer

306
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,440
need to describe the independent

307
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
dynamics of each micro scale structure

308
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,120
we can instead describe the behavior of

309
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,920
this single interaction dominance system

310
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
which consists of complementary actions

311
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
from each person's motor activity as it

312
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,800
pertains to their role in this softly

313
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
assembled complex system

314
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
and you might even notice some

315
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
similarities here between

316
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,240
these graphics and a graphic we might

317
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,200
draw of nested markov blankets and these

318
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,279
might very well be two sides of the same

319
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,399
coin um just two perspectives with a

320
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,480
very similar conceptual landscape here

321
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,839
and there's a variety of methods for

322
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,680
studying the coordination dynamics that

323
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,560
underlie interpersonal coordination

324
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,040
for example we might ask two people to

325
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,720
sit next to each other and swing

326
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
pendulums or to rock and rocking chairs

327
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,200
and we can measure how these individuals

328
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,480
intentionally or unintentionally

329
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
synchronize their behavior

330
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,880
as each individual's action becomes

331
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,640
coupled to their partner

332
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,720
or we can ask musicians to play together

333
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,160
in a musical ensemble or a duet

334
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
and we can measure how these quartets or

335
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
duets move together in time forming

336
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
these loosely coupled interpersonal

337
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,880
synergies

338
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
but in each of these interactions

339
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,440
a motor or acoustic behavioral output of

340
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,320
each interacting individual was measured

341
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,480
and analyzed for meaningful correlations

342
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
between these individuals

343
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
so importantly in these experiments here

344
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,880
it has been possible to obtain clear

345
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,680
measurements of individual behavior

346
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,120
in order to correlate the behavior of

347
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,200
these individuals and examine the

348
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
emergent coordination dynamics of

349
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,600
multi-agent interaction and social

350
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
self-organization

351
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
but what happens when we have this

352
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,680
massive crowd of people

353
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,959
can we measure the interpersonal

354
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,720
synergies that form in such a large

355
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,839
crowd

356
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,000
how does a group of people move between

357
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,519
novel and habitual

358
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,519
patterns of coordination how does a

359
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,480
multi-agent system navigate transitions

360
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,920
between chaos and stability

361
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
and let's make it a little bit trickier

362
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
the real world is messy and measurement

363
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,800
is difficult in a naturalistic social

364
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,040
interaction and a very large crowd i

365
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,560
probably can't measure the behavior of

366
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
every single individual person

367
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,399
i probably can't give everyone an

368
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
individual microphone i probably can't

369
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,160
track each person's individual brain

370
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,320
states and i might not even have access

371
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,880
to a camera let alone a set of motion

372
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,720
capture cameras and hundreds of markers

373
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
to track everyone's head and limb

374
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,639
movements

375
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,560
so let's come back to the crowds we

376
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
imagined at the start of this discussion

377
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
when you're imagining this coffee shop

378
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,079
crowd and the crowd at the rock concert

379
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,839
you might have also been imagining how

380
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,040
these concert how these crowds sounded

381
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,519
so the difference between

382
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,519
this disjointed noise you might hear at

383
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,600
the coffee shop and this

384
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,920
all together coordinated singing maybe

385
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,240
at a rock concert it's trivial trivially

386
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,959
easy for you or i to identify

387
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,959
an uncoordinated group of independent

388
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,160
individuals

389
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,720
happening to co-exist in a shared space

390
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,560
versus a coordinated group of

391
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,839
interdependent

392
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,399
group members in a crowd

393
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,000
we can simply hear that these two groups

394
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920
of people sound different

395
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,160
similarly we can simply hear when we

396
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,639
ourselves are engaged in participating

397
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
as a collective sort of agent while

398
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,480
we're interacting with a large group of

399
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,440
people

400
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
or in a very large musical ensemble

401
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,800
so i'm taking that idea

402
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,000
and

403
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,920
i think we can measure the sounds that a

404
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,760
crowd makes and with a well-placed

405
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,079
microphone or a few microphones

406
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,480
we can generate a single audio recording

407
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,160
of the sounds that an interacting group

408
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
makes over time

409
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,519
and i know that a human can make

410
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,760
inferences about the interactions and

411
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,440
the acoustic social world of a crowd

412
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,959
just by listening

413
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,560
um so similarly

414
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,639
i want to know if this dynamical systems

415
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,199
toolkit that i have can allow us to make

416
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,279
inferences about the behavior of an

417
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,040
entire complex system

418
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
based on this one acoustic measurement

419
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
that we have access to

420
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
so for the next little while i'm going

421
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
to walk through a bit of theory and then

422
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
a toy example

423
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,279
until i eventually end this talk with

424
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,680
data from real live multi-agent groups

425
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,600
that we're analyzing with tools from

426
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,880
dynamical systems theory

427
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,519
so

428
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,680
one of our most simple

429
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,839
complex dynamical systems

430
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,440
is a

431
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,600
metronome or a pendulum

432
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,000
so christopher huygens first discovered

433
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,639
this activity of two pendulums from from

434
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,079
pendulum clocks

435
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,800
will be related to each other when these

436
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,040
clocks are hanging from a shared surface

437
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,079
and what he found was that these

438
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,639
pendulums would swing in anti-synchrony

439
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,000
with each other

440
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,320
and since then in

441
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
1600s or so there's been lots of

442
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,839
research on pendulums and on coupled

443
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,480
metronomes

444
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,639
and if we put these metronomes a time

445
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,399
keeping device um

446
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,480
for for making music on a shared

447
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
platform and maybe that platform rotates

448
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,440
like this

449
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
um you'll see each of these metronomes

450
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,800
come into synchrony with each other

451
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,959
these are just static pictures so to

452
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,880
really help you visualize this and hear

453
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,120
this i'm recruiting a little bit of help

454
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,560
from the mythbusters

455
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,440
the mythbusters on youtube

456
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,160
so hopefully it is uh free and

457
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,240
uncopyrighted

458
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,920
and i'm just going to skip ahead here to

459
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,279
part way into their episode

460
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
friction and momentum as i can so that

461
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
only the metronome is having the effect

462
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
now let's try to

463
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
adam doubles his trouble with two

464
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,839
metronomes set to the same tick mark

465
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,720
look at the movement on this platform

466
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,199
and after two minutes the shimmy takes

467
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,040
over

468
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
stay with it boys

469
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,560
nice

470
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
nice it's totally working

471
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,079
it just took them a little while to find

472
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,560
each other's rhythm

473
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
cool

474
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,720
i have an idea if i stop the platform

475
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,320
they should drop out of phase

476
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,480
there it is

477
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,119
the moving platform is totally totally

478
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,240
critical to this experiment

479
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,480
so

480
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,520
all right so that's uh adam savage there

481
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,839
with two

482
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,039
metronomes one on earth why does this

483
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,880
matter um well what he's done is

484
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,799
replicated that findings of that

485
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,240
centuries-old experiment that was

486
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,400
originally conducted with pendulums on a

487
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,079
clock

488
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,280
and

489
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,760
he noted that this moving platform here

490
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,400
is what's totally totally critical

491
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
but what i want you to also think of is

492
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,160
that you heard these metronomes slowly

493
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
coming into phase with each other they

494
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,000
were becoming interdependent on each

495
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,320
other's behavior because they are

496
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
connected by this coupling mechanism

497
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,280
here this the shared platform

498
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,760
and as adam correctly notes this moving

499
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,400
platform is totally totally critical and

500
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
in fact when you saw him stop the

501
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,160
platform the metronomes were no longer

502
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,760
coupled and their behavior no longer

503
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,520
affects the other

504
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,679
this platform here can take many forms

505
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,520
as long as it is freely flowing and

506
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,919
responsive to the metronomes movement

507
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,320
and for the metronomes this platform is

508
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,240
the essential coupling mechanism for

509
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,640
this emergent of coordinated acoustic

510
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
behavior

511
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,000
in humans this coordination doesn't have

512
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
to be a physical platform

513
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
in fact

514
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,360
i argue that it is the interaction

515
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
itself which serves as a coupling

516
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,559
mechanism for multi-agent human behavior

517
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,600
and we're going to spend just a little

518
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,280
bit more time with metronomes before i

519
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,720
get onto real human groups here

520
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
so when you have many metronomes on a

521
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,640
shared platform you can have more than

522
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,760
two

523
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,200
they're going to transition from

524
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,360
uncoordinated random phase to

525
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
coordinated synchronous phase and what

526
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,720
you're going to hear next is the

527
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,200
acoustic output of 32 metronomes on a

528
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,039
freely moving platform

529
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,559
and i'm going to justify to you two

530
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,520
things

531
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
that we can identify emergent

532
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,919
coordinated behaviors in acoustic data

533
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,240
and what all

534
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
i'm going to justify what state-space

535
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,720
reconstruction is and how this tool from

536
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,960
dynamical systems can help us to analyze

537
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
that acoustic data

538
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,799
so i'm going to start at the beginning

539
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,720
with each of the metronomes in random

540
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,720
phase

541
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
and this really takes a bit of a time so

542
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,960
we don't have to listen to that for so

543
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,000
long i'm going to skip ahead

544
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,150
[Laughter]

545
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,159
[Music]

546
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
so what you heard was 32 metronomes all

547
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,000
ticking at their own tempo at their

548
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
natural period it sounded like a bunch

549
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,840
of random noise

550
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,880
but this platform again served as a

551
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
coupling mechanism

552
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,799
and synchronization between the

553
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,120
metronomes emerge so they begin to sound

554
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,000
like one group ticking together and this

555
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
is an example of the type of data we'll

556
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
be investigating for the emergence of

557
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,480
coordination and acoustic signals

558
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,600
so keep these metronomes in mind

559
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,600
no don't don't play the metronomes again

560
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,200
the platform is serving as a coupling

561
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,679
mechanism a synchronization emerges they

562
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,880
begin to sound like one group

563
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,520
um so we're going to visit some theory

564
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
i'm going to introduce you to token's

565
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,799
theorem and phase based reconstruction

566
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,480
so if we take one time series from a

567
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,480
system this is the lorenz system here

568
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,159
it's defined by a set of three

569
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,799
differential equations um but what you

570
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,559
need to know is that we can reconstruct

571
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,760
the behavior of this system as a whole

572
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,400
by measuring only one of its parts

573
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,159
this is accomplished by embedding

574
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,640
delayed copies of a single time series

575
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
into multiple dimensions on some delay

576
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
so

577
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,039
here's

578
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,799
one of this time series extracted from

579
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,960
the learn system and we delay that time

580
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,280
series to make another time series delay

581
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,600
once more to make a third time series we

582
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,760
take these three dimensions and we use

583
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,960
them to reconstruct a projection of the

584
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,600
lorenz system and this is phase space

585
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,440
reconstruction

586
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
and you can see that it maintains the

587
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,840
topography or the same shape as the

588
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,600
original lorenz system

589
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,159
in the case of our acoustic data

590
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,320
i'm going to take a time series of that

591
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,880
sound that acoustic signal

592
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,039
and i'm going to follow these steps here

593
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,640
to

594
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,320
i'm going to follow these steps here to

595
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,600
reconstruct the behavior of those

596
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,159
metronomes over time

597
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,360
and once we've completed this

598
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,679
phase-based reconstruction i'm going to

599
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,280
visualize the behavior of our

600
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,520
reconstructed system by generating what

601
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
we call recurrent spots

602
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,760
this is done by plotting recurrent

603
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
points from the reconstructive phase

604
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,320
base within some radius that we set

605
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,000
and we can evaluate the structures in

606
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,320
these recurrence plots using recurrence

607
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,960
quantification analysis so on the right

608
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,200
here you're seeing a few examples of

609
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,039
different time series

610
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,559
and you're seeing their reconstructed

611
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,080
phase space here

612
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
and on the bottom you're seeing the

613
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,320
recurrence plot that we

614
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,000
generate from these reconstructed phase

615
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,360
space

616
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,960
so one of the simplest measures that we

617
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,039
can glean from our currents plot is the

618
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,039
rate that states recur and this is

619
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,000
called

620
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,799
recurrence rate

621
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,720
and on the left here we're seeing a time

622
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,679
series of a simple sine wave and when we

623
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,200
reconstruct it we end up seeing

624
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,240
something a bit like an oval or a circle

625
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,440
and when we plot a point on our

626
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
recurrent system every time a recurrent

627
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,240
spot here every time our system revisits

628
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,799
a space on the circle here

629
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,400
so in the sine waves recurrence plot

630
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,960
we're seeing these diagonal lines these

631
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,480
diagonal lines are reflecting

632
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
deterministic behavior

633
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,480
and they track how similar

634
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
similar sequences of values change over

635
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,360
time

636
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
so this sine wave here it's reliably

637
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,200
deterministic if it starts here it's

638
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,720
going to go here next then it's going to

639
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,240
go there next

640
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,320
and that gives us these long recurrence

641
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,520
values here

642
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,880
and as

643
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,280
you've probably expect this measure is

644
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,440
called determinism

645
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,080
in the middle we see uncorrelated white

646
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,840
noise and you can see the signal already

647
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,080
looks much more random than our sine

648
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,280
wave

649
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
and when we reconstruct it in face space

650
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,039
i don't really see a shape here that we

651
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,159
can

652
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,080
get much out of

653
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
and underneath you see our recurrence

654
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,679
plot and it looks similarly random you

655
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,960
could think of it like white noise on

656
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,120
your television even

657
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,760
finally on the right we see a time

658
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
series extracted from speech it's a

659
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
little bit deterministic like our sine

660
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,080
wave if it goes up it's going to come

661
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,279
down

662
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,760
but it's also drifting a bit and you can

663
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,559
see if we reconstruct that phase space

664
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,720
instead of a simple oval we're seeing

665
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
we're seeing a sort of transient signal

666
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,919
here

667
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,919
and in the recurrence plot

668
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,679
um we're also going to be seeing

669
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,960
variation in length in these diagonals

670
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,720
and finally recurrent spots can contain

671
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,240
these vertical structures that you don't

672
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,240
see here in addition to diagonals

673
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,760
and these are indications of periods of

674
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
stability we measure these with a value

675
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,240
called laminarity in laminarity you can

676
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,720
contrast it with determinism it measures

677
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,039
how a signal is organized in terms of

678
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,440
simple similar absolute values that are

679
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,600
stable over time

680
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,120
and this is

681
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,159
one representation of recurrence plots

682
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,520
it takes a little bit of time to get

683
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,799
comfortable with what our current spot

684
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,679
is so i just have a different

685
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,760
visualization to show you a little bit

686
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,679
of the same thing

687
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,480
so

688
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,360
these are the same set of rqa measures

689
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,039
that we take from our system and plot on

690
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,880
recurrent spots

691
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,480
this is demonstrating

692
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,640
recurrence rate it's just the percentage

693
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,200
of recurrent points that we see on this

694
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,679
recurrence plot over time and it

695
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,279
represents patterns of behavior that

696
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,440
repeat over time

697
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
determinism

698
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,840
is the percentage of points that

699
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,000
fall in a diagonal at any time and it

700
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,320
represents behaviors that belongs to a

701
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,960
longer sequence of behavior

702
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,360
entropy this is the variability and

703
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,159
lengths of these diagonal lines down

704
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,520
here

705
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,120
and it represents the amount of disorder

706
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,039
that there might be in these sequences

707
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,880
finally laminarity here are the

708
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
percentage of points that fall on a

709
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,720
vertical line and this represents

710
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,799
clusters of behavior that might repeat

711
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,880
for a length of time like when a system

712
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
revisits a period of behavior

713
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
leaves and returns that behavioral state

714
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,559
again

715
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,279
all right so it's a lot of theory i need

716
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,799
to bring you back to the metronome so we

717
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,559
know what's going on here

718
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,799
so what you see here this is a picture

719
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,799
of our uncoordinated metronomes they're

720
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,640
moving in all sorts of directions and

721
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,159
finally our coordinated metronomes at

722
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,520
the bottom

723
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,000
and i took 30 second a 30 second

724
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,679
acoustic signal from each

725
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,559
each set of behaviors here

726
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,919
and on the right i have signals from

727
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,679
this uncoordinated metronome and the

728
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,919
recurrent spot we generated from them

729
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,440
and you can see this first recurrent

730
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,039
spot it resembles that kind of

731
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,200
uncorrelated white noise i don't see a

732
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
lot of structure here

733
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
and then in our time series for the

734
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,520
coordinated metronomes you start to see

735
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,200
some periodicities kind of in this

736
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
signal here and you see a lot more of

737
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
these laminar structures down here in

738
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,120
the bottom these vertical structures

739
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,440
which indicate these periods of stable

740
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,960
states in this group metronome behavior

741
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,640
i could break that down even smaller and

742
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
i could look at five seconds of sound

743
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,120
and we see the same structures emerging

744
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
you can also see a bit more clearly

745
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,799
these spikes that occur in the

746
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,960
coordinated metronomes that correlate

747
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,799
with these vertical structures than we

748
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,400
did in the last plot

749
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
so this is great now you're experts

750
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,600
you've learned everything you need to

751
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,360
know to evaluate the emergence of

752
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
coordination

753
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,080
when we measure it from a global

754
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
acoustic signal and you know how to

755
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,679
visualize it in a recurrence plot and

756
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,600
how to interpret that plot so we're

757
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,399
going to apply all of this to human data

758
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,919
and i want to remember for the

759
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,760
metronomes this platform is the

760
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,679
essential coupling mechanism for the

761
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,000
emergence of coordinated behavior

762
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,279
for humans

763
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,120
the interaction is totally totally

764
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,240
critical

765
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,320
so say me and my colleague marley reeves

766
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,840
from the applied mathematics department

767
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,520
here uc merced

768
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,440
so we don't need a shared platform

769
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,200
instead we just need to interact with

770
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
other human beings in order to couple

771
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,199
our multi-agent human behavior

772
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
so now that we've got this far

773
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,320
i promised you some empirical data

774
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,799
and i'm going to tell you about

775
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,720
multi-agent interaction first in a

776
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
specific musical ensemble performing a

777
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,640
specific musical work

778
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,200
and then in the crowd at a basketball

779
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,720
game

780
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,600
so first our musical ensemble here

781
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
um

782
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,960
they are performing a work called

783
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,880
welcome to the imagination world by

784
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,120
tsuki shimizu

785
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,279
and this group of musicians um they're

786
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,960
performing this piece that was composed

787
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,039
to do something interesting so the

788
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,360
composer wrote the first few minutes of

789
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,200
this musical piece to be completely

790
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,440
random in music theory terms we call

791
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,679
this aliatwork it's when some element of

792
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,240
the music is left up to chance or to

793
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,919
whatever the performers decide to play

794
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,520
in that moment

795
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,520
so the start of this piece sounds a

796
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,320
little bit like this

797
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,320
[Music]

798
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,419
[Applause]

799
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,729
[Music]

800
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,760
so

801
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,700
[Music]

802
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,779
[Applause]

803
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,120
[Music]

804
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,640
okay that flute gets a little loud for

805
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,440
me um so this is not the musicians

806
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,520
warming up on stage this is the actual

807
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,559
music

808
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,720
the musicians themselves are instructed

809
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,960
not to interact with each other

810
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,399
and you can see this is kind of hard for

811
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,760
musicians

812
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,360
because you do hear

813
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,279
musicians sort of taking turns starting

814
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,200
each musical line a little bit

815
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,039
and it's a little bit hard to play

816
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,880
completely random you hear some folks

817
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,960
playing scales up and down but in

818
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,520
general this is supposed to sound

819
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,960
random and they're not supposed to be

820
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
coordinated

821
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,799
and after a few minutes the musical

822
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,520
score actually directs the musicians to

823
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
begin coordinating with each other and

824
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,360
when this happens i'll show you what

825
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,840
that sounds like

826
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:11,640
[Music]

827
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,240
so

828
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:35,900
[Music]

829
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,330
[Applause]

830
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,760
[Music]

831
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,200
i'm gonna stop it right before it gets

832
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,399
exciting

833
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,159
um so once they've been coordinating

834
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,080
with each other they begin to sound like

835
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,039
one interacting musical ensemble

836
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,840
so this musical interaction is serving

837
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,600
as the coupling mechanism

838
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,120
and the coordination between the

839
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,080
musicians arises and they begin to sound

840
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,158
like one interacting ensemble

841
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,399
now we're not seeing emergent or

842
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,919
spontaneous interaction in this

843
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,000
particular musical composition and this

844
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,480
performance the musicians are told by

845
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,399
the musical score precisely when to

846
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,720
begin coordinating their actions

847
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,519
and

848
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,120
in this particular performance the

849
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,519
divide between uncoordinated and joint

850
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,320
music making is made even more apparent

851
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,679
by a theatrical trick the lights turn on

852
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,440
and then the conductor arrives on stage

853
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
just as the musicians begin to play

854
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,519
together as one ensemble but i'm using

855
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,679
this as a model system because i know

856
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,039
the behavior they're supposed to be

857
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,880
engaged and i know that there's going to

858
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,279
be a transition from uncoordinated to

859
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,200
coordinated behavior

860
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,960
so i can use that knowledge to ask the

861
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,159
questions

862
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,799
are there any differences in non-linear

863
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,919
recurrence dynamics measured by rqa

864
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,919
between the uncoordinated acoustic

865
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,399
behavior and the coordinated behavior of

866
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,518
this musical ensemble

867
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,559
and

868
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,720
spoiler alert there absolutely are so at

869
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,200
the top you're seeing um the first and

870
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,840
last 30 seconds of that first piece the

871
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,080
first part of the performance

872
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,679
on the bottom you're seeing the first

873
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,519
and last 30 seconds of the second part

874
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,679
of the performance once the musicians

875
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,200
have become coordinated

876
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,760
and we can see that the acoustic

877
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,440
behavior from these musicians and the

878
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,279
coordinated section of the music is more

879
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,760
structured we see these bursty vertical

880
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,279
lines here

881
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,600
um with where you have these stretches

882
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,000
of connected sound connected stretches

883
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,919
of sound um for

884
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,279
periods of time

885
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,679
and again we can look even closer

886
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,159
at five second samples and we can see

887
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,000
the same structures

888
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,360
in

889
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,559
same vertical structures in the

890
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,320
coordinated but not the uncoordinated

891
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,720
sections so if i take just

892
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,120
these little blocks here

893
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,919
zoom in to five seconds we see a little

894
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,919
bit more structure here and a little bit

895
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,679
less or a little bit noisier structure

896
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,720
here

897
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,120
um these are just for visualizations

898
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,880
this is not actually the five second

899
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,320
snippet here

900
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,840
but it works for

901
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,480
getting the idea across

902
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,240
okay so cool i see these structures in

903
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,919
the recurrence plot

904
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,000
but is it really more structured

905
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,279
when musicians are coordinated

906
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,279
we can do some statistics and we can

907
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,080
visualize our data

908
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,279
in another way so these are

909
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,880
distributions of all of those measures

910
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,399
that we extract extracted from the

911
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,919
recurrent spot

912
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,360
and you can see

913
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,600
coordinated sections in blue

914
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,840
uncoordinated sections in red and we're

915
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,360
seeing that when the musicians begin

916
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,519
interacting with each other as a

917
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,840
coordinated musical ensemble

918
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,600
recurrence and stability measures

919
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,559
increased overall so we have higher also

920
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,880
more variable rqa measures

921
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,720
when they're coordinated and we see

922
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,039
lower and less variable rqa measures

923
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,200
when they're uncoordinated

924
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,039
and we can see this even a little more

925
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,240
clearly

926
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,919
if we can

927
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,880
plot

928
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,440
those same measures over time

929
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,720
and

930
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,320
the blue and purple lines here are

931
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,840
representing uncoordinated section of

932
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,520
the piece orange and green is

933
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,159
represented sorry blue and purple is

934
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,679
coordinated

935
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,079
orange and green is uncoordinated

936
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,040
and we can see that over time when the

937
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,800
musicians are coordinated and acting

938
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,399
like one

939
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,480
interacting ensemble they're able to

940
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,560
explore a greater variety of recurrence

941
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,440
dynamics they're able to explore

942
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,839
more behavioral states than when they're

943
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,839
uncoordinated and we see all of these

944
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,440
measures no matter what they are

945
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,040
hovering around a small subset of

946
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,639
dynamics

947
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,560
now you would be forgiven if you are

948
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,119
skeptical of these results after all the

949
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,040
entire musical performance is over eight

950
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,599
minutes long maybe i simply chose the

951
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,079
most uncoordinated sections and the most

952
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,399
uncoordinated sections of the song

953
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,079
and you'd be smart to have this worry

954
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,480
our peer reviewers shared the same worry

955
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,280
so

956
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,839
we graphed the time series of rqa

957
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,400
metrics for the entire piece and it's

958
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
pretty clear even if you don't know what

959
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,520
these values are that there's some

960
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,440
difference in all of these top pink and

961
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,680
blue kind of graphs and these bottom

962
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,160
orange and green type of graph

963
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
we're seeing this same greater

964
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,599
variability

965
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,359
greater values and more variability in

966
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,000
each of these rqa metrics

967
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,320
when the musicians are coordinated than

968
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,000
when they are performing as a bunch of

969
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,760
individuals on stage

970
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,599
and the takeaway here

971
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,720
is that

972
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,040
these musicians when they're interacting

973
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
together as a musical ensemble they're

974
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,880
able to explore a greater variety of

975
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,440
acoustic behavior when they're when they

976
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,119
formed a single

977
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,680
complex system an interpersonal synergy

978
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,599
then when they were acting as a lot of

979
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,800
individuals on stage and we were able to

980
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,119
use these non-linear statistical methods

981
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,119
from dynamical systems theory to measure

982
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,680
that change

983
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,040
cool so that's a musical ensemble

984
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,720
i'm using it as a model system because

985
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,960
we know what the behavior should be

986
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,560
can i measure this

987
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,640
from a different kind of system one that

988
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,960
doesn't have a script dictating the

989
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,280
behavior of what's going on on the stage

990
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,560
so to do that i look at data recorded

991
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,359
from

992
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,400
the student section of a byu basketball

993
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,760
game

994
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,359
and this data

995
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,000
was collected by butler and colleagues

996
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,599
and labeled by

997
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,119
many hard-working undergraduate students

998
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,040
and we have basically recordings

999
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,760
from the crowd that are labeled based on

1000
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,440
what kind of

1001
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,960
crowd sounds they're making whether

1002
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,640
they're cheering this is like a loud

1003
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,920
positive crowd vocally vocalization

1004
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,320
um whether they're applauding so this is

1005
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
mostly clapping but could include some

1006
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,680
vocalization

1007
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,920
um distraction noise when you're trying

1008
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,240
to distract someone from a free throw

1009
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,280
mainly

1010
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,440
um positive chance so this is the

1011
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,839
fans chanting um their

1012
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,760
their byu cougars chants or defense

1013
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,599
um negative chanting it's when they're

1014
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,920
angry rather than cheering positively

1015
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,320
singing and then silence

1016
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,680
so

1017
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,040
we're taking this data and we're going

1018
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,839
to ask a similar question so we don't

1019
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,200
have a clear transition from

1020
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,599
uncoordinated to coordinated behavior

1021
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,119
but we do have all of these different

1022
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,040
types of behavior

1023
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,839
so

1024
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,040
we're going to ask is there a

1025
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,200
relationship between non-linear

1026
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,079
recurrence dynamics measured by rqa and

1027
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,079
these different categories of acoustic

1028
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,040
behavior

1029
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,359
at the crowd at this basketball game

1030
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,280
we follow the same process

1031
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,000
we extract acoustic signals

1032
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,079
and we cut them up into five second

1033
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,160
samples here

1034
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,920
and we use these signals to generate

1035
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,680
recurrence plots

1036
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,680
and we take the measures from that

1037
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,280
recurrence plot to see if there's

1038
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,040
anything different and i'm going to show

1039
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,800
you just to recurrent spot in the next

1040
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,880
slide i'm going to show you a plot from

1041
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,520
positive chanting and from distraction

1042
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
noise

1043
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,760
so here's distraction noise

1044
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,320
it looks like white noise it looks

1045
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,839
like what you would see

1046
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,680
on your television screen

1047
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,359
and when i show you positive chance

1048
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,119
there's clearly a striking difference

1049
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,440
there's almost no structure in this

1050
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,880
distraction noise here but there are

1051
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,960
very clear laminar bursts of activity

1052
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,520
represented in these vertical lines

1053
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,480
and in fact these two plots look very

1054
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,400
similar to our unsynchronized and

1055
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,240
synchronized metronomes way back from

1056
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,760
the middle of this talk

1057
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,000
and intuitively this makes sense if

1058
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,440
you're trying to distract someone during

1059
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,040
a free throw you're making all sorts of

1060
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,880
random sounds you might be shaking your

1061
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,960
keys around people are stomping on the

1062
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,040
stands but if you're cheering your team

1063
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,800
on trying to motivate them to score more

1064
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,880
points or if you're mounting a strong

1065
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
defense you're going to be working

1066
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,280
together shouting whatever your chant is

1067
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,560
go team go defense and it's going to

1068
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,480
occur in a very rhythmic metronomic

1069
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
faction

1070
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,200
and we can compare how all of these

1071
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,119
distributions of rqa metrics look

1072
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,400
between each different kind of crowd

1073
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,440
noise

1074
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,119
and you can see there's quite a lot of

1075
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,520
overlap but there's also some difference

1076
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
so positive and negative chance seem to

1077
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,599
be a bit similar to each other in every

1078
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,760
category which makes sense because

1079
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,280
whether they're chanting in a positive

1080
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,200
or negative energy it's still this

1081
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,520
rhythmic isochronous behavior that's

1082
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,920
happening

1083
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,079
um distraction noise cheer and applause

1084
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,760
on the other hand all seem pretty

1085
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,920
similar to each other no matter where we

1086
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,599
look at them

1087
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,079
and then finally all the way on the

1088
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,359
lowest scale is angry noise here

1089
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,359
um and one

1090
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,280
thing to note is we had very

1091
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,760
very few samples of angry noise here so

1092
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,280
that could be why we're seeing a few of

1093
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,760
these differences and if we had more

1094
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,359
samples maybe ingrid noise would look a

1095
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,520
bit more like distraction noise

1096
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
so visually we can see there are

1097
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,119
differences in these rqa metrics for all

1098
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,040
of these crowd sounds

1099
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,800
and we don't want to just do

1100
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
visuals so we can do some statistics

1101
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,000
here

1102
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,040
this is just another visualization

1103
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,079
of our estimated marginal means showing

1104
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,000
pairwise comparisons between every crowd

1105
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,640
sound category and it's a graphical

1106
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,040
representation of the estimated marginal

1107
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,280
means if these red lines overlap that

1108
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,720
means there are not significant

1109
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,000
differences

1110
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,960
between um for instance distract noise

1111
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,040
cheering applause here

1112
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,880
positive and negative do look different

1113
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,480
however

1114
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,960
interesting um and then angry noise is

1115
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,440
far out by itself

1116
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,240
um so knowing this um i mentioned very

1117
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,680
briefly earlier i have a colleague in

1118
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,760
the applied mathematics department and

1119
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,240
one thing she's interested in is whether

1120
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,359
we can give a machine learning algorithm

1121
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,359
some of these rqa metrics to tell the

1122
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,800
difference between these different crowd

1123
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,640
sounds

1124
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,040
the researchers at byu have done this

1125
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,200
with traditional sound metrics spectral

1126
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,599
analysis captural analysis and we're

1127
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,680
doing it with our rqa metrics so we're

1128
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
focused more on the rhythmic content

1129
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,040
rather than pitch or spectral content of

1130
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,400
the sound

1131
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
and she

1132
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,440
is doing this in two ways so one is

1133
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
training a

1134
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,040
neural network with

1135
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,720
image classification

1136
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,680
and

1137
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,040
what i'm going to show you a few results

1138
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,920
from is a random forest that is using

1139
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,480
these recurrent features as input and

1140
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,280
doing some future vector classification

1141
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,119
using decision trees

1142
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,880
and doing some stuff that if you ask me

1143
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
questions about i will not know the

1144
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,040
answer

1145
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,640
because i'm not the mathematician in

1146
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,240
this context but

1147
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,839
once she's trained that algorithm

1148
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,920
it can actually learn the differences

1149
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,599
between these crowd sounds so if these

1150
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,280
are dark blue along the diagonal that

1151
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,760
means that it categorized cheer very

1152
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,359
well if they're light blue that means

1153
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,839
there was some confusion here

1154
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:52,720
um

1155
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,560
and if we remember

1156
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,040
through one of the previous graphs

1157
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,960
applause distraction noise all kind of

1158
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
look similar to each other so if we sort

1159
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,640
of smush those

1160
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,520
into one distraction category um put

1161
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,280
applause and share together and put

1162
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,599
positive negative chance here um we get

1163
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,480
even better classification and this part

1164
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,319
is something we're still working on

1165
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,720
hopefully we will be ready to submit in

1166
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,040
a paper kind of soon

1167
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,400
um but now that we're ending on this

1168
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,240
really complex point

1169
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,919
um what have we learned

1170
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,520
first we took a

1171
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,839
quick dive into dynamical systems theory

1172
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,040
and the notion of interpersonal

1173
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,520
synergies i told you that interpersonal

1174
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,760
synergies form when a functional

1175
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,000
coupling emerges between the behavior of

1176
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,240
two or more individuals this kind of

1177
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,119
synergy can arise when individuals begin

1178
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,680
to coordinate and as an integrated

1179
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,000
multi-aging group of people

1180
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,520
but measuring the submergence of

1181
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,839
coordination in large groups of people

1182
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,319
is difficult even if we can intuitively

1183
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,000
hear the difference between a coffee

1184
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,480
shop crowd and a crowd at a concert or

1185
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,000
sporting event

1186
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,839
without individual signals from each

1187
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,079
person in this interacting group it's

1188
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,319
very hard for scientists to measure when

1189
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,160
the coordination occurs

1190
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,760
but if we can hear this difference then

1191
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,800
maybe we can measure it so we practice

1192
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,640
with the toy model a pair of coupled

1193
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,480
metronomes transitioning from

1194
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,560
uncoordinated to coordinated activity

1195
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,640
unsynchronized to synchronized and then

1196
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,560
we applied these same non-linear

1197
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
statistical analysis techniques from

1198
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,560
dynamical systems to measure

1199
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,720
uncoordinated and coordinated behavior

1200
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,160
in a musical ensemble

1201
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,880
transitioned once too far

1202
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,520
ah my musical ensemble is behind our

1203
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,200
graphs here apologies about that i can

1204
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,880
come back to this slide

1205
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,640
um so when we want to learn something

1206
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,359
about social behavior music provides a

1207
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,680
good model system you know

1208
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,160
roughly and can manipulate what roles

1209
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,599
each member of the musical group is

1210
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,520
performing and sometimes you even have

1211
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,839
the aid of a musical script like we did

1212
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,240
to be able to carefully um

1213
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,319
measure the coordination dynamics that

1214
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,040
emerge in this joint music making

1215
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,440
these same intentional interdependencies

1216
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,280
which arise from a group of musicians

1217
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,680
co-creating music together

1218
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,160
can also emerge as the result of local

1219
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
interaction between individuals and

1220
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,240
large interaction groups of people like

1221
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,720
crowds at a basketball game

1222
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,200
and we investigated that by measuring

1223
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,960
the different crowd sounds that these

1224
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,160
fans made

1225
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,000
and the different acoustic behavioral

1226
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,520
dynamics we could observe in each of

1227
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,000
these crowd sounds um with fans at a byu

1228
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,240
basketball game

1229
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,280
and

1230
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,760
all this work i was not done just by me

1231
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,599
um but also my colleague marley reeves

1232
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,760
in the applied mathematics department

1233
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,000
my advisor mesh bell super mania and

1234
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,680
also our colleagues chris kello and

1235
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,280
michael spivey

1236
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,920
so that's all i got thank you so much

1237
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,720
for having me

1238
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,640
awesome thank you

1239
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,800
you can unshare and

1240
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,880
all ask some questions and if anyone in

1241
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,319
the live chat has questions they can

1242
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,560
also ask

1243
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,920
sounds great are you going back to the

1244
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,040
slides

1245
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,560
i was going to go back to the slide i

1246
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,240
also cannot find the unshare button

1247
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,839
ah it's fine it's it's in jitsi the same

1248
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,480
as the share button but yeah

1249
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,720
cool

1250
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
all right

1251
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,880
well

1252
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,079
a lot of very interesting research and

1253
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,680
really appreciate the

1254
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,520
care and to kind of

1255
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,760
speaking it very concisely and clearly

1256
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,800
so just if i could give one takeaway

1257
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,119
that i thought was really fascinating

1258
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,520
so you in the fuceroli 2014 quotation he

1259
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,240
talked about how there was like synergy

1260
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,640
and about the continuum

1261
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,960
and the spaces that are

1262
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,880
uncoordinated versus increasingly

1263
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,839
coordinated from the sheet music which

1264
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,960
is one type to the emergent coordination

1265
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,079
and then

1266
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:24,430
um

1267
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:27,359
[Music]

1268
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,200
i thought that was an interesting way to

1269
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,240
open up coordination not in a framework

1270
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,760
of either

1271
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,920
strong versus weak emergence

1272
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,839
but rather within a

1273
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,000
directly measurable dynamical systems

1274
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,119
perspective

1275
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,920
and then at the end to

1276
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,560
do the machine learning and be able to

1277
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,960
train a model on the recurrence

1278
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,240
statistics

1279
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,720
and then identify the system it's like

1280
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,119
there's information about the system

1281
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,160
state as identified by experts which is

1282
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,200
what that labeling task was about that's

1283
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,280
retained like just in the coordination

1284
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,720
pattern

1285
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,960
and so there's something about the

1286
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,800
patterns across systems that can be

1287
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,119
generalized that captures also

1288
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,800
important information

1289
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,079
and that's an intuition that i think

1290
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,160
people often bring

1291
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,040
up when talking about dynamical systems

1292
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,880
but i really thought it was made clear

1293
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,400
with how you presented it

1294
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,960
yeah thanks i'm glad that i got across

1295
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,319
that was kind of a message i was trying

1296
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,040
to share

1297
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,839
one place to maybe start is this soft

1298
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,920
assembly so where does this soft

1299
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,480
assembly come into play and i guess just

1300
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,359
what

1301
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,880
does it mean in

1302
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,240
human teams or communication

1303
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,200
yeah um so this this notion of soft

1304
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,200
assembly um

1305
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,800
let me think of something that's not

1306
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,839
soft something that's

1307
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,440
hardwired if

1308
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,440
oh i don't have i don't have an opposite

1309
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,280
example to soft assembly so if you take

1310
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,160
if you take like a

1311
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,599
a tool

1312
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,079
like i don't know a wrench it only can

1313
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,400
move in one way the parts of the wrench

1314
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,160
or the parts of a set of pliers they're

1315
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,760
not softly assembled they're always

1316
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,880
attached

1317
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,480
and they're always going to perform that

1318
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,440
function

1319
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,480
right

1320
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,880
but if we think about

1321
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,400
lots of kind of systems if we think

1322
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,280
about

1323
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,680
human systems um

1324
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,359
if we think about

1325
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,720
um ant colonies or if we think about

1326
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,640
anything where an individual member of

1327
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,640
that system could leave if it wanted to

1328
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,920
or could leave when they're not

1329
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,520
interacting that's what we would call a

1330
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,839
softly assembled system

1331
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,520
and a group of humans

1332
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,400
um

1333
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,839
the example that i was thinking of was

1334
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,000
any group of humans that comes together

1335
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,760
um for some amount of time if we're

1336
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,839
talking about musicians on stage

1337
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,160
they're together and they function as a

1338
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,880
string quartet or as an orchestra so

1339
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,480
long as they're on stage and performing

1340
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,319
together but then they can pack their

1341
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,880
instruments up and they can go home so

1342
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,800
there's not a strong bond or like a

1343
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,680
strong

1344
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,200
physical

1345
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,200
mechanical connection that's forcing

1346
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,880
their interaction

1347
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,319
to occur

1348
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:15,359
it's just happening during that process

1349
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,040
because you also connected that to like

1350
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,800
the transient motor

1351
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,040
chains and so that was

1352
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,920
pretty

1353
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,280
um

1354
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,800
interesting

1355
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,920
um

1356
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,920
again anyone who's watching live can ask

1357
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,000
a question otherwise i'll just keep on

1358
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,880
asking about a few points so

1359
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,280
you use the metronome as a

1360
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,319
example of synchronization

1361
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,880
but also there's listening to repetitive

1362
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,000
music

1363
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,079
whether it's like electronic music

1364
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,520
that's repetitive or other kinds of

1365
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,559
music

1366
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,760
uh

1367
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,559
binaural beats so

1368
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,920
what

1369
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,960
is this repetition listening

1370
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,440
nature and what like kind of makes us

1371
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,400
select a given level of repetition to

1372
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,800
desire

1373
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
like what how do we think about that in

1374
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,319
terms of how you presented it with the

1375
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,480
recurrence here

1376
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,160
yeah so there's two things that i would

1377
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,599
i would think about so first you

1378
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,079
mentioned um binaural beats and we

1379
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,920
want to listen to these very repetitive

1380
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
musical patterns

1381
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,280
um and so

1382
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,520
there's two ways that

1383
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,359
our brains might be interpreting

1384
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,040
rhythmic patterns

1385
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,920
in music um one notion that is probably

1386
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,680
very meaningful to the active inference

1387
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,280
lab and what you talk about

1388
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,760
um is is predictive coding

1389
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,400
um and the idea that we have

1390
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,319
um these hierarchical predictions that

1391
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,480
are happening in the brain so when we

1392
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,240
perceive this low-level stimulus this

1393
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,680
rhythmic input

1394
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,119
we're constantly predicting when the

1395
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,240
next input is going to arrive

1396
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,000
and we're only passing up areas when our

1397
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
prediction is wrong

1398
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,280
and

1399
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,920
isochronous these very rhythmic beats

1400
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,319
are really easy to predict

1401
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,280
um but there's another option it could

1402
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,640
be that we're not doing any prediction

1403
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,240
at all and we just have these inherent

1404
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,640
oscillations these natural frequencies

1405
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,800
of oscillations in our brain

1406
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,680
and

1407
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,319
when we hear a rhythmic pattern

1408
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,920
that is similar enough

1409
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,800
we

1410
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,079
naturally entrain to that beat or that

1411
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,280
rhythm

1412
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,119
drives this oscillatory behavior and so

1413
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,160
you have

1414
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,240
this emergent entrainment and no

1415
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,240
predictions necessary

1416
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,160
and you could be in either camp

1417
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,559
i alternate between being a firmly

1418
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,599
predictive coding camp and being a

1419
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,520
entrainment camp

1420
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,200
um but this

1421
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,520
either way um what seems to be really

1422
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,760
important in this activity is activity

1423
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,839
of your motor system and your ability

1424
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,440
for your motor system which is really

1425
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,280
good at making periodic movements like

1426
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,119
moving walking

1427
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,359
um the ability of the motor system to

1428
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,559
help

1429
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,559
the auditory system to communicate with

1430
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,160
the auditory system

1431
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,599
um in

1432
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,520
predicting when the next speed occurs or

1433
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,520
in entraining to the beat of a sound

1434
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,440
like that

1435
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,240
um

1436
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,839
and that's with binaural beats the

1437
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,760
second thing that i would bring up

1438
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,480
is

1439
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,240
we like these binaural beasts maybe

1440
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,240
they're relaxing for some people

1441
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,319
um but we're listening to music there's

1442
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,960
a phenomenon called musical groove

1443
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,400
um and this

1444
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,880
is when it's very scientific no it is

1445
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,400
actually the scientific term um peter

1446
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,079
gennada in 2012 uh coined this and it's

1447
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,880
uh when the rhythm of the music is it's

1448
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,040
just complicated enough

1449
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,440
that it makes us want to move to music

1450
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,880
so it's just in that sweet spot where

1451
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,599
it's

1452
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,280
predictable but not quite predictable

1453
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,480
enough

1454
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,200
and it engages our motor system instead

1455
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
of just passively engaging it

1456
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,880
it actually makes us move to the beat of

1457
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,920
the music

1458
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,520
this might be because when we move when

1459
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,160
we tap our foot when we dance we're

1460
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,599
better able to predict when the next

1461
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,240
beat happens

1462
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,839
thanks the the groove uh again jargon so

1463
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,119
apologies

1464
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,319
it it

1465
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,800
reminds me of the zone of proximal

1466
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,319
development

1467
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,559
and kind of what does it mean if there

1468
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,559
was a build up and too much tension

1469
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,640
being built like a ramping but then

1470
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,880
there's for example um when there's

1471
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,520
quarter notes for two measures and then

1472
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,200
eighths and then sixteens and then it's

1473
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,599
like when it goes even faster and then

1474
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:24,559
it

1475
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,359
it's like a meme with making it more

1476
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,559
exciting

1477
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,200
because there it's reflecting a

1478
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,240
uh

1479
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,839
cultural and

1480
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,079
potentially related to biology like our

1481
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,440
priors on

1482
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,000
increasing rate of

1483
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,520
the the

1484
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,960
sound is like meaning something because

1485
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,319
it can't go on forever so then something

1486
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,559
is exciting or something is changing so

1487
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,079
then that's very interesting about how

1488
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,040
our

1489
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,960
like what is quiet what is loud what do

1490
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,800
those represent and what are the priors

1491
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,280
of the musical experience

1492
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,559
that becoming cultured in different ways

1493
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,160
so

1494
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,640
yeah maybe how does it help us think

1495
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,800
about like different preferences amongst

1496
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,079
individuals

1497
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,839
in the kind of music that they want to

1498
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:08,720
play

1499
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,119
or engage in or listen to or how they

1500
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,079
want to

1501
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,440
engage with that music

1502
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,280
yeah so

1503
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,720
so much so much content and what you

1504
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,680
just said

1505
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,800
um

1506
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,839
the one is is this like notion of

1507
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:24,720
anticipation when the rhythm keeps

1508
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,640
getting faster and faster

1509
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,160
um and

1510
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,640
there's um

1511
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,319
a whole book by leonard meyer about

1512
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,000
how

1513
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,119
music

1514
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,079
is correlated with emotions and how

1515
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,000
there's this idea that a composer is

1516
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,760
playing with these periods of tension

1517
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,079
and release so whether that tension is

1518
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,319
from build-up of rhythmic events and we

1519
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,200
usually expect

1520
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,839
the faster rhythm gets maybe

1521
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,599
it's associated with

1522
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,040
a certain

1523
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,440
activity in the music or we expect it to

1524
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,960
slow down after it's gotten faster for

1525
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,240
so long

1526
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,640
or you're thinking about um when the

1527
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,359
beat drops in a piece of electronic

1528
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,319
music

1529
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,160
for instance

1530
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,960
um

1531
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,160
we can play with the rhythm or we can

1532
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,720
play with the musical pitch and we might

1533
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,200
have a certain set of chords that

1534
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,079
usually lead up to a certain resolution

1535
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,520
and we can trick everyone in the

1536
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,200
audience if we play a different chord

1537
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,640
instead

1538
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,480
um but you mentioned

1539
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,680
this kind of idea of different

1540
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,960
individuals

1541
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,680
liking different kinds of music and this

1542
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,720
zone of proximal development too so

1543
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,960
this is really getting into how

1544
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,839
the music that we're exposed to

1545
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,240
shapes the expectations that we're going

1546
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,920
to have

1547
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,599
so if you grew up

1548
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,760
hearing western music if you

1549
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,599
are trained in western classical music

1550
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,200
you have certain expectations of what

1551
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,119
rhythms are allowed

1552
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:54,160
of

1553
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,160
what kind of melodic or harmonic

1554
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,160
progression is going to happen

1555
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,359
and when you hear a different kind of

1556
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,559
music

1557
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,480
it might not even register to you as

1558
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,400
music the first time you hear it until

1559
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,000
you learn about it until you learn about

1560
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,839
the music of that culture

1561
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:08,960
um

1562
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,559
even if it's music within your own

1563
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,599
culture say you listen to uh

1564
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,680
hard rock for the first time or like

1565
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,359
like heavy metal for the first time it

1566
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,359
might just sound like noise

1567
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,200
until you're exposed to it enough or if

1568
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,359
you study the patterns of of how that

1569
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,480
music

1570
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,839
um moves in time

1571
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,799
it's like the

1572
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,119
plastic learning phase which is always

1573
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,200
continuing but especially during early

1574
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,040
developmental phases

1575
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,920
uh

1576
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,599
it it's

1577
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,920
catching on to patterns and rhythms and

1578
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,720
whether the the beat measure

1579
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,599
or different pitches and

1580
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,920
rhythms are familiar

1581
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,400
or not that's very

1582
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,280
interesting area so

1583
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,079
i would one model that and or where do

1584
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,160
you see active inference in this

1585
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,760
discussion and what you've discussed

1586
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,720
here

1587
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,559
yeah so there's um been predictive

1588
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,799
coding approaches at modeling this

1589
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,119
um also the information dynamics of

1590
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,559
music

1591
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,559
is one model that comes to mind

1592
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:13,920
um

1593
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,040
or if you think of any of these ai music

1594
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,880
generators um

1595
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,640
google has an ai that plays music like

1596
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,680
bach

1597
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,599
um actually that might not be google but

1598
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,200
there is an ai that plays music like

1599
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,559
bach

1600
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:27,839
google has

1601
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,078
uh

1602
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,920
different music ais that you can

1603
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,920
actually interact with

1604
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,760
and what you do here

1605
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,559
is you turn all of the music into

1606
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,400
symbols for the computer

1607
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,400
um and you're going to encode

1608
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,920
what the pitch is you're going to encode

1609
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,960
what the the rhythm is and a set of

1610
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,280
however many different numbers you want

1611
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,480
and then

1612
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,280
you can kind of take measures of maybe

1613
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,200
the shannon entropy of how likely you

1614
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,359
are to expect this note knowing that

1615
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,280
that note has played

1616
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,200
and if you've only trained this ai on

1617
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,440
bach corrals maybe then you know the

1618
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,960
notes are mostly going to be quarter

1619
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,920
notes maybe half notes maybe an eighth

1620
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,920
note here there and some whole notes so

1621
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,200
you already are constrained with the

1622
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,280
type uh the the length of note that

1623
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,480
you're going to hear

1624
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,359
and black corrals follow the a similar

1625
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,440
pattern every single chorale

1626
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,960
so you have

1627
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,599
you know the probability of you hearing

1628
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,000
the tonic chord at this point in time

1629
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,760
and not hearing um a major second

1630
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,799
or

1631
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,240
hearing a

1632
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,280
certain

1633
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,319
step

1634
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,400
at this point in time um because you've

1635
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,920
mapped out all of those probabilities

1636
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,680
and lots of people do that i don't

1637
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,480
do that kind of um

1638
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,839
ai or modeling work

1639
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:53,680
with musical scores myself

1640
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,480
so they're creating musical scores

1641
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,000
with what

1642
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,599
imperative or

1643
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,880
for what ends

1644
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,599
that's a good question so

1645
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,440
um

1646
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,119
i've actually worked with a co-author

1647
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,720
with submitted manuscript

1648
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,480
and that's kind of one of the questions

1649
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,520
we ask

1650
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,480
um

1651
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,960
waiting on reviews back but

1652
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,319
we're looking at all of these different

1653
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,359
kind of music making ais

1654
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:26,319
and

1655
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,000
we're coming at the question from

1656
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,160
another angle we're kind of asking

1657
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,760
whether they can make

1658
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,440
music and whether it's good music um

1659
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,480
and what's missing if they can't

1660
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,520
um

1661
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,119
and that's because when we're talking

1662
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,839
about humans and why humans make music a

1663
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,480
lot of it comes down to the social

1664
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,880
interaction that music allows

1665
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,960
so music seems to facilitate social

1666
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,319
bonding

1667
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:53,359
if i

1668
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,760
am drumming in time with you even if i'm

1669
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,880
walking in time with you but if i'm

1670
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,040
doing something in time with you

1671
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,559
whether it's drumming or tapping or

1672
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,000
making music

1673
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,240
i probably will like you more after that

1674
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,359
event

1675
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,319
um

1676
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:07,599
and

1677
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,240
it's also a tool that we use um

1678
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,160
parents to infants to soothe them if you

1679
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,319
think about lullabies

1680
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,160
and there's a lot about music that seems

1681
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,599
to be rooted in social bonding

1682
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,680
and music also activates

1683
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,480
reward systems in our brain

1684
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,359
so

1685
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,520
we get a dopamine rush when we get to

1686
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,839
that peak experience in music

1687
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,040
um we

1688
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,640
there's some recent work and i can't

1689
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,000
remember who put it out that if you

1690
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
listen to music um you're getting

1691
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,680
similar

1692
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,359
activation as if you had to engage in

1693
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,880
exercise

1694
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,440
we use music and therapy and like music

1695
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,880
is just it's connected to a lot of

1696
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,720
survival and social bonding functions

1697
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,319
for humans

1698
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,000
but why doesn't ai make music

1699
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,040
like

1700
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,839
the ai doesn't need to bond with another

1701
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:57,440
ai um

1702
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,960
maybe they're getting reward in terms of

1703
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,559
like a value function that we've

1704
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,559
programmed into the ai to say like oh

1705
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,319
good that was a good musical line that

1706
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:05,359
you made

1707
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,280
now do it again

1708
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,680
but like what motivation do they have

1709
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,079
there's also no connection to any sort

1710
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,319
of like interreceptive states or

1711
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,799
physiological states if we think about

1712
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,480
listening to music before we go to the

1713
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,559
gym we listen to music to hype us up and

1714
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,240
get us pumped and it's raising our blood

1715
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,400
pressure

1716
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,079
it's

1717
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,319
getting us our body prepared to do the

1718
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,240
activity we want to do and at night we

1719
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,240
might listen to calming soothing music

1720
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,400
lower blood pressure lower breathing

1721
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,280
rate

1722
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,680
to prepare to go to sleep

1723
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,160
what drive does a computer have

1724
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,760
to sort of maintain these different sort

1725
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,559
of

1726
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,480
homeostatic needs at different times of

1727
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,559
the day or times of your life

1728
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,559
compared to a human it's a great

1729
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:49,520
question

1730
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,799
i don't know if the people who are

1731
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,640
making ai music

1732
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,960
are always asking that question

1733
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,480
um but have you ever heard of holly

1734
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,160
herndon

1735
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,440
no

1736
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,559
so she is a um

1737
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,480
electronic music creator who has created

1738
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,839
a music ai in this space and her notion

1739
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,359
was to take

1740
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:12,960
this idea of of cultural learning um and

1741
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,079
if you could think of the zone of

1742
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,160
proximal development but she has she's

1743
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,960
trained her her ai baby

1744
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,520
um with voices of a lot of different

1745
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,400
people and exposed to a lot of like

1746
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,880
basically a culture in order for it to

1747
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,720
generate some sort of music

1748
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,240
um from what she makes and she has some

1749
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:34,439
really interesting art in that space

1750
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,720
it's a little bit like the the tree

1751
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,799
falling in the forest is it a noise or a

1752
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,480
sound someone have to listen to it if

1753
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,440
you have

1754
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,240
a bunch of auto-generated songs

1755
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,640
in a genre but no human experience

1756
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,559
writing them

1757
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,000
know and experience listening to them

1758
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,400
it's like did it ever happen

1759
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,720
um that's quite an interesting idea and

1760
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,079
it's also it's a cross-media issue with

1761
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,799
generated text and image

1762
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,640
and uh

1763
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,920
that also

1764
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,839
makes me think about a john cage quote

1765
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,599
talking about music

1766
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,000
and duration and time so maybe

1767
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,680
what do you think about music and time

1768
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,599
music and time

1769
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:16,720
so

1770
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,160
stereotypically whenever we think of

1771
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,240
john cage think of that four minutes and

1772
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,760
33 seconds

1773
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,359
he sits in front of the piano and starts

1774
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,440
a timer and it's just silent

1775
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,440
um

1776
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,480
there's a

1777
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,680
marius kozak i i if i remember right um

1778
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,960
actually writes about um music and time

1779
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,119
and the idea that

1780
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,160
um

1781
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,280
music is deeply linked to movement

1782
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,240
in time and it's sort of it's sort of a

1783
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,480
way to

1784
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,480
express movement in time

1785
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,240
through

1786
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,839
not just the auditory lens but also

1787
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,920
through dance so like thinking of dance

1788
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,240
it's a form of music as well and seeing

1789
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,839
how

1790
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,839
not not only something like auditory

1791
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,160
music but dance is prevalent in every

1792
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,280
culture

1793
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,480
in the globe

1794
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,079
and i think there's something important

1795
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,760
to

1796
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,280
the notion of time and maybe music as

1797
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,359
the choreographing

1798
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,599
of movement through time

1799
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,119
because if we think about

1800
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,559
you mentioned

1801
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,880
generated language or images

1802
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,920
these are

1803
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,079
static pieces you know you can look

1804
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,079
around the scene or you can read the the

1805
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,039
text but music has to happen in the

1806
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,760
temporal domain you have to listen to it

1807
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,160
over a period of time once a note is

1808
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,280
played

1809
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,799
it's gone after that or once you've um

1810
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,280
enacted a particular dance

1811
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,280
it's gone after that

1812
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,880
um

1813
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,720
and i don't know i don't have like a a

1814
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,240
nice

1815
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,319
way to wrap that up about why time is

1816
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:53,359
important

1817
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,480
um

1818
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,960
but it's definitely an important feature

1819
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,119
of music and of dance that's you're not

1820
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,640
going to find in

1821
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,880
other art forms you might find you could

1822
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,720
think of it in a narrative has to happen

1823
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,000
over time because you're reading it over

1824
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,319
time

1825
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,559
and that's part of why so in my

1826
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,240
neuroscience work i study how we

1827
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,640
perceive musical rhythm

1828
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,440
so

1829
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,559
if we

1830
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,240
perturb the time

1831
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,559
that a musical rhythm is happening

1832
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,960
how does our brain cope with that

1833
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,280
or if we perturb

1834
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,960
part of the brain that is thought to be

1835
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,319
involved with

1836
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,960
timing perception so this ability to

1837
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,720
hear

1838
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,720
beats that are happening in a certain

1839
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,760
phase

1840
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,880
or

1841
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,400
to hear certain rhythms if we perturb

1842
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,319
that system

1843
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,559
are we going to impair how

1844
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,559
people perceive the rhythm in that piece

1845
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:45,920
of music

1846
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,359
and these are questions i'm asking

1847
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,359
questions a lot of people are asking

1848
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,359
um

1849
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,640
it's a very

1850
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,160
bright landscape right now for that kind

1851
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,079
of question

1852
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:57,280
what's really

1853
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,520
interesting about bringing the action in

1854
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,079
and maybe even moving music

1855
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,359
outside or a little bit beyond just the

1856
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,200
auditory

1857
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,599
because that might open up auditory

1858
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,400
experiences that aren't music

1859
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,880
and musical experiences that have a

1860
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,359
large component um through time but

1861
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,760
they're not necessarily auditory

1862
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,599
now so one other

1863
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,079
thing thinking about the the development

1864
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,480
of auditory preferences and expectations

1865
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,720
for

1866
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,039
probably a long time in human history

1867
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,359
the sounds and the music that one heard

1868
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,160
was local and like performed if not

1869
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,440
interactive

1870
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,359
and then there was a pretty short period

1871
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:44,400
of time of like

1872
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,640
top 40 records cds and then now there's

1873
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,119
the ability to listen to

1874
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,039
a huge number of

1875
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,079
music as well as listen to

1876
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,799
a small selection many times

1877
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,200
and uh

1878
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
what is that doing

1879
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,400
to our auditory cognition or or even

1880
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,839
more broadly

1881
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,319
that i can listen to the same

1882
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:14,640
song with 50 different versions in a row

1883
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,680
versus that just not being plausible

1884
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,240
not even so long ago

1885
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,760
yeah that's an interesting question i

1886
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,079
haven't thought a lot about it but

1887
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,359
um

1888
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,039
i'm basically just tracking like from

1889
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,280
music in the home to everybody's hearing

1890
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,880
everything the same thing on the radio

1891
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,799
to now we have spotify

1892
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,640
and the internet um

1893
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,160
and it's probably a question that's not

1894
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,839
just about music it's also about media

1895
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,200
we went from

1896
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,880
only getting our media or news from

1897
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,799
people that we locally interacted with

1898
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,119
to everybody sitting for the same virus

1899
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,200
i chat so now everybody's in their

1900
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,960
different bubble for

1901
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,160
whatever media they're consuming um

1902
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,760
and it's interesting i know there's been

1903
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,119
some work um for instance um mike hove

1904
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,280
has looked at how

1905
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,280
the bass sounds in music have gotten

1906
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,160
lower over time lower and louder

1907
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,440
um

1908
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,119
which has some impact on how we feel

1909
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,119
musical groove since the bass is usually

1910
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,680
where the the rhythm sits um

1911
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,599
in

1912
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,200
pop music

1913
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,319
um

1914
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,880
but yeah so

1915
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,719
what is it doing to like our brains and

1916
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,600
like our perception of music

1917
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,359
that's interesting you'd and you

1918
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,359
mentioned

1919
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,279
memes earlier

1920
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,520
which made me think of tick tock

1921
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,319
um

1922
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,040
and so this like new way of

1923
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,960
proliferating sounds

1924
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,040
um and if you've ever been spent very

1925
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,560
much time on tick-tock there'll be like

1926
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,399
one sound that everybody's making a

1927
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,520
dance to

1928
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,839
or one sound that um people are just

1929
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:47,439
playing over the top of the video of

1930
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:49,520
their dogs running around because that

1931
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,120
sounds popular

1932
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,439
um and then when you hear it on the

1933
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:54,880
radio

1934
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,399
it's a little bit jarring because you

1935
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,960
only know this like 15 second snippet or

1936
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,799
however long a tick tock is

1937
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,719
um from that tic tac video and then you

1938
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,640
realize this is this is a real song like

1939
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,880
a real work of art that somebody made

1940
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,359
before it became a tick tock mean

1941
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,279
um

1942
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,198
which

1943
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,439
is just pure like personal anecdote but

1944
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:17,839
it's interesting so if we're getting

1945
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,880
insulated by like the media we consume

1946
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,679
are

1947
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,520
we also getting insulated by the type of

1948
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,600
music we consume like are we less able

1949
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,198
to appreciate other types of music

1950
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,198
because i'm listening to the same

1951
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,920
song in a lot of different renditions

1952
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,560
or are we like broadening our musical

1953
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,560
consumption because i'm able to access

1954
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,000
music from all over the globe at the

1955
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,520
click of a button

1956
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,799
it's probably a little bit of both

1957
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,960
yeah it's like the space of the action

1958
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,719
opens up

1959
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,439
when when there's so many affordances in

1960
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:53,520
our niche to select from

1961
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,280
yet also

1962
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,760
quite curated and presented in a certain

1963
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,719
way

1964
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,960
that just on aggregate probably still

1965
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,600
does drive people to have shared action

1966
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,360
and so then like it's literally the

1967
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,400
platform

1968
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,320
playing that role of the

1969
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,800
metronome coupling interaction

1970
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,480
there that's interesting that you bring

1971
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,120
that up um and also

1972
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,560
so if we come to this music is the

1973
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,960
strive for social bonding and we've just

1974
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,280
been in this global pandemic or we still

1975
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,080
are

1976
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,159
um but for many people we were

1977
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:28,719
on various stages of lockdowns

1978
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,440
music live music was not happening

1979
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,600
um choir or musical ensemble rehearsals

1980
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,280
were not happening

1981
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,080
and you saw this drive to continue to do

1982
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,760
something like make music together

1983
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,560
online and one of these drives was

1984
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,719
she shanties became really popular on

1985
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,080
tiktok

1986
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:46,880
and

1987
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,400
it's not something that people were

1988
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,320
doing together at the same time because

1989
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,480
we have this delay that's happening

1990
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,360
over

1991
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,520
audio visual communication like this it

1992
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,199
works well when we're taking turns it's

1993
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,560
harder for trying to synchronize and

1994
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,840
sing together

1995
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,239
so tick-tock allowed someone to record a

1996
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,120
sea shanty and then the next person adds

1997
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,280
their voice to that recording

1998
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,120
and they record their song singing the

1999
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,280
sea shanty and then the next person does

2000
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,719
the same thing and you end up with these

2001
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:13,920
compilation

2002
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,239
not compilations but these like

2003
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,400
ensemble performances

2004
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,600
of

2005
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,040
a song that

2006
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:21,840
um

2007
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,760
people would sing when they're off on

2008
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,440
ships at sea

2009
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,840
and they're feeling um they're like

2010
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,360
having this social bond with the people

2011
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,280
that they're out at sea with the whole

2012
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,040
time and now it's our song that we're

2013
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,159
singing through the internet as a way

2014
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,440
to

2015
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,719
feel like we're having some sort of

2016
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,239
social bonding and interacting and

2017
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:42,159
engaging with people and you saw that on

2018
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,000
tick tock you also saw that with

2019
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,880
celebrities trying um

2020
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,199
trying to sing when they all gathered

2021
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,360
together to sing imagine we can argue

2022
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,440
about whether that went well or not

2023
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,400
um

2024
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,159
or when we saw

2025
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,080
basically there was kind of an explosion

2026
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,840
of different types of online music

2027
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,760
interaction

2028
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,520
to try to replace this local

2029
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,280
interaction of going to a concert and

2030
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,560
seeing someone

2031
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,800
on stage around a group of people that

2032
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,400
you're interacting with together or

2033
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,199
going to perform or rehearse or jam with

2034
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,400
your friends

2035
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,080
in your garage

2036
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,159
and trying to find digital avenues for

2037
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,760
the same

2038
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,000
social role that music traditionally

2039
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,320
plays

2040
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,360
very

2041
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,040
interesting

2042
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,719
like

2043
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:34,239
and how will it

2044
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,960
change going forward

2045
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,199
some people may

2046
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,480
find very uh

2047
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,719
immersive sensory experiences to be

2048
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,239
powerful for them maybe that's a

2049
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,800
scalable approach maybe it's not maybe

2050
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,159
that's a good thing maybe it's not um

2051
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,760
so one one other part was like

2052
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,719
when you were contrasting the musical

2053
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:00,960
study that you presented first with the

2054
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,960
basketball you mentioned that that

2055
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,120
environment was unscripted or

2056
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,000
um in in in contrast to

2057
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,840
sheet music or like a spoken dialogue

2058
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,679
that was scripted

2059
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,159
and then um in one sense it is

2060
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,760
unscripted but then

2061
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,640
as per the paper on active inference and

2062
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,400
scripts

2063
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,640
it's more like the strong and the weak

2064
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,640
scripts like the basketball

2065
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,880
is a scripted environment in the

2066
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,880
cultural norm

2067
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,800
weak script

2068
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,560
sense so

2069
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,040
yes it doesn't have the stage directions

2070
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:35,840
but

2071
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,920
you know are there not signs

2072
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,000
helping identify where people with a

2073
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,679
given ticket should sit

2074
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:44,080
and signals and lights and sounds that

2075
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,760
also provide a lot of cues that are

2076
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,840
going to be totally specific like the

2077
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,480
seventh inning stretch in baseball

2078
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,159
why stretch then

2079
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,320
but then that's part of where

2080
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,560
like the embodiment of even watching the

2081
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,679
game

2082
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:01,199
and participating in it gets to be why

2083
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,120
it's the phenomena of

2084
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,640
entertainment

2085
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,920
and why it's something that people spend

2086
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,000
their life like supporting directly and

2087
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,080
indirectly and practicing for

2088
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,840
and why this isn't just like a neural

2089
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,760
entrainment

2090
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,920
binaural beat hack or something like

2091
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,520
that

2092
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,080
yeah so if i got the same experience

2093
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,840
being at a basketball game sitting in

2094
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,840
the student section that i got from

2095
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,040
sitting on my couch and watching the

2096
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,719
basketball game at home

2097
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:29,120
then you would imagine nobody pays to go

2098
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,560
to basketball games and we all sit on

2099
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,280
our couch and watch them at home right

2100
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,040
but we spend lots of money to go to

2101
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,800
basketball games or whatever sporting

2102
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,679
events

2103
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,000
we have student sections

2104
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,880
we wear the colors of our sports team so

2105
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,480
we're already signaling to people that

2106
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,040
you know i'm wearing this outfit so i'm

2107
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,600
a byu fan i'm wearing this other outfit

2108
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,800
so i'm a

2109
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,400
i don't know basketball teams i was

2110
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,320
going to name another one i'm that kind

2111
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,600
of fan

2112
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,440
so that's already signifying a kind of

2113
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,440
script where i know oh yeah you're a

2114
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,880
friend we're gonna cheer at the same

2115
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,159
time

2116
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,280
um and then the game has rules and the

2117
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,040
game has

2118
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,560
good things that happen if my team

2119
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,719
scores a point my response is going to

2120
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,320
be to fear if

2121
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,679
the other team scores a point i'm going

2122
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,719
to be upset so there's already um

2123
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,800
a relationship where the the game is

2124
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,360
driving the behavior in the stands

2125
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,520
and then you have the interactions of

2126
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,800
the people next to you the people you

2127
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,880
can see next to you and in front of you

2128
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,640
the people who you can hear

2129
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,880
also behind you

2130
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,560
and

2131
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,880
there are certain cheers that might

2132
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,920
be

2133
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,000
scripted just like that musical ensemble

2134
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,080
so if there's a certain idiosyncratic

2135
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,760
chant that i make

2136
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,000
um that's associated with this team and

2137
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,960
this mascot we all know this chant we've

2138
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,239
learned it

2139
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,440
maybe it was

2140
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,920
written down maybe it's being broadcast

2141
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:52,800
on the

2142
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,400
on the big screen

2143
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,760
above the game

2144
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,640
maybe there's cheerleaders or a band

2145
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,600
who's who's leading a certain cheer

2146
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,920
and you're engaging it so even though

2147
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:04,960
it's it's

2148
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,199
less scripted in a way than this musical

2149
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:08,480
ensemble

2150
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,320
in the sense that it's not written on a

2151
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,760
piece of paper that every person is

2152
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,120
looking at

2153
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,920
they're all aware of the social scripts

2154
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,679
that are involved in

2155
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,679
a basketball game experience and a

2156
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,679
basketball game experience with that

2157
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:22,560
team

2158
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,719
or with that student section that you're

2159
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,640
sitting in

2160
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,960
so you're absolutely right that there's

2161
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,400
scripts like this and i think any

2162
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,080
interaction you get to

2163
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,440
there's going to be some kind of script

2164
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,120
there's not going to be something that's

2165
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,280
pure interaction nobody's interacting

2166
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,440
just on vibes you know

2167
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,320
um

2168
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,640
there's some social script based on

2169
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,560
where the people are

2170
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,400
based on

2171
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,760
what

2172
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,760
context they're in whether they know

2173
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,360
each other ahead of time whether there's

2174
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,880
some external signal

2175
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,719
like clothing

2176
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,640
um or if you look like me or you don't

2177
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,800
look like me

2178
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,719
and that's all going to change

2179
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,560
the dynamics it might make

2180
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,560
certain forms of interactions

2181
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,480
occur more easily

2182
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,080
um it might make certain kinds of

2183
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,360
interactions

2184
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,360
dissipate more easily which

2185
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,440
interestingly is something that

2186
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,080
we're still studying with metronomes

2187
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,840
so metronomes don't only move into

2188
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,880
synchrony

2189
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,400
if you have two interacting metronomes

2190
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,760
they might actually cancel each other

2191
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,440
out um or they might

2192
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,440
exhibit other

2193
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,440
like coming in and out of

2194
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,920
synchronous dynamics and if we are still

2195
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,679
learning how to understand that in that

2196
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,440
physical system

2197
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,440
um where there's physical properties

2198
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,280
that we can change and measure that are

2199
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,360
really simple just you know moving back

2200
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,480
and forth in a certain period

2201
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,159
is that much more complicated when we're

2202
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,960
looking at humans who we seem to have

2203
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,120
some sort of free will and we can behave

2204
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,800
according to some social rules that we

2205
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,640
know about or we could behave completely

2206
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,560
contrary to those rules

2207
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,520
awesome point that the model system like

2208
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,920
you brought up helps us confirm just our

2209
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,920
statistics like

2210
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,760
before the linear model gets brought out

2211
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,199
in one setting

2212
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,960
try it on the piece of graph paper and

2213
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,640
so this is like the graph paper for

2214
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:13,760
thinking about

2215
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,360
semantic or

2216
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,080
narrative coordination but one wouldn't

2217
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,520
want to be in a non-observable territory

2218
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,480
with

2219
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,480
kind of flying blind that way

2220
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,239
um

2221
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,840
and also i think the examples with the

2222
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,800
game

2223
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,040
and the context coordinating behavior to

2224
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,560
different ends

2225
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,840
uh

2226
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,920
it made me think about where there's

2227
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,960
fans from

2228
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,360
different teams in the same setting

2229
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,320
versus like sections that are separated

2230
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,520
and then there's the parents at the game

2231
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,520
and maybe like the intention is just to

2232
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,480
support people in their play

2233
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,320
versus like a professional sports and

2234
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,600
then there's like people who are there

2235
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,080
for pragmatic value they have literal

2236
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,560
money other people have like identity

2237
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,880
currency on the line

2238
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,679
and uh like feeling like one's

2239
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,320
city has a good baseball team and all

2240
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,080
these very complex things and so it's

2241
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,000
kind of just cool

2242
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,280
to

2243
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,159
have a model that maybe can blanket off

2244
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,960
some of that complexity but also just

2245
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,280
recognize the real data that you're

2246
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,480
getting from these systems which is

2247
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,320
sometimes as you pointed out down to a

2248
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,640
single microphone which has many

2249
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,520
advantages over visual observation or

2250
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,320
like um sensor tracking or anything

2251
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,239
and that's what we're observing from the

2252
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,120
system

2253
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,679
and then there's our process of

2254
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,440
doing analysis on that signal because

2255
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,600
that's actually what the system is

2256
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,679
providing these measurements so it kind

2257
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:44,480
of

2258
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,400
does tie in active inference and how

2259
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,000
we're modeling these

2260
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,400
complex settings without

2261
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,080
getting lost in how many possible ways

2262
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,480
they can be

2263
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,719
cool do you have any other like things

2264
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,400
you'd like to add or any other points

2265
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,280
you want to bring up

2266
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,440
um

2267
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,719
no

2268
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,639
i think this is really great i really

2269
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:10,880
appreciated the discussion you brought

2270
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,360
we covered a lot more than just

2271
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,040
interacting groups of people

2272
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,920
running from brains to music ai's back

2273
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,159
again to people it was really fun

2274
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,480
cool thank you very much for joining so

2275
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,239
see you anytime

2276
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:28,759
awesome sound good see you bye

2277
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,880
alright

2278
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,800
you
