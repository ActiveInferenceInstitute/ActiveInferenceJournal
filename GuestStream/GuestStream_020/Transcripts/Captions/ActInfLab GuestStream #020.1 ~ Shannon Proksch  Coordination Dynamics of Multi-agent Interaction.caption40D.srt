1
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:09,275
Hello.

2
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:12,946
This is Acton flat guestroom number 21.1.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,482
It's April 21st 2022.

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,017
And we're here with Shannon.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,886
Proksch and Jen will be giving a talk.

6
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,989
Coordination
dynamics of Multi-Agent Interaction.

7
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,760
The talk will happen
for maybe around an hour

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,461
and then there'll be time for Q&A.

9
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,231
So feel free to ask any questions
in the chat during.

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,066
So off to you, Shannon.

11
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,603
Looking forward to this talk and thanks
again for joining on active flight.

12
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,774
So thanks so much.

13
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,878
So I'm Shannon Daniels, already
giving you the title of our talk.

14
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,915
And I'm coming to you from the University
of California in Racette,

15
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,016
where I'm a Ph.D.

16
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:53,286
candidate, and I'll actually
be defending this summer.

17
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,922
So maybe the next time you hear from me,

18
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,992
I'll be talking to you
from Augustana University,

19
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:04,831
where I will be starting a tenured
professor position later this fall.

20
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,068
As an assistant professor
of psychology and neuroscience

21
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,971
Oh, nice, nice.

22
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:12,872
Thanks.

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,743
So that's that I'm not going
to talk to you about neuroscience today.

24
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,879
I'm going to talk to you a little bit
about the behavior of crowds.

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,019
And I stole this roadmap idea from
previous active inference lab sessions.

26
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,923
And this is kind of outlining
where we'll be going today.

27
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,559
So first,
the first thing we're going to do

28
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,496
is really dig into a little bit of theory
and data

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,034
I'm going to give a bit of a brief
introduction to multi-agent interaction

30
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,938
and what kind of human behavior
I'm interested in.

31
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,241
And I'm going to walk
through a couple of ways that

32
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,146
active inference
folks might be interested

33
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,215
in crowd dynamics and behavior,

34
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,618
but primarily I'm going to be focusing
on dynamical systems theory

35
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,155
and the notion of synergies and the tools
that come along with these concepts.

36
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,758
And then finally, I'm going to show you

37
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,697
a model system where we apply these tools
to a system of couple of metronomes.

38
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,834
Before I look at some empirical data
from real, real world interaction,

39
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,372
musical performance, and also of crowds

40
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,442
cheering at a basketball game.

41
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,512
So first,
what is multi-agent interaction?

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,717
This is simply an interaction that's
happening between two or more agents.

43
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,053
In our case, we're looking at people
and each of these people,

44
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,556
they'll have their own personal goals
and behaviors,

45
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,293
but their individual behaviors
are influenced in some way

46
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:43,196
by interacting with other agents
in their shared environment.

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,033
And I want to talk about two forms
of multi-agent coordination today

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,772
and the best way to introduce this is
through a short thought experiment. So

49
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,440
I'll just have

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,076
you imagine
the sounds of a crowded coffee shop.

51
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,612
Consider how individuals
in that coffee shop

52
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,714
might be interacting with each other.

53
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,651
There might be some small groups,
there might be pairs,

54
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:09,722
but mostly it's many individuals
engaging in small temporary interactions.

55
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:13,526
And these individuals aren't coordinating
with every other individual

56
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,695
in some sort of cohesive coffee shop
group.

57
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,697
They're just a jumble of individual

58
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,133
individuals
who are cohabiting, a shared space.

59
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:25,505
Now, instead, imagine the audience
on the floor of a rock concert.

60
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,908
They're cheering or singing
along with the artists on the stage.

61
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,079
And alternatively, imagine the fan
section at your favorite sporting event

62
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,583
emerging into a synchronous chant
or a chorus of resounding boos.

63
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,253
Imagine how individuals in these large
crowds might be interacting

64
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,257
with each other as they cheer, sing,
chant or boo.

65
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,962
They're all sharing in similar behavioral
states engaging in similar actions.

66
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,899
They're likely sharing similar
physiological states like breathing rates

67
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,000
and neural states as well.

68
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,437
These crowds are tuning together in time.

69
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,507
They're behaving and they're coordinating
like one large interdependent group,

70
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,079
and you could refer to these
as shared acoustic spaces.

71
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,282
And they include
various levels of interaction

72
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,518
from dyads pairs of individuals
or larger and larger groups.

73
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,121
And I might even call
these acoustic social worlds

74
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,791
the acoustic signal
that's generated by these crowds.

75
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,961
It carries some information
about their behavioral dynamics

76
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,564
that were employed
in creating that signal.

77
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,601
And the sounds these crowd makes carry
some sort of information

78
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,137
about the status of that crowd,
either as an

79
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,607
incidental collection
of lots of individual coffee goers

80
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,745
or an integrated and coordinated
crowd like a crowd of concert goers.

81
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,516
And there are, of course,
many and important factors at play

82
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,553
when we're evaluating these acoustics
social worlds, and we're trying to decide

83
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:51,057
whether that crowd is acting
as one integrated multi-agent system

84
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,426
rather than a collection
of independent agents.

85
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,062
And these include the social context.

86
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,765
A coffee shop is different than a concert
arena,

87
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,199
the development

88
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,404
of patterned cultural practices
in these different contexts and different

89
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,874
scripts surrounding what events happen
and when these events happen

90
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,611
and different regimes of shared attention
between each of these agents.

91
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,179
And these are things

92
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,581
you've talked about in the inference lab
before.

93
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,886
And basically this is all a rather long
winded way of saying that we expect

94
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:23,823
coffee shop behavior in a coffee shop
and concert behavior in a concert arena.

95
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,661
If I were going to talk to you
in the language of Act of Inference,

96
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,331
I might talk to you today
about Markov blankets

97
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,334
and we might talk
about the statistical boundary

98
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,870
that might be behind
a pair of interacting

99
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,740
individuals
around a pair of interacting individuals

100
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,010
separating their internal states
of this interaction.

101
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,046
With the rest of the interactions
happening in a coffee shop crowd.

102
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,917
And I might talk about
how the statistical boundary expands

103
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:55,121
as we start to engage or interact
with larger groups of people

104
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,658
from three to four to
maybe 100 people were more.

105
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,827
We're in a large group interaction,

106
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,030
and while this can be a really useful way

107
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,768
to model multi-agent interaction,
to talk about a suite of nested markup

108
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:13,573
blankets, we quickly run into questions
of how a researcher chooses

109
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,709
where to draw a Markov blanket
at any given system

110
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,613
or where to draw each nested Markov
blanket

111
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,048
in a given system.

112
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,651
And this is the topic that you've discussed a lot in the Active Inference Lab.

113
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,186
You spent

114
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,623
some time talking with you,
Bernard Berg and colleagues

115
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,627
after the recent BBC article commentaries

116
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:38,264
and how there might be differences
from me as a researcher

117
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:41,200
applying some sort of Markov
blanket around a system versus

118
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,303
the actual agents
interacting in that system.

119
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:49,442
But I just mentioned this idea of March
markup blankets to situate the topic

120
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,079
for the audience of these
into active inference lab live streams.

121
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,149
As far as measuring

122
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,351
the emergence
of an integrated interacting crowd,

123
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,454
this is an empirical question
that I'm asking rather

124
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,458
than a modeling question,
and I'm not a mathematician or a modeler.

125
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,728
So for this question
about groups of interacting people,

126
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,231
I found empirical tools
from dynamical systems

127
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,834
theory and with the concept
of interpersonal synergies.

128
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,236
So that's one
I'm going to introduce to you guys next.

129
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,373
So Dynamical Systems Theory,

130
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:24,343
this considers a trajectory of behavior
of a system over time,

131
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:29,649
and the concept of synergies arises
from the field of motor control

132
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,285
as a solution
to the degrees of freedom problem.

133
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:36,856
So essentially the degrees
of freedom problem is that fine

134
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,626
and precise control of every degree
of freedom in a motor movement

135
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,163
would be computationally intractable
for the nervous system to solve.

136
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,768
And what you see
here is a minor hammering

137
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,671
and you see these light patterns.

138
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,741
This is really sort of the earliest sort
of motion capture that we had.

139
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,812
And we're seeing the trajectory
of his arm hammering here.

140
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,713
And you can see that

141
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,249
even though the hammer
is hitting the same place every time,

142
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,018
you'll have to trust me,
that's hitting the same place every time.

143
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:09,188
His arm is taking a slightly different
trajectory to get there.

144
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,391
But it generally covers
this one spring behavior,

145
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:14,627
and that's

146
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:19,031
because the muscles in his arm
here are self-organizing and two coupled

147
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,166
and locally constrained

148
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,103
degrees of freedom forming temporary
soft assemblies of motor function

149
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,306
that's enabling this flexible movement
and coordination here.

150
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,777
But another way, synergies are identified

151
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,848
by their functional specificity,
specificity, dimensional compression

152
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,118
and reciprocal compensation
what are those?

153
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,989
Well, the need to perform
a specific function like hammering

154
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:47,426
that and build
that functional specificity temporarily

155
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,630
shapes the coordination
of several components into one system

156
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,300
that's dimensional compression

157
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,870
in which external
and internal perturbations

158
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,940
are flexibly dealt with via compensatory

159
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,577
adjustments of the components,
reciprocal compensation.

160
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,447
So each muscle in his arm is compensating
for the activity of the other muscle.

161
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,618
And if he was bumped slightly,
there would be compensation

162
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,988
from other muscles
to ensure that handle hits its location

163
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:17,490
and this

164
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,326
is all done
in order to preserve the functionality

165
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,195
of the whole system
for as long as it's needed.

166
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,031
And that last comment,

167
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,000
for as long as it's needed,
that gets the notion of softness smoothly

168
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,070
where any of these units

169
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,106
in this picture here
might be functionally coupled

170
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,676
just for as long
as you need to perform that task.

171
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,545
So if we're talking about
a group of people,

172
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:43,382
this this group of people might form
some sort of complex system

173
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,451
just while they're interacting
for that meeting,

174
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,920
while they're at that concert,
until they disperse

175
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,823
and they're ready to move on

176
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,793
we can differentiate

177
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,662
mere coordination,
which might happen between two people

178
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,832
as a result of engaging
with the same stimulus

179
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,636
and similar patterns of actions
from a true interpersonal synergy.

180
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,473
And you see here we might see
the same patterns of movement.

181
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:12,612
If we have two individuals who are maybe
just listening to the same set of music.

182
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,449
But if these individuals are interacting
with each other

183
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,453
where the action of one person
and the action of the second person

184
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:25,257
is constraining each other, then this is
where an interpersonal synergy happens.

185
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:26,492
And these

186
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:30,896
synergies are the result of these
micro scale structures of a system

187
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,467
giving rise to macro scale dynamics.

188
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,838
When a synergy develops,
we no longer need to describe

189
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,441
the independent dynamics
of each micro-scale structure.

190
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,779
We can instead describe the behavior
of this single interaction

191
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,080
dominant system,

192
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,151
which consists of complementary actions
from each person's motor activity

193
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:56,489
as it pertains to their role in this
softly, simple and complex system.

194
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,393
And you might even notice
some similarities here between

195
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,664
these graphics and a graphic
we might draw of nested Markov blankets.

196
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,800
And these might very well
be two sides of the same coin,

197
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,071
just two perspectives
with a very similar conceptual

198
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,773
landscape here.

199
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,810
And there's a variety of methods

200
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,814
for studying the coordination dynamics
that underlie interpersonal coordination.

201
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,651
For example,
we might ask two people to sit next

202
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:29,388
to each other and swing pendulums or two
rocking, rocking chairs,

203
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:34,460
and we can measure how these individuals,
intentionally or unintentionally

204
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,262
synchronize their behavior

205
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:37,663
as each

206
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,166
individual's action becomes
coupled to their partner.

207
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,738
Or we can ask musicians to play together
in a musical ensemble or a duet,

208
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,975
and we can measure
how these quartets of duets move together

209
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,846
in time, forming these loosely
coupled interpersonal synergies

210
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,249
but in each of these interactions,

211
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,320
a motor or acoustic behavioral output
of each interacting individual

212
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,691
was measured and analyzed for meaningful
correlations between these individuals.

213
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,396
So importantly in these experiments
here, it has been possible to obtain

214
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,932
these measurements of individual behavior

215
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,134
in order to correlate the behavior

216
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,838
of these individuals and examine
the emergent coordination dynamics

217
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,742
of multi-age interaction
and social self-organization.

218
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,579
But what happens

219
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,948
when we have this massive
crowd of people,

220
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,285
we measure the interpersonal synergies
that form in such a large crowd.

221
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,189
How does a group of people move
between novel and habitual

222
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,258
patterns of coordination?

223
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:44,530
How does a multi-agent system navigate
transitions between chaos and stability?

224
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,033
And let's make it a little bit trickier.

225
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,102
The real world is messy in measurement.

226
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,807
It's difficult in a naturalistic social
interaction, in a very large crowd.

227
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,410
I probably can't measure the behavior
of every single individual person.

228
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,614
I probably can't give everyone
an individual microphone.

229
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:04,683
I probably can't track each person's
individual brain states,

230
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,054
and I might not even have access
to a camera, let alone a set of motion

231
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,825
capture cameras and hundreds of markers
to track everyone's head and movements

232
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,629
so let's come back to the crowds

233
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,431
we imagined
at the start of this discussion

234
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:23,702
when you were imagining this coffeeshop
crowd and the crowd at the rock concert.

235
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,174
You might have also been imagining how
these concerts, how these crowds sounded.

236
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,576
So the difference between

237
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,480
this disjointed
noise you might hear at the coffee shop

238
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,851
and this all together coordinated singing
maybe in a rock concert,

239
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,121
it's trivial, trivially easy for you
or I to identify

240
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,858
an uncoordinated group of independent
individuals

241
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:50,162
happening to coexist in a shared space
versus a coordinated group

242
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,432
of interdependent group members
in a crowd.

243
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,303
We can simply hear that these two groups
of people sound different.

244
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,440
Similarly, we can simply hear
when we ourselves are engaged

245
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,845
and participating as a collective
sort of agent while we're interacting

246
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,515
with a large group of people
or in a very large musical ensemble.

247
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,818
So I'm taking that idea

248
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,755
and I think we can measure
the sounds of the crowd mics,

249
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,692
and with so well placed microphone
or a few microphones,

250
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,529
we can generate a single audio
recording of the sound setting

251
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,231
interacting group makes over time.

252
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:26,765
And I know

253
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,468
that a human can make inferences
about the interactions

254
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,404
and the acoustics of the world of a crowd
just by listening

255
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,740
so similarly,

256
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,777
I want to know if this Dynamical Systems
toolkit that I have in allow us

257
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:42,748
to make inferences about the behavior
of an entire complex system

258
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,051
based on this one acoustic measurement
that we have access to.

259
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,090
So for the next little while, I'm
going to walk through a bit of theory,

260
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,292
and then it's for example,

261
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,929
until I eventually end this talk
with data from real live

262
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:01,000
multi-agent groups that we're analyzing
with tools from dynamical systems theory

263
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,572
so one of our most

264
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,475
simple complex dynamical systems

265
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,145
is a metronome or a pendulum.

266
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,348
So Christopher Regan's first discovered

267
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,022
this activity of two pendulums
from four pendulum clocks will be related

268
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,892
to each other when these clocks
are hanging from a shared surface.

269
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:27,893
And what he found

270
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,463
was that these pendulums would swing
and anti synchrony with each other

271
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,768
and since then, in 1600s or so,
there's been

272
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,705
lots of research on pendulums
and on a couple of metronomes.

273
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,674
And if we put

274
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,844
these metronomes at time
keeping device for, for making music

275
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,948
on a shared platform, and maybe that
platform rotates like this,

276
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,153
you'll see each of these metronomes
come into synchrony with each other.

277
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,622
These are just static pictures.

278
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,258
So to really help you visualize this
and hear this,

279
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,795
I'm recording a little bit of help
from the Mythbusters

280
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,566
the Mythbusters on YouTube.

281
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:11,103
So hopefully it is free
and I'm copyrighted

282
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,940
and I'm just going to skip ahead here to

283
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,911
partway into the episode.

284
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,612
Friction and momentum

285
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,248
as I can so that only the metronome
is having the effect.

286
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,117
Now, let's try to.

287
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:29,388
Adam doubles his trouble with
two metronomes set to the same tick Mark.

288
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,858
Look at that movement on this platform.

289
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,694
And after 2 minutes,
the shimmy takes over.

290
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,131
Stay with it, boys.

291
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,332
Nice.

292
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,133
Nice.

293
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,035
It's totally working.

294
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,838
It just took them a little while

295
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,273
to find each other's rhythm.

296
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,212
To have an idea.

297
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,913
I stop the platform.

298
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:58,150
They should drop out of phase

299
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,855
there it is.

300
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,658
The moving platform is totally,

301
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,727
totally critical to this experiment.

302
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:14,133
So all right, so that's

303
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:18,737
Adam Savage there with Two Metronomes,
one on Earth.

304
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,339
Why does this matter? A mile?

305
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,176
What he's done is replicated that
findings of that centuries old experiment

306
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,945
that was originally conducted
with pendulums on a clock.

307
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,549
And he noted that

308
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,752
this moving platform here is
what's totally, totally critical.

309
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,889
But what I want you to also think of
is that you heard these

310
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,758
metronomes slowly
coming into phase with each other.

311
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,363
They were becoming interdependent
on each other's behavior because they are

312
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,634
connected by this coupling mechanism
here, this the shared platform.

313
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:54,139
And as Adam correctly notes, this moving
platform is totally, totally critical.

314
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,976
And in fact, when you saw him
stop the platform, the metronomes were no

315
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,813
longer coupled and their behavior
no longer affects the other

316
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,548
this platform here.

317
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,782
It can take many forms

318
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:07,286
as long as it is freely flowing and
responsive to the Metronomes movement.

319
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:12,191
And for the Metronomes, this platform
is the essential coupling mechanism

320
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:16,795
for this emergent of coordinated
acoustic behavior in humans.

321
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,498
This coordination doesn't
have to be a physical platform.

322
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:24,002
In fact,
I argue that it is the interaction itself

323
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,739
which serves as a coupling mechanism
for multi-agent human behavior.

324
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,409
And we're going
to spend just a little bit more time

325
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,845
with metronomes before
I get on to real human groups here.

326
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,315
So when you have many metronomes

327
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,151
on a shared platform,
you can have more than two.

328
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,988
They're going to transition
from uncoordinated random things

329
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,425
to coordinated synchronicity
is what you're going to hear next

330
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:50,662
is the acoustic output of 32 metronomes
on a freely moving platform.

331
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,665
And I'm going to justify
to you two things

332
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,436
that we can identify I emergent
coordinated behaviors in acoustic data

333
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,772
and what all I'm going

334
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:04,676
to justify what state space
reconstruction is and how this tool

335
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,147
from dynamical systems can help us
to analyze that acoustic data.

336
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,251
So I'm going to start at the beginning
with each of the metronomes and

337
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,352
random things

338
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,777
and this really takes a bit of a time
so we don't have to listen to that

339
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:39,378
for so long.

340
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,046
I'm going to skip ahead

341
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,459
so what you heard was 32 metronomes

342
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,062
all ticking at their own tempo,
at their natural period.

343
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,965
It sounded like a bunch of random noise.

344
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:04,136
But this platform again
served as a coupling mechanism,

345
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,073
and synchronization
between the metronomes emerged

346
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:11,410
so they began to sound like one group
sticking together.

347
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,947
And this is an example of
the type of data will be investigating

348
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,749
for the emergence of coordination
and acoustic signals.

349
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,553
So keep these metronomes in mind.

350
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,457
Don't don't play the metronomes again.

351
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,960
The platform is serving
as a coupling mechanism.

352
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,728
A synchronization emerges.

353
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,231
They begin to sound like one group

354
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,701
so we're going to visit some theory.

355
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,905
I'm going to introduce you to tachyons
theorem and phase space reconstruction.

356
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:41,373
So if we

357
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:45,844
take one time series from a system,
this is the Lorenz system here.

358
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,615
It's defined
by a set of three differential equations.

359
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,318
But what you need to know
is that we can construct the behavior

360
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,856
of this system as a whole by measuring
only one of its parts.

361
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,361
This is accomplished by embedding
delayed copies of a single time

362
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,597
series
into multiple dimensions on some delay.

363
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,167
So here's

364
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,903
one of this time
series extracted from the word system.

365
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,841
And we delay that time series to make
another time series delay once more.

366
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:19,144
To make a third time series,
we take these three dimensions,

367
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,982
and we use them to reconstruct
a projection of the Lawrence system.

368
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,652
And this is Face Space Reconstruction,

369
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,988
and you can see that
it maintains the topography

370
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,091
or the same shape
as the original Lawrence system.

371
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,295
In the case of our acoustic data,

372
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,998
I'm going to take a time series
of that sound, that acoustic signal

373
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,201
and I'm going to follow these steps here.

374
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,171
So I'm going to follow these steps here

375
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,940
to reconstruct the behavior
of those metronomes over time.

376
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,011
And once we've completed the space
based reconstruction,

377
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,581
I'm going to visualize the behavior
of our reconstructed system

378
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,917
by generating what we call
recurrence plot.

379
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,321
This is done by plotting recurrent points

380
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,557
from the reconstructed base space
within some radius that we set.

381
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,194
And we can evaluate the structures
in these recurrence plots

382
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,997
using recurrence quantification analysis.

383
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:16,468
So on the right here, you're seeing
a few examples of different time series,

384
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,705
and you're seeing their reconstructed
face base here

385
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,774
and on the bottom
you're seeing the recurrence plot that we

386
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,478
generate from these reconstructed faces.

387
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,581
So one of the simplest measures
that we can glean

388
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,417
from recurrence
plot is the rate that states recur.

389
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,953
And this is called recurrence rate

390
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,391
and on the left

391
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:43,128
here we're seeing a time series
of a simple sine wave.

392
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,663
And when we reconstruct it,

393
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,432
we end up seeing something
a bit like an oval or a circle.

394
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,002
And when we plot a point
on our recurrent system every time

395
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,505
or recurrence,
but here, every time our system revisits

396
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,975
a space on the circle here

397
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,512
so in the sideways recurrence plot,
we're seeing these diagonal lines,

398
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,049
these diagonal lines are reflecting
deterministic behavior.

399
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,953
And they track how similar system,
similar sequences of values

400
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,521
change over time.

401
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,224
So this sign right here,
it's reliably deterministic.

402
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,560
If it starts here, it's going to go here
next, then it's going to go there next.

403
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,164
And that gives us
these long recurrence values here.

404
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:24,436
And as you probably expect,
this measure is called determinism.

405
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,607
In the
middle, we see uncorrelated white noise.

406
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:32,477
And you can see this signal already looks
much more random than our sine wave.

407
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,248
And when we reconstruct it in face space,
I don't really see

408
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,151
a shape here that we can get much out of.

409
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,755
And underneath you see our recurrence
plot and it looks similarly random.

410
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,057
You could think of it like white noise
on your television, even

411
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:51,763
finally on the right, we see it time
series extracted from speech.

412
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,833
It's a little bit deterministic,
like our sine wave

413
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:59,337
if it goes up, it's going to come down,
but it's also drifting a bit.

414
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,441
And you can see if we reconstruct
that face space

415
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,610
instead of a simple oval we're seeing.

416
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:11,483
Yep, we're seeing a sort of transient
signal here and in the recurrence spot,

417
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,654
we're also going to be seeing

418
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,523
for variation lengths in these diagonals.

419
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,960
And finally, recurrence spots
can contain these vertical structures

420
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,261
that you don't see here.

421
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,264
In addition to diagonals.

422
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,533
And these are indications
of periods of stability.

423
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,103
We measure these as the value
preliminary and liminality.

424
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,139
You can contrast it with determinism

425
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,876
and measures how a signal is organized
in terms of simple,

426
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,612
similar absolute values
that are stable over time.

427
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,550
And this is one representation
of recurrent spots.

428
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,320
It takes a little bit of time
to get comfortable with what

429
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,054
a current spot it is.

430
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,056
So I just have a different visualization

431
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,792
to show you
a little bit of the same thing.

432
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,828
So these are the same set of IQ measures

433
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,065
that we take from our system
and plot on recurrence, but

434
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,401
this is demonstrating recurrence rate.

435
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,438
It's just the percentage
of recurrent points

436
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,940
that we see
on this recurrent plot over time.

437
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,410
And it represents patterns of behavior
that repeat over time

438
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:17,482
determinism,
and it's the percentage of points that

439
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,286
fall in a diagonal at any time,
and it represents behaviors

440
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:25,624
that belongs to a longer sequence
of behavior, entropy.

441
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:30,562
This is the variability in lengths
of these diagonal lines down here,

442
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,699
and it represents the amount of disorder
that there might be in these sequences.

443
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,301
Finally, Liminality,

444
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,604
here are the percentage of points
that fall on a vertical line.

445
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,875
And this represents clusters of behavior
that might repeat for a length of time,

446
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,645
like when a system revisits
a period of behavior,

447
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,381
leaves
and returns that behavioral state again.

448
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:51,182
All right.

449
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,251
So it's a lot of theory.

450
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,987
I need to bring you back to the metronome
so we know what's going on here.

451
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:00,525
So what you see here, this is a picture
of our uncoordinated metronomes.

452
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,694
They're moving
and all sorts of directions.

453
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,729
And finally,
our coordinated metronomes at the bottom.

454
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,199
And I took 32nd a 32nd

455
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,569
acoustic signal from each

456
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,639
each, a set of behaviors here.

457
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:19,344
And on the right, I have signals
from this uncoordinated metronome

458
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,047
and the recurrent support
we generated from them

459
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,648
and you can see this first recurrence,

460
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,551
but it resembles
that kind of uncorrelated white noise.

461
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,220
I don't see a lot of structure here.

462
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,457
And then in our time series
for the coordinated Metronomes,

463
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,894
you start to see some periodicity
kind of in the signal here,

464
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,798
and you see a lot more of these laminar
structures down here in the bottom.

465
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:44,069
These vertical structures which indicate
these periods of stable states

466
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,804
in this group, metronome behavior,

467
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,707
I could break that down even smaller

468
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:52,711
and I could look at 5 seconds of sound
and we see the same structures emerging.

469
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,414
You can also see a bit
more clearly these spikes that occur

470
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,516
in that coordinated metronomes

471
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,853
that correlate with these vertical
structures than we did in the last one.

472
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,688
So this is great.

473
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:04,623
Now you're experts.

474
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,023
You've learned

475
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:08,226
everything you need to know to evaluate
the emergence of coordination.

476
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,162
When we measure it
from a global acoustic signal

477
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,498
and you know, how to visualize
that inner occurrence plot

478
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,433
and how to interpret that plot.

479
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,702
So we're going to apply all of this
human data.

480
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,407
And I want to remember for the Metronomes
this platform is the essential

481
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:26,945
coupling mechanism for the emergence
of coordinated behavior for humans.

482
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,781
The interaction is totally,
totally critical

483
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,883
so if, say, me and my colleague

484
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,919
Mark Reeves from the Applied Mathematics
Department here, you see more sudden.

485
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,589
So we don't need a shared platform.

486
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,291
Instead we just need to interact
with other human beings

487
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,328
in order to couple
our multi-agent human behavior

488
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,698
so now that

489
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,801
we've got this far,
I promise you some empirical data

490
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,072
and I'm going to tell you
about multi-agent interaction.

491
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:58,343
First in a specific musical ensemble
performing a specific musical work

492
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,713
and then in the crowd
at a basketball game.

493
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,983
So first our musical ensemble here

494
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,154
they're performing a work called

495
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:12,123
Welcome to the Imagination World
by Tsuki Shimizu

496
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,894
and this group of musician,
they're performing

497
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,930
this piece that was composed
to do something interesting.

498
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,498
So the composer wrote

499
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,735
the first few minutes of this
musical piece to be completely random

500
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,938
and music theory terms,
we call this Aleatoric it's

501
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,374
when some element of the music
is left up to chance

502
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,644
or to whatever the performers
decide to play in that moment.

503
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,915
So the start of this piece
sounds a little bit like this

504
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,983
OK, that flute gets a little loud for me.

505
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,652
So this is not the musicians
warming up on stage.

506
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,755
This is the actual music.

507
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,258
The musicians themselves are instructed
not to interact with each other.

508
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,194
And you can see
this is kind of hard for musicians

509
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,165
because you do hear musicians
sort of taking turns

510
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,367
starting each musical line a little bit

511
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,070
and it's a little bit
hard to play completely random.

512
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,607
You hear some folks playing
scales up and down, but in general,

513
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,644
this is supposed to sound random and
they're not supposed to be coordinated.

514
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,381
And after a few minutes,
the musical score

515
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:47,085
actually directs the musicians
to begin coordinating with each other.

516
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,053
And then this happens.

517
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,456
I'll show you what that sounds like.

518
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,908
And then

519
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:41,940
you I'm going
to stop it right before it gets exciting.

520
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,009
So once you begin coordinating
with each other,

521
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,346
they begin to sound like one
interacting musical ensemble.

522
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,251
So this musical interaction is serving
as the coupling mechanism

523
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:57,055
and the coordination
between the musicians arises,

524
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,325
and they begin to sound like one
interacting ensemble

525
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,864
now we're not seeing emergent
or spontaneous interaction

526
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,733
in this particular musical composition
and this performance.

527
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:12,937
Musicians are told by the musical
for precisely when to begin

528
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,839
coordinating their actions.

529
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,344
And in this particular performance,
the divide between uncoordinated and

530
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:23,982
joint music making is made
even more apparent by a theatrical trick.

531
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,652
The lights turn on,
and then the conductor arrives on stage

532
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,688
just as the musicians begin
to play together as one ensemble.

533
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:34,392
But I'm using this as a model system
because I know the behavior.

534
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,094
They're supposed to be engaged,

535
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,162
and I know that there's
going to be a transition

536
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,498
from uncoordinated
to coordinated behavior.

537
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,735
So I can use that knowledge
to ask the questions.

538
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,971
Are there any differences in non-linear

539
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:51,542
recurrence dynamics measured by our aim
between the uncoordinated

540
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:55,680
acoustic behavior and the coordinated
behavior of this musical ensemble?

541
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,453
And. Well, there absolutely are.

542
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,557
So at the top, you're seeing the first
and last 30 seconds

543
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,560
of that first piece,
the first part of the performance.

544
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,698
On the bottom, you're seeing the first
and last 30 seconds of the second part

545
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:14,799
of the performance.

546
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,368
Once musicians have become coordinated

547
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,273
and we can see that the acoustic behavior

548
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,977
from these musicians in the coordinated
section of the music is more structured.

549
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,646
We see these bursts
of vertical lines here

550
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,383
with where you have
these stretches of connected

551
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:36,921
sound, connected
stretches of sound for periods of time

552
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,525
and again,
we can look even closer at five

553
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:45,830
second samples and we can see
the same structures in the same

554
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,967
vertical structures in the coordinated,
but not the uncoordinated sections.

555
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,003
So if I take just
these little blocks here,

556
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:53,972
zoom in

557
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,342
to 5 seconds,
we see a little bit more structure here

558
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,078
and a little bit less there, a little bit
noisier structure here.

559
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,247
These are just four visualizations.

560
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,683
This is not actually the five second
snippet here,

561
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,053
but it works for getting the idea across.

562
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,489
OK, so cool.

563
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,092
I see these structures
in their current spot,

564
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,462
but is it really more structured
when musicians are coordinated?

565
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,065
We can do some statistics

566
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,835
and we can visualize our data

567
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,003
in another way.

568
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,271
So these are distributions
of all of those measures that we

569
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,074
extracted from their current spot.

570
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,610
And you can see coordinated sections

571
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:37,248
in blue, uncoordinated sections and red
and we're seeing that when the musicians

572
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:41,386
begin interacting with each other
as a coordinated musical ensemble,

573
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:45,056
recurrence
and stability measures increase overall.

574
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,459
So we have higher also more variable
our measures

575
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,263
when they're coordinated
and we see lower and less variable

576
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,265
criteria measures
when they're uncoordinated

577
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,702
and we
can see this even a little more clearly

578
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,471
if we can plot

579
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,410
those same measures over time
and the blue

580
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,546
and purple lines here are representing
uncoordinated section of the piece.

581
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,817
Orange and green is represented
sorry, blue and purple is coordinated.

582
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,254
Orange and green is uncoordinated.

583
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,656
And we can see that over time

584
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:23,761
when the musicians are coordinated
and acting like one interacting ensemble,

585
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,331
they're able to explore a greater variety
of recurrent singing mix.

586
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:32,737
They're able to explore more behavioral
states than when they're uncoordinated.

587
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,906
And we see all of these measures,
no matter what,

588
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,742
they are hovering around
a small subset of dynamics.

589
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:42,180
Now, you would be forgiven
if you are skeptical of these results.

590
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,917
After all, the entire musical performance
is over 8 minutes long.

591
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,320
Maybe I simply chose
the most uncoordinated sections

592
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,722
and the most uncoordinated
sections of the song,

593
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,225
and you'd be smart to have this worry.

594
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:58,296
Our peer reviewers shared the same worry,
so we graphed

595
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,666
the time series of our three metrics
for the entire piece,

596
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,167
and it's pretty clear

597
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,136
even if you don't know
what these values are,

598
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,271
that there's some difference
in all of these hot

599
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:11,275
pink and blue kind of graphs and these
bottom orange and green type of graphs

600
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,146
we're seeing this same greater
variability,

601
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,850
greater values and more variability
in each of these are three metrics.

602
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,986
When the musicians are coordinated,

603
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,456
then when they're performing
as a bunch of individuals on stage.

604
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:30,027
And the takeaway here
is that these musicians,

605
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,730
when they're interacting together
as a musical ensemble,

606
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,001
they're able to explore a greater variety
of acoustic behavior when they're

607
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:41,539
when they've formed a single complex
system and interpersonal synergy,

608
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,109
then when they were acting
as a lot of individuals on stage

609
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:49,313
and we were able to use these non-linear
statistical methods

610
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,883
from dynamical system
theory to measure that change

611
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:54,685
cool.

612
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,221
So that's a musical ensemble.

613
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,289
I'm using it as a model.

614
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,192
So some mix,
we know what the behavior should be,

615
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,395
and I measure this
from a different kind of system,

616
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,364
one that doesn't have a script

617
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,033
dictating the behavior
of what's going on on the stage.

618
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,637
So to do that, I look at data recorded

619
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,908
from the student section
of a BYU basketball game,

620
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,812
and this data was collected
by Butler and colleagues

621
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:25,883
and labeled by many hard
working undergraduate students.

622
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,787
And we have basically recordings

623
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,958
from the crowd that are labeled based on

624
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,862
what kind of crowd sounds
they're making, whether they're cheering.

625
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,566
This is like a loud, positive
crowd vocalization vocalization

626
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,634
and whether they're applauding.

627
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,469
So this is mostly clapping.

628
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:49,340
That could include some vocalization,
distraction, noise

629
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,877
when you're trying to distract
someone from a free throw, mainly

630
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,112
positive chants.

631
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:59,283
So this is the fans chanting their

632
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,221
their BYU Cougars chants or defense

633
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,256
native chanting.

634
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,157
It's when they're angry

635
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:09,093
rather than cheering, positively singing,
and then silence

636
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:15,366
so we're taking this data
and we're going to ask a similar question

637
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:19,170
so we don't have a clear transition from
uncoordinated to coordinated behavior.

638
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,373
But we do have all of these
different types of behavior.

639
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,910
So we're going to ask,
is there a relationship

640
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,480
between nonlinear recurrence dynamics
measured by our cue

641
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:33,751
and these different categories
of acoustic behavior at the crowd?

642
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,887
At this basketball game,
we follow the same process.

643
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,624
We extract acoustic signals

644
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,994
and we cut them up into
five second samples here,

645
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,998
and we use these signals to generate
recurrent thoughts.

646
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,601
And we take the measures
from that recurrent spot

647
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,536
to see if there's anything different.

648
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,338
And I'm going to show
you just to recurrence.

649
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,475
But in the next slide, I'm
going to show you a quote from positive

650
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,177
chanting and from distraction noise

651
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,885
so here's distraction noise.

652
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,120
It looks like right noise.

653
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,291
It looks like what you would see
on your television screen.

654
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,228
And when I show you positive chant,
there's clearly a striking difference.

655
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:17,995
There's almost

656
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:21,632
no structure and distraction noise here,
but there are very clear

657
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,869
laminar bursts of activity
represented in these vertical lines.

658
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:30,308
And in fact, these two plots
look very similar to our unsynchronized

659
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,477
and synchronized metronome was way back
from the middle of this talk.

660
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:36,013
And intuitively, this makes sense.

661
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,081
If you're trying to distract

662
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,117
someone during a free throw,
you're making all sorts of random sounds.

663
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,786
You might be shaking your keys around.

664
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:45,723
People are stomping on the stands, but
if you're cheering your team on, trying

665
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:49,660
to motivate them to score more points,
or if you're mounting a strong defense,

666
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,129
you're going to be working
together, shouting

667
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:55,566
whatever your chant is, go team,
go defense.

668
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,136
And it's going to occur
in a very rhythmic, metronomic fashion.

669
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:00,971
And we

670
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,108
can compare
how all of these distributions

671
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,911
of our human metrics look between each
different kind of crowd noise.

672
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,947
And you can see there's
quite a lot of overlap but

673
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,749
there's also some difference.

674
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,152
So positive and negative chants
seem to be a bit similar to each other

675
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,923
in every category, which makes sense
because whether they're chanting

676
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,959
in a positive or negative energy,
it's still this rhythmic,

677
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:26,097
I socratous behavior that's happening

678
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,232
distraction, noise, cheers and applause.

679
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:28,966
On the other hand,

680
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:32,703
all seem pretty similar to each other,
no matter where we look at them.

681
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,540
And then finally,
all the way on the lowest

682
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,144
scale is angry noise here.

683
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,279
And one thing to note is

684
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,483
we had very,
very few samples of angry noise here.

685
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,586
So that could be why
we're seeing a few of these differences.

686
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,655
And if we had more samples,
maybe angry noise would look a bit

687
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,724
more like distraction noise.

688
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,693
So visually,
we can see there are differences

689
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,429
and these are two way metrics
for all of these crowd sounds.

690
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,465
And we don't want to just do visuals.

691
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,168
So we can do some statistics here.

692
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,970
This is just another visualization

693
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,740
of our estimate of marginal means showing

694
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,077
pairwise comparisons
between every crowd zone category.

695
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:17,581
And it's a graphical representation
of the estimated marginal means.

696
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,851
If these red lines overlap,
that means there are not significant

697
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,854
differences between,

698
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,923
for instance, abstraction, noise,
cheers, and applause.

699
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:29,093
Hear positive and negative chant
do look different.

700
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,060
However

701
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:34,398
interesting in that angry
noise is far out by itself.

702
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,435
So knowing this

703
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,837
I mentioned very briefly earlier,
I have a colleague

704
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:43,441
in the Applied Mathematics Department,
and one thing she's interested in

705
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,144
is whether we can give a machine
learning algorithm.

706
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,479
Some of these are three

707
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,348
metrics to tell the difference
between these different crowd sounds.

708
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:56,787
The researchers at BYU have done this
with traditional sound metrics,

709
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,023
spectral analysis, cultural analysis,

710
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,492
and we're doing it
with our automated metrics.

711
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,360
So we're focused
more on the rhythmic content

712
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,629
rather than pitch
or spectral content of the sound.

713
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:06,997
And she

714
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,034
is doing this in two ways.

715
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:13,771
So one is training a neural network

716
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,373
with image classification.

717
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:21,178
And what I'm going to show you
if you results from is a random force

718
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,948
that is using these recurrent features
as input

719
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:28,652
and doing some feature vector
classification, using decision trees

720
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,622
and doing some stuff
that if you ask me questions about,

721
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:35,493
I will not know the answer because I'm
not the mathematician in this context.

722
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,195
But once you train that algorithm,

723
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:43,234
it can actually learn the differences
between these crowd sounds.

724
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:43,534
So if

725
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:48,272
these are dark blue along the diagonal,
that means that it degrades to very well.

726
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,808
If they're light blue,
that means there is some confusion here.

727
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:56,280
And if we remember through
one of the previous

728
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,284
graphs, applause, abstraction, noise,
all kind of looks similar to each other.

729
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,287
So if we sort of smush those into

730
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,991
one distraction category,
I'll put applause and cheer together

731
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:11,629
and put positive negative chants here
we get even better classification.

732
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,131
And this part is
something we're still working on.

733
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:18,002
Hopefully we will be ready to submit
it in a paper kind of soon.

734
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,004
But now that

735
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:23,040
we're
ending on this really complex point,

736
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,209
what have we learned

737
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,647
first we took a quick dove into
dynamical systems theory.
