1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,000
hello everyone welcome to the active

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,480
inference lab today it is august 20th

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,440
2021 and we are here in guest stream

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,160
number 9.1 with some awesome guests so

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,920
we'll just start with introductions and

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,320
then head into a short presentation

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,119
before a question and answer period so

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,039
if you're watching live definitely write

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,439
questions in the chat so i'm daniel i'm

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,000
a researcher in california and blue

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,760
i'm blue knight i am an independent

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
research consultant in new mexico and

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,440
i'll pass it to raphael

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,920
hi everyone uh thank you guys for having

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,480
us over i'm rafael i'm also an

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,879
independent researcher i

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,360
have a day job at google that has some

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,480
but not a lot to do with this topic and

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,600
i've

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,520
been working with

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
pranav and

22
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,039
jacob on this topic for

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,359
about a year and a half now uh it's been

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,680
a wild ride so right now go ahead

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,000
hello everyone uh thank you

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
daniel and pluto for inviting us i'm a

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,200
phd student uh at carnegie mellon tepper

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
school of business uh

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
my areas of research are collective

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,240
intelligence where does it come from

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,520
building a

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,880
causal model social technical

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,280
architecture looking at collectives as

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,680
adaptive systems um

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,320
you know i was very interested in the uh

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,479
active interest framework we met rafael

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,920
i and jacob met

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,479
you know across different ci conferences

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,640
and got this project going so we're very

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
excited to talk more about and learn

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
from all the discussions that we have

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,880
back over to you guys

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,280
sounds cool so let's go to raphael's

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,159
presentation and then we'll just have a

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
bunch of time for questions so go for it

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,119
all right before i get started can you

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,040
all confirm that you can see me alright

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,280
uh yeah we see the slides the slides

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,799
perfect all right cool

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,159
all right so um

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
what are we doing here um

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,639
so as we mentioned uh

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,120
the the interest here is to try to

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
understand better uh the phenomenon of

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,319
collective intelligence and so two

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
examples here what we're talking about

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
and they're pretty different examples

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,400
one of them is a pretty classic uh

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
example it's the murmuration of

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,440
starlings

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,239
top

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,400
left i know the bird that's solving a

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,160
puzzle on the top right is a crow not a

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,840
starling so i'm cheating a little bit

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,440
but that's fine uh so

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,720
uh the on the bottom the example is the

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
discovery of the exposure which is an

68
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,319
amazing example of

69
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,920
kind of a large scale long-term

70
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
scientific collaboration so those are

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,400
both legit uh examples of collective

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
intelligence and and

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120
yet the way that we approach analyzing

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,519
these uh things uh tends to be a little

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,480
bit different

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,959
so uh if you're doing something around

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,560
complex aerodynamical systems or

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
computational biology uh you tend to

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,519
look primarily at the collective

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,159
behavior and to be able to do that uh in

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,680
a computable way you assume that

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,280
individual agents are following simple

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
rules to react to the environment and to

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
their peers

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,000
and if you're doing something like uh

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,720
like anthropology or social science uh

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,360
you're probably thinking of collectives

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,760
that look more like the bottom and so

89
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,519
you're focused on these really

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,360
sophisticated agents that have these um

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
complex social cognitive capabilities

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
that are the thing that endows them with

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,319
the ability to access collectives and

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,480
you try to build a picture of the

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,159
collective behavior kind of

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,519
bottom up from the some of those

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,799
interactions

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,720
and both of our valid perspectives of

99
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,159
course but they're speaking pretty

100
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,319
different languages uh and we think that

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
there must be a missing link here

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,519
because if you think about us humans uh

103
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,920
i mean i i definitely feel like i am at

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,000
the same time an autonomous an

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,319
autonomous individual and a member of

106
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,080
not just one but a bunch of collectors

107
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,799
right so i fluidly go in and out of uh

108
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,319
companies or sports team or uh or uh uh

109
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,720
polity and of course i'm part of my

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,079
family

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,959
so

112
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,639
all these collectives can demonstrate

113
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,639
intelligence behavior that that cannot

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,800
be explained exclusively by aggregation

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
of

116
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,080
of the individual intelligence and yet

117
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
uh

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,759
the collective itself is a complex

119
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,160
system that is composed of

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,320
components that are in and of themselves

121
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,720
highly autonomous uh complex adaptive

122
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
systems as well and that's how we frame

123
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
the

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,800
the goal of our

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
of our research we're looking at what

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
you call the misting link which is a

127
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,199
a plausible theoretical description of

128
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,479
the functional relationship between

129
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,240
these two scales

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,600
and uh in particular we think that the

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
the missing link will be found by

132
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
understanding what kinds of social

133
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,120
cognitive features enable the formation

134
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,160
of an effective collective within

135
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
within these kinds of

136
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,759
autonomous agents

137
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,919
all right

138
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,360
to do that uh we've been uh using active

139
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,840
inference as a as a framework uh since

140
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,560
uh the group here is probably uh

141
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
way familiar with

142
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,840
active inference already i'm not gonna

143
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
go uh a lot

144
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
into it uh just pointing out here that

145
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
we're

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,880
approaching this

147
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,639
uh you might see the language that's a

148
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
little bit uh different from

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,759
from some of the canonical stuff that uh

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
first and team put out we're using some

151
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,360
different nomenclature but it's really

152
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
the same principle we're all looking at

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,720
an agent as a markov blanket and uh

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
trying to to

155
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,919
model exactly what's the

156
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,280
the

157
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,600
generative distribution that

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,720
that

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
creates behavior in that

160
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,080
in that agent and look at what happens

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,919
when you put it against some

162
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,080
true system dynamics that are that are

163
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,440
happening in the

164
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,800
environment and of course you you you

165
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,479
run the the system as an asian model

166
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,000
all right

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
uh accepted in our case it's a

168
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
multi-scale model right because we're

169
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,919
interested both in what happens at the

170
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,479
scale of individual agents and the

171
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,000
global system

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
for us it's actually quite uh

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,639
interesting to try to decouple things

174
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,240
and look at

175
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,319
what's going on in a very

176
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
specific way

177
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,400
modeling many many-to-many relationships

178
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,479
uh is really hard

179
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,000
so we really focused on the sparewise

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,440
subsystems so our

181
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,800
our

182
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,360
uh model is really composed of a

183
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
collection of pairs of agents they only

184
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,400
have interact with each other within a

185
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
single pair

186
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
and

187
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,319
we basically compose them the the

188
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,520
what we call the system scale model

189
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,360
bottom up from

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,240
copies of these pairs of agents

191
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,199
all right

192
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,560
so

193
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,960
let's look first at the individual scale

194
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,520
where we have um

195
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,400
each fare is operating on the same

196
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,160
physical environment they're sharing uh

197
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
you can think of them as sharing one of

198
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,919
these uh circles

199
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,440
um if you're familiar with uh with the

200
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,720
mcgregor model that

201
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
has been published in 2015 it's uh it's

202
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,120
a very simple very simple intentionally

203
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,720
uh

204
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,120
stylized uh active inference model that

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
was originally designed to be

206
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,360
analytically solvable actually so it

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,160
allows us to have a really clear uh

208
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
view of what's going on

209
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,479
on the system as a dynamical system

210
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,240
and uh we just added some minimal

211
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,639
capabilities in that model so

212
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,080
each of the agents that are marked out

213
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,680
as little can think of them as little

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,160
parts within this uh within the circle

215
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,199
environment

216
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,000
they

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,080
each of them can only do a couple of

218
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
things which is their capabilities they

219
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
can only observe their their own

220
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,400
position

221
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
uh they can't directly observe the

222
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,199
environment or that that is uh

223
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,520
uh meaning they can't observe their own

224
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,479
position they can only get a clue

225
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,400
uh which is an on-off sensor

226
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
generated by a chemical signal on each

227
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
cell i'm getting a pin here from a

228
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
friendly viewer also known as my wife

229
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
saying that my image may be blurred can

230
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,958
no it's good for others

231
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,320
it might look a little different but i

232
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,560
have a high resolution one saved locally

233
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
no matter what the final processed

234
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,200
youtube one looks like thanks youtube

235
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
all right thanks youtube

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,279
uh all right cool so as uh as i was

237
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,000
saying the the main way that agents uh

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,360
get information

239
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,640
about their physical environment is by

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,519
this uh sensory state which is a binary

241
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,640
uh one on off sensor that's uh you can

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,440
think of it as being generated by a

243
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
chemical signal or a kind of smell on

244
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,160
each cell and it's emanating from this

245
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,519
from the source position source position

246
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,519
um so that's pretty much it about the

247
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,760
physical environment and agents can go

248
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,880
uh left and right or stay stand so on

249
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
that environment

250
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,360
uh now

251
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,000
talking about the relationship between

252
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,279
uh

253
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,080
between agents and their peer on a pair

254
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,839
uh their pure impair is a funny thing to

255
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,839
say but

256
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,959
the

257
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
the agent can observe

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,839
their uh their peer or their partner's

259
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,720
position relative position meaning i'm

260
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
one or two or however many uh

261
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,920
um hops

262
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,240
to the left or to the right they can be

263
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,399
actually in the same position as well

264
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
uh and they can also

265
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,279
observe their their motion right there

266
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,320
they're

267
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,880
you can observe whether the the agent

268
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,800
the other agent the partner has gone to

269
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
left right or sits on the

270
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
last

271
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,399
um last iteration

272
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,920
right um

273
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,480
let's talk a little bit about uh reward

274
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,040
functions uh the agents have independent

275
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,600
reward functions that are two beats uh

276
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
with one common peak and one private

277
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
peak that the reason why that support is

278
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,480
going to become clear a little bit later

279
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,279
cool

280
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,279
so that's it that's pretty much it about

281
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,839
the individual agents uh as i promised a

282
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,880
really simple uh really simple model

283
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,040
and the global scale as i said uh is a

284
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,200
number of agent pair you can think of

285
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,519
like 80 copies of these two pairs of

286
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,440
agents meaning 160 agents in total or

287
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
or whatever and uh

288
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,640
from that perspective of the the higher

289
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,600
scale

290
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,240
the the markov blanket is actually

291
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
composed of the

292
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,279
of the collections of all of these pairs

293
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,160
right so they are each interaction

294
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
interacting with a

295
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,600
um with a global environment

296
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,720
and uh the cool thing is that we're

297
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,040
we're um

298
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,360
the way that the sensory inputs are

299
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,040
relayed to each agent is as desires so

300
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,279
you can think of it as the top level as

301
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,640
kind of

302
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,880
bringing in some uh some

303
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,880
nudges some target states that are

304
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
that are pretty much the the sort of

305
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,600
smells that the agent picks up

306
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,480
um

307
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,079
all right the other important thing is

308
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,240
that the optimal state for the system

309
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,800
compo corresponds to the agent's share

310
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
target only

311
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
but so

312
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,880
from the system's perspective it

313
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,720
wants all the agents to be in that

314
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
shared target but they the agents

315
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,880
themselves they don't know it uh why

316
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,079
it's important is that it means that

317
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,399
there's no exogenous incentive to to

318
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,079
achieve the global goal so it's not like

319
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,160
just for nudging we're asking all all

320
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,600
the agencies the same thing and lo and

321
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,279
behold they're going to do it

322
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
all right and let's talk a little bit

323
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
about how

324
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,440
free energy minimization happens here uh

325
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,720
on the

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,079
on the

327
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,920
individual level on the level of the

328
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,800
individual agent uh we just assume that

329
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,880
there's some process some neurological

330
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,279
process within each agent that uh that

331
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
does gradient descent that's the

332
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,639
traditional technique uh but at the

333
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,800
global level what we're actually doing

334
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,120
is that the behavior that we're

335
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,600
simulating at the collective

336
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,399
of all these individual agents the

337
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,519
the aggregate of that behavior is

338
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,760
uh what we want what we would like to

339
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,560
see

340
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,680
approximate

341
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,040
gradient descent so that's the thing

342
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,800
that we actually want to

343
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
demonstrate here we want to look at the

344
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,000
behavior of the collective

345
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,279
um calculate the the free energy the

346
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,839
collective free energy which is f sigma

347
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,680
here in this uh in this situation at the

348
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,399
bottom

349
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
and uh see if it's actually minimized if

350
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,880
it's minimized then we uh

351
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,040
then we can say that the system this

352
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,000
this

353
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
uh

354
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
group of very simple agents as a

355
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
collective it's uh performing active

356
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,200
inference at the at the global scale or

357
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,800
not and uh shock review what we find is

358
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,040
that the extent to which the collective

359
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,360
is actually able to do that um the free

360
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,920
energy minimization depends on the

361
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,320
social capabilities that we uh endowed

362
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
these simple agents with

363
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,760
um so we focused on two

364
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,240
um cognitive uh capabilities or or

365
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,680
or

366
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
features

367
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,480
that are stylized versions of

368
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,399
of things that we

369
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,560
traditionally look at in uh in social

370
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,440
science

371
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
uh the

372
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,240
first one is what we call theory of mind

373
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
and what we

374
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,959
define that as that is the ability of an

375
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,399
agent to put itself in the shoes of

376
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,800
another and we actually uh try to model

377
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,320
that in a pretty literal way uh so

378
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,399
if you think of shallow versus deep

379
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,399
representations of

380
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,079
of the other you can think of a

381
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,360
shallower presentation as like a

382
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,920
mechanistic oh if they're going this way

383
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,959
it means

384
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,560
it means this rule-based kind of kind of

385
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,240
kind of way which you you could think of

386
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,680
being

387
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,440
an internalization of a rule that i

388
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,120
think somebody else is following

389
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
but we actually did hear some something

390
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,120
quite different right so uh it was based

391
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
on the this philosophy of active

392
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,600
inference that

393
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,399
uh means that the agent has every agent

394
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,240
has a self-actualization loop and what

395
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,079
we said here is hey

396
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,560
uh the self-actualization loop the

397
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,680
internal part of it needs to be um

398
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
implemented by some kind of

399
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
quote-unquote neuro neurological

400
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,079
circuits and what if this exactly the

401
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,480
same type of circuit the same structure

402
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,279
were being used to model the partner so

403
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,199
so that you actually also had a partner

404
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,720
actualization loop

405
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,959
so this is quite literally putting

406
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,680
yourself in the shoes of of your partner

407
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,199
right so

408
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,680
uh you have your own beliefs about your

409
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,880
position

410
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,600
and about your desires and you also have

411
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,560
the literally the same uh kind of

412
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,320
belief about

413
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,279
the partner's position and their desires

414
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,959
and you can use that

415
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,759
uh

416
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,519
plus of course whatever sensory or

417
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,120
whatever information you have from the

418
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,199
environment to predict

419
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,160
uh

420
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,240
the the partners actions is exactly the

421
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,519
same way that you're predicting your own

422
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,360
actions the only difference of course is

423
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
that uh you don't actually control your

424
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,279
partner so you're predicting that that's

425
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,040
the dotted line from a2

426
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,680
uh out or from a1 out in the in the

427
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,480
right

428
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,519
uh

429
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,440
so you're predicting how you're creating

430
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,959
counter factuals about what your partner

431
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,320
is going to do and then of course you

432
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,440
can observe

433
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,320
uh

434
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,560
observe whether that prediction matches

435
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,279
the

436
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,680
the the outcome in the next round and uh

437
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,600
use that each partner uses that too to

438
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,079
calibrate their model of the

439
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,920
of the of their partner

440
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,079
um and uh

441
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,240
the other thing is you want those two

442
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,160
predictions to be consistent between the

443
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,440
cells right you wanna you want the

444
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
beliefs about yourself and the partner

445
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,240
to have some consistency and that

446
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,560
actually helps you uh do what we call a

447
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,240
triangulation

448
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,440
right so you know

449
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
uh you know very maybe very little about

450
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,040
your physical environment but you're

451
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,120
seeing your partner do stuff

452
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,639
and uh and moving around and you're

453
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,959
using that information to inform your

454
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,279
your belief about your own position so

455
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,279
that's the the the power really the

456
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,480
power of theory in mind for our model

457
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
and we're going to see how useful that

458
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,399
is

459
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,440
now uh the other one is uh go alignment

460
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,800
i now realize that i've been speaking

461
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,119
for a long time so i'm gonna uh

462
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,720
go a little bit faster

463
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,400
and so the other feature that we talked

464
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,480
about is this thing called go alignment

465
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,520
and it's really uh about the ability for

466
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,919
an agent to adapt its goals to to

467
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,880
match another agent's goals and

468
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,480
uh this is a

469
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,919
this is a

470
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,679
bottom-up incentive

471
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,520
incentivization mechanism don't remember

472
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,039
what i mentioned that the system

473
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,200
actually has an optimum but has no

474
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,480
direct way to tell the agents about it

475
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
so the assumption here is that to the

476
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,840
extent that you can't that you have

477
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,400
overlaps between the two agents

478
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,760
uh goals and it turns out that those

479
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,640
that the overlapping goals are aligned

480
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,880
with the system optimum that provides a

481
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,400
bottom-up way for

482
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,799
for collectively optimal behavior to

483
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,400
to to happen and we didn't model dynamic

484
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,320
the dynamics of how that go alignment

485
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
happens we just assume that it can be

486
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
flipped on and off

487
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,039
just again for for simplicity and that's

488
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,240
uh that's the thing that we'd like to

489
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
explore further cool

490
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,360
um so we did a virtual experiment we ran

491
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
simulations with all four possible

492
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,480
combinations of with or without theory

493
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
of mind with or without uh goal

494
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,600
alignment and

495
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,919
and basically what we

496
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,679
and the baseline here which is without

497
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,520
your mind without golem in corresponds

498
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,600
to a scenario where these agents are

499
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
pretty much blind to each other they're

500
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,440
not interacting uh with them with each

501
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
other at all we can see each other but

502
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,039
they're not using that information

503
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,360
uh and we're gonna see how those

504
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
features actually drive the

505
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,919
the behavior of individual agents and

506
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,480
also the system itself

507
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,679
cool so basically what we find is that

508
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,200
uh i don't think i mentioned this before

509
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,640
but we define

510
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,520
in each pair there there's a strong a

511
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,120
perceptually strong and a perceptually

512
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,160
weak agent uh the weak agent is pretty

513
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,240
much following almost uh

514
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
random noise that they have very very

515
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840
poor smell

516
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,799
uh

517
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,520
receptors uh but they still they can

518
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,720
still use the the partner's uh position

519
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280
motion to triangulate right so

520
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,400
the

521
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
the effect here that we see agent-wise

522
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,679
are mostly

523
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,840
what benefit do these uh social

524
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
capabilities uh endow the weak agent

525
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,280
with

526
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,120
and

527
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,799
so we see that

528
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,840
the

529
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,000
model with both together actually is the

530
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
one where the performance of those the

531
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
weak agents consistently improves uh

532
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,720
really well to the point where you know

533
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,600
it gets almost as good at finding an

534
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,080
optimum as the

535
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,679
as the

536
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,679
strong agent and

537
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,919
uh why is that so the the basic

538
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,039
intuition is that theory mind by itself

539
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,760
uh in this model is not able to improve

540
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,160
outcomes that that much because

541
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,840
um remember each agent has two uh two

542
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,159
goals which correspond to the

543
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,720
the two peaks here in the in the

544
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,440
middle drawing on the left side and uh

545
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,039
because there's this this great

546
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,360
ambiguity right if i'm going to

547
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,919
to assert in a certain direction uh what

548
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,600
goal the

549
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440
it's hard to interpret that in terms of

550
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,600
going to a specific goal if you don't if

551
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,039
there's two possible goals where you're

552
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,240
going so

553
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,559
that limits how much useful information

554
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,640
the agent can get from the

555
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,679
from the

556
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,039
strong

557
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,960
and uh goal alignment itself uh doesn't

558
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
help by itself

559
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,640
because now you have a single reward

560
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
target target but you you're still not

561
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
uh super well defining where you're

562
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,960
going but putting the tape up the two

563
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,400
capabilities together actually does

564
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,120
result in a grass skin improvement so oh

565
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,720
i'll let it let that sink in for a

566
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,200
second uh theory of mine knowing put

567
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,679
putting yourself in the shoes of another

568
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,480
plus uh having a goal alignment the

569
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
capacity to to

570
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:58,880
to

571
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,640
share a goal uh it actually creates

572
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,520
benefits for the the agents that are

573
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
compensates helps a lot to compensate

574
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,159
for deficiencies in the in the

575
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,480
in the agent's ability to navigate its

576
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,640
physical environment

577
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,720
and uh

578
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,360
that also is true uh looking at the

579
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,679
collective so remember we were talking

580
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,440
about whether these uh models can

581
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,919
minimize the the collective free energy

582
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,240
f sigma so

583
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
we're interpreting this uh these runs of

584
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,640
uh

585
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
all these runs of

586
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,559
optimization for the

587
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,919
individual agents as part of one single

588
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
uh bayesian inference step for the

589
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
collective right and what we see here is

590
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,360
uh the

591
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,440
if we're doing this right the graph

592
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
should look like uh

593
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,080
like a gradient descent down the the

594
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,039
free energy gradient and

595
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,120
this only really happens consistently

596
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,000
towards an asymptote of zero in the

597
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
fourth model where you have both of

598
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,679
these social capabilities as we

599
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,760
mentioned you know get some improvement

600
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,679
uh you you have some abilities from

601
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,960
these agents that are coming from their

602
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,120
individual capabilities but when you

603
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,679
when you put uh the social cognitive

604
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,840
together with the with the

605
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,760
uh capabilities about the environment

606
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,080
that's when you get the ability to

607
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
really minimize the the system free

608
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,720
energy

609
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,840
all right so that's what uh what we uh

610
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,080
found in our paper and we think it's a

611
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
pretty interesting and compelling uh

612
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,520
example of being able to link uh still

613
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,360
in a very stylized way but

614
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
uh but very clearly link uh social

615
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,400
cognitive capabilities at the individual

616
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
level that are just that are not just

617
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,039
simple rules right it's not about simple

618
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,720
rule following but it actually has to do

619
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,360
with interpreting the other and using

620
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,720
that information

621
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,919
and linking that directly to um

622
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,679
to active inference at the collective

623
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,640
level

624
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,720
uh and where we'd like to take that i

625
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
think the the four most exciting uh

626
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,640
things that we've been discussing the

627
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,480
last couple of months are

628
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
first of all

629
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
uh can you actually

630
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,080
look at experiments with with humans and

631
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,960
uh

632
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
because you know these capabilities

633
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,080
these software

634
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,679
these social capabilities are things

635
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,840
that you can measure uh through your

636
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,679
mind and the ability to align goals for

637
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,520
things that you can test out with human

638
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,799
subjects and uh can you

639
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,679
use our model to to

640
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,039
to

641
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,440
represent and simulate and contrast with

642
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,919
what happens in groups of of humans and

643
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,279
see if

644
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,640
the

645
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,360
differences in their abilities to

646
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,400
to

647
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,080
to have theory of mind and to align on

648
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,440
goals

649
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
matches up with with what we're defining

650
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,360
here as free energy minimization that's

651
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,279
one one idea

652
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,679
another one is you know collectives one

653
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,080
of the things that collectives can can

654
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,640
have is behaviors around shared

655
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,360
resources and these resources endowed

656
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
them with capabilities in different ways

657
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,360
so that creates we think that creates

658
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,080
sort of an on-ramp to understanding the

659
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
the idea of economic value

660
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,600
um

661
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,360
that's we've been joking and jokingly

662
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,679
calling it for tsunamics

663
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,200
this is uh

664
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,120
the further down you go the more

665
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,559
speculative we get but we think that

666
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,320
uh

667
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,760
active inference can actually help us

668
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,559
understand this notion of

669
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,360
of where does value come from is it

670
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,840
really just uh

671
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,320
related to scarcity or is actually also

672
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,880
related to to the capabilities that it's

673
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,880
endowing with different agents how these

674
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
two things relate to each other so i

675
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,760
think that's a there's a there's a

676
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
powerful idea there

677
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,520
um this notion of uh gynomics uh i wrote

678
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,600
a little bit about that i think it's uh

679
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,720
it's been

680
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,880
starting to pick up scene in some areas

681
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
and uh you know ultimately the

682
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,240
uh all of us are embedded in one big

683
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,480
collective which is gaia from gaia

684
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,520
theory uh it's the planetary scale uh

685
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,360
collective intelligence that some

686
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
sometimes works really well sometimes it

687
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
doesn't work really well can we use

688
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,159
these sorts of ideas of multi-skill um

689
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,480
active inference modeling to to

690
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,600
improve how we define and model uh the

691
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,799
the behavior of that guy assistant

692
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,760
finally going from the pretty big to the

693
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,840
pretty small individuals

694
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,559
and individual humans brain uh we've

695
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,559
been looking at jeff hawkins's uh

696
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,880
a thousand brain theory from his recent

697
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,039
book and there's a lot of interesting

698
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,440
ideas that look a lot like active

699
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,559
inference but

700
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,320
uh as far as you know

701
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,880
uh nobody said try to model what what he

702
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880
says is the fundamental unit of

703
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,720
intelligence which are these cortical

704
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,840
columns in the new neural cortex

705
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,320
nobody tried to model those using active

706
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,960
inference and as the name implies

707
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,919
the

708
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,799
the the main thesis of this theory is

709
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,400
that the

710
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,720
intelligence in our brains comes from

711
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,760
the collective behavior of all these

712
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,600
all these cortical columns interacting

713
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,039
by a

714
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,520
certain algorithm and so

715
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,799
what it would look what would it look

716
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,720
like to try to implement this uh this

717
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,640
year in the context of of the brain and

718
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,960
what inter-protocol agent capabilities

719
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,159
are required

720
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:32,960
so

721
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,440
i'm going to pause there i've i've

722
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,520
overstayed my welcome

723
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,679
i'm really curious to hear what kind of

724
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,000
questions or or thoughts

725
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,120
we have

726
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,200
in our homes yeah

727
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,480
thanks

728
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,320
awesome thanks for the fascinating

729
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,360
present you're muted then

730
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
thanks sorry um

731
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,159
great presentation so maybe we could

732
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,600
start with just uh pravnav and then blue

733
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,440
just

734
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,000
what is bringing you to being right here

735
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,919
and what are your first thoughts either

736
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,000
being involved on the work or on the

737
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
collective behavior side more generally

738
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,120
blue are you going start like

739
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,559
author's profession

740
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,799
thank you thank you uh

741
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,480
no i think uh

742
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,399
so this work in particular

743
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,000
uh like i'll start with this work as a

744
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,679
context to set up the

745
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,640
the bigger idea is

746
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,279
a part of the thing that we

747
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,200
i'm interested in we're interested

748
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,159
together

749
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,760
is figuring out

750
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
one

751
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,080
understanding causality of where does uh

752
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,600
you know collective intelligence emerge

753
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,880
from like what are the interactions

754
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,039
between humans or humans and machines

755
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,600
those things uh while you can have

756
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,760
causal theory from a management social

757
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,080
science perspective

758
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,000
it's very hard to know that it is

759
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,880
optimal like is that the outcome uh like

760
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,559
a statistical you know mechanics

761
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,399
approach to looking at ideal gas

762
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,159
behavior and saying that oh the at the

763
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,760
aggregate level this is how the gas

764
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
should behave but you can look at the

765
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,159
micro interactions uh underneath so i

766
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,399
think for from my perspective active

767
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,799
inference is

768
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,840
like

769
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,600
you know this may not count correct but

770
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,039
from a social scientist perspective it

771
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,799
is an a theoretical way or physics way

772
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,080
of looking at uh the markov blanket like

773
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,279
looking at the

774
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,039
statistical mechanics without worrying

775
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,520
about how exactly does theory of mind

776
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,799
come about so

777
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,480
as raphael explained we had a partner

778
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,279
actualization loop we think the

779
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,320
analog

780
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,279
in social science is theory of mind uh

781
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,360
and and what we start to demonstrate is

782
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,640
that even if there are individual uh

783
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,120
active inference agents they will need

784
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,880
some form of

785
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,279
partner actualization and in humans you

786
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,120
can observe that as the capability of

787
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,080
theory of mind to be able to you know

788
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,240
use each other as sources of information

789
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
so if i cannot

790
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,039
uh

791
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,799
work in my environment because my

792
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,640
physical skills like looking at you know

793
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,120
smelling the uh different chemicals at

794
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
different levels is low but my social

795
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,279
perceptiveness is high so i can look at

796
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,159
my partner and infer something about my

797
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,679
environment then i can still work in the

798
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,480
environment right but that alone is not

799
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,279
enough for us to work as a collective so

800
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,559
the free energy of the collective will

801
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,720
not go down just if everybody can

802
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,240
understand each other's perspective or

803
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,640
step into each other's shoes so then we

804
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,480
need something more so the second thing

805
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,399
that we introduce and you know

806
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,039
test out is some form of aligning goals

807
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,440
like there has to be a reason to find

808
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,120
you know common peaks

809
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,159
uh again the current model does not say

810
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,679
how it comes about that is a social

811
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,960
science type of question because the

812
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,880
causality like do we trust each other do

813
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,440
we have a good communication

814
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,880
processes or not like there will be

815
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,480
accuracies and efficiency issues in

816
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
communication themselves all of this is

817
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
not you know aif doesn't worry about

818
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,320
that but it tells us that these two

819
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,399
capabilities at the individual agent

820
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,120
level are important to get a collective

821
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,799
outcome like i think from from our

822
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,760
perspective that is really the uh core

823
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,279
contribution that we are saying that

824
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,200
there are some

825
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,120
cognitive capabilities that are beyond

826
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,520
an individual aif model the way mcgregor

827
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,760
had set it up that are needed for it to

828
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,360
show up as a collective

829
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,720
all right there's much more to be done

830
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,080
here but we are starting to draw these

831
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,480
patterns so the exciting thing that uh

832
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,320
raphael started uh you know talked more

833
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,279
about was can we map those which is uh

834
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,120
experimentally if we run

835
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,760
uh human agents in a similar environment

836
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,880
and you know and ask them to do a

837
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,720
similar task and we have aif agents

838
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,000
working together

839
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,880
can we create a mapping of what is the

840
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,039
you know theory of mind index like the

841
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,320
score for this person for this person on

842
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,799
this scale because that would help us

843
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,480
preemptively say that all right if you

844
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,240
have a collection of people with this

845
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,159
distribution of theory of mind like

846
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,640
their ability to uh understand each

847
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,320
other's like social perceptiveness which

848
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,720
is a standard scale uh in social

849
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,000
sciences

850
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,240
i think it's called rme reading the mind

851
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,159
and the eye that's a standard scale so

852
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,640
like if we can create a mapping from

853
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,240
a real uh indicator of theory of mind

854
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,240
onto these things we can start having

855
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,840
some predictions that this team is

856
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,919
likely to succeed more than this

857
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,159
combination of people right so that

858
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,919
starts to open up the area all right now

859
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,240
we have some interesting uh

860
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,320
uh understanding of how the whole system

861
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,240
works and can we draw it to real human

862
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,559
so like this is very much the beginnings

863
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,600
of a

864
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,039
grander uh

865
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,559
research statement and there is like

866
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,840
research direction that we are trying to

867
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,640
pursue and using aif

868
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
in uh tandem with

869
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,159
you know cause and theories or uh

870
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,159
management or social science theories to

871
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,840
figure out more that how can we you know

872
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,120
help teams better or design teachers

873
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,720
does that like

874
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,399
is that enough like i didn't go much

875
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,480
beyond that but like very happy to talk

876
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,000
more on other kinds of words

877
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,799
over to you

878
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,519
thanks that was great um yeah i really

879
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,080
enjoyed this paper from um my background

880
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
is like biological sciences and so like

881
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,840
i've done cellular and molecular

882
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
neuroscience like all the way through my

883
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
phd until i kind of took the jump off

884
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,480
the diagonal um so for me it's i'm not

885
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
as well versed in the social science

886
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,080
aspect but i think

887
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,720
a lot about collectives and i'm super

888
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,480
drawn to collective intelligence and

889
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,279
even um hierarchical systemic

890
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,000
organization right like so how you know

891
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,360
bodies are built right from like

892
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,559
molecules to cells to tissues to organs

893
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,519
etcetera um and even like to societies

894
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,320
and ecosystems um like the gaia theory

895
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,159
that you were talking about earlier so

896
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,159
so this paper was awesome for me i do

897
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,919
have like quite a bit of questions um

898
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,000
especially at like the social science

899
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
front like in the beginning of the paper

900
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,760
you guys outlined like a whole lot of

901
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,360
different um

902
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,000
you know potential ways that we operate

903
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,279
like as

904
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,519
multi-system um

905
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,919
multi-agent systems and so like a lot of

906
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,080
them you have theory of mind in there um

907
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
and also the goal alignment but you also

908
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,840
had like shared norms and folk

909
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,799
psychology and so what what made you

910
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,399
choose just those two as opposed to like

911
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,640
testing all the other ones out or did

912
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,399
you try others or did you not figure out

913
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,559
a way to like mathematically get it

914
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,840
together or what was your logic there

915
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,559
expedience

916
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
right now do you want to take that

917
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,760
uh

918
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,640
yes i think so we had

919
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,320
about six months of discussion of what

920
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,760
would be the scope of the paper and

921
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,320
that's where uh because it was like so

922
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,600
many things like as you can see here i

923
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,279
found this and we are all very excited

924
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,880
about looking at it at the level of

925
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,120
christian

926
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,919
but before we could jump on to any of

927
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,399
those things i think it was important to

928
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,120
boil down as to what is the key

929
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,880
you know pieces that are needed before

930
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,480
it can go to specifics so the key piece

931
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,360
was

932
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,440
at this point aif

933
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,599
does a very good job of explaining like

934
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,199
an individual interacting with an

935
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,359
environment and how it operates

936
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,239
so

937
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,079
yes we can go to norms yes we can go to

938
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,918
these things but these are details about

939
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,159
how does you know norms emerge and at

940
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,839
the end of the day again i could be

941
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,520
misunderstanding some pieces of it

942
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,599
because i i'm coming from social

943
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,159
sciences to active influence so pardon

944
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,079
my uh pardon me errors there and please

945
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,320
correct me my understanding is that aif

946
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,520
does not give you a sort of a human

947
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
level explanation it is the same kind of

948
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,679
collective outcome that we would see if

949
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,599
of cells clumping together we would not

950
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,359
call it theory of mind in cells because

951
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,119
i don't think we have a

952
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,960
feature that says oh cells have theory

953
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,359
of mind of other cells like it could be

954
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,159
like it is still an analogy so aif is

955
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,440
not telling you that this is the

956
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,520
mechanism it's saying that you need this

957
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,160
as a functional piece to it so that the

958
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,320
energy minimization happens and that is

959
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,880
demonstrated to the map so the reason we

960
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,119
did not go into a specific

961
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,280
implementation was because i think that

962
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,119
would be the next you know set next set

963
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,359
of steps we first need to say that

964
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,599
at the abstract level at the you know

965
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,240
baseline level concept level we need to

966
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,000
have certain additions to an aif

967
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,200
framework when looking at collectives

968
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,680
as against uh so one way of looking at

969
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,440
collective that we you know

970
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,839
do in the systems free energy system

971
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,520
level free energy is that we look at the

972
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,800
entire system

973
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,240
as a

974
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
you know aif

975
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,320
thing and plots free energy but that is

976
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,760
very different from being able to say

977
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,599
that oh how are these two members or

978
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,839
these 15 members within this system

979
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,520
interacting with each other what are the

980
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,359
capabilities that these people have that

981
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,040
is different from this whole system as

982
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,320
an you know active inference system

983
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,800
and that that is where i think if i am

984
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,760
not

985
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,240
like i don't mean to complicate this uh

986
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
or sound vague i think we first wanted

987
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,440
to establish all right what is the

988
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
minimum mechanism that we need if we do

989
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,160
that in one paper at the simplest level

990
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,400
then let's start digging into how does

991
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,280
the goal alignment or norm uh formation

992
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,560
come about so that can then be a

993
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,720
parameter that certain

994
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,520
teams or certain set of individuals or

995
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,359
subgroups of individuals are better at

996
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,680
forming norms while others are not you

997
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
would expect these people to minimize

998
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,839
their free energy as a subgroup better

999
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,200
than this other subgroup so that would

1000
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,640
be an exciting extension in which you

1001
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,520
can go

1002
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,359
but we didn't want to jump there because

1003
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,280
it would be doing too much

1004
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
at least that's where we were at raphael

1005
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,560
is that

1006
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,359
accurate or did i completely

1007
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,780
[Music]

1008
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,599
from my side where where i

1009
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,400
where i got to to the beginnings of

1010
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,240
what we were discussing is i had this

1011
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,599
question in my mind of

1012
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,400
you know it takes a ton of cells to

1013
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,560
create a

1014
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,440
great collective behavior

1015
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,280
it's usually

1016
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,960
it's usually a pretty big discrepancy

1017
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,480
between the the different scales at

1018
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,160
which you know different levels of

1019
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,920
hierarchy are are

1020
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,640
are

1021
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,720
are set up if you think about a

1022
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,598
cell and then uh

1023
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,520
an organelle sorry an organ or

1024
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
clearly not a biologist but

1025
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,800
uh even in um

1026
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,240
in these examples that we gave with with

1027
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,640
starlings or other

1028
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,880
examples with

1029
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,280
other animals other than humans it looks

1030
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,680
like it like the

1031
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,760
the the behaviors of ant colonies and so

1032
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,320
on it's a it's a collective behavior but

1033
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,720
it's really driven by the the

1034
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,440
the statistical mechanical uh

1035
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,320
implications of of these relatively

1036
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,200
simple

1037
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,119
uh rule follow group following behaviors

1038
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,680
whereas

1039
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:02,640
the

1040
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,480
sword i don't claim to have demonstrated

1041
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,560
it so i'll continue calling it a hunch

1042
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,760
the hunch that that we had is

1043
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,160
because humans have this more

1044
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,599
sophisticated

1045
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,400
uh

1046
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,920
set of abilities

1047
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,720
that

1048
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,240
you know

1049
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,760
implicat implies some uh some

1050
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,160
some ability to

1051
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,240
to

1052
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,320
do things in a non-rule following way

1053
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,720
meaning that they're not uh they're not

1054
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,079
cause effect relationships at the at the

1055
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,599
uh individual level uh that

1056
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,520
allows collectives of humans to be

1057
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,240
formed in a more uh

1058
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,960
in uh with fewer humans and with more of

1059
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,800
more of a fluid

1060
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,839
aspect

1061
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,560
and meaning they can the collective can

1062
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,119
also have more flexible behaviors

1063
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,079
again don't claim to have proven it but

1064
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,359
that's where

1065
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,680
i i i feel like the

1066
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,480
um the two the two capabilities that we

1067
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,960
that we picked came from because theory

1068
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,160
of mine

1069
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,640
true what distinguishes true theory of

1070
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,320
mind from just having a heuristic about

1071
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
how your partner is going to behave is

1072
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,720
really this ability to to

1073
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,839
to

1074
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:18,800
put

1075
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,040
put what you're seeing uh in the world

1076
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,720
through the same

1077
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,800
the same active inference loop as you're

1078
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,760
used for

1079
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,280
for yourself which will call putting

1080
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,800
yourself in the shoes of another and

1081
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,359
that's like inherently not uh

1082
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,920
not a simple cause effect thing

1083
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,200
the

1084
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
uh the other one with goal alignment

1085
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,640
even though we didn't demonstrate it

1086
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,880
quite quite as as deeply i think it

1087
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,560
follows the same principle of you know

1088
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,160
it being this kind of like mutual

1089
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,760
adjustment of expectations that

1090
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,599
eventually gets you to uh

1091
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,119
to uh to a shared goal

1092
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,960
and so you feel like that

1093
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,119
that has the kernel of an idea about

1094
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,640
what makes human connective special

1095
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,320
awesome

1096
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,079
one comment and then i'll ask a question

1097
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,480
from the chat you kind of pointed out

1098
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,400
that there's a lot of modeling at the

1099
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,040
single agent level and then sometimes

1100
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,880
when you have a massive number of agents

1101
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,040
interacting you can almost take these

1102
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,960
mean field approaches or

1103
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,800
statistical averaging and then the kind

1104
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,640
of complexity is in the middle where

1105
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
there's small groups and reconfiguring

1106
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
so that was really interesting

1107
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,040
and also just the challenge of different

1108
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,599
words used for the same phenomena across

1109
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,319
scales or across systems

1110
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,240
i understood it as sort of like you were

1111
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,920
saying this is the continent of theory

1112
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,839
of mind these are some of the key words

1113
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,079
or the questions and then that's just a

1114
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,160
first connection and now you could

1115
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,920
reconfigure what the collective could do

1116
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,079
or do other experiments

1117
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,480
so here's a question from the chat

1118
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,880
they wrote a feature of the model is

1119
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,960
that order emerges through the bottom-up

1120
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,800
self-organization rather than top-down

1121
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,119
priors like most active inference models

1122
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,640
on morphogenesis

1123
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,400
however the goals were pretty much

1124
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,640
hard-coded into the model what

1125
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
self-organization did is only to select

1126
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
the collectively optimal decision among

1127
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,880
a set of possible decisions

1128
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,280
so i'd like to know more how the model

1129
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,200
improves on existing literature and

1130
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,480
importantly what it says about

1131
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,160
intelligence which is understood as the

1132
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,760
capability to understand the world

1133
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
rather than just optimize outcome given

1134
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,720
a set of possible decisions

1135
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,440
all right again

1136
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,359
yeah talk a little bit to that and then

1137
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,960
if you have anything to add

1138
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
um i think this uh

1139
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,359
this really points to to

1140
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,040
another limitation

1141
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,079
presented by time when we decided to to

1142
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,599
um

1143
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,400
to publish this for for entropy we had

1144
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,640
this

1145
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,040
this notion of being able to investigate

1146
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,480
how goals emerged at the collective

1147
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,119
level as well and

1148
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,119
uh that turned out to just not be

1149
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,160
feasible

1150
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,599
in our time frame but i totally agree

1151
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,520
with the critique that

1152
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,960
ultimately what you do want to

1153
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,240
understand is is also how goals emerge

1154
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,760
we talk about that a little bit in the

1155
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,560
paper i think the the one one possible

1156
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,200
approach is this notion of

1157
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,119
of

1158
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,400
um

1159
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,599
exploring states and uh as a collective

1160
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,040
and uh

1161
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,280
and seeing what happens to individual

1162
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,160
uh outcomes and if if there is an

1163
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,040
evolutionary nudge that would that would

1164
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,839
that would align incentives naturally

1165
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,520
you know from the from the perspective

1166
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,200
of the

1167
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,040
um

1168
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,280
of the various combinations of all

1169
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,160
of

1170
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,319
individual incentives as well as if you

1171
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,760
think about social incentives they have

1172
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,000
these ideas of keeping up with the jonas

1173
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,720
jones's or or however there's a bunch of

1174
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,680
ways to

1175
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,560
to

1176
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,760
model that

1177
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,440
and we think that given uh

1178
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,800
given that kind of

1179
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,599
evolutionary nudge towards uh go

1180
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,079
alignment we could see that emerge as a

1181
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,200
as a

1182
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,880
totally bottom-up uh model as well even

1183
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,640
having said that i don't think that the

1184
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,680
model is uh completely top-down uh given

1185
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,960
you know

1186
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,800
it's not giving like

1187
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,119
so such strong constraints uh and uh

1188
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,920
the

1189
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,160
the way we try to to

1190
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,119
to

1191
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,720
tease apart that that thing is that this

1192
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,319
notion of everybody has two different

1193
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,119
goals and uh but the system has a has a

1194
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,720
single

1195
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,480
single optimum state

1196
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,920
and but it has it's not like directly

1197
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,599
telling it's not directly giving

1198
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,720
incentives to the to the uh individuals

1199
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,960
to to do it right it's just like quote

1200
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,680
unquote by coincidence the the

1201
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,960
the

1202
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,119
shared goal asc

1203
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,240
is the

1204
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,839
is also

1205
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,040
the

1206
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,359
the optimum for the system

1207
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,960
of course you know as we then as we

1208
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,440
showed if without a way to align on that

1209
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,280
shared goal it's just as likely that

1210
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,079
each

1211
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,440
each uh individual will just uh pursue

1212
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,839
their own uh private goal we did play

1213
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,440
around with some models where the the

1214
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,040
shared goal was actually a lower peak

1215
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,440
entering the reward function than the

1216
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,760
private goals and uh of course that

1217
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,240
meant that that

1218
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,560
absent goal alignment

1219
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,240
the agents were more likely to pursue

1220
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,599
the the

1221
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,000
the private goals and the shared goal

1222
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,520
and so you have a little bit of that

1223
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,240
flavor of okay i think we can

1224
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,160
uh we can at least say something about

1225
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,599
that uh

1226
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,359
about that relationship that is not just

1227
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,960
the traditional bottom-up composing

1228
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,880
goals and of course the units are gonna

1229
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,240
are gonna

1230
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,118
strive for us as well

1231
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,319
you have i think i'll jump in and add a

1232
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,960
couple of oh mostly

1233
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,560
how we arrived at this visions i think

1234
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,040
so several uh uh like i think great

1235
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,160
question this is the kind of we started

1236
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,400
with a complex model and

1237
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,240
you know evolved it into what's the

1238
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,079
simplest instantiation for the goal of

1239
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,200
this paper so let me walk you through a

1240
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,040
couple of different things

1241
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,920
which

1242
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,760
we started out with but we're now

1243
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,079
planning ahead on so we first started

1244
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,680
with the idea that

1245
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
okay if you're looking for a minimal

1246
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
mechanism we need something through

1247
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,240
which and i'm talking in analogy in like

1248
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,560
you know two agents teams terms not in

1249
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,400
uh aif terms uh we need the two agents

1250
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,119
to not only understand each other's

1251
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,319
goals or distribution of desires

1252
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,400
but also compile them

1253
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
right so the the simplest way we

1254
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,319
initially started with that we gave each

1255
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,800
individual their own twin beat or three

1256
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,119
beat or you know how it however peaked a

1257
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,880
distribution of goals in their

1258
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,520
environment and said okay you can just

1259
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,000
take them and combine them

1260
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,760
but what we started

1261
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,640
encountering in that piece was that

1262
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,400
should we be thinking about

1263
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,560
having an additional value

1264
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,319
for approaching shared goals that is

1265
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,079
when the peaks are combined if my

1266
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,800
partner also has this similar peak it

1267
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,560
should be given higher value so there is

1268
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,480
like there is a synergy bonus or there

1269
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,240
is a collective goal bonus that should

1270
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,599
be given that minimizes my uh you know

1271
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,000
selfish desire to go after goals that is

1272
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,400
only mine like my private goals so like

1273
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,960
we've played around this

1274
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,200
sort of decision space but we found out

1275
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,280
that i think we'll have to create

1276
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,839
another parameter on giving them how

1277
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,440
much is their preference for personal

1278
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,960
goals versus preference for collective

1279
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,040
codes so that's an additional parameter

1280
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,280
that can be added to the model to each

1281
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,040
individual that they have

1282
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,000
uh i i forget the name that you're like

1283
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,680
selfish buyers or like team buyers

1284
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,960
something like we created something of

1285
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,760
that sort uh and that would determine so

1286
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,680
you could also end up in a place where

1287
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,960
me as an agent is always going after my

1288
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,800
personal goals but rafael as a team

1289
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,720
member is always going after team goals

1290
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,400
or shared goals like that would be the

1291
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,839
distinction that we'll be able to draw

1292
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:58,560
out

1293
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,720
that was not part of the scope of this

1294
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,560
paper that's why we you know removed

1295
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,200
away that's a thing and simplified it as

1296
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,680
everybody has only two peaks and it is

1297
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,119
very clearly known that this is the

1298
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,960
shared peak and this is the unshared to

1299
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,040
simplify the model and the explanation

1300
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,280
uh what you can do is make a general

1301
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,520
version of it that you can have a way of

1302
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,359
compiling them you can add on a

1303
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,599
parameter which can say that i have a

1304
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,400
dream team preference like i have the

1305
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,760
social science equivalent would be my

1306
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,440
collectivism orientation uh

1307
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,960
individualistic versus collectivism

1308
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,960
collectivistic orientations right like

1309
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,559
if i am very collectivistic i am very

1310
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,640
likely to choose a goal that is good for

1311
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,680
the team

1312
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,280
if i'm individualistic i am likely to

1313
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,760
choose a goal that is good for me right

1314
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,280
i'm not optimizing for the team so like

1315
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,280
those kinds of things can be built in

1316
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,000
and

1317
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,839
hopefully we'll be able to explore that

1318
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,000
further but we realize that that

1319
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,079
orientation by itself

1320
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,359
is not

1321
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:52,960
required to minimally explain the

1322
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,119
emergence of characters right so one

1323
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,960
interesting piece again not explored in

1324
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,640
the paper was

1325
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,000
over here

1326
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,720
the idea was that both

1327
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,280
agents should end up at the shared peak

1328
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,359
so they are trying to seek the common

1329
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,640
peak

1330
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,680
what if

1331
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,480
uh

1332
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,720
so that is how systems high system

1333
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,520
performance was uh defined but what if

1334
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,040
it is a

1335
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,640
what you would call a disjunctive class

1336
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,400
that is there are multiple goals in the

1337
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,160
environment the team as a whole should

1338
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,640
hit all the goals as against compile on

1339
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,319
a single goal what does that look like

1340
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,240
that is cooperation to achieve all the

1341
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,280
goals

1342
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,040
our model currently cannot handle that

1343
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,760
it does not know how to coordinate

1344
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,680
separate goals that are contributing to

1345
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,000
a team over here the assumption there is

1346
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,040
that

1347
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,720
synchronizing or converging onto a

1348
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,119
position is what is good collective

1349
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,960
behavior that is not true like as you

1350
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,760
try to

1351
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,440
you know do more analogies on which

1352
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,880
direction you want to grow the model

1353
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,559
that would be an extension that one has

1354
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,240
to think about that

1355
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,040
how are we defining what you know better

1356
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,440
collective outcome looks like like that

1357
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,480
depends on the environment you're

1358
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,240
working in depends on how the goals are

1359
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,079
broken down so those are the places that

1360
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,839
we would like to go so you're absolutely

1361
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,440
right that it

1362
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,760
it is essentially in right now an

1363
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,680
optimal decision-making

1364
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,599
situation because the simplest feature

1365
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,000
the goal was not to make the

1366
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,079
optimization the complexity of the paper

1367
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,000
the goal was to say that you need a

1368
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,280
heuristic

1369
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,200
to find the common ground that's it and

1370
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,640
here is the simplest one that we

1371
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,480
presented

1372
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,200
does that make sense

1373
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,920
i think it brings us to this question

1374
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,559
about what does make the higher order

1375
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,440
group

1376
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,760
an active inference agent versus really

1377
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,400
what does make something specifically

1378
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,480
an active inference agent at any scale

1379
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,559
is it just enough to have input of

1380
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,200
information and policy selection isn't

1381
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,160
that just control theory more broadly so

1382
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,079
how do we um

1383
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,760
figure out who is and isn't the active

1384
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,520
inference agent at the level we designed

1385
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,839
it at explicitly which was the lower

1386
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,400
level formally defined and then

1387
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,160
where really your claim is kind of

1388
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,240
building the bridge to which is

1389
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,680
statements about collective phenomena

1390
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,839
and collective behavior so maybe either

1391
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,960
the authors are then blue

1392
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,800
yeah and uh i'll i don't have a ton to

1393
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,640
add to that i just wanted to say that

1394
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,400
you know but i'm not i don't have a

1395
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,119
strong background in complexity to

1396
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,640
theory or or even in dynamical systems

1397
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,359
but

1398
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,960
i was

1399
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,880
i was reflecting on on those sorts of

1400
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
things and it struck me that

1401
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,599
this assumption of gradient descent

1402
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,800
uh you know the assumption that the

1403
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,920
optimization is is even possible

1404
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,880
is

1405
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,800
is such a kind of an ingrained thing

1406
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,520
when you think about

1407
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,280
this kind of modeling that

1408
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,200
exploding that assumption a little bit

1409
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,480
and just

1410
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,040
and focusing on on exactly this question

1411
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,720
of is it even possible for a for uh

1412
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,119
for a system that looks like this to

1413
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,920
actually like in in practice uh

1414
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,359
minimize this free energy functional

1415
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,280
right is it

1416
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,160
and uh i think it it

1417
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,240
again my day job has to do with some

1418
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,400
some issues of organizational dynamics

1419
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,720
and so on and i think that has a lot

1420
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,480
actually to do with with

1421
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,800
uh system dysfunctions because

1422
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,000
the

1423
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,960
the

1424
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,440
basic assumptions of

1425
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,839
of

1426
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,200
of

1427
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,040
what needs to happen in order for things

1428
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,520
to fall into place is

1429
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,400
or sometimes you know not trivial at all

1430
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,880
and uh can you know the efficacy of a

1431
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,000
team of the of the collective at

1432
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,960
uh

1433
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,920
doing that kind of of minimization which

1434
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,480
we really understand as achieving some

1435
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,520
kind of shared interpretation of the

1436
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,760
of the world is

1437
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,599
is really what's at stake here i also

1438
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,319
want to add really quickly that uh we

1439
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,480
cheated a little bit our system is not

1440
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,480
an active the the global system is not

1441
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,920
an active interest model it's just an

1442
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,960
interest

1443
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,359
uh model uh it

1444
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,240
again came down to expedience

1445
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,480
so it's the the collective as a whole is

1446
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,079
not acting back into the

1447
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,119
into the

1448
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,280
uh environment so i think

1449
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,359
there are bigger questions there around

1450
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,880
how does that

1451
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,960
bigger loop evolve and how does that

1452
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,000
influence the capabilities that that

1453
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,160
agents have right if you're like really

1454
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,800
trying to just to get your system to to

1455
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,880
act optimally on the world and the

1456
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,280
levers you have are the kinds of

1457
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,280
of social cognitive capabilities that

1458
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,359
individual agents have would that select

1459
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,480
for more

1460
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,440
for

1461
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,920
more agents with more theory of mind

1462
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,559
with more go alignment with the mix

1463
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,160
so that's the kind of things that we

1464
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,960
would expect to see with the broader uh

1465
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,040
dynamical lens at the

1466
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,599
system scale

1467
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,319
thanks blue

1468
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,920
yeah so um

1469
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,400
from the like complexity

1470
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,640
uh perspective and kind of piggybacking

1471
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,800
off of like the bigger system and what

1472
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,359
is the bigger system so

1473
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,040
i don't know if you're familiar with uh

1474
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,960
maybe integrated information theory of

1475
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,480
consciousness but it really looks at

1476
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,800
like to what degree the whole is more

1477
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
than the sum of just its interconnected

1478
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,200
parts um and then um there's there's

1479
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,119
that like angle but then there's also a

1480
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,800
recent paper by david krakauer that

1481
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,720
talks about the information theory of

1482
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,240
individuality

1483
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,319
and they really talk in this paper about

1484
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,280
how in order for a unit to be a new

1485
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,400
individual um there has to be like so

1486
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,839
and this goes even back to like the

1487
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,079
origins of life theories right like so

1488
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,920
you start off as like a collective of

1489
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,760
whatever molecules and then what makes

1490
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,920
you form a cell right and so what has to

1491
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,599
happen in the integrated information

1492
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,599
theory uh paper um or sorry the

1493
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,119
information theory of individuality

1494
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,559
paper is that there's this

1495
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,880
bi-directional information flow from

1496
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,119
both the bottom to the top and then from

1497
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,200
the top to the bottom which you also see

1498
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,760
like in human organizations when like

1499
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,680
you get a group of individuals that

1500
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,160
align on some kind of collective goal

1501
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,079
like so somehow

1502
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,480
a leader emerges right like so so if

1503
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,160
everybody's kind of like well

1504
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,200
i don't know what to do and like you

1505
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,240
know how people are they act like that

1506
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,400
so then somebody will take charge and

1507
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,319
direct the group even in an emergent

1508
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,559
unstructured way there becomes this

1509
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,960
bi-directional information flow that

1510
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,960
makes something a collective unit and

1511
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,880
and i just wonder um

1512
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,280
like i i just find myself questioning

1513
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,599
whether you have that if you've built a

1514
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,480
new collective unit or not so and do you

1515
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,440
think you could and

1516
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,400
can i jump in

1517
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,119
quickly so

1518
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,240
you bring up fantastic points i think

1519
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,440
the way

1520
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,200
i have simplified and understood active

1521
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,520
inferences that you have an agent it is

1522
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,760
considered to have an active uh

1523
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,960
working in an active infrastructure

1524
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,799
paradigm if it is interacting with its

1525
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,240
physical environment to reduce its

1526
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,119
surprise right like it is trying to

1527
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,119
act on it build a hypothesis and then

1528
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,280
act on it as simple as that

1529
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,000
but when we try to move to collectives

1530
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,160
what we are changing here so like when

1531
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,720
uh so for example if you have to say

1532
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,599
is this single human an active inference

1533
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,920
agent we ask does it interact with a

1534
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,200
physical environment you know to

1535
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,599
optimize an outcome then we ask is this

1536
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,440
organization or a team

1537
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,960
acting as an active inference as a

1538
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,400
system you can say that oh this

1539
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,680
organization is interacting with its

1540
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,359
physical environment with the resource

1541
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,359
environment and doing things

1542
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:38,559
the distinction that we're trying to

1543
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,359
build is how do you go from here to here

1544
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,680
which means when there are multiple

1545
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,920
individual aif agents in addition to

1546
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,680
having a physical environment you also

1547
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,280
have a social environment

1548
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,000
and

1549
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,280
that is where

1550
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,119
you you have to be interactive right so

1551
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:54,960
like now you are so the idea of theory

1552
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,040
of mind or goal alignment all of this

1553
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,520
results in the like from my perspective

1554
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,319
in the social environment place which

1555
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,319
you know leads to a system as a whole

1556
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,880
behaving such that it looks like it is

1557
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,599
uh you know an active inference agent it

1558
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,280
appears to be an active internet agent

1559
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,520
because it is able to

1560
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,079
very dynamically work on its physical

1561
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,240
environment but coordinate or combine

1562
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,920
its information that is coming from

1563
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,319
decentralized sources internally to get

1564
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,760
you know the you know minimum free

1565
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,720
energy

1566
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,000
type of action so now building from like

1567
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,599
looking back from there the idea of so

1568
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,599
we don't do in our current paper i think

1569
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,160
as rafael said we are not modeling the

1570
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,799
entire system as an af agent what we are

1571
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:40,720
saying is this is simply a statistical

1572
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,400
look so if you look at all the different

1573
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,720
runs and compile them together it would

1574
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,400
seem as if

1575
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,880
in most cases the behavior of the system

1576
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,119
is such that it aligns with reducing

1577
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,359
free energy it is not actually actively

1578
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,440
doing things this is just a compilation

1579
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,520
or aggregation of the different you know

1580
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,280
simulation runs that we've done

1581
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,319
so

1582
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,760
because you're not trying to build an ai

1583
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,280
model at home because at the whole level

1584
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,799
if you're trying to build an af model

1585
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,000
the model would look different you would

1586
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,440
not have separate individuals in the

1587
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,760
world uh they will have to have you know

1588
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,240
act as uh some somewhere you know joint

1589
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,480
at the hip in which there is perfect uh

1590
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,400
or there's some form of information

1591
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,040
integration going on so the the idea

1592
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,720
that i think you brought up

1593
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,839
was

1594
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,520
that in an unstructured environment

1595
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,520
there's a leader developing and they you

1596
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,839
know bring it down so this

1597
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,079
fascinating idea and i think the way we

1598
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,240
were thinking about this was

1599
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,640
if we are going down the direction of

1600
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,760
when goals are merged do we have a

1601
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,359
bonus for

1602
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,440
convergence right where does that bonus

1603
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,280
come from so i think one way of thinking

1604
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,520
about this would be that that is the

1605
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,440
leader's job the leader's job is to

1606
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,599
change the weightage that each member

1607
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,480
gives

1608
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,839
to you know pursuing a common goal so

1609
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,400
if left to my own devices just you know

1610
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,400
carrying the previous example i might be

1611
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,559
very strongly focused on my individual

1612
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,559
goal that is not shared with it but if

1613
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,480
we have a leader amongst ourselves the

1614
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,000
leader is changing my the way i weight

1615
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,160
these different uh goals in my

1616
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,079
perspective and if they're able to

1617
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,160
convince me that the common goal would

1618
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,400
be a better outcome for you so like

1619
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,720
in in my type of theorization i would

1620
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,440
say oh negotiation and goal alignment so

1621
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,960
that would be that we are talking and we

1622
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,920
are saying that all right let me

1623
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,680
understand what are you after are you

1624
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,040
looking for status are you looking for

1625
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,480
exciting job opportunities are you

1626
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,440
looking for uh you know more higher pay

1627
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,520
let me understand what your underlying

1628
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,520
desires and motivations are and let me

1629
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,200
try to get them

1630
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,599
closer to what the common goal is like

1631
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,359
by your pursuing the common goal you

1632
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,760
will get x and that motivates you and

1633
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,680
you know from from like a very modelling

1634
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,280
perspective it changes the weightage

1635
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,440
that you assign to

1636
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,760
common goals and that kind of individual

1637
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,599
interactions

1638
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,280
i would not say that it doesn't have to

1639
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,280
be a single leader it could all be

1640
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,960
decentralized that people are helping

1641
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,119
each other understand why you know

1642
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,799
following the common goal is better for

1643
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,559
each one of them that is a discovery

1644
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,040
process in that sense it is you know

1645
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,680
very directly looped that once a

1646
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,839
collective starts forming or once

1647
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,240
consensus start forming it becomes

1648
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,000
easier and easier or more more

1649
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,839
profitable for other individuals to join

1650
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,599
into you know the group goal because

1651
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,839
there is very highly high chance of the

1652
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,480
success or some other resources that you

1653
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,079
know you get as a payout like those

1654
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,920
kinds of directions we can think about

1655
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,000
doing again none of this is done in this

1656
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,480
model it's a fairly simplistic model to

1657
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,839
talk about

1658
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,000
let's think about social environment how

1659
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,640
do you go how do you bootstrap from aif

1660
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,799
in a physical environment to what do the

1661
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,440
agents do such that it looks like at the

1662
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,680
high level it is aif it is not at this

1663
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,280
point but minimum cognitive

1664
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,280
architectures

1665
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,920
can i ask you for power yeah yeah

1666
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,280
um so

1667
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,520
right like in the global system that's

1668
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,359
not an active inference agent but like

1669
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,040
each individual agent is an active

1670
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,359
inference agent and then they form this

1671
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,799
like dyad so is the dyad like this meso

1672
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,040
at this meso level is the dyad an active

1673
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,860
inference agent also or no

1674
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,440
[Music]

1675
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,040
i think uh raphael feel free to

1676
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,559
you know

1677
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,960
disagree with me i don't think it is an

1678
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,960
active inference agent at the diet level

1679
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,440
because there is no

1680
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,680
uh

1681
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,040
there is no changes that are happening

1682
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,160
in how i infer about my goal states

1683
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,319
or how i like the only thing that is

1684
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,760
happening is

1685
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,280
now i have a secondary source of

1686
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,760
information so in the dyad up until now

1687
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,839
i my only source of information was the

1688
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,599
physical environment if i was low

1689
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,520
skilled like i think when

1690
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,960
raphael was presenting like the orange

1691
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,599
language the low skill low skill person

1692
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,760
they had very little

1693
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,160
uh they had a very low ability to

1694
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,079
understand where they are in where they

1695
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,000
are or are

1696
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,680
in that environment and hence they were

1697
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,599
not very successful in achieving their

1698
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:02,559
goals

1699
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,079
most of the time but the high skilled

1700
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,920
the blue line which you know came down

1701
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,400
really quickly uh

1702
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,400
had a very accurate understanding of

1703
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,079
where they are on the map so they could

1704
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:13,839
quickly traverse to their goal

1705
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,680
the thing that changed was by having

1706
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,559
high social perceptiveness now i have

1707
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,480
a secondary source of information about

1708
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,480
the environment my primary skill is gone

1709
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,640
like i cannot infer from you know the

1710
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,400
chemicals but i can infer from my

1711
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,559
partner's behavior so in that sense

1712
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,400
there is additional information that is

1713
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,280
helping the individual agent be a better

1714
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,319
aif

1715
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,319
right because now they have a source of

1716
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:37,760
location of information that they can

1717
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,760
trust and you know build accurately on

1718
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,359
that said

1719
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:42,720
that source of information is not

1720
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,480
changing their own

1721
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,400
weighting of their goals and that's why

1722
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,040
there's no top down like there is no uh

1723
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,559
as a collective we are not trying to

1724
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,640
influence each other we are only taking

1725
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,319
independent decisions

1726
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,319
now assisted by a social environment

1727
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:59,599
also and that that much is enough to see

1728
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,240
collective uh outcomes emerge but if you

1729
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,000
are looking for more complex scenarios

1730
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,960
in which you are supposed to make a

1731
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,880
decision of should we you know break

1732
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,520
down across multiple tasks or what how

1733
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,440
many of these people should do task a

1734
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,680
and do task b or understand who is good

1735
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,119
at what those kinds of things will

1736
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,440
require more sophisticated machinery

1737
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,400
so it is i would not say it is a

1738
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,119
proper af

1739
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,839
well that to that i would add my counter

1740
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,640
find that uh if you define a proper af

1741
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,480
model as just any markup blanket then

1742
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,720
yes the dyads are

1743
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,559
are um

1744
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,640
markup blankets composed of the

1745
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,240
where the internal states are the union

1746
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,280
of the two agents and uh

1747
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,440
yeah even the even the bigger collective

1748
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,319
is just a very boring uh

1749
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,440
agent

1750
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,680
right the collective is an af agent it

1751
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,240
has its uh its inputs and it has its

1752
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,760
active state which is the null state

1753
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,359
right but

1754
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:00,400
you know proper there mean is it useful

1755
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,319
to think of it of that of it in those

1756
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,799
terms i guess it it depends right we

1757
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:05,839
want to

1758
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,359
we wanted to learn some salient facts

1759
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,440
about the collective we didn't quite ask

1760
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,680
that many questions about the diet as a

1761
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,960
as its own unit but we could

1762
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,880
so in the diet formation did you guys

1763
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,640
play with like i know that you did the

1764
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,359
strong and the weak and you had like the

1765
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,760
strong one had strong environmental

1766
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,680
preferences and you had some parameters

1767
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,359
that you played with like and and the

1768
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,200
weak agent didn't have any like was

1769
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,720
really stupid about the environment but

1770
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,720
like could lock on to the partner and

1771
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,880
infer based on the partner so did you

1772
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,960
ever play with parameters like

1773
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,839
what if you make one agent um

1774
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,000
you know weak in both and one agent

1775
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,400
strong in both or or what what happens

1776
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,079
like did you mess around with those at

1777
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,280
all is it like

1778
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,039
the scale of it like as you were tuning

1779
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,079
to get like what was just right for you

1780
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:52,880
uh

1781
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,559
yes i think we're not can go into a lot

1782
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,839
of detail on that uh we did learn one

1783
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,839
thing very interesting which is uh you

1784
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:00,960
could very easily replicate the

1785
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,880
phenomenon of the blind

1786
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,960
the blind leading the blind

1787
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,440
where uh and we turned out it turned out

1788
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,599
that if uh

1789
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,280
if the strong agents was

1790
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,079
also very socially perspective it was

1791
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,480
very easy for that agent to lock into

1792
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,440
the partners behavior and

1793
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,599
try to learn trying to try to infer more

1794
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,839
than was actually

1795
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:27,680
uh actually legitimate from from what

1796
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,960
the the partner was doing which was a

1797
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,000
sports almost brownie in motion and that

1798
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:32,960
actually you know

1799
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,799
it can throw a poor agent into a

1800
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,039
tailspin so

1801
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,680
uh it is it is when you start looking at

1802
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,119
these uh

1803
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,480
at these

1804
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,200
more like as i said less less rule

1805
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,880
following behaviors

1806
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,920
they are pretty sensitive to to

1807
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,240
to kind of this balance of parameters

1808
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,880
well that is exactly it i think

1809
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,000
a fantastic question blue uh and rafael

1810
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,599
has captured the essence of it is

1811
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,599
there is a combination so like we had

1812
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:07,359
the entire like i was doing robustness

1813
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,039
things and like there's an entire space

1814
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:09,839
of

1815
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,280
what are the different combinations and

1816
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,119
how do they pan out the most striking

1817
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,559
example was

1818
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,640
when the strong agent has a very strong

1819
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,359
social perceptiveness also uh

1820
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,960
they even if they've achieved their

1821
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,559
target they start to move away from that

1822
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,160
because they're you know trying to get

1823
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,000
something they're getting confused about

1824
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
their own state because they think that

1825
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,359
the other member is still trying to move

1826
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:30,880
towards their goal state so either there

1827
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,760
must be some other goal state or like

1828
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,760
this is me putting explanation on top of

1829
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,440
the behavior that we saw so like we did

1830
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,839
not see a stabilization coming up now

1831
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,520
what this tells us it tells us a very

1832
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,920
important thing that

1833
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,079
our model is not complete at all right

1834
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,839
it simply says that you need these two

1835
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,680
features but these two features are not

1836
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,839
enough to see a fairly sophisticated

1837
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:54,079
version of collective behavior in which

1838
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,000
there is uh

1839
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,319
error correction at that level and and

1840
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,079
from my perspective again and i know

1841
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:02,160
that uh raphael and i uh you know have

1842
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,599
been going at understanding active

1843
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,200
inference and how we define it and

1844
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,760
that's why i come out on the side of the

1845
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,000
collective is not completely an active

1846
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,319
insurance model yet because it does not

1847
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,640
have error correction uh and how do we

1848
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,400
get there like there is more who wants

1849
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,400
to be built into that

1850
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,280
uh

1851
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,039
how is it different from if you have

1852
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:21,920
both

1853
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,240
all the agents in your team are very

1854
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,039
good in their physical environment

1855
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:27,839
so

1856
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,760
so that's like having an all-star team

1857
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,680
we know sometimes all all-star teams

1858
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,480
fail

1859
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,480
can we you know bring up that kind of

1860
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,480
that niche of behavior now all of these

1861
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,480
questions are unanswered and extremely

1862
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,559
exciting you know important areas to go

1863
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,640
into uh but

1864
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,319
all of that and that's what you know i

1865
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,079
come down and we started with norms and

1866
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,280
we thought that we should have this and

1867
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,119
we should have that but we boil down to

1868
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,400
okay what is the minimum thing that we

1869
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,400
need to say without this nothing works

1870
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,240
so the collective does not emerge even

1871
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:54,960
in

1872
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,280
minimal circumstances without these two

1873
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,400
features

1874
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,880
uh in play

1875
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,280
if i could give one comment on that and

1876
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,720
it's such an interesting tension that

1877
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,559
your two answers brought out where if

1878
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,559
the system is designed as an active

1879
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,359
inference agent it's a no-brainer yes it

1880
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:14,079
is and then this debate which we've seen

1881
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,280
play out

1882
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,039
you know increasingly across so many

1883
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:19,039
different areas okay it's a system that

1884
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,200
wasn't explicitly designed as an active

1885
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
inference agent whether it directly

1886
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,960
computationally emerges from a designed

1887
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,640
agent or whether it's

1888
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,480
a performer on a stage or some other

1889
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,640
social system of governance and then

1890
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,559
there's the realism question is it

1891
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,119
actually quote an active inference agent

1892
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,599
versus the instrumentalism question can

1893
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,039
we use this framework statistically to

1894
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:42,400
do inference

1895
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,319
and just like the distribution doesn't

1896
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,880
have to be perfectly normal in nature

1897
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,680
for the use of a t-test there's ways to

1898
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,319
use active inference very usefully so

1899
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,160
it's so cool to see like a sandbox for

1900
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,000
exploring some of these fundamental

1901
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,160
questions about collective behavior

1902
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,720
which often times it feels like every

1903
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,559
single species or every system they have

1904
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,400
their own programming language or they

1905
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,480
have their own norms or the edges are

1906
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,400
transient so they go down

1907
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,920
the rabbit hole with the math that way

1908
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,400
instead of stable edges

1909
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,599
so what's the framework that's going to

1910
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,280
have the flexibility to actually cross

1911
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,399
these different

1912
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,000
bridges within the collective

1913
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,399
intelligence or collective behavior area

1914
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,560
so it's an awesome good question

1915
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,719
and i think that it goes to the heart of

1916
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,158
like local

1917
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,560
i don't know if you guys haven't read um

1918
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,719
the three body problem where they have

1919
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,839
uh you know uh spoiler alerts there's uh

1920
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,479
an alien alien species and you know

1921
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,279
they're

1922
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,880
uh they have this big computer that's

1923
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,198
made up of soldiers with flags

1924
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:43,279
uh you know

1925
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,120
the soldiers with flags make up a

1926
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,799
computer that's by definition it's a

1927
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:48,479
computer because it was designed you

1928
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,080
know they're they're following rules

1929
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,359
that that caused it to to compute

1930
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,319
uh certain functions right and you know

1931
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,560
that's that's how we design computers

1932
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,439
now

1933
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,279
there may be

1934
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,759
uh certain you know turing machines that

1935
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,799
emerge that are that are uh

1936
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,719
that we can even sometimes even prove

1937
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,719
that they are uh universal sewing

1938
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:11,839
machines

1939
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:14,238
and that's pretty awesome right and you

1940
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,080
know that's another way of saying that

1941
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,359
they are computers and i think there's

1942
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,238
the same uh same sort of uh question

1943
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,319
going on here with uh with active

1944
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,319
inference where

1945
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,880
you know is it a markup blanket yeah you

1946
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,399
can

1947
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,439
and draw the the the lines around it

1948
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,880
it's a mark of blanket is it's

1949
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,839
um

1950
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,000
to what extent it's

1951
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,520
performing free energy minimization

1952
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,439
depends on how you define the generative

1953
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,839
density how you define the the

1954
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:46,479
the the

1955
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,399
internal state so you can calculate the

1956
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,238
free energy functional and

1957
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:51,279
and

1958
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,839
and yada yada and the

1959
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,280
proof is inputting right when you look

1960
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,800
at it does it like does it actually look

1961
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,480
like it's optimizing that that free

1962
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,159
energy function sometimes the answer to

1963
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,199
that is

1964
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,199
really hard to get or only feasible to

1965
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,800
get if you make some pretty uh

1966
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
aggressive assumptions as you're saying

1967
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,159
about uh mean field um

1968
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,640
and so on so it's

1969
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,080
it's at the heart there's uh there's an

1970
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,840
epistemological presence

1971
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,360
and almost an ontological one

1972
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,360
i'm going to ask a question from the

1973
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,120
chat this is from

1974
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,159
dean

1975
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,280
who wrote

1976
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,480
is there a difference between a

1977
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,400
self-actualization loop and what might

1978
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,000
be described as a sense of

1979
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,440
self-awareness

1980
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,280
and what is the pursuit of shared goals

1981
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,840
dependent on if common interpretation

1982
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,080
and translation such as symbolic

1983
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,080
manipulation is not generating a common

1984
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,120
context thank you

1985
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,280
that's an awesome question i don't

1986
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,440
pretend to have any answers to it i'll

1987
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,520
give you my uh

1988
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,520
sort of opinion i'd also love to hear

1989
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,600
from the others uh i think um my mental

1990
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,719
model of this is hey uh these agents are

1991
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,960
reasonable they only have

1992
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,320
to the extent that you can say that they

1993
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,960
have uh beliefs or opinions about

1994
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,960
anything they have beliefs or opinions

1995
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,000
about two things right their their uh

1996
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,480
their own position and their

1997
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,560
their partner's position

1998
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,520
so

1999
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,560
they

2000
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,280
in particular they don't have and these

2001
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,199
are literally just uh

2002
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,000
uh numbers from 1 to 16 right so there's

2003
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,159
two probability distributions

2004
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,080
in particular they don't have anything

2005
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,600
that we could

2006
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,520
associate with

2007
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,440
the self as a concept

2008
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,440
right because they're only looking at

2009
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,400
two positions right now i think there's

2010
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,440
uh

2011
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,120
definitely uh

2012
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,360
it's it's not trivial to say well what

2013
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,080
is uh does self-awareness mean a

2014
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,560
symbolic sense of self or is it just the

2015
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,280
the

2016
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,840
epic phenomenon of having

2017
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,159
beliefs about some aspect of itself

2018
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,199
right

2019
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,679
i'm not qualified to judge that but in

2020
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,159
my opinion what the agent has

2021
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,199
is

2022
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:08,000
just information about a specific aspect

2023
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,280
of itself

2024
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,239
and

2025
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,360
it feels like without the symbolic

2026
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,520
without like having a sort of more

2027
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,840
sophisticated causal model that has

2028
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,840
opinions about this opinions about that

2029
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,360
and opinions about how these other

2030
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,360
things can act and one of those things

2031
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,040
is the self which is representing is

2032
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,840
like a pointer to pointer to self

2033
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,120
i don't think that qualifies itself

2034
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,519
awareness

2035
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,760
awesome these are fun discussions blue

2036
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,199
daniel you needed

2037
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,640
oh it was on the stream but not agency

2038
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,880
so blue oh

2039
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,880
um i will uh

2040
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,719
follow up to that question actually so

2041
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,600
you have like this

2042
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,199
self-actualizing loop with the agent and

2043
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,880
then you have this like other act

2044
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,719
actualizing loop right and i kind of

2045
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,080
looked at it like your maybe your

2046
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,640
self-actualizing loop is like your iq

2047
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,400
and your other actualizing loop is like

2048
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,600
your eq maybe like or or either way um

2049
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,280
but but what i really thought about is

2050
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,960
like you know we are by nature like such

2051
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,000
incredibly selfish creatures and so like

2052
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,320
it seems that you like maybe gave equal

2053
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,840
weight in the model like can you maybe

2054
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,199
dig into like

2055
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,960
because in in reality we don't give

2056
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,880
equal weight like we would give the self

2057
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,640
loop way more priority than the other

2058
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,520
loop

2059
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,960
and was that a parameter that you played

2060
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,199
with

2061
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,600
yes like i have a lot more to say but

2062
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,080
like rough i'll go first and then

2063
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,120
that is yes

2064
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,040
but if i go ahead please yeah no no i'm

2065
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,239
just going to say yes i think the the

2066
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:39,360
the

2067
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,120
primary question that we were looking at

2068
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,280
when we think about the these these

2069
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,719
loops

2070
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,239
if if you think about the

2071
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:49,679
um

2072
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,480
just the basic function of

2073
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,719
of taking some input

2074
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:55,840
from the

2075
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,560
from the environment forming some uh

2076
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,320
some

2077
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,920
belief states that are just just really

2078
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,239
like a collection of

2079
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,480
of numbers and then uh

2080
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,000
and then acting on it

2081
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,159
uh that can represent pretty much

2082
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,840
anything that's what we

2083
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,520
were when we talk about a partner

2084
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,880
actualization loop you can really just

2085
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,480
think of it as two copies of the same

2086
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,560
circuit one of them is

2087
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,840
is

2088
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:22,719
uh

2089
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,239
wired

2090
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:27,440
wired out into my own actions

2091
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,840
and the other one is not

2092
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,440
right so

2093
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,679
the one that's wired out of my own

2094
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:34,880
actions is the cell phone

2095
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,880
self-actualization group just by virtue

2096
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,280
of the fact that it's completing the the

2097
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,880
it's the thing that's completing the the

2098
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:45,120
markup blanket uh the the other one is

2099
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,679
is wired out into nothing so it's just

2100
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,560
generating predictions about my my

2101
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,320
my partner's behaviors

2102
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,840
but it's it has the same formal

2103
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,760
structure internally to the

2104
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,320
internally to the agent uh

2105
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,320
now i think the the part where it gets

2106
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,239
interesting is that uh consistency

2107
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:05,040
requirement where we uh

2108
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,040
uh we're talking about

2109
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,880
like we have uh we have beliefs about

2110
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,880
the about the

2111
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,199
[Music]

2112
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:14,400
the other and as as the

2113
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,760
predictions are that we're generating

2114
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,600
about their actions are related to those

2115
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,440
beliefs but i think what we're asking is

2116
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,520
really about uh what matters most to me

2117
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,600
right is it about

2118
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,600
uh am i paying more attention to my

2119
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,280
actions and my goals or to to my

2120
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,679
partner's actions and to

2121
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,440
and to their goals right so i think what

2122
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,840
the definition of matters

2123
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,760
is really about what's influencing my

2124
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,040
actions

2125
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,960
that is primarily about my beliefs but

2126
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,640
they are informed about my beliefs of

2127
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,159
it's primarily about my beliefs of my

2128
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,280
position but they're also informed by by

2129
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,800
my beliefs about my partner's position

2130
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,640
which is that process of triangulation

2131
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,080
that we talked about and that's the

2132
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,760
parameter the theory of my parameter

2133
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:54,560
that we

2134
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,440
were

2135
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,040
we're squeezing out so

2136
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,840
it is of course uh

2137
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,760
you know it's very simplified but in

2138
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,280
principle that's uh that's a range that

2139
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,280
can go anywhere

2140
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,960
i think we did play around even with uh

2141
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,800
with having some uh

2142
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,840
some

2143
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,280
anti-social behavior uh programmed in uh

2144
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,280
and you know

2145
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,120
limited amount of interpretability

2146
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,120
yeah i think uh blue very insightful

2147
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,000
question again and uh

2148
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,679
like i think we were also thinking about

2149
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,840
as the self as being

2150
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,159
iq because it is individual skill and

2151
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,159
the partner actualization group being

2152
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,000
more social intelligence because it is

2153
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,440
about understanding the other person's

2154
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,640
interaction

2155
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,679
we sidestep that problem of

2156
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,440
how do you weight one over the other by

2157
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,600
choosing uh

2158
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,199
you know the space

2159
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,040
and again like i think this maps on very

2160
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,120
well with your previous question that oh

2161
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,679
what happens if both of them like if uh

2162
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:54,080
an agent is good at both right we see

2163
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,480
blind leading the blind which means that

2164
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,719
as soon as you see that diversity in

2165
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,480
agents that can be really good at both

2166
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,400
or really bad at both you'll need some

2167
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,640
form of weighting mechanism that to what

2168
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,600
extent do i value information that i

2169
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,400
have

2170
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,440
received from my primary skill versus

2171
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,880
i value information that i've received

2172
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,040
from my social environment and by social

2173
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,800
environment now as you can imagine if

2174
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,440
you have more than one partner you'll

2175
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,440
get you will also get conflict

2176
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,800
information because the partners might

2177
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,640
be moving differently because they are

2178
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,600
differently able right so at that time

2179
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,560
we cannot sidestep the question of how

2180
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,480
do i weight the social information

2181
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,239
coming in from different partners so

2182
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:37,360
there has to be a trust or a credibility

2183
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,360
index that i have to maintain internally

2184
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,239
so this is very close to uh

2185
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:43,920
concepts like a transactive memory

2186
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,320
system in management literature right

2187
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,320
where we are trying to set up that oh i

2188
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,840
know that uh raphael is an expert at

2189
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,199
skill a

2190
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,600
and that's a credible source so even if

2191
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,080
i find a new team member who is equally

2192
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,360
skilled at uh you know uh the same skill

2193
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,080
okay i would more like i'm more likely

2194
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,920
to go to rafael for help when i need it

2195
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,520
because he has credibility he has some

2196
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,600
history so there is an index that i

2197
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,679
maintain internally a meta memory of

2198
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,840
mapping of who has what skills and how

2199
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,080
credible they are so like you cannot

2200
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,920
sidestep that question as we start

2201
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,800
building

2202
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,719
and working towards bigger collectives

2203
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,040
right so you are spot on with that and

2204
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,560
that will start to happen even at the

2205
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,199
simplistic level of this discrepancy can

2206
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:29,600
be created between my primary uh

2207
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,040
information source and my social

2208
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,400
information source

2209
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,760
we did not

2210
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,840
like as like we

2211
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,199
played around with oh let's give it

2212
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,120
antisocial like they always think that

2213
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,280
their physical thing is better

2214
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,760
this led us to having conversation like

2215
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,199
do they have meta memory which is like

2216
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,360
do they have self awareness that they

2217
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,960
are low skilled in the physical

2218
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,199
environment as compared to their partner

2219
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,040
right so this all started building more

2220
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,120
complex things like in my other stream

2221
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,640
of research i built those kinds of

2222
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,719
agent-based models which are social

2223
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,320
cognitive architectures that you give

2224
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,320
them a memory they give them a meta

2225
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,000
memory you give them meta attention you

2226
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,480
give them a reasoning a way to map who

2227
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,640
is working before how much do i trust

2228
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,840
them so like and that's where these

2229
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,840
ideas were flowing in from that all that

2230
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,760
complexity we cannot sidestep that

2231
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,400
complexity if we want to build

2232
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,199
you know that sophisticated behavior

2233
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:20,480
that was not the goal of the paper and

2234
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,239
that's why we didn't like we just

2235
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,760
removed all that like we just

2236
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,600
sidestepped that complexity by saying

2237
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,600
let's look at what is the minimum gains

2238
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,400
that can be had by doing x or y

2239
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,159
but the next step really if you are

2240
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,159
trying to build a more sophisticated

2241
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,239
behavior outcomes right not just

2242
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,159
minimizing system level free energy

2243
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:41,280
would be to poke in that direction

2244
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,120
so brilliant question like i'm like this

2245
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,040
is actively of how we've been thinking

2246
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,040
and you know making the

2247
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,360
model more complex and then simplifying

2248
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,280
this is the exact tension and

2249
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,800
interesting insights that you would get

2250
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,520
there so very happy to uh you know if

2251
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,600
you have more ideas on oh this would be

2252
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,280
something that would be nice to pursue

2253
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,600
i'm all yours

2254
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,840
you know one one thought that that

2255
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,400
brought to mind was when there's just a

2256
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,159
differential equation model like some

2257
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,600
kind of smooth line that's going to be

2258
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,080
generated the model can't really fail

2259
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,760
like you could fail to read in your data

2260
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,360
set but it's not like the line's ever

2261
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,639
going to break so

2262
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,320
then people are wondering about how well

2263
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,760
does it fit and they kind of focus on

2264
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,199
the performance and then with

2265
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,159
agent-based modeling it's always

2266
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,840
understood that there's actually only a

2267
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,000
few islands of parameters and of course

2268
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,280
the choice of which parameters to

2269
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,480
include

2270
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,320
from which effective collective behavior

2271
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,400
is going to arise like it's not just

2272
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,400
enough to be an ant forager not every

2273
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,080
foraging strategy works and the one that

2274
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,520
works in the desert is not gonna work in

2275
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,679
the jungle so it's actually just these

2276
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:43,280
islands of stability and then you bring

2277
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,719
up all these questions like well what's

2278
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,639
the resilience of it to being

2279
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,800
perturbed those are the the kinds of

2280
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,840
questions that we care about with the

2281
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,159
real world systems and it's almost like

2282
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,400
the affordance from a scientific and a

2283
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,560
modeling communication perspective of

2284
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,760
having

2285
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,280
a modeling approach like linear

2286
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,120
regression that pretty much accepts any

2287
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,480
kind of data set without really

2288
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,960
questioning it it leads to different

2289
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,159
questions that are being asked and it

2290
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:07,920
leads to different uses of the model so

2291
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,840
it's just so cool that those kinds of

2292
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,360
questions are arising and i'm sure they

2293
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,360
come up in interesting ways in your own

2294
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,639
research so

2295
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,400
we'll keep on yeah

2296
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,480
yeah this is super exciting because uh

2297
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,719
that's the direction that uh

2298
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,600
sorry did i speak over you raphael

2299
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,280
no no so this is

2300
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,520
clearly as it has been communicated this

2301
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,120
is super exciting to me because i think

2302
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,440
uh a big question that we've not asked

2303
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,280
yet is what is the goal of this kind of

2304
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,800
a modelling like there's one way to look

2305
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
at active inference can do x y z like

2306
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,800
from my perspective the goal is okay how

2307
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,719
can we have these social cognitive

2308
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:42,159
models and active inference models go

2309
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,600
hand in hand so that we understand

2310
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,840
something about real teams and real

2311
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,320
teams have you know as you know you

2312
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,600
really elegantly put they have

2313
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,199
non-linear behaviors they have islands

2314
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,800
of places where they'll behave in a

2315
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,480
structured manner and suddenly it breaks

2316
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,080
because one parameter moved out of that

2317
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,120
island

2318
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,040
to be able to get there we need some

2319
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,360
minimal machinery so i think that is the

2320
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,000
space where i live in when we uh you

2321
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,120
know

2322
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,519
with anita and with chris riedel uh

2323
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,719
and i think i've not worked directly

2324
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,320
with david angle but like anita has

2325
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,840
pre-work with like that is the direction

2326
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,440
that we are pushing in in that space is

2327
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,679
like oh let's find this island of area

2328
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:19,040
where if

2329
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,520
meta tension and meta meta memory is you

2330
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,480
know

2331
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,520
reasonably developed or there's

2332
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,600
diversity within the team how does that

2333
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,679
where are the stable coordination zones

2334
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,440
there right right so that is one way but

2335
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,440
in aif at this point we did not even

2336
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,360
have the minimal machinery that i think

2337
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,880
we could understand and interpret so we

2338
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,800
started like what's the first building

2339
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,080
block that we need to build and

2340
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,760
the confession is i don't think i

2341
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,639
completely understand aif rules i think

2342
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,639
they're fluid like how do you define an

2343
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,639
aif like raphael was bringing up if it

2344
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,719
is only a mark of market then yes it is

2345
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:52,320
if it is this then it is that so this

2346
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,840
could be my shortcoming because i'm not

2347
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,360
red enough or it could be the field is

2348
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,679
actually really updating itself so so

2349
01:22:57,679 --> 01:22:59,360
this is that's why this is exciting like

2350
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,280
let's build that but for me my eye is

2351
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,679
always on the like how do we

2352
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,679
pull it out into is this applicable like

2353
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,440
we don't want only equations that can

2354
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,800
never be

2355
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,920
wrong

2356
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:10,960
in a matter of time you don't get

2357
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,440
non-linear dynamics out of it directly

2358
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,400
sorry yeah awesome thank you

2359
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,679
yeah and then

2360
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:18,560
100

2361
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,880
agree and i think this uh

2362
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,719
perhaps you you eluded that and i want

2363
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:23,679
to pull it

2364
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,760
uh pull it up it's

2365
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,440
it's really about the

2366
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:31,199
the scientific endeavor as a collective

2367
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,639
active inference

2368
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:35,440
uh behavior right if you think about how

2369
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,040
uh

2370
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,120
how scientific

2371
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,480
modeling in the in the

2372
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,159
kind of linear

2373
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:45,679
paradigm

2374
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:48,960
works it's about you know establishing

2375
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,280
uh universal truths that are not

2376
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,800
contingent

2377
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,320
uh you know that

2378
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,040
are you know contingent only on uh on a

2379
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:57,920
very

2380
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,400
uh

2381
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,920
very specific very explicit set of of

2382
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,679
assumptions that are knowable

2383
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,920
and

2384
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,400
within that you know you pull it out

2385
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,560
uh you can explain it to an alien or you

2386
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,440
can

2387
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,040
pull it out and

2388
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,800
write it into stone tablets and the next

2389
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,600
civilization can read it and and so on

2390
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,960
right and that's that's not what we're

2391
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,400
doing here right i think we're feeling

2392
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,600
our way as a as a collective towards a

2393
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,639
more useful more um

2394
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,800
more

2395
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,600
interesting and applicable way to to

2396
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,120
understand the real systems that are

2397
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,760
around us and then to

2398
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,159
maybe to learn something to help them

2399
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,639
function better so that's that's

2400
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,360
probably working at it

2401
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,440
um i'll ask a quick question from the

2402
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,880
chat because i think it applies and then

2403
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:49,760
blue

2404
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,480
so dean wrote where would the authors

2405
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,719
see citizen learning organizational

2406
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,080
structures

2407
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,920
blind leading the blind or basic

2408
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,840
research at scale

2409
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,639
no it's not a buzzfeed article from 2027

2410
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:06,159
it might be maybe you're seeing a

2411
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:09,120
glimpse of the future

2412
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,920
i don't know enough to answer brandon

2413
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:14,960
you guys want to take a step

2414
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,280
but now if you're muted yeah then

2415
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,120
sorry yeah i was just responding to

2416
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,040
dean's comment it's a such an insightful

2417
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,560
comment there's like one hopes that this

2418
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,280
basically scale it is it it is like it

2419
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,880
brings up the

2420
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,639
uh thought experiment that will

2421
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,480
democracy thrive if

2422
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,800
uh you don't have independent thinkers

2423
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,639
right like so if it is blind reading the

2424
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,080
blind that nobody is actually thinking

2425
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,920
everybody is just based on secondary

2426
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,560
information then it would look one way

2427
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,159
and it would be the same

2428
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,320
at the aif level it's the same behavior

2429
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,920
or it is independently thinking and

2430
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,159
basic research at scale and you get

2431
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,760
completely different outcomes in both

2432
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:52,880
cases so like

2433
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,719
i i don't think i have good answers

2434
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:56,639
there but i think

2435
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,280
very very legitimate question uh

2436
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,360
something that we can figure out i think

2437
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,520
that's that's model that's modelling

2438
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,760
and it relates to the discussion earlier

2439
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,600
about convergent collective behaviors

2440
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,920
versus divergent so whether it's like

2441
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,159
honeybees deciding on where to relocate

2442
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:14,320
or some other type of consensus protocol

2443
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,639
you want convergence but then you talked

2444
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:17,920
about an example where there was

2445
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,239
preference to be on separate niches

2446
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,080
and it's also important to have

2447
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,239
divergence like in discourse and in

2448
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:27,280
other areas and creativity so how to

2449
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,400
design that space is so critical

2450
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,880
i i think i think uh

2451
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,560
your spotlight but there is value in

2452
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,159
both of those see convergence is

2453
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,159
important to get the outcome like the

2454
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,480
bees have to decide on where to go

2455
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,639
finally but divergence is important to

2456
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:44,480
assess the accuracy of the information

2457
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,920
so to the extent

2458
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,159
uh or rather to explore the space right

2459
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:49,040
like

2460
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,120
accuracy and exploration of the space

2461
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,199
itself so to the extent it is blind

2462
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:54,639
leading the line i would say that is

2463
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,040
biased towards convergence

2464
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,159
which means

2465
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:01,360
the system is opening itself up to not

2466
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,920
settling on sub sub optimal outcomes uh

2467
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,760
because everybody agrees very quickly on

2468
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,679
what the solution should be uh lack of

2469
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,520
creativity that kind of thing if you are

2470
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:10,960
too divergent and you're not able to

2471
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,560
converge then

2472
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,000
the system is opening itself to not

2473
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,840
getting the rewards because nobody's

2474
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,920
agreeing on anything so you need both

2475
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,440
and that's what i think the independent

2476
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,679
research and the blind linear brand are

2477
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:23,120
fantastic things i don't think can

2478
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,239
resolve the issue unless there is

2479
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:27,440
uh

2480
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,440
one agent that is always understood to

2481
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,040
be they have the most accurate

2482
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,600
information always and the entire system

2483
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,280
understands that right like it could be

2484
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,360
like a small family universe's or

2485
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,840
whatever mom says is correct so all the

2486
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,360
children's are lined up because they are

2487
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,280
not trying to question they agree and

2488
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,520
trust that that is true and in that case

2489
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,480
convergence is great

2490
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:52,559
anyway

2491
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,159
um and actually to connect that to some

2492
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,239
of the analytical components of active

2493
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,760
inference in the free energy

2494
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,400
minimization there's one term that's

2495
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,199
often framed as pragmatic value and then

2496
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:06,960
the other one is the exploratory the

2497
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,120
epistemic component you know and

2498
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,560
accuracy minus complexity these

2499
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,239
different framings that we've seen and

2500
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:13,920
so it's so cool that you described the

2501
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,840
need to have a balance of the converging

2502
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,719
and the diverging collective algorithms

2503
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:20,719
not worrying about whether it is a

2504
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,480
formal active inference at the higher

2505
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,760
scale but just some of the same

2506
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,440
principles which is that you have to

2507
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,080
have some target seeking or signal

2508
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:29,199
detecting

2509
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,360
aspect and then some aspect that

2510
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,760
prevents at the very best premature

2511
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:34,960
convergence

2512
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,120
if not actually keeping options open to

2513
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,280
remain resilient so those are some of

2514
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,199
the the principles of collective systems

2515
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,040
that kind of go beyond even

2516
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,719
active inference alone and just it

2517
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,480
doesn't matter at that higher level

2518
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,560
exactly what it is and so really

2519
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,480
interesting stuff

2520
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:54,320
yeah so if you look in the literature uh

2521
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,080
in the management so you could look at

2522
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,800
mega and even corrective and uh

2523
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,000
complex adapter systems from holly arrow

2524
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,960
like they have a book on groups as

2525
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,760
complex adapter systems and like one of

2526
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,679
the key things that you know

2527
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,600
in in a separate line of research i

2528
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,920
build on that is there are two functions

2529
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,360
that any group has to do one is

2530
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,600
efficiency the other is maintenance the

2531
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,000
idea of efficiency is that the resource

2532
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,280
that you have you have to deploy very

2533
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,199
well and get the maximum out of it the

2534
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,440
idea of maintenance is that oh you need

2535
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,520
to choose the right goals so that the

2536
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,440
system can survive right because if

2537
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,800
you're very efficient but you're going

2538
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,560
after the low rewarding things then the

2539
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,239
system will not thrive

2540
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:35,920
on the other hand if you're choosing the

2541
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,679
right goals but your

2542
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,040
wasting away the resources and not

2543
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,480
applying them efficiently the system

2544
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,159
will not survive so those two things

2545
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,880
together are functions of any group or

2546
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,199
any collective so i think

2547
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:49,199
again like for me it's like they're

2548
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:50,960
looking at the same phenomena from two

2549
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,719
different sides one is coming from

2550
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,159
what's the mechanics of it how do we

2551
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,080
achieve that so you look at all the

2552
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,080
social social cognitive architecture

2553
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,679
collective memory collective attention

2554
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,239
collective reasoning the other is

2555
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,159
like does this look like an aif and can

2556
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,600
we model it mathematically without

2557
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,199
worrying about what exactly is the

2558
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,520
mechanism right so it can prove as a

2559
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,679
ground truth to

2560
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:13,920
this team has way more to achieve than

2561
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,000
it is currently achieving because an

2562
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,199
ideal aif model can be better performing

2563
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:20,480
right and you're missing something so

2564
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,320
there is some losses happening in the

2565
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,560
processes in the groups right it could

2566
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,920
be we're not understanding we're not

2567
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,920
choosing the right strategy or we are

2568
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,760
biased towards convergence whatever that

2569
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,960
is right like that's something to be

2570
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,880
diagnosed about the team and that

2571
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,159
therein lies a practical application

2572
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:35,679
like you have to figure out from here to

2573
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:38,960
here what could be you know going wrong

2574
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,800
so yeah all right

2575
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,480
the thing that i want to say

2576
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,800
i wanted to add that is

2577
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,080
if you look at gaia theory uh and if you

2578
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,679
shake it hard enough and it looks like a

2579
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,440
dynamical system and you're

2580
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:54,800
throwing the the uh ergodicity

2581
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,159
assumption

2582
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,560
yeah i know maybe from the

2583
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,000
from the whole

2584
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,600
whole system throughout it's like

2585
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,760
billions of billions of years uh time

2586
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,679
scale perspective and you can back out

2587
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:08,000
and say yeah it's a single it's a single

2588
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
active inference agent and therefore

2589
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,719
there is one you can back back it into

2590
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:17,040
like one big system goal for all time

2591
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,880
that is only ever visible in retrospect

2592
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,880
from uh from the perspective of like

2593
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,400
some of the the time keepers in the

2594
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,080
multiverse or whatever right uh we hear

2595
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,239
simple agents uh try to do our part

2596
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:32,880
don't have access to that and we have to

2597
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,000
do with more proximate goals right these

2598
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,760
are often going to be at odds these are

2599
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,239
often going to turn out to be wrong and

2600
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:41,120
there's

2601
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,080
there's

2602
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,239
always this tension between how you

2603
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:46,080
construct uh

2604
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,000
the goals are you constructing them for

2605
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,760
for exploitation or for

2606
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,880
for exploration at what at what level

2607
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,120
how can we can in turn internalize

2608
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,480
uh

2609
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,880
internalize the work of other

2610
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,520
uh systems around you to to get towards

2611
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:02,639
more of a

2612
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,480
uh more bang for the bug for everybody

2613
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,760
and so on uh but it's all it's it's all

2614
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,400
really imperfect and i think that's what

2615
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,040
the the question trying to finally tie

2616
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,760
it back to that question on

2617
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,040
on citizen learning it's you know

2618
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,040
from uh from a long run perspective

2619
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,120
probably it's

2620
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,600
to some definition it works out okay but

2621
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,159
what okay means and uh you know in the

2622
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:29,679
long term we're all dead

2623
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:30,880
it's uh

2624
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,960
the devil is definitely in the details

2625
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,880
on that one

2626
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,480
nice that reminds me a lot of bucky

2627
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,520
fuller and humans role as sensemaker

2628
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,000
locally and making it work for everybody

2629
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,520
so it's really cool to see that kind of

2630
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,960
come back to active inference through

2631
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,600
design science and other areas so blue

2632
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,239
so i have like a small technical

2633
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,159
question and i'm just gonna load it up

2634
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:57,120
followed by my big question so pranav i

2635
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,199
am curious about your like social

2636
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,960
science mapping and meta mapping and

2637
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,880
memory and meta memory just like how

2638
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,520
much compute power that takes like is it

2639
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,520
is it monstrous but then i'll i'll add

2640
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,080
another a couple couple more things so i

2641
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,520
have done a little bit of a

2642
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,040
agent-based modeling if you like need

2643
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,280
somebody to interrogate you over

2644
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,960
your model parameters i'm super good at

2645
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,000
that so

2646
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,560
i will harass you any time um and then

2647
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,719
uh the real question that i have is

2648
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:24,639
maybe because of the nature of

2649
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:27,360
agent-based modeling maybe it's

2650
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,440
you know you always have to define the

2651
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,280
parameters of the system

2652
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,840
and so we're looking to create a model

2653
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,679
where essentially the rules are broken

2654
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,520
right like when you make a collective

2655
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,679
the collective has broken the rules it's

2656
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:44,239
done what the individual agents it's not

2657
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:46,320
collective behavior it's something new

2658
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,920
right and so we don't know what that

2659
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,080
newness is going to be and so maybe

2660
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,080
agent-based modeling is is maybe the

2661
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,880
wrong tool like how do you allow in an

2662
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,320
agent-based model where you define all

2663
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,080
the parameters how do you allow for this

2664
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,840
like newness to emerge

2665
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,360
again blue fantastic question i'm so

2666
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,560
happy to

2667
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,920
keep listening to your questions they're

2668
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,520
just very insightful uh

2669
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:15,120
i i'm not sure if this is

2670
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,560
if i've understood the spirit of your

2671
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,840
question but i think based on what i

2672
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:20,239
understand i would say the use of agent

2673
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:22,080
based modeling

2674
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,480
is predicated on the goal that you have

2675
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,360
so

2676
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,719
then

2677
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:28,719
in a social science or sort of like

2678
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:31,440
social theory perspective uh

2679
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,679
we are building a transactive

2680
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:35,760
systems model of collective intelligence

2681
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,600
that is we are saying that collective

2682
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,400
intelligence emerges out of

2683
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,280
uh the formation and co-regulation of

2684
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,520
processes that involve collective memory

2685
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,880
collective attention and corrective

2686
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,800
reasoning so intelligence is an outcome

2687
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,320
of these three functions but these are

2688
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,400
not independent as in every person has

2689
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,760
that that is true but there is

2690
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,760
coordinated so collective memory which

2691
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,199
is called transactive memory in the

2692
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,600
literature emerges out of the skill

2693
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,440
based interactions that coordination

2694
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,040
that people do same thing with attention

2695
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,400
same thing so if we're building that

2696
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,679
kind of a model

2697
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,800
the role of an agent-based approach to

2698
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,719
this kind of theorizing

2699
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:12,480
is essentially

2700
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,960
to say that okay i have this fantastic

2701
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,360
narrative theory that people understand

2702
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,199
are aware of each other's skills meta

2703
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,760
memory right and they use that

2704
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,960
information

2705
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,320
to make

2706
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,400
allocation choices that is if i have a

2707
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,560
certain task and it requires help with x

2708
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,880
skill who do i go to or who do i assign

2709
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,119
this to in the team so like if that is

2710
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,719
the theory

2711
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:37,119
how do we know that this is enough this

2712
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,560
is parsimony so this is the idea of

2713
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,400
generative sufficiency right like are

2714
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,320
these minimal processes enough to

2715
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,199
explain the emergence of your collective

2716
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:48,080
memory right like will a flock emerge if

2717
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,320
each bird is each void is given these

2718
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,239
three rules right so

2719
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:53,920
and that kind of

2720
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,719
research question or you know building

2721
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:59,199
of that model is important to basically

2722
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,440
give some credence to these are the

2723
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,280
minimum social cognitive processes that

2724
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,880
are important to give you this outcome

2725
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,760
so we are not trying to code flocking we

2726
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,920
are only giving individuals certain

2727
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,760
capacities and the flock is emerging so

2728
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,600
that this is minimally enough now is

2729
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,440
that flock adaptive to

2730
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,760
uh let's say a predator approaching them

2731
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,760
maybe not because we've not told them

2732
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,840
how to react to a predator right so in

2733
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,520
that sense we now know there is a

2734
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,360
boundary condition that with only x

2735
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,080
rules it can you know handle high levels

2736
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,920
of workload but it cannot handle high

2737
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,360
levels of uncertainty like those kinds

2738
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,719
of things so

2739
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,639
computationally how difficult or how

2740
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,719
complex the thing depends on how many

2741
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,560
features you are trying to build into it

2742
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,239
the model that i've you know developed

2743
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,520
for my dissertation and i'm you know

2744
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,320
presenting uh as i'm going on the market

2745
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,000
uh is

2746
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,199
fundamentally saying that at the

2747
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,199
simplistic level give each individual

2748
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:50,159
agent

2749
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:52,960
three capacities of having skills and

2750
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,880
meta memory understanding you know my

2751
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,480
team members their skills

2752
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,719
having attention or focus like ability

2753
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:00,800
to work on something and understand how

2754
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,080
other people are working on different

2755
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,520
things so like what priority that is how

2756
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,840
important it is for them which leads to

2757
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,239
the meta reasoning which is i have

2758
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,159
selfish motivations and i know that

2759
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:11,280
other people also have selfish

2760
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:13,920
motivations but is the task

2761
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,199
aligned with you know each other

2762
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:17,119
motivation so i should send this task to

2763
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:18,800
somebody for whom this is already

2764
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,560
aligned so they'll get to it faster and

2765
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,080
that will benefit the team it's like

2766
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,159
none of this is a centralized

2767
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:25,679
uh here's the leader who knows

2768
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,000
everything and is making the allocations

2769
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,520
right this is not top down command

2770
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,000
control this is very decentralized how

2771
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,320
will an intelligence at the collective

2772
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,719
level emerge to the extent these members

2773
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,920
are able to figure these things out

2774
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,440
so that that's that's the building of

2775
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,360
the model that's you know headed towards

2776
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,040
that direction so i think what it

2777
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,080
becomes useful is

2778
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,000
under what circumstances the useful

2779
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,280
question to us is under what

2780
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,560
circumstances is meta reasoning or you

2781
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,960
know collective memory important so like

2782
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,239
this is the question that is very

2783
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,320
different from saying that or do we need

2784
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,679
this parameter or not and how

2785
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,520
computationally intensive it is

2786
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,360
the the answer lies in okay what's the

2787
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,960
environment what's the so like as you

2788
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,159
know daniel was pointing out there are

2789
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,920
islands of operation

2790
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,239
does this island in a phase space land

2791
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:13,840
in a place where these parameters are

2792
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,600
important or not so those are the kinds

2793
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,119
of questions you can answer with that

2794
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:18,800
and i think that would drive the choice

2795
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,639
of parameters i would not i would not

2796
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:22,960
try to say that or it should be a all

2797
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,239
encompassing model it should be the

2798
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,400
simplest model uh

2799
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,679
if anything i've tried to always say

2800
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:29,119
that we're trying to go to the simplest

2801
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,440
model that explains her part

2802
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,119
very clearly

2803
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:34,320
does that answer the question i i

2804
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,600
suspect it does not yeah so so um

2805
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,280
definitely like with flocking and like

2806
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,199
i've seen similar models of like fish

2807
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:45,119
schooling and and stuff like that um so

2808
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:46,080
we have

2809
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,520
that as a model

2810
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,639
of maybe collective behavior versus

2811
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:51,840
collective

2812
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,920
intelligence or like has something

2813
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,159
actually has something new

2814
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:58,880
emerged in the flock or in the school of

2815
01:38:58,880 --> 01:38:59,840
fish

2816
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,320
and so my my point is is that when you

2817
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,840
just give these agents their individual

2818
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,679
parameters how do you know when there's

2819
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:07,280
another level like we're looking for

2820
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,520
another level that does active inference

2821
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,840
so so not like a yes to collective

2822
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,119
intelligence you can even collective

2823
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:15,040
intelligence and collect behavior can be

2824
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,639
modeled with a group versus the

2825
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,360
individual agents but when do you have

2826
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,840
another level like in the hierarchy when

2827
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,440
do you when do your cells become a

2828
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,520
tissue when does your group of people

2829
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,320
become you know a squad or a team or

2830
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,760
something like this

2831
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,600
so that that's what i don't know if

2832
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,520
agent-based modeling is suited to to

2833
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,239
determine or not

2834
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,040
well that's a good question i think

2835
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,840
it depends on

2836
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,000
so it's partly a definitional issue

2837
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,920
what do you mean by another level right

2838
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,760
so intelligence the way it is defined at

2839
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,360
least in that literature collective

2840
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,840
intelligence is an ability to adapt to

2841
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:53,760
changing environments so as the task

2842
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,000
changes in its complexity that is

2843
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,480
uncertainty is changing or the level of

2844
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,080
knowledge interdependence or the level

2845
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,639
of workload is changing over time the

2846
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:04,719
team is able to seamlessly adapt its

2847
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,639
internal coordination processes to

2848
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:08,320
maintain performance so it is not just

2849
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,080
because the task has changed in its

2850
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,320
complexity so the environment is

2851
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:13,920
uh moving around just because the

2852
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,520
environment moved it should not be so

2853
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,360
specialized that it starts to fade it is

2854
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:19,679
able to adapt to it so if intelligence

2855
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:21,199
is defined that way

2856
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:24,000
to what extent can the you know the team

2857
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,840
regulate internally to maintain

2858
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,440
performance at the highest level

2859
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,679
possible then i would say yes it is

2860
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,239
emerging because the the diagram that

2861
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:33,760
you show right like essentially the plot

2862
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,760
that you show is a team that does not

2863
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,040
have these

2864
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,639
coordination mechanisms

2865
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,719
is failing like is dropping in

2866
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:42,239
performance

2867
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:44,400
anytime there is a perturbation while a

2868
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,639
team that has these mechanisms is like

2869
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:48,400
seeing a momentary dip but is able to

2870
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,920
maintain high levels of performance so

2871
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,840
it is it is a relative thing now if you

2872
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,080
change the composition the internal

2873
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,760
coordinations would be different because

2874
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,119
now it's a different set of people

2875
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:59,920
trying to coordinate but it would not

2876
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,080
invalidate the idea that a different set

2877
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,000
of people still have collective

2878
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,679
intelligence or not because it's given

2879
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,639
by given our internal resources how are

2880
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:10,239
we adapting to the changes like if

2881
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:12,080
you're able to track their so

2882
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,520
in that sense i think agent-based model

2883
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,280
does a fantastic job of showing you that

2884
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,639
we are able to see this emergent

2885
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,159
behavior of maintaining high level

2886
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:23,040
performance uh or not right and that's

2887
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,880
where you you go into the mechanisms

2888
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,639
that this mechanism is essential for

2889
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:28,560
this outcome versus not

2890
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,920
does that help

2891
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,440
it does it does but it's it's the

2892
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,199
question of at what scale is it an

2893
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:35,280
active inference agent right so like is

2894
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,360
the team the active inference agent or

2895
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,960
is it the each individuals is it like

2896
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,040
their collective active inference versus

2897
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,400
the team collective i can see daniel

2898
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,639
like oh wait i was just gonna say that

2899
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:46,159
yeah

2900
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:48,800
to speak to the question of novelty

2901
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,480
there's the question of generating

2902
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,400
novelty and then responding to novelty

2903
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,400
and in the case of generating novelty

2904
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,920
especially for humans we haven't really

2905
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:59,280
talked about stigma g niche modification

2906
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,199
cumulative culture so

2907
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,159
there's

2908
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:04,639
many avenues from collective behavior to

2909
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:06,960
more niche modifying algorithms that

2910
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,320
are

2911
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,600
maybe explaining some of the phenomena

2912
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,679
that we are interested in here but then

2913
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:13,040
this question about responding to

2914
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,960
novelty and like how do you deal with a

2915
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,320
threat that maybe hasn't been seen

2916
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,159
before or a failure mode that's never

2917
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:19,840
been observed or rare

2918
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,199
it kind of just reminded me of

2919
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:24,719
homeostasis which is generalizing across

2920
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,960
specific situations to help you keep

2921
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:29,040
target variables within a preferred

2922
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,000
range

2923
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,360
and then

2924
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:34,080
instead of just reacting to changes

2925
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,000
it makes one move towards anticipating

2926
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,400
which is the whole area of variously

2927
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,719
like cybernetics and signal processing

2928
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,800
and so those features of responding and

2929
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,360
anticipating and planning

2930
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,760
agent-based modeling is a great place to

2931
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,600
computationally and physically test that

2932
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,480
and

2933
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,480
clearly active inference at the very

2934
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,920
least can be

2935
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:56,400
sketched out over a lot of these systems

2936
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,800
and then it will be a debate always like

2937
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,320
about the details and the mechanisms

2938
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,480
like you brought up but it's just to

2939
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,960
have a framework that we can integrate

2940
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,280
scales and just nest them cleanly

2941
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:09,840
is at the very least a path towards

2942
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:12,000
answering some of these questions if not

2943
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,600
philosophically at least empirically

2944
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,400
raphael

2945
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,000
yeah

2946
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,360
thank you yeah and i think about the

2947
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,880
philosophical aspect also uh

2948
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,320
as

2949
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,560
backing down from

2950
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,080
unless you're looking at the gaia theory

2951
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,199
thing and you don't believe in such a

2952
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:32,800
thing as uh you know

2953
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,840
um

2954
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:34,560
the

2955
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,360
uh

2956
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,440
selection multiverse

2957
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,920
uh thing uh

2958
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:42,960
so if you back down to like subsystems

2959
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,960
of the big thing whatever the big thing

2960
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,239
is

2961
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,000
then you can back down into functions

2962
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,280
right and you can use that as your

2963
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,840
benchmark for for for what performance

2964
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,719
or success or intelligence uh looks like

2965
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:56,320
and deconstruct

2966
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,840
uh down

2967
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:58,719
and

2968
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:01,280
match that up with you get from from the

2969
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,400
from the

2970
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,480
bottoms up from the bottom of you and

2971
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,639
yeah i guess the the

2972
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:08,719
uh the interesting question is

2973
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:10,639
when and where does it actually

2974
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:13,600
do the the bottom up and the top down

2975
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,119
approach

2976
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:16,159
line up

2977
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:17,040
right

2978
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:17,840
and

2979
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,760
you know there's i think in general

2980
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,119
there's no

2981
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:22,719
there's no

2982
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:26,320
answer there from uh from

2983
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,360
from an ecological perspective i think

2984
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,360
there's some some pretty clear

2985
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,440
patterns of functional specialization

2986
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,440
and then and uh

2987
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,040
some of them are hierarchical some of

2988
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,719
them are you know tend to be like almost

2989
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:40,239
hierarchical or hierarchical with a

2990
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:42,159
little little bit of splint sprinklings

2991
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:43,760
of of

2992
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,520
uh horizontal

2993
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,679
conditions and maybe that's a that's a

2994
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:49,520
useful you know philosophical approach

2995
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,600
to to to look at things that from from

2996
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,800
the instantiation at least from the

2997
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,280
instantiation of oh the kinds of systems

2998
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,639
that were

2999
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:59,199
interesting interested in it's when does

3000
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,280
a group of cells become

3001
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,440
become a tissue but it's also

3002
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:04,639
uh

3003
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,159
what does it what are the conditions

3004
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:06,800
that

3005
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,719
that a thing needs to meet

3006
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:10,560
uh to be

3007
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,320
to be meeting the function of a tissue

3008
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,000
and to be uh

3009
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,760
worthy of being called the tissue in

3010
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:18,000
that in that functional context right

3011
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,840
and then you can talk about well what

3012
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,600
what if that tissue is not made of of

3013
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,520
cells but of like

3014
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,320
nano nanobots or whatever

3015
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,880
and so on

3016
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,360
yeah i do yeah i don't think it is a it

3017
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,119
is an either or type of question i think

3018
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,320
it is more of

3019
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,800
uh the two approaches of like coming at

3020
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,480
it from a mechanistic perspective versus

3021
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,000
coming at it from an active inference

3022
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,920
perspective are complementary they're

3023
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,119
trying to

3024
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:45,199
look at the same phenomena but estimate

3025
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:47,040
them differently

3026
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,679
so the idea of uh i think then started

3027
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:50,719
mentioning that

3028
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,880
morphogenesis and morphostasis i think

3029
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,119
that that's like when novelty happens

3030
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:57,119
how do you respond to that novelty is

3031
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:59,440
part of you know one term in the aif

3032
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,440
equation and it is also a way of looking

3033
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,800
at saying that oh will the system adapt

3034
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,320
to it or not right so there's a

3035
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,320
mechanism of how it adapts and then

3036
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,239
there is the equation version of it if

3037
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:10,639
it adapts well it would be reducing its

3038
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:12,560
uh free energy right because that is

3039
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,159
what we are able to estimate i think

3040
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:15,920
both of them are very complimentary

3041
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,560
approaches what

3042
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,239
so one way i think i look at it is

3043
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:23,920
how do you know that the adaptation from

3044
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,760
a mechanics mechanistic shampoo that is

3045
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,520
happening is

3046
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,840
correct or wrong right is it maladaptive

3047
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,119
is it going to lead for a better outcome

3048
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:32,159
or is it going to lead to a worse

3049
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:34,960
outcome one way of looking at it is is

3050
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,639
that reducing free energy or is that

3051
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,639
increasing free energy of the system

3052
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:40,080
right now that is where you can marry

3053
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,000
the two things and forecast compliments

3054
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,760
that or there are certain adaptations

3055
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,600
because as an agent is sitting inside

3056
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,280
the system you know not knowing the

3057
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,719
bigger picture

3058
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:50,960
there is no way you know uh whether

3059
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,040
these you know uh

3060
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,560
variations that you're trying are good

3061
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,800
or bad like you need a system level out

3062
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,480
so i think that is how i think they're

3063
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:00,000
complimentary again i don't have good

3064
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,920
answers yet because that's the area of

3065
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,119
research that you're trying to figure

3066
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:04,639
out but i the fact that that is where it

3067
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:06,080
could go we could combine the two

3068
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,400
approaches to get more insight

3069
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,880
on the both the mechanism and the

3070
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,520
overall outcome

3071
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:18,320
this has been great any last thoughts or

3072
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,159
any time you're always welcome to join

3073
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:21,199
again

3074
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:23,760
and it's just super interesting to hear

3075
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,360
about we hope that people watching it

3076
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,360
live and replay could think about some

3077
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,440
of these questions but anyone's welcome

3078
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,920
to give a last thought otherwise this

3079
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,679
was just a great first appearance with

3080
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:37,800
you both and we hope to see you again

3081
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,320
yeah just thanks this was super fun to

3082
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,600
read and to discuss and i think um

3083
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,760
i think that the the

3084
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,639
theory underlying the model is

3085
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:51,280
hot and super on point and building it

3086
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,040
out and flushing it out into a more

3087
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,280
thoroughly um you know developed model

3088
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:56,960
will be awesome

3089
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,639
thank you yeah now i really appreciate

3090
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,360
it uh thanks to to both of you guys for

3091
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:04,560
for inviting us uh thanks of course to

3092
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,040
everybody who's uh watching this

3093
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,199
or reading transcripts or you know

3094
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,040
connected to them to the

3095
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,880
mind meld and you know getting an

3096
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,639
instant download of all humanity's

3097
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:16,800
knowledge 200 years from now

3098
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:19,520
uh and yeah i mean

3099
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,360
as i said i think the ultimate purpose

3100
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,840
of all of this is to be useful and it's

3101
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,840
an evolving conversation

3102
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,400
so we're really curious to to

3103
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:31,199
hear thoughts questions uh other ideas

3104
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:34,480
that might pop up and

3105
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,480
yeah i mean i don't know if your emails

3106
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,199
are

3107
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:38,639
are available but

3108
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,320
if not you can

3109
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,320
make them available you can reach out to

3110
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:45,440
us on twitter or down to to the active

3111
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,040
inference labs organizers and they can

3112
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,159
connect us

3113
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:49,520
yeah

3114
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,000
yeah same here thank you both of you and

3115
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,920
thank you to serval and dean for the

3116
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,880
questions

3117
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:57,119
uh we are i think both of us are

3118
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:58,800
available on twitter or otherwise to

3119
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,880
have questions would love to follow up

3120
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,719
on certain things you know and see if we

3121
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:04,880
can make interesting projects out of it

3122
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,280
thank you folks this has been fun thank

3123
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:11,040
you bye cheers bye

3124
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:14,679
good times
