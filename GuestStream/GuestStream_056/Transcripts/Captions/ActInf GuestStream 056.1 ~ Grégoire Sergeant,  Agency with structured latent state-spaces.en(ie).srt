1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,840
foreign

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,960
it's September 15 2023 and we're at the

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,940
Active inference Institute in active

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,720
guest stream number 56.1 today we have

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,180
Gregory Sergeant Petri

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,460
and we'll be hearing a talk followed by

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,820
a discussion on Geometry of world model

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,140
influences behaviors

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,599
first there'll be a presentation and

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,640
then any comments that people have in

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,020
the live chat

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,120
or any other questions it'll be great to

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,059
talk so thank you a lot for coming

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,239
really looking forward to this so peace

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,500
to you

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,480
May thank you very much Daniel for the

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,160
invitation first it's really I'm very

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,680
happy to to be able to present this this

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
work here so it's a it's a work around

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,500
the like some models uh

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,660
of Consciousness at least some some

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,340
computational models of Consciousness

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,780
some part of Consciousness and how it

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,300
can help to generate a different kind of

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,880
behaviors especially when we

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,260
let's think about let's say

27
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,860
artificial agents so it's a um it's a

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,159
work in collaboration with uh so David

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,860
Davidoff Kenneth Williams

30
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,479
in fact it's a it's not just one work

31
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,939
it's a collection of of works that been

32
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,280
have been on for like uh already around

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,259
10 years so if you want to know more

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,720
about like this group and the work that

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
we're doing you can go on the page on my

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,439
personal webpage and there's a link to

37
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,700
PCM dot HTML and there's a summary of

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,340
all the work we've been doing and some

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,540
uh

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,640
summary of the work we've been doing and

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
also of some articles that can be

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,560
relevant on this subject so today we'll

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,780
focus more particularly on two uh two

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,299
articles so one that is accepted and

45
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:55,799
will appear very soon the other one need

46
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,360
to resubmit which uh give formulation of

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,200
let's say autonomous agents or like

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,360
let's say

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,000
mathematical formulation of agents that

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,860
have a world model that is structured

51
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,540
geometrically in such a way that this

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,400
world model captures some features of

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,860
Consciousness so the first article is

54
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,020
let's say the

55
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,660
that we we view all the experimental

56
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,520
results that we have and the like most

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,280
recent formalism that we have on our

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,400
work which is

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,160
to the literature on pomd partially

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,040
terrible monitoring process which is

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,239
optimal control stochastic optimal

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,739
control and we just try to tweak a bit

63
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,500
and this formalism to uh introduce the

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,900
ideas with how you can include inside of

65
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,519
the world model of the agent some ideas

66
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,680
on Consciousness and still continue to

67
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,599
have algorithms to do inference to find

68
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,700
Optimal policies and everything and the

69
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,620
second article focuses more particularly

70
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,319
on how uh changing the world model of

71
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,980
the agents can change its behavior in

72
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,540
particularly the relationship the

73
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,180
geometry of the world model the way that

74
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,599
it perceives Etc and the way it acts

75
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,480
with respect to uh for agent strategy so

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,980
the way that it looks for something so

77
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,360
it will change its behavior and looking

78
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,400
for something so I will start by

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
presenting a bit what uh what are all

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,300
these terms or World model what you

81
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,040
needed what it is what is a foraging

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,500
strategy what it is to how you how can

83
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,659
you define an agent that is looking for

84
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,300
a certain object in particular what is

85
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,000
an exploration based on curiosity or say

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
more technically epistemic value

87
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,780
so let's consider the setting where you

88
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,239
have a let's say a real world so it's a

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,440
space that surround us through each

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,200
space you do a setup where you have an

91
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,480
agent which is let's say a solid it has

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,280
a solid frame so it has a center of

93
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,900
three axis but it's in front but it's on

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,239
its side where it's above above it and

95
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,280
it's looking for an object o which is

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,819
itself a solid inside of R3 and all the

97
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,980
configuration of the agents and the

98
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,220
objects they are defined by let's say a

99
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,220
reference frame that is a external and

100
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,200
that the that characterizes completely

101
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,760
their configuration inside of this world

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,040
now the agent a

103
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,260
what it wants to do is to find for the

104
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,200
object o but it doesn't it can only have

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,420
like some noisy observation of where the

106
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,600
object o is so to be able to find all it

107
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,858
needs to have some

108
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,979
a priorian world o should be

109
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,160
to be able to plan the consequences of

110
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,160
its actions with respect to where or

111
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,880
will be once it has moved and to update

112
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,639
and to be able to plan what

113
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,160
the how the observation can act with

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,080
respect to updating its prior so in

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
other words so you have have an agent

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,680
and the agent is looking for oh and

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,300
things that always for example in this

118
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,560
direction on the right so it's going to

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,759
move towards the right and makes an

120
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,160
observation if it doesn't CEO it's going

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
to change its belief on where o is so

122
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,820
this is a very standard formalism that

123
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,340
you can find like in pomdp stochastic

124
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,600
optimal control

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,419
but the one other point we want to to to

126
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,580
Really emphasize is the fact that the

127
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,460
agent a has its own frame of reference

128
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,040
in the way that it's going to give the

129
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,780
coordinates coordinates of the object

130
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,479
the way that it will Trace worthy object

131
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,979
is is using its own way of computing the

132
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,139
the coordinates of O so it has its own

133
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,360
way to measure where o is so it doesn't

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,660
have to refer to a global frame a global

135
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,340
coordinate system to be able to know

136
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,100
where o is so for example I am always

137
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,820
centered on myself when I move I see the

138
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,060
object I I don't think about me moving

139
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,740
but I think about the object moving and

140
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,660
this is because when I move I change my

141
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,820
frame so the way I'm going to reference

142
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,139
the object is going to change

143
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,419
accordingly and the point we want to

144
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,220
introduce is the fact that you can have

145
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,740
several ways of defining for the agent

146
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,900
to Define its own coordinate system with

147
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,120
respect to its environment and this is a

148
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,820
key feature of that we want to capture

149
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,800
like in terms of of modeling but that's

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,840
also wishing that it is something that

151
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,460
is very structuring with respect to

152
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,620
models of Consciousness because when you

153
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,320
consider like more generally an agent

154
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,699
uh

155
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,100
that that had that is let's say that has

156
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,580
a world model uh on in which it has its

157
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,580
own let's say uh it has its own point of

158
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,039
view perspective on this world model you

159
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,520
kind of have to start tackling the the

160
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,560
problem of how to introduce a point of

161
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,800
view on the environment of the agent how

162
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
can you introduce in the way that it's

163
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,080
uh it is going to encode its environment

164
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,819
a certain point of view and in

165
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,860
particular if you think like about it in

166
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,880
terms of the role of space to be able to

167
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,220
take into account your own perspective

168
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,620
on the environment you can see that if

169
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,180
you take away this like everything that

170
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,919
fills up the space you keep just the

171
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,919
space itself

172
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,160
it's it's uh the space allows you to uh

173
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,500
let's say to structure the way that you

174
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,020
are going to fill in some informations

175
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,360
about the environment and it's centered

176
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,580
on your own point of view in a way that

177
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,919
when you're going to act you're still

178
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,740
going to keep this still says this the

179
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,560
the like the unfilled space the St you

180
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,960
you're still going to keep the stay same

181
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,000
way of modeling this space the space

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,800
will stay the same when you move

183
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,500
when I move the space is the same but I

184
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,020
talk into account the fact that I can

185
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,180
move from one point to another in this

186
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,220
space without changing the space and

187
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,720
something that is also very important is

188
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,000
that with respect to any movement that I

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,919
can do the space doesn't change so

190
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,960
there's no particular point in space

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,900
with respect to the movements that I do

192
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,599
another way another property that is

193
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:43,860
very similar is that instead of

194
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,479
considering just my actions and the way

195
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,819
that I can change my frame while I'm

196
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,440
doing an action you can also Imagine

197
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
taking the frame of somebody else so it

198
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
means that you can you see that the

199
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,039
space that you you use to be able to

200
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,840
structure your environment doesn't

201
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,080
change when you take the perspective of

202
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,819
somebody else for example if you imagine

203
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,240
yourself as a solid agent changing by

204
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,340
your rotation your own like coordinates

205
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,060
your own solid frame and translating

206
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,120
okay so this is uh something that we

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,780
will use in fact as a definition for the

208
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,240
state space the the way that the agent

209
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,340
encodes its environment and we will see

210
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,199
that there's a natural notion to be able

211
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,960
to that encodes this idea that you can

212
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,479
change perspective on your environment

213
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,179
on the world model that you have of your

214
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,219
environment simply by introducing

215
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,360
something that's very well known which

216
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,399
is the notion of a group acting under a

217
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,500
certain space so this is just to sum up

218
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,299
a bit the what we're trying to do so

219
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,979
we're just trying trying to do like

220
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,260
exploration inside of an environment but

221
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,880
we're adding an additional information

222
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,760
which is that the way the agents is

223
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,440
going to encode its environment takes

224
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,860
into consideration the fact that it can

225
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,779
change its reference frame on this space

226
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,019
without singling out any point

227
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,519
okay so what do you mean like

228
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,279
perspective taking in like more

229
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,100
precisely so how do we go from The Real

230
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,320
World so the let's say the world and

231
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,899
code the world described by the external

232
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,120
like a frame that allows you to say the

233
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,680
agent is here and the object is here

234
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,540
from the internal world to of the agents

235
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,880
so you just Define the map that will

236
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,500
take into consideration that the agent

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,120
can have a first perspective on this

238
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,860
environment the simplest case in the

239
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,779
occasion case is just rewriting the

240
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,760
coordinates a bow inside of the frame of

241
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
the agent reference rate of the agent

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,160
and then once the agent moves its frame

243
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,440
solid frame in the real world changes

244
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,720
and this induces indeed the

245
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,120
transformation inside of its internal

246
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,380
World which will be in a fine

247
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,839
transformation

248
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,459
okay but you could imagine also having

249
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,800
other Transformations I don't know if

250
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,680
you can see my my mouse

251
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,920
probably can you see my mouse or not no

252
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,560
okay so okay so the map C PSI can also

253
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,459
be

254
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,080
something else than a defined

255
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,480
transformation it could be like any kind

256
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,300
of transformation for example in a fine

257
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,940
case the apparent volume of the object

258
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,680
doesn't change but if you change this

259
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,000
map and consider for example the

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,560
projective transformation

261
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,680
as we will describe later you can add

262
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,180
that the size apparent size of the

263
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,180
object changes so we we went from

264
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,980
something that is a bit like already

265
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,200
like very well known and not not very

266
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,220
Innovative which is that you can rewrite

267
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,019
like motions depend like the emotions

268
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,640
depends on the way it depends on the

269
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,620
frame that you choose to describe them

270
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,740
into seeing that you can in fact change

271
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,019
some frames to be able to account for

272
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,360
some uh like perceptive property

273
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,980
and what we asked also for the agents

274
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,240
that we consider is that they can

275
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,640
imagine the consequences of their moves

276
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,000
which on their uh future observations

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,980
so there's something just to say that

278
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,260
the agents that we consider have a

279
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,120
notion of agency which is that they can

280
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
plan the consequences of their actions

281
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,300
so that they can choose the best action

282
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,040
with respect to a certain reward in

283
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,019
particular the reward that we consider

284
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,600
is the trying to maximize a certain

285
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,079
surprise

286
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,640
so to sum it up we have an agent that is

287
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,079
looking for certain objects so it has

288
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,140
belief of where the subject is and the

289
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,980
beliefs lives on on an internal State

290
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,779
space so the world model of the

291
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,760
environment

292
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,100
it can make observation which allows it

293
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,700
to update uh its beliefs and then it can

294
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,380
predict the consequences of its actions

295
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,440
so that it can plan the way that it

296
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
should act with respect to a certain

297
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,980
objective so formally this is simply the

298
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,720
notion of markup decision process or

299
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,279
more generally like notion of partially

300
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,019
observable markup decision process

301
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,720
because we do not have a complete

302
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,519
information of the environment but also

303
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,760
but only some observations that are that

304
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,260
are limited and uh it's very related and

305
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,360
let's say

306
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
I mean

307
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,500
there's a strong Duality between Po mdp

308
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,360
and active inference so there's really a

309
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,880
strong link between both

310
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,440
so

311
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,720
now what I did in the way that I

312
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,760
presented it so I presented it with the

313
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,860
idea I tried to present the idea of what

314
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,779
we're doing so the general context

315
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,959
pomdps agents that are planning uh their

316
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,459
action with respect to certain objective

317
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,560
here the objective is to find a certain

318
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,300
object

319
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,620
and uh I give uh the formal setting for

320
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,260
defining it which are ndpmvpn now I will

321
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,240
go one step further and Define it

322
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
explicitly and I will continue like this

323
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,260
approach for the second part where I

324
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,880
will also present our results and our

325
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,320
specificity where else developed with

326
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,180
the general statement then a bit more

327
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,339
precise and then really digging digging

328
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,459
into the result so here the classical

329
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,959
way to define the markup decision

330
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,000
process is to consider that you have a

331
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,620
set of configurations of the environment

332
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,180
which is the state space of the world

333
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,980
model in the way and at least the way

334
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,200
that you encode your environment so this

335
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,660
is something on which you can act

336
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,339
because the agent when it makes an

337
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,899
action it changes the state of the

338
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,220
environment

339
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,680
and the actions the way that the actions

340
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,019
change the environment is with respect

341
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,899
to a certain uh

342
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:23,540
Markov kernel

343
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,220
probability kernel so it's stochastic

344
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,740
which means that each actions changes

345
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,300
the state of the environment but you

346
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,920
don't know completely I guess not

347
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,019
deterministic it you allow some errors

348
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,160
in the way that it acts on the

349
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,540
environment

350
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,760
and you have a reward form a function

351
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,500
that is associated to the actions that

352
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,360
you can do at 20 and also the state of

353
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,200
the the agent that time t and partial

354
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,399
observable partially observable markup

355
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,839
decision process is the same thing that

356
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,459
a markup decision process

357
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,160
but you authorize to say that your

358
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,779
observation on your environment are only

359
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,839
partial which means that you do not have

360
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,540
a pre-say precise information on the

361
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,700
states of the environment so the way

362
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,560
that you need to relate observation and

363
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,180
states is through also a probability

364
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,200
kernel which tells you that

365
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,560
uh if you're at state for example s

366
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,420
you would expect to make a certain

367
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,300
observation let's say of if you if you

368
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,399
think the object is at The X

369
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,620
you expect to see the object attacks but

370
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,940
with a certain error because you know

371
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,940
that your sensors are also random they

372
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,260
have some they have they can make some

373
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,279
mistakes

374
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,100
and you keep similarly a reward function

375
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,480
so it's the same thing that an mdp

376
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,220
Markov decision process but usually also

377
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,820
allow to have some

378
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,380
to get information on your environment

379
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,000
through observations that are not

380
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,079
complete

381
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,240
in fact there's a formulation in terms

382
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,160
of partially observable markup decision

383
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,860
processes our particular case of markup

384
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,420
decision processes which is called

385
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,839
belief Markov and belief and DPS Billy

386
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,480
markov's decision process

387
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,040
and the only difference that you have

388
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,260
between Minecraft process and belief mdp

389
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,820
is the fact that the state space is

390
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,139
necessarily continuous in the second

391
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,120
case so po ndps can be seen as a

392
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,940
particular place of ndps

393
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,040
so

394
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,459
we said that the actions of a pomdp act

395
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,500
on the state space and you have you

396
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,000
account for the consequences of the

397
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,300
actions only through observations so

398
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,260
graphically it means that you have the

399
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,000
state space of your so the world model

400
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,620
your environment X

401
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,040
on which you you like you reference for

402
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,019
example where the object is so the

403
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,519
position of the object

404
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,920
and then when you act it induces a

405
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,420
consequence on the position of the

406
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,220
objects at time t plus one and then you

407
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,079
can make an observation of who you think

408
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,880
the object will be or you can make an

409
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,500
observation with respect to where the

410
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,420
object is depending if you're planning

411
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,740
into the future or if you're really

412
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,440
doing the action uh you're you're

413
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,760
implementing the consequence of the

414
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,320
actions in the real world

415
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,360
the thing that we're trying to do in our

416
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,699
setting is to replace simply the actions

417
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,160
by a change of perspective like I told

418
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,620
you like when the agent asks it's

419
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,540
coordinate system on the environment

420
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,779
changes so you can always see it as in a

421
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,760
way passively where you just see it as a

422
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,339
change of coordinates so we want to say

423
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,380
that instead of considering actions on

424
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,139
the environment we have a space on which

425
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,120
there's a natural notion of changing of

426
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,519
reference frame and actions are simply

427
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,399
certain kind of changes of frames we

428
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,100
also allowed to have some actions that

429
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,839
are do not correspond to changes of

430
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,420
frames we just say that we include the

431
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,100
possibility that some actions are

432
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,959
changes of frames and the changes or

433
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,519
frames are have something that is

434
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,680
related to all the Transformations that

435
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,100
are internal at the for the agents so

436
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,620
for example things that it knows that a

437
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,380
priori it knows it's encoded in the way

438
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,880
the agents will interact with the

439
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,339
environment

440
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,000
so

441
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,680
the way that we do it a bit more

442
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,079
formally is that we say that changing

443
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,600
perspective is simply through the action

444
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
of a group

445
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,699
so for example in the affine case when

446
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,040
the the agents

447
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,099
moves it changes a frame is a defined

448
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,020
transformation and we say that the world

449
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,319
model so the state space is simply a

450
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,599
space on which the group acts so

451
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,419
formally

452
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,160
what does it mean that the group acts on

453
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,660
the space is just saying that

454
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,720
you for you have space s

455
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,840
and Group G there's an application that

456
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,059
goes that takes an element from G and S

457
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,700
and that sends back s in other words for

458
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,500
every GI you can associate a function

459
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,200
from S2s and you assume well so that it

460
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,179
has good properties which is that it

461
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,520
satisfies equation one and that uh if

462
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,080
you don't move you stay at the same

463
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,799
place

464
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,020
so this is like just the notion of a g

465
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,000
space a space a group acting on the

466
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,460
space but now if we want to include this

467
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,240
in

468
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,380
ndps and P1 DPS we just assume that

469
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,620
the state space is a g space that some

470
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,260
actions are some elements of the group

471
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,360
and that when we choose the actions that

472
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,799
corresponds to the element of the group

473
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,480
that corresponds to the way that the

474
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,700
group acts on the element so it's very

475
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,620
like there's nothing like very

476
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,299
convoluted it's just saying that you

477
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,520
define a collection of functions which

478
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,919
you see as changes of frames and the way

479
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,799
that they act so the probability kernel

480
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,539
from the state space to the States

481
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,059
states that time T2 time t plus one

482
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,620
after reaction

483
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,480
uh after the change of perspective is

484
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
simply through the way that the function

485
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,220
changes the state space

486
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,200
so it's just kind of a way of

487
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
reformulation but what is really hidden

488
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,460
behind here is that we have the

489
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,720
structure of the group

490
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,760
and that we don't consider any kind of

491
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,320
actions we assume that there is more

492
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,419
structure in the actions that we can

493
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,059
consider and then it's defined that is

494
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,400
that it's uh in like in the way that is

495
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,980
uh it's that it's encoded inside of the

496
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,260
geometry of the space that we have so we

497
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,760
don't separate any more action and state

498
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,419
space we say that the state space in its

499
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,280
geometry encodes already certain kind of

500
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,840
actions which are the change of

501
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,820
perspectives so there are two cases that

502
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,500
we consider the first case is where the

503
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,320
status is The Arcadian space and gdfn

504
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
transformation it corresponds to like I

505
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,919
find Transformations translations and

506
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,679
rotations of the agents and changing

507
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:21,120
rewriting the coordinates of the objects

508
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,700
inside of the ref solid reference frame

509
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,240
of the agent and the second case where

510
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,160
uh the first the state spaces the

511
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,260
projected space and the group is a

512
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,039
projected transformation

513
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,320
we described how what are the generative

514
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,940
models that we consider and how we can

515
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,980
include so the inside of the classical

516
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,559
theory of pomdps the fact that you can

517
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,360
take a perspective inside on your world

518
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,480
uh on your on your environment now we

519
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,640
will introduce uh like a classical

520
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,340
notion of epistemic value which will

521
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,760
allow us to Define what is uh Behavior

522
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,280
what is an exploratory Behavior with

523
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,039
respect to curiosity so how what it is

524
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,799
foreign agent 2 uh exploits an

525
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,440
environment based on curiosity

526
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,720
so

527
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,160
curiosity or let's say the drive for

528
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,240
exploration

529
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
is uh

530
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,020
uh quantity that will it's a it's a

531
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,900
quantity that you will

532
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,679
um

533
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,780
Okay so

534
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,600
it's uh

535
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,039
okay it's

536
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,440
so how do you define it just with like

537
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,940
very generally

538
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,760
so you start with the agent has a prior

539
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,799
on the state of its environments then it

540
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,260
plans the consequence of one of its move

541
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,059
step so this changes the prior that it

542
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,380
has on the environment because there's

543
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,880
action on the environment so we get a

544
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,900
new prior

545
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,299
and now it's going to make an

546
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:57,059
observation once so it imagines that

547
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,039
it's going to make an observation once

548
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,559
it makes an observation it's there's an

549
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,200
aposteri the priorities of data so you

550
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,000
get an Apple Theory the way that you

551
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,400
Define curiosity or let's say epistemic

552
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,400
value is how informative is the

553
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,539
observation that you will do how far is

554
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,539
the apostillary from the apiary but this

555
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,120
you cannot do it for one given

556
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,580
observation because the way that you

557
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,440
compute It Is by planning what will

558
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,760
happen at the next step so you need to

559
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,559
consider all the possible observation

560
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,299
that you will make so the observations

561
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,340
are themselves stochastic with respect

562
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,799
to the way that you consider which is

563
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,220
actually a priori on the state space of

564
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,400
a Time t

565
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,039
as we said

566
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,080
for us actions are changing the frame so

567
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,380
we can also Define epistemic value four

568
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,600
frames for changes of frames and in

569
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,860
particular something that we gain that

570
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,600
is I think interesting is that now we

571
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,940
have a function that is defined on the

572
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,740
on the group that can be a continuous

573
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,419
group so you can allows you have for

574
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,419
example if you want to maximize it you

575
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,100
you can or minimize it and it depends

576
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,840
how you see it you can watch you you

577
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,520
couldn't do gradient descent for example

578
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,100
so you can have more analytical tools

579
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,900
because you're on the space that is

580
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,080
continuous and has some structure

581
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,419
so now to give the formal definition of

582
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,840
epistemic value so as I said

583
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,140
it's based on the quantity c c that I

584
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,520
will Define now

585
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,140
so if you have yourself if you give

586
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,539
yourself a prior on a space X and you

587
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,220
give yourself a probability kernel so

588
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,380
stochastic map from X to Y stochastic

589
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,440
map is simply saying that for any X you

590
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,880
will associate the measure on y

591
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,440
then you can get a joint Distribution on

592
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,480
X and Y which is simply given by the

593
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,960
product p y doing x times the prior

594
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,419
in fact the quantity C is simply the

595
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,880
mutual information between X and Y

596
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,340
which is saying how far is the joint

597
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,240
distribution with respect to the uh the

598
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,880
independent distribution the product of

599
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,919
the marginal distribution next and on y

600
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,919
but this is like you you see it it

601
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,120
appears everywhere the mutual

602
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,460
information so this formulation is based

603
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,919
on the paper that is uh from a fist on

604
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,140
the null active inference and a pessimic

605
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,419
value the mutual information is

606
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:19,620
something that appears everywhere but I

607
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,700
think that there's a very nice

608
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,200
re-expression of the mutual information

609
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,059
which allows to give a better

610
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,340
interpretation of this quantity and

611
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,080
which is the interpretation I was

612
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,059
discussing in the previous slide so if

613
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,620
you rewrite Mutual information you can

614
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,539
always see it as the coolback library

615
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,419
distance between the posteriorly for a

616
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,700
given observation and the prior pullback

617
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,380
distance being a way of computing how

618
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,059
far you are how far the two distribution

619
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,039
are but you need to look at the

620
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,480
expectation with respect to the

621
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,919
observation that you make so it's

622
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,179
exactly what I was discussing before

623
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,919
so then uh

624
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,559
uh this is like for any kernel any

625
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,620
kernel from X from y x to Y with a prior

626
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,000
on x

627
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,039
but as we were discussing here you have

628
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,539
to take into con so this would be the

629
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,100
kernel but you have to take into

630
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,659
consideration that you can do actions

631
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,179
and let your prior r on X so the way to

632
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,179
the compute epistemic value in for this

633
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,159
kernel here

634
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,600
when having only your the prior on X is

635
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,700
that you propagate the prior buy the

636
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,100
action on X1 then you get the prior on

637
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,799
X1 and you can Define the epistemic

638
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,159
value for this prior and Markov kernel

639
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,159
which responds to like the randomness of

640
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,500
your sensors which is always fixed and

641
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,120
this is very important this one doesn't

642
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,640
change even if you change frames the

643
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,340
kernel that you have relating your prior

644
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,080
what you think about the state space so

645
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,760
relating the state space and the

646
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,100
observation never changes

647
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,919
and so

648
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,720
especially this means that we after a

649
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,480
certain action or after a certain change

650
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,179
of frame and get a joint Distribution on

651
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,340
X and Y which is the following one here

652
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,559
so this corresponds to the prior

653
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,840
propagated on X1

654
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,360
and then the epistemic value is simply

655
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,100
the neutral information of this joint

656
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,020
distribution so now how does the

657
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,240
algorithm work the algorithm that

658
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,520
corresponds to uh defining an

659
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,679
exploratory behavior for an agent that

660
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,480
is looking for

661
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,400
so he said it started with a prior of

662
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,740
where o should be then you maximize

663
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,760
curiosity based on some changes of

664
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,020
frames that are around the identity

665
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,980
Elements which correspond to not

666
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,840
changing frame

667
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,700
then you get an action that you can

668
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,039
apply you propagate the prior to the

669
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,320
next step with this action and then you

670
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,659
just update your priori with respect to

671
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,220
a certain observation

672
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,320
and then it Loops back so this is the

673
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,900
algorithm that we consider uh

674
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,840
in the second paper that I that was

675
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,179
listed in the in the presentation so

676
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,460
which corresponds to having an agent

677
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,020
that is looking for a certain object is

678
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,580
it's um behavior is defined by an

679
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,720
exploratory is is driven by exploration

680
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,779
uh driven by curiosity taking into

681
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,640
account that its state space is

682
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,440
structured by the action of a group so

683
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,940
that the state space is structured by

684
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,340
the fact that it it corresponds to all

685
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,279
the possible ways of like changing

686
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,200
frames so it has inside of the state

687
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,820
space inside of the geometry of the

688
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,980
state space all the possible ways of

689
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,260
changing frames

690
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,880
uh

691
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,940
and uh this is this is like explicitly

692
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,679
what we do so I mean in this context

693
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,720
this is the algorithm that we consider

694
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,919
and nothing else

695
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,840
then we get a very interesting result at

696
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,520
least I find I mean it's not it's

697
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,740
interesting and like in the way that

698
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,179
it's presented here I find it

699
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,700
interesting and then I mean if you go

700
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,860
more into detail and it's it's because

701
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,480
the occlusion case is very particular

702
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,320
but

703
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,440
what you get is that if you look at the

704
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,779
behavior of an agent that is driven by

705
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:02,400
exploration by curiosity uh

706
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,799
but that has a state space structured by

707
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,720
occlusion transformation or clearing

708
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,159
transformation so the first case where

709
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,140
the agent is simply

710
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,320
uh encoding its environment in its

711
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,240
reference frame but nothing else

712
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,000
then it doesn't need to move

713
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,799
in the second case where the changes of

714
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,840
charts are given by projective

715
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,000
Transformations so the way it encodes to

716
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,559
it's in transformation

717
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,919
they take to account a perspective a

718
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,500
projective uh deformation of its

719
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,500
environment then it will always try to

720
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,020
get closer to the object so you have two

721
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,200
very separate behaviors so this is

722
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,700
something that is

723
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,000
I think it's a very interesting to to

724
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,299
note

725
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,240
so before going into the details of uh

726
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,179
how you can improve the statement

727
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,580
I will say a bit more about why it's

728
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,279
more it's an interesting perspective

729
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,980
point of view on the on the subject

730
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,220
because and how it goes a bit further

731
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,320
than simply considering this very simple

732
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,400
setting

733
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,580
what you could imagine is that encoding

734
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,279
the fact that the agent encoding the

735
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,500
actions of the agent directly inside of

736
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,880
the state space of the Asian through

737
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,340
geometry could be a way to stabilize the

738
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,679
representations of the agent

739
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,059
and this is something that we're working

740
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,200
on now

741
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,299
and there's already already literature

742
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:34,740
in this direction

743
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,880
okay

744
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,059
so now let us proof uh the statements

745
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,740
and to prove the statement we need to

746
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,220
give a formal like a precise uh

747
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,179
statement

748
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,700
so what more particularly what we were

749
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,820
able to show is that if you assume that

750
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,400
the agent has us move staying still so

751
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,380
it's allowed to stay still

752
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,460
then if uh it's it's uh changes of frame

753
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,140
are given by actually by a fine

754
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,460
transformation

755
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,980
the agent stays still

756
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,480
now

757
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,460
in the projective case

758
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,039
if you assume that the agent is always

759
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,400
looking in the direction of the object

760
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,159
it will always try to get closer to the

761
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,460
object

762
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,100
okay so the idea of the proof is that

763
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,860
in the what what place the the role for

764
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,080
discriminate for for the tribe of the

765
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,020
agent is how big the agent is appearing

766
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,860
to in the reference how is the size of

767
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,600
the object in the reference frame of the

768
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,620
agent

769
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,799
and it's how big it is it appears to be

770
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,440
to the agent so in the first case the

771
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,020
volume of the object in the internal

772
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,539
space of the agent doesn't change so it

773
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,799
doesn't need to move

774
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,659
in the second case if it makes a move

775
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:59,100
what is informative is to try to make

776
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,260
the object bigger because once it's

777
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,899
bigger the apostillary will be further

778
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,000
from the prior with respect to a certain

779
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,279
observation so it will always privilege

780
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,559
moves that allow to make the object look

781
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,640
bigger

782
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,000
and in this case what you can do is

783
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,020
um

784
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,080
uh you can you can show that this

785
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,640
corresponds in fact two actions or

786
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,980
change of frames that gets you closer to

787
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,000
the object

788
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,340
okay so how to improve the results

789
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,340
so as we said we consider a change of

790
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,620
frame from The Real World to the

791
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,240
internal World here I didn't consider

792
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,039
changes of perspectives with respect to

793
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,020
moves here is simply how you relate the

794
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,940
real world to the internal world in the

795
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,559
euclidean case it's clear it's clear

796
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,419
it's just the way that you write the

797
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,799
coordinates of the object in the solid

798
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,140
frame in the projected case is clearly

799
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,000
not it's not obvious

800
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,620
because there are several ways that you

801
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,960
can relate the solid frame of the agent

802
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,120
to the projective frame

803
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,360
so one way that we decided to do it

804
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,399
is we give some set of actions that we

805
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,679
consider to Media let's say uh coherent

806
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,380
with our own experience of space

807
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,059
which is that we feel that we're always

808
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,840
centered on ourselves that the access of

809
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,880
the site frame of the agents inside of

810
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,860
the like 3D space so what is in front of

811
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,120
it or what is on the right where the

812
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,399
stops are preserved that there's no

813
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:18,480
point in front of the object that

814
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,700
appears to be at Infinity

815
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,279
and that that near to the center of the

816
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,039
object the volumes are preserves

817
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,799
so when you do this so this uh this

818
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,440
formulation like this result is in in

819
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,299
this article here

820
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:36,720
so the way that we relate Some solid

821
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,419
frames like some solid referencement of

822
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,700
the agent to some protective

823
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,620
Transformations are in this article in

824
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,419
particularly in proposition A1 where we

825
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:48,659
show that this set of actions limits

826
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,520
the set of projective transformation we

827
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,919
can consider and we will only have this

828
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,140
projected transformation

829
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,840
and so the change of frames from the

830
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,539
external world to the internal world is

831
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,059
given by rewriting the coordinates of

832
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,700
the agent of the object in the solid

833
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,200
stream of the agent and then applying

834
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,640
this projective transformation

835
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,779
so now uh what we defined here is are

836
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,940
the maps that relate the observation of

837
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,100
the agents

838
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,100
Zach

839
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:27,899
so the we we defined the maps in the

840
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,340
occlusion and projective case that

841
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,740
relate the observation of the agent the

842
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,140
observation of the object to the way

843
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,000
that it represents this this object

844
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,179
inside of its internal world

845
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,440
here

846
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,299
so

847
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,179
this is simply like the pomdp

848
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:48,299
that we defined before and now once the

849
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,820
agent doesn't move it changes its

850
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,799
equation reference frame so there is a

851
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,799
solid reference frame so that from going

852
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,480
from one side reference frame to another

853
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,179
side reference frame you can by applying

854
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,620
the projective transformation we had

855
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,539
before Define another one that we call

856
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:06,299
PSI that goes from the state space at

857
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,799
Time Zero to the state space after

858
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,080
action after moving very what is very

859
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,779
important is that we consider uh the

860
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,779
Markov kernel Associated to a noisy

861
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,940
observation to be of this shape here

862
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,860
which is that if you know about the

863
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,299
object if you think the object is at

864
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,120
point x then you believe that the

865
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,299
observation will be around X in the ball

866
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,240
uh around X for a ball of a certain

867
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,600
radius which is a small ranges Epsilon

868
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,940
okay and I need to charge my computer so

869
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,179
sorry

870
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,659
okay

871
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:00,240
so now press uh epic value as defined

872
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
um

873
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,060
it

874
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,800
has a very simple expression

875
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,440
so the epistemic value of the prior

876
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,020
propagated after the transformation Phi

877
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,359
after this changes of frame five so you

878
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,339
have a problem here you propagate it on

879
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,679
X1 through Phi and you compute the

880
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,440
epistemic value for this uh for the

881
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,080
joint distribution over X1 and Y is

882
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,359
given by this formula here well it's

883
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,520
simply integrating over all the possible

884
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,159
places where the object could be times

885
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,739
the

886
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:44,699
probabilistic volume of the ball

887
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,359
um

888
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,699
of size that sit on uh for the

889
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,879
propagated measure and the logarithmic

890
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,040
of the sequentity okay so this is very

891
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,219
direct to write you can just compute it

892
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,920
and you find this expression but what

893
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,180
you have already here is that if you

894
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,800
consider an oxygen transformation then

895
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,020
the quantity Cube sine minus one B

896
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,940
Epsilon y doesn't change

897
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,980
so then you have the sigmatic value that

898
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,780
is a that is constants so basically if

899
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,280
you try to maximize the systemic value

900
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,720
maximize this quantity you can do

901
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,099
anything you have always one move which

902
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:15,900
is not which is not to move so you don't

903
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,599
move it's okay it's perfectly fine

904
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,339
now in the second case we have the

905
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:21,900
projective where you consider that the

906
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,119
way you relate environment and the

907
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,680
internal world is through a projective

908
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,119
transformation then it's more

909
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,000
complicated and so you need to uh

910
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,339
use a trick which is that you know that

911
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,800
once an observation has been made the

912
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,320
support of the prior will be smaller

913
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,359
and so after one step if you suppose

914
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,359
that your Epsilon so the size of let's

915
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:44,220
say noisiness of your sensor is small

916
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,200
enough

917
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,760
you have a support that is uh of the

918
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,640
distribution that sufficient is small

919
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,339
enough so that you can do an asymptotic

920
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:54,720
development of the quantity in the

921
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,280
integral

922
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,440
so this is an equality but this is an

923
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,339
approximation here

924
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,619
and now this is very useful because now

925
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,619
that you know we're like doing this in a

926
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:12,780
way uh you can say that you just need to

927
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,880
develop this quantity at the point where

928
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,320
the object is really

929
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,060
so if you do it you get this expression

930
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,960
here

931
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,760
and what appears to play a role is only

932
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,240
the determinant of uh the Jacobian or

933
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,339
the projective transformation which here

934
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:29,720
in the case will be one

935
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,579
can be many things

936
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,619
so here also is not very clear because

937
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,079
how do you define CM so cm is defined as

938
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,700
a composition of several Maps I didn't

939
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,680
go into the details but it's corresponds

940
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,920
to the map that are given by the changes

941
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,839
of frame so

942
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,599
if you have the oxygen space and the

943
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,099
internal spaces

944
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,260
after moving you have a change of frame

945
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,060
in the equation space but it corresponds

946
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,400
to also a change of frame in the

947
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,720
internal space

948
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,720
so if you the way you define PSI is

949
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,220
simply saying that you inverse the

950
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,900
projective transformation from internal

951
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,839
world to external world to go at Time

952
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,760
Zero then you apply the change of frames

953
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,260
and then you apply the projective

954
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,820
transformation to go from external to

955
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,200
internal

956
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,780
foreign

957
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,400
this formula that you have here

958
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,740
and which is very nice with this and

959
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,300
then you have the first term that

960
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,500
doesn't depend on the actions that you

961
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,640
do so you don't need to take it into

962
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,440
account this one will be one and then

963
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,720
you just need to compute this one

964
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,400
in fact this one has a very simple

965
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,339
expression so it's expression 20 23 and

966
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:35,400
then here you can directly see which

967
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,560
moves correspond to increasing this

968
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,119
quantity and then decreasing this

969
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,320
quantity

970
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,480
because we want to increase epistemic

971
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,820
value and so this this is the result

972
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,740
this allows to prove the result that we

973
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,599
we said in the first day like in the

974
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,020
several slides before that in the

975
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,460
projective case if you have enough

976
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,859
movements if you look at the object then

977
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,780
you're always going to go closer to the

978
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,460
object

979
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,520
the way to interpret it is as if the

980
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,640
agent it was a bit paranoiac or paranoid

981
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,859
if it's like I'm very uncertain on its

982
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:09,720
own beliefs so

983
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,200
it knows the object might be over there

984
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,640
but it's always uncertain so it needs to

985
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,400
go check and once I check it's more

986
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,579
certain but still as it can always be

987
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:23,339
even more certain it will always try to

988
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:27,320
get more and more certainty

989
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,599
and so I only presented like in this uh

990
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,820
in this presentation all the aspects

991
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,500
which are more computational and what

992
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,020
the algorithm and some like analysis of

993
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,880
the algorithm we considered but we also

994
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,099
have like some experiments on how this

995
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:42,960
setting can allowed to generate

996
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,579
different behaviors behaviors that we

997
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,040
would expect explain for example some

998
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,619
Illusions like the moon Illusions and

999
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,940
then invite you if you're interested on

1000
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,339
this to listen on to the like online

1001
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,940
talk

1002
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,380
moc-4 conference that was in Oxford last

1003
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,800
week or to check up check out one of

1004
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,060
these three papers

1005
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,380
and I would like to thank you very much

1006
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,920
for your attention

1007
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,440
all right awesome wow

1008
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,040
very interesting and different ways than

1009
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,900
how I've seen the

1010
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,960
pomdp and related uh

1011
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,900
works so

1012
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,000
okay let's just start off with little

1013
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,680
context and then I'll read some

1014
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,180
questions and read some questions from

1015
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,460
live chat so what what brought you to

1016
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,800
study this question this way

1017
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:47,160
uh what question the question of uh okay

1018
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,380
did you come from a math side and find

1019
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,780
Consciousness and and geometries to be

1020
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,700
interesting or vice versa what kind of

1021
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,020
brought you to want to make this

1022
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,339
contribution

1023
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:59,579
so at the beginning so when I did my my

1024
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:02,820
uh PhD in maths I was more interested I

1025
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,820
was interested in let's say uh like all

1026
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,680
this idea of critical critical brain

1027
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,440
hypothesis so uh the way that the trying

1028
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,119
to understand the way that the brain

1029
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,280
processes information and makes it

1030
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,880
something that is uh like exploited

1031
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,079
and so they one of so the critical brain

1032
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,060
hypothesis tells you that the activity

1033
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,680
of the neurons is basically close to

1034
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,780
certain criticality criticality in the

1035
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,579
source of statistical physics if because

1036
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,619
you can model the activation of the

1037
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,260
neurons as let's say uh statistical

1038
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,220
system like an icing model but the so I

1039
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,380
worked a lot on this and then I there's

1040
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,839
another hypothesis that is uh like very

1041
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,160
common which is the Bison brain

1042
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,359
hypothesis

1043
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,700
and so the Bayesian brain hypothesis led

1044
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,440
me to active influence to learning more

1045
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,960
about optimal control by Asian fashion

1046
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,720
perspective on optimal control

1047
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,619
and uh there was uh so uh my advisor was

1048
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,960
a PhD advisor was working with David and

1049
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,780
they're still together on uh trying to

1050
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,359
uh Implement uh some aspects of

1051
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:07,560
consciousness

1052
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,680
uh and how it can influence influence

1053
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,300
especially with their article in the

1054
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,940
Moon Illusion so uh I was interested in

1055
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,560
knowing how uh how uh this uh kind of

1056
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,680
let's say uh ideas

1057
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,780
uh simply like in a very naive way they

1058
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,760
interact with the Bison brain hypothesis

1059
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,280
and then I continued in fact like one of

1060
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,200
the lines of my research is structured

1061
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,720
like algebraically structured statistics

1062
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,660
or machine learning and so the way that

1063
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,400
they see it like very geometrically in

1064
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,079
fact or let's say geometrically or

1065
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,060
algebraic it's not the same thing but

1066
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,400
it's very related it's something that I

1067
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,760
I wanted to uh to to understand a bit

1068
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,980
better let's set you to make it in a

1069
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,500
formal setting so that it's simply a

1070
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,240
particular case of what are what is in

1071
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,060
the literature so it's specifying what

1072
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,740
exists in the literature and this took

1073
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,079
some time because I was more on the

1074
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:02,400
active inference like the free energy

1075
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,680
principle side so I had to read more

1076
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,140
about like Optimal control sarcastic

1077
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,060
optimal control qmdps and understand

1078
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,040
that in fact

1079
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,339
what we're doing is simply adding more

1080
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:17,339
structure on the latent space of of the

1081
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:19,320
agent and the state space of the agent

1082
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,980
and uh doing this allows to ask the

1083
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,619
question like why is this useful why

1084
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,140
having a state space that encodes

1085
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,640
different perspectives so the motivation

1086
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,020
comes from the Consciousness and study

1087
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,359
cognitive Sciences but why it can be

1088
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,920
useful for Robotics and it's always been

1089
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,500
like my motivation study uh some

1090
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,480
statistical statistical models more

1091
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,400
structured models with more our priori

1092
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,300
that can be useful uh for understanding

1093
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,359
the behavior of a closed system like an

1094
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:50,880
agent like a collection of neurons like

1095
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,700
even like molecular machines okay so

1096
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,940
that's a very long answer but it's okay

1097
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,440
cool so you focused on the spatial

1098
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,579
movement epistemic foraging case

1099
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:07,859
is there something special about space

1100
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,079
or can we also think about this

1101
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,020
perspective taking in terms of for

1102
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,200
example semantic or a narrative

1103
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,060
reference frame

1104
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,060
so the this is I think it's a very very

1105
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,280
important question because up to now all

1106
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,560
the work a reference will need to space

1107
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,660
so the fact is based in terms of the 3D

1108
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,119
space and not space in terms of geometry

1109
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,339
and the fact of writing it as geometry

1110
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,319
allows to get out from the classical

1111
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,359
point of view as space as a 3D space

1112
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,040
because you see that there's more and

1113
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,200
more like for example in the in

1114
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,940
geometric deep learning there's more and

1115
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,520
more the use of uh space to encode

1116
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,020
environments of certain objects and

1117
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,440
these objects are not necessarily uh had

1118
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,420
the three the three-dimensional

1119
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,980
structure you can have objects that have

1120
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,339
higher groups of ignorance so I think

1121
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:57,839
that the

1122
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,420
it's it's indeed using geometry for

1123
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,000
other contexts and it's really the aim

1124
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,380
of trying to go through this more

1125
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,940
General formulation is to be able to

1126
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,460
apply it to real world models what I

1127
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,960
mean by real world models it means the

1128
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,760
ones that are learned to be able to have

1129
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,200
an agent in an open environment that

1130
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,200
will learn the way uh it would learn its

1131
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,940
generative model but with they are

1132
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,040
priori that it can take a perspective on

1133
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,839
its environment and see what it can do

1134
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,720
so we really want to get out from the

1135
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,940
3DS at least for me go out from 3D space

1136
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,859
and go to like implementing it

1137
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:32,640
completely in autonomous agents

1138
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,040
okay to kind of follow on that there's a

1139
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,500
question to chat great talk I also

1140
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,240
wonder whether it applies to any

1141
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,760
modality not just visual spatial but

1142
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,640
also text

1143
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,160
yeah so it's for other modalities like

1144
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,319
sound for example what I don't know for

1145
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,880
applying to text

1146
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,000
so there's a lot of work now on uh large

1147
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,880
language models and like of this idea of

1148
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,800
prompting and being having these models

1149
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,880
being able to have some kind of

1150
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,640
imagination so you would like to have

1151
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,160
this kind of these ideas applied in this

1152
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,040
context but for now I mean it's not the

1153
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,720
line that we're trying to that I'm

1154
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,640
trying to do so I'm trying to stay on

1155
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,500
deep learning so basically take standard

1156
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,099
data set without considering uh uh like

1157
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,819
text and just try to see how these ideas

1158
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,560
like in geometric deep learning can

1159
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,780
stabilize representations

1160
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,880
so it's not the same that is a lot of

1161
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,500
others it's clearly other modalities

1162
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,000
especially if we consider like

1163
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,760
multi-model integration like you you try

1164
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,380
to rebuild the state space and you don't

1165
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,880
want to see it only as a vector space

1166
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,140
but you wanted to see it got more

1167
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,760
structure because you want to force the

1168
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,800
way like you have constraints be you

1169
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,119
know appear only the constraints that

1170
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:44,400
you're going to have on the way that you

1171
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,200
can take a perspective on one volatility

1172
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,839
or the other but it's not for text at

1173
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,460
least not matter I think it maybe it

1174
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,079
could be used for text but but it's not

1175
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,680
what I'm doing now yeah

1176
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,579
okay so it's I I I I just wanted to

1177
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:01,339
rebound

1178
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:04,319
I have the lack of collaborating with

1179
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,920
real mathematics

1180
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,900
some guy with intuition that I've found

1181
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,180
the right people to to do the work uh

1182
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,280
regarding multimodality this is

1183
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,079
important to understand that this is not

1184
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,460
about vision

1185
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,460
this is about spatial recognition it's

1186
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,339
supermodal the claim is that vision is

1187
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:26,880
just one particular way of integrating

1188
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,040
information indeed in an obviously

1189
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,280
projective manner but that's integrated

1190
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,619
in a much larger field of experience

1191
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,960
than the field of view or the visual

1192
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,560
field and obviously proprioception touch

1193
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,660
when you build a representation just by

1194
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,640
touching something and you get the 3D

1195
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,900
representation of the scene

1196
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,420
automatically in your mind hearing to

1197
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,800
the extent that it's about Source

1198
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,579
localization and building spatial uh uh

1199
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:56,460
uh representation all of that stuff

1200
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,099
that's the claim of the theory is

1201
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:02,220
integrated in this projective space they

1202
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,200
are priors from memories there are stuff

1203
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,660
from Vision staff from addition stuff

1204
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,240
from popular reception in the reception

1205
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,579
you name it all senses contribute to it

1206
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,920
so it's not Vision the claim is that

1207
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,079
projective 3D projective geometry in

1208
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,020
that case is beyond Vision vision is

1209
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,300
just actually a slave to that Supreme

1210
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,819
other representations that's the claim

1211
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:27,780
um awesome all uh yeah please

1212
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,339
that's important because we haven't

1213
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,680
choose I think we like we let's say we

1214
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,420
work like a group there are several like

1215
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,859
different perspectives for me I'm more

1216
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:36,180
on the computational side so it's

1217
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,500
important to have that color because

1218
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,119
clearly something I won't be able to

1219
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,020
answer

1220
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,180
cool here's a nice following question

1221
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,119
from Vladimir in the chat they wrote

1222
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,680
if the

1223
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,800
EG visual sensors have variable

1224
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,380
resolution for example higher resolution

1225
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,940
in the center

1226
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,400
this can naturally lead to curiosity

1227
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,680
based change of orientation response

1228
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,960
within your framework

1229
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,579
so is it the question or an affirmation

1230
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,920
so it's for EG right so if there's a

1231
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,319
variable if there's variable sensor

1232
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:10,200
Precision for example higher Precision

1233
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,440
in the sensor might you see any

1234
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,020
resulting

1235
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,960
curiosity Associated change merely based

1236
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,060
upon the asymmetry or the structure of

1237
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,400
the sensor Fields okay so I shouldn't

1238
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,260
say it but I will still say it because I

1239
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,819
don't know if the people will go out one

1240
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:29,640
day or nothing this is more attention

1241
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,220
this is more attention than curiosity so

1242
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,380
it's more like uh so you can act on your

1243
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,420
sensors so that you can uh change the

1244
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,920
way that you integrate them and this

1245
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,520
really acts as a form of attention

1246
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,920
so I really went into it

1247
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,200
what do you think what is the interplay

1248
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,000
between attention

1249
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,079
and curiosity

1250
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,460
uh

1251
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,180
uh I mean

1252
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,319
it's it's the way you're going to move

1253
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,319
basically on the the way the way that it

1254
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,780
deforms the way that you move that you

1255
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,760
so the consequences of your actions are

1256
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,619
not the same so basically curiosity is

1257
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,960
what what drives actions and the way

1258
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,040
that you uh said the con so you choose

1259
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,720
your action with respect to reward which

1260
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,579
is a epistemic value and now attention

1261
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:22,980
or let's say changing the sensors is a

1262
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,660
way to change the consequences of your

1263
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,579
action with respect to let's say

1264
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:28,920
optimizing this value so it's it's like

1265
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,520
um

1266
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,599
yeah I mean it's it's yeah I

1267
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,339
I don't know if I should say yes or not

1268
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,960
but okay okay let's say it's okay that's

1269
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,520
it for I think it's symmetric basically

1270
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,500
it's it acts like a sort of metric on

1271
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,140
the space on the the group directly so

1272
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,520
it means that it's going to so when you

1273
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,200
have a function you want to degrade in

1274
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,819
this engine you choose a metric and the

1275
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,859
metric is so the attention will act as a

1276
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:51,960
metric and so the metric will allow you

1277
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,240
to deform in fact

1278
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,640
um the the steps that you will do and so

1279
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,099
I think this is how it acts so it's very

1280
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,660
known that I mean it's known that the

1281
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,180
fact that changing the sensors is is

1282
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,560
related to attention that's not

1283
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,540
something much new but the fact that you

1284
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,460
can directly in our setting related to

1285
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,339
groups and you can relate it to uh like

1286
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:12,720
changing the metric on the group is

1287
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,000
something that that can be done and I

1288
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,920
think it's it's interesting

1289
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,200
um all right another question in the

1290
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,480
chat

1291
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,640
what is a formal framework for learning

1292
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,680
geometry from data

1293
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,220
how do we move from empirical data sets

1294
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,140
the files on our computers and the

1295
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,760
things that we do deep learning on take

1296
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,800
into machine learning pipelines and how

1297
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,619
do we utilize geometric approaches and

1298
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:42,839
formalize to the kind of analytical

1299
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,640
Precision that we saw here some of these

1300
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,220
geometric relationships

1301
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,800
so the the there's a very like uh there

1302
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,900
are several different fields of how to

1303
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,780
use geometry uh on data so there's

1304
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,819
already like I mean depends how you see

1305
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:58,859
geometry but one way is a TDA

1306
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:01,079
topological data analysis so which is

1307
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:04,319
basically trying to uh let's say uh do

1308
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,460
you want supervised learning by

1309
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,980
geometric Pro like stability property of

1310
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,500
of your data and try to interpret it as

1311
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,240
a certain kind of space and then you

1312
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,619
look at the whole of your space and this

1313
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,660
is something that defines your data set

1314
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,280
so this is one approach another one is

1315
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,319
that people doing many like they try to

1316
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,480
learn the so they they know that you're

1317
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,380
that the that the data lives in the low

1318
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,940
dimensional manifold and they try to

1319
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,559
learn this manifold so that's another

1320
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,240
perspective another way of doing it so

1321
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,920
there's a lot of work in this in this

1322
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,119
direction there are people who are

1323
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,740
interested in variants and equivalence

1324
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:38,160
so more in the geometric deep learning

1325
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,680
there are people who are interested in

1326
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,380
the same setting on appearance how to

1327
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,300
use the geometric aprioris and included

1328
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,680
in learning for a deep learning

1329
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,059
reinforcement learning and this is what

1330
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,160
we do in fact this is where one of where

1331
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,980
many people do this it's not just then

1332
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,740
we like for us we try to focus on this

1333
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,180
idea of how to export it for

1334
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,078
reinforcement learning

1335
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,020
um so in this setting

1336
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,720
epistemic value was the only driver of

1337
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,900
action is that yeah so it's kind of like

1338
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,300
a expected free energy

1339
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,599
except without pragmatic value so we

1340
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,640
only have the epistemic term remaining

1341
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,040
exactly exactly in fact if you look at

1342
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,900
in terms of optimal control and not by

1343
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,400
Asian because you know that there's this

1344
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,619
Duality that is most of the time stated

1345
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,720
in like active influence where you have

1346
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,720
basically a duality between the uh let's

1347
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,339
say uh

1348
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:35,400
about like a stochastic value function

1349
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,839
and the probabilistic version of value

1350
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,900
function so you can encode like on

1351
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,960
priors you can encode all your drives

1352
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,619
with priors or with uh the value

1353
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:49,380
function directly so rewards and so both

1354
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,599
are kind of dual and they're dual in the

1355
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:54,119
way and you can make like this there's

1356
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,460
Duality I mean it's I don't know if it

1357
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,619
explicitly dual like in some context

1358
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:00,780
this this sentence makes sense for

1359
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,520
active inference for me I'm not

1360
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,319
completely aware if the Duality is

1361
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,780
exactly formal but at least this the

1362
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,160
idea is here so there's no big

1363
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,540
difference at least the way I see it as

1364
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,099
with value function and seeing it

1365
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:12,720
probabilistically but the terms of

1366
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,540
epistemic value is a is a is an

1367
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,579
exploration Drive which you also find in

1368
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,680
reinforcement learning maybe not in this

1369
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,660
exact expression I think that the exact

1370
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,040
expression that was given in the paper

1371
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,490
of a 37 and all is is

1372
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:29,480
[Music]

1373
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,839
is on the paper it's it's um it's

1374
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,640
um it's a very uh uh like a canonical

1375
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,700
way to define a epistemic value so it's

1376
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,740
an exploratory drive you can always add

1377
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,140
to the value function

1378
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,579
you know that there's a lot of problem

1379
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:49,920
of trying to explore in fact uh like

1380
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,059
your environment you find the good

1381
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:53,579
policies like it because if you're in a

1382
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:54,960
state space that is continuous it's

1383
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,319
really difficult to uh to result in p1bp

1384
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,420
yes it's like if you knew which

1385
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,300
Curiosities you could

1386
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,880
get rewarded from

1387
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,240
you would have already known the answer

1388
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,319
to the search

1389
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:22,680
so that's that's one of the

1390
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,099
challenges with pragmatic value

1391
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:29,040
it converges well to expectations but

1392
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,839
then

1393
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:35,339
this work uh really

1394
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:37,859
focuses in on epistemic value and shows

1395
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,040
what it can do alone as a driver

1396
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,440
so how would you bring pragmatic value

1397
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,160
into this formalism you just added you

1398
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,200
just like it's really you can put the

1399
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,940
value functions of some of the rewards

1400
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,280
in some way and then you add and then

1401
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,780
you add the epistemic value in fact when

1402
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,520
you look at the formulation in terms of

1403
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,220
belief and DP for pumdp the Curiosity

1404
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,119
epistemic value is simply a value

1405
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,640
function nothing more it's a one-step

1406
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,020
value function but I mean this is like

1407
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,780
just playing with definitions but so you

1408
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,880
can always add a drive for uh for

1409
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,619
exploration and this is something that's

1410
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:15,780
really often done in uh in reinforcement

1411
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,300
learning I mean I care

1412
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,559
yes

1413
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:22,020
like I think it's even standard in not

1414
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,579
this way exact not exactly this

1415
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:24,780
expression but there's a book that is

1416
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,040
called reinforcement learning state of

1417
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,200
the art and they they introduce this

1418
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,540
exploratory Drive

1419
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,460
like this is a book maybe that has 10

1420
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,260
years or something like this so it's

1421
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,520
something that you add up you can put

1422
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,319
you can put your the way we will do it

1423
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:39,300
now is like we we can we can put some

1424
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,859
drawers or with respect to preferences

1425
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:42,180
and then you add for example an

1426
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,359
epistemic value and you try to to just

1427
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,059
solve the optimization problem but like

1428
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:49,500
in terms of formalism as you look at the

1429
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,119
belief mdp it's nothing more than a

1430
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,800
certain value function so it's not

1431
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,319
foreign

1432
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:01,440
so space

1433
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,780
remains

1434
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,380
when we translate through it

1435
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,200
or when we

1436
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,480
whether we're in the euclidean or in the

1437
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,300
projective setting space is basically

1438
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,099
the

1439
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:20,640
what is not changed through action

1440
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,940
is that the case okay

1441
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,640
and so is that the weight so the so the

1442
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,520
thing is that so okay so there's a bit

1443
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,319
of technicality so the way that we use

1444
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:33,300
it we use a chart so we need to take for

1445
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,740
the protective plane so we need to use

1446
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,180
homogeneous coordinates so we need to

1447
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,119
take away a like a lower dimensional

1448
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,200
plane

1449
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,940
so that's why you always have the same

1450
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,099
like in the the way that we encoded we

1451
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:45,960
always are in R3 because we chose a

1452
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,079
chart I mean we chose a homogeneous

1453
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:51,059
coordinates and we use projective

1454
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:52,559
Transformations from one homogeneous

1455
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,300
coordinates to another homogeneous

1456
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,460
coordinate but it always lists to a

1457
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,260
Project X transformation so what is

1458
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,700
hidden in the way that we write it is in

1459
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,380
fact we don't have the same space in the

1460
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,579
first case we have a Cleveland and the

1461
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:04,680
second we have projective so but the way

1462
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,020
as we use charts and we like I mean we

1463
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,480
don't put all the details of

1464
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,920
the fact that for example you can

1465
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,300
compose two projective transformations

1466
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,119
in uh by even if you write it in charts

1467
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,680
in terms of homogeneous coordinates and

1468
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,880
it stays a productive transformation

1469
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,500
this is something that is okay but it's

1470
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,839
it's we just don't write it this way we

1471
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,280
stay in charts and so that's why there's

1472
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,380
a similarity between e because we want

1473
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,059
to implement it there's a similarity

1474
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,780
between the acridian

1475
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,819
projected case clear case and protective

1476
00:57:32,819 --> 00:57:35,099
case have the same state space R3 but

1477
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:36,540
the space of transformation is really

1478
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,920
different and in fact they are not the

1479
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,960
same space but when it's important for

1480
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,000
us in terms of spaces just to tell

1481
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,839
yourself that if you take away

1482
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:44,700
everything that is inside the space all

1483
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,140
the all the like everything that

1484
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,300
populates space you take it away what

1485
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,040
what you're left with is with this kind

1486
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,599
of Concepts which already takes into

1487
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:52,740
account the fact that when you act

1488
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,599
you're not changing you're not changing

1489
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,819
the space and there's no single point

1490
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:58,920
that is singled out so this is very

1491
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,720
important because it's a very typical

1492
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,040
like it types A lot of the objects

1493
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,780
you're looking at like if you move

1494
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,280
there's no point in the space that is

1495
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,020
changing there's no point that it's

1496
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,460
single out and when you move the space

1497
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,839
it's not changing so you know that you

1498
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,280
you already have inside of your space a

1499
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,500
change of charts that is that is encoded

1500
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,260
and even more when you can imagine that

1501
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,400
you take the perspective of somebody

1502
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,359
else

1503
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:20,339
and this is like really something that

1504
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:22,440
is at the basis of the space we consider

1505
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,440
is that the space is simply a way to

1506
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,000
support the fact that you can change

1507
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,280
charts you can change perspectives and

1508
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,020
so it's including this idea inside of

1509
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,640
agency that we're trying to do so maybe

1510
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,079
I was not clear in the way that I

1511
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,579
installed it first but I think this is

1512
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,559
really

1513
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:39,119
opportunity

1514
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,260
it's the water we're in so it's a very

1515
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,640
interesting

1516
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,940
um way to approach it and it reminds me

1517
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,880
way back when actually almost three

1518
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,700
years ago when we discussed the

1519
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,799
projective Consciousness model and

1520
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,900
phenomenal selfhood in live stream

1521
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,640
number nine

1522
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,680
and um

1523
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,500
we talked a lot about

1524
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,420
flipping between the euclidean and the

1525
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,940
projective

1526
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,359
modes how an agent could have on one

1527
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:14,099
hand

1528
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:17,280
a space in which

1529
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,000
um

1530
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,599
a book is a rectangle and yet also be

1531
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,819
seeing it very close to their face so

1532
00:59:23,819 --> 00:59:27,900
that it's visual uh projection was was

1533
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,900
different and yet here

1534
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,160
there was different Behavior associated

1535
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,660
with

1536
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,079
the frame alone so what's going on there

1537
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,540
where even though they

1538
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,720
apparently can be reconstructed

1539
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,740
from each other

1540
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:53,220
what flips can we flip from thinking

1541
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,359
more

1542
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:58,200
euclidean and then in that situation

1543
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,059
um you know I'm a plane 30 000 feet

1544
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:02,160
above my city so there's nowhere I need

1545
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,420
to go

1546
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,599
but then in the projective setting

1547
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:10,579
we do have this kind of inbuilt

1548
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:15,079
epistemic drive to to be near

1549
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,839
so I think it's it's a hard coded so so

1550
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:21,660
the the idea is one of the things that

1551
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,760
it can be useful for is communication so

1552
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,740
using space as a way to communicate

1553
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,200
taking an example that we have very

1554
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,299
different architectures like the way

1555
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:31,980
that we treat information are not the

1556
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:33,780
same we don't have exactly the same

1557
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,880
connection neurons and everything but we

1558
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,740
still have like a common framework in

1559
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,960
which we can discuss for example in a

1560
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,700
visual visual information is something

1561
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,160
that is very immediate for us which is

1562
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,780
not obvious if you take the perspective

1563
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,760
the point of view if you go from the

1564
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,220
idea that it's rebuilt and it's not the

1565
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,319
environment you're living on it's not in

1566
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,420
it's not the exactly the space that we

1567
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,500
see there's something that we

1568
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,380
constructed like uh for uh like uh

1569
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,180
functional reasons and that is one of

1570
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,980
them could be that we can communicate

1571
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,619
very directly with it so I think it's

1572
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,960
hard coded that the state space needs to

1573
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,640
have this action

1574
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,380
and that all the agents share this

1575
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,700
action but they don't share the same

1576
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,740
architecture so it gives a common base

1577
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,420
for discussion like true actions for

1578
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:17,460
example change that of perspective so it

1579
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,980
gives like the so it's the chance of a

1580
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,380
question or clean projective we're not

1581
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,180
going in the direction uh in terms of

1582
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,440
research where we're trying to say that

1583
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,059
we can go from a community to projective

1584
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:29,460
for the same agent we so agents are

1585
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,619
hard-coded with the latent space which

1586
01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:34,319
is a has some structure and then we try

1587
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:35,520
to export it for function for

1588
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,400
communication for multi-agent uh like uh

1589
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,559
Behavior so that they can collaborate

1590
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,339
this is

1591
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:46,380
okay so each agent is within its own

1592
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,240
projective setting and then the

1593
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,520
euclidean

1594
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,859
sets the stage and allows that

1595
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:55,440
multi-perspective the oxygen space which

1596
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,319
is the outside world is just here in

1597
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,839
this toy model because we it's a way to

1598
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,059
reference the configuration of the world

1599
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,339
but for a network this would be for

1600
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:08,460
example the configurations of its

1601
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,420
sensors

1602
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,240
so it's just here there's a there's this

1603
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,280
kind of ambiguity between space and

1604
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,200
space so outside space which is occasion

1605
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,240
and inside which is projective but the

1606
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,579
outside space is just a way to discuss

1607
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:23,819
uh configurations of something that is

1608
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:25,440
related to the environment so it can be

1609
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,599
like your your sensors the configuration

1610
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,160
of your sensors or something like this

1611
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,260
information coming from your sensors so

1612
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,180
you just give a state space from it and

1613
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,280
the geometry is really in the

1614
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,440
reconstructured world that is internal

1615
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,440
but the being able that you do networks

1616
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,480
that do this is somewhere that we're

1617
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,099
working on now and it's not that obvious

1618
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:45,660
because you need to there's a lot of

1619
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,000
algorithms the problem algorithmic

1620
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,920
problems that we try to solve and that

1621
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,599
we need to solve so in the story Model

1622
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,520
is really like the ambiguity comes only

1623
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,740
from the fact that it's a toy model and

1624
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,079
but what is space is inside it what is

1625
01:02:58,079 --> 01:02:59,760
reconstructed is the thing that we

1626
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,700
perceive space from sensors as being a

1627
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,440
whole as being something that structures

1628
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,760
the information and so David wants to

1629
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,960
say something or

1630
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,140
well I mean yes indeed in the talk you

1631
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,059
are having too I was giving them also

1632
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:16,680
and it really felt if I remember well

1633
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,799
yeah indeed the toy models encoded a

1634
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:23,819
certain world model in an Acadian uh way

1635
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:27,059
uh and then using homogeneous coordinate

1636
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:28,799
and this kind of stuff to do the

1637
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,980
projective uh transformation uh we just

1638
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,099
transform the Acadian space into a

1639
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:36,740
projective space

1640
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,540
and you can go of course it's in you can

1641
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,280
invert it I mean there is an online air

1642
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,920
division but you can invert it anyway uh

1643
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,200
so you can go from one to the other but

1644
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,359
Gregor is right that it was a choice of

1645
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:51,119
modeling it was a bit motivated by my

1646
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,980
experiment my experience as a brain

1647
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,900
scientist you know there are reasons to

1648
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,240
believe that memory for instance Place

1649
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,960
sales and grid cells they then do their

1650
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,940
new hypothesis about their hyperbolic

1651
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,920
characters but they you know usually

1652
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,140
they are thought as encoding space in

1653
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,839
the nuclearian manner so since when we

1654
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:15,000
project uh you know future action we use

1655
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,339
sometimes and we have to use memory or

1656
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:20,099
even if we do a remembrance of the past

1657
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:21,900
and we project ourselves in the scenes

1658
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,000
in the past there is this access to

1659
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,760
memory systems that you know we used to

1660
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,559
think and probably this is still the

1661
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,720
case on code information in a Korean

1662
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,760
manner so it would make sense that then

1663
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,160
for the conscious access there will be

1664
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,200
some operation that would allow us to go

1665
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,240
from the Cleveland to project which you

1666
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,160
know was implemented that way at the

1667
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,040
same time this is way beyond my my

1668
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,839
abilities in math so regular will

1669
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,000
correct me

1670
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,200
there is a way of seeing projective

1671
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,599
geometry as being more General as an

1672
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,660
extension of a fine Space by adding

1673
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,640
point at Infinity so if now you think

1674
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,700
about the project space with a metric

1675
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,440
basically uh the projective space is an

1676
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,420
extension of a trillion space am I

1677
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,680
saying something completely false

1678
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:11,339
yeah I mean it's one way to sing it and

1679
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:13,579
also a lot of operations that use

1680
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:15,599
dialogues I would say exchange between

1681
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,760
projective and Acadian if you think

1682
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,920
about multi-view reconstruction of 3D

1683
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,960
equipment space for multiple shots in

1684
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,059
your camera you take several shots of a

1685
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:26,280
building from different perspective and

1686
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,380
then you can use a deterministic

1687
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,299
algorithm I mean approach using people

1688
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:32,819
are geometry to kind of infer under some

1689
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:35,099
fires that basically all lines that

1690
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:36,660
converge at Point at Infinity are

1691
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,400
actually parallel then you reconstruct

1692
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,920
you go from projective to euclidean so

1693
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,660
there is a you know

1694
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,640
a deep relationship between the two that

1695
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,940
is possible and probably functional

1696
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,599
um

1697
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:51,420
yeah that's that's about it so and

1698
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,819
people are geometry is a is a subset of

1699
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:56,700
projective geometry no yeah so just to

1700
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,419
leave some context

1701
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:02,940
David has a better intuition on

1702
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,920
protective spaces and me this is like

1703
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,220
this so when he says stuff

1704
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:11,640
I I I I like I I not he really has a

1705
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,058
very uh

1706
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:19,680
intuitive like physical personal like

1707
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,180
visualization and most of the time he's

1708
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,220
right so yeah

1709
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:24,680
foreign

1710
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,240
experiencing a projective geometry or

1711
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,280
what is it like to experience a

1712
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,359
projective geometry

1713
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,319
so one one problem that there's this

1714
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,700
with this model is the fact that you

1715
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,500
have so you need to force the point that

1716
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,900
Infinity to be um so the plane you take

1717
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,000
away from the projected space has to be

1718
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,099
behind and So you you're not really

1719
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:46,920
working with real Maps you when no you

1720
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,780
can always extend them that's okay but I

1721
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,339
mean the thing is if you want to see it

1722
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,220
in the way that we see it s which is we

1723
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,079
have something in front of us I find it

1724
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:58,140
a bit restrictive to say that you cannot

1725
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,819
see what's behind you I mean you never

1726
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:02,160
see it right I mean you can imagine it

1727
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,900
which is not the same thing because you

1728
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,839
change your frame so I can't answer

1729
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:08,579
really this question I'm just pointing

1730
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:10,440
out the fact that for me it's very

1731
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,299
perturbating to think that I have a

1732
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:14,339
plane that corresponds to uh this

1733
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:17,700
continuity uh I mean with respect to I

1734
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,980
mean I have a plane that destroys

1735
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,359
completely the way that I can think

1736
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,640
about movement behind me which is that

1737
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,200
if I had to imagine I had the whole

1738
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,819
space in that is around me and not just

1739
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:28,920
in front of me things would be very very

1740
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,319
weird in terms of Transformations but

1741
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:32,400
it's not something that is not possible

1742
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,260
possible I mean it's uh this is what

1743
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,359
happens when you take psychiatric you

1744
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:37,640
basically

1745
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,660
allows the projective transformation

1746
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,400
yeah like maybe you have all these

1747
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,440
degrees of freedom but in the perception

1748
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,920
like in some sorry motor processes this

1749
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,200
is calibrated this is restricted so we

1750
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,180
have to choose certain subset of the

1751
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,799
group basically it's just it's only

1752
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,720
certain project transformation that will

1753
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,240
be used in practice but now if you go

1754
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,400
into mystical experience or you take

1755
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,680
drugs they are going to mess precisely

1756
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,960
that's the hypothesis because with those

1757
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,280
parameters and now you have the full

1758
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,660
flight 15 degrees of freedom

1759
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,940
transformation and you see things that

1760
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:10,619
are very weird like that looks like

1761
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,599
mandalas or things like that so that's

1762
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:15,180
something you can get when you when you

1763
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,979
leave too much freedom to the projective

1764
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:21,479
action basically it's having yeah what

1765
01:08:21,479 --> 01:08:23,160
if what we're seeing quote in front of

1766
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:26,960
us is behind us or something like that

1767
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:30,080
what do you mean

1768
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,580
what was the what was the issue with not

1769
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:35,640
being able to see behind us the issue is

1770
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,339
so if you want to see the project space

1771
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:41,219
as a 3D space as a way that we skip now

1772
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:43,259
need to take away your plane and

1773
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:45,060
basically projective transformation so

1774
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,160
that is sort of playing at Infinity on

1775
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,719
which you can

1776
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,939
I mean it doesn't exist in the projected

1777
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:52,500
space it exists only in the way you

1778
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,779
define the navigation chart like a 3D

1779
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:57,120
like our R3 chart

1780
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,060
uh with the plane that is taken away and

1781
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,920
and so this plane that is behind you if

1782
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,259
you apply a projective transformation

1783
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:05,939
like in front of you everything will

1784
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:08,100
seem fine you're You're Expecting like

1785
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,080
it's things that you experience but then

1786
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,060
once what happened is that it can send

1787
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,859
things at the infinity back behind you

1788
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:16,140
and so this is something that is a bit I

1789
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:19,259
mean for me I'm very on on I mean it's

1790
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:22,259
if I so you can write it explicitly

1791
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,759
there's no problem mathematically but if

1792
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,799
it's really the way that we experience

1793
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:28,319
it it's extremely weird to think about

1794
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,120
so I prefer not thinking about it so

1795
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,160
this is the only thing I and I don't

1796
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,380
think drugs so I'll leave it to other

1797
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,479
people I mean it's really a good it's

1798
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,000
true that taking drugs in this context

1799
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,979
makes complete like you can you could

1800
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:44,399
model it in the projective framework and

1801
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,839
not in the euclidean framework because

1802
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,640
you have a huge amount of protective

1803
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,100
Transformations that make sense more

1804
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,719
than the one that are related to actions

1805
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:53,580
in there so in in the presentation I

1806
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,020
give there was a way to relay attack

1807
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,300
like a cleaning friends to protect the

1808
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,760
frames under certain actions and in fact

1809
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,620
you have a huge much bigger space of

1810
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,600
projective Transformations than the one

1811
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,660
that are restricted through by uh

1812
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,420
the actions of the agents so the action

1813
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,760
of the agent inside of the real space so

1814
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,920
the occlusion space induced projective

1815
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,960
transformation in its internal world but

1816
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,100
there are much more projective

1817
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,199
transformation than these actions and so

1818
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:20,940
you can imagine in this setting having

1819
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,640
like very confusing States uh of your

1820
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,380
mind in a way it's really a good friend

1821
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,060
like this

1822
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,920
which you cannot in the application case

1823
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,440
so

1824
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,320
I wonder if if a creature with or a

1825
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:41,040
robot with 360 degree cameras

1826
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:45,060
would it not be so perplexed as it

1827
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,699
wouldn't necessarily have a visual

1828
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:51,719
before or a visual in front and behind

1829
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:53,400
and the thing is how do you glue them

1830
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,380
together

1831
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,420
they still have to pick a point you

1832
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,560
still have to pick a point of

1833
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,500
convergence right I mean you need to you

1834
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,179
need to find a way to do multi-modal

1835
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:05,640
integration like if you if you want to

1836
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,860
have a camera that's 360 uh you have if

1837
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,360
you have the space to represent it so

1838
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,739
maybe you can represent it as a sphere

1839
01:11:10,739 --> 01:11:13,080
and in this case the sense

1840
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,659
the sensors the sensors are different so

1841
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:17,820
it's it's not necessarily the same the

1842
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,679
same robot than the models that we are

1843
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,179
considering but there might be also

1844
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:23,940
another homogeneous space so a g space

1845
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,260
which is a space acting like which

1846
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,120
corresponds to the rotations of the uh

1847
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,179
of uh of uh like if you say that it can

1848
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:32,400
look 360 and then you can rotate and the

1849
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,140
space of observation stays the same so

1850
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:36,000
you can always imagine acting on it and

1851
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,640
so you can imagine like having another

1852
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,900
g-space structure and the good thing

1853
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,420
about it is just with respect to the

1854
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,340
perspective if you have an agent that

1855
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,900
can take a different perspective on this

1856
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,060
environment which depends on its sensors

1857
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,460
and its actions and the kind of data you

1858
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,020
have then you can Define G space and you

1859
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,760
can do exactly the same setting

1860
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,280
everything like it's it's made in the

1861
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,620
morals General more General context so

1862
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,600
you can apply it and so it's not limited

1863
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,159
only to the

1864
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,800
projective case I like we come from the

1865
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,260
PCM projective Consciousness model

1866
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:11,040
but uh I mean the the framework now are

1867
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,840
at least the way to replace this

1868
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,199
framework inside of uh optimal control

1869
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:19,500
is uh well adapted for any change of

1870
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,659
perspective and nothing and not just

1871
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:24,060
projective

1872
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:26,040
awesome well

1873
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,719
Where Are You Gonna

1874
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,480
go to next where will the epistemic

1875
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,600
drive take you

1876
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,520
carrying forward

1877
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,800
so that there are two projects now so

1878
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,900
the first one is to be able to be like

1879
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,620
have a maybe that we can talk but but is

1880
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:46,260
to be able to uh to get uh so to

1881
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,140
implement it so that it can be used for

1882
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,360
uh monitoring behaviors or to be able to

1883
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,880
predict behaviors or to analyze it so if

1884
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,500
you have a model of behaviors of Agents

1885
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,780
like maladaptive behaviors think that we

1886
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,400
already published but in more limited

1887
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,920
context now to make it inside of a

1888
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,420
computational framework so that we can

1889
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,699
use it to analyze like experiments with

1890
01:13:05,699 --> 01:13:07,679
humans so this is the first project

1891
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,659
which is ongoing with several students

1892
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,640
so on the page that I put on my on the

1893
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,679
first slide there's all the work that

1894
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:14,940
we're doing the people who are working

1895
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,040
with us and we're very grateful for them

1896
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,380
working with us and all the ongoing work

1897
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,900
in this direction and there's the second

1898
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,960
one which is more like say machine

1899
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,159
learning and so for me it's very

1900
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,900
important you have effective algorithms

1901
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,340
things I mean like things that you can

1902
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,080
really use in practice things that you

1903
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,000
can really Implement and implementing

1904
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,440
when you have group structures there are

1905
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,239
many many problems that appear how to do

1906
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:37,679
sarcastic optimal control when the

1907
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,540
latent space is a homogeneous space it's

1908
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,580
I think a completely open question when

1909
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:42,780
I start you have answers in this

1910
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,000
direction so I hope hopefully the the

1911
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,719
work will go out come out soon let's say

1912
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,960
uh January or something like this but

1913
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,340
it's there's a huge work in this

1914
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,580
direction

1915
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,520
cool anything else you want to add

1916
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,770
thank you very much for the invitation

1917
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,080
[Music]

1918
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,120
a lot to

1919
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,219
think about Slash

1920
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:11,640
mentally rotate slash project I mean

1921
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,739
after all as you even alluded to with

1922
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:15,840
communication

1923
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,440
yeah this is a perspective taking

1924
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,659
question

1925
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:24,780
Technologies adding some new flavors and

1926
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,040
methods

1927
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,219
for example

1928
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:30,300
asynchronous communication but it's

1929
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,860
synchronous for the agent when they

1930
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,480
perceive it but all these different

1931
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,900
modalities of communication and

1932
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:40,020
it's quite interesting to think about

1933
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,940
and just really cool that you and

1934
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,100
colleagues are pursuing that from

1935
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,380
empirical

1936
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:50,159
data analytic and from theoretical

1937
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,980
mathematical approaches

1938
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:55,260
I mean on this side for communication I

1939
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,360
think and so it's something I I find

1940
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,100
extremely interesting like more

1941
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,659
generally if some people want to some

1942
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:01,860
people want to work on the project

1943
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,020
please tell us and I will be very happy

1944
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:06,239
and if you and even if you have money

1945
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,100
please tell us and who are very happy

1946
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,000
here so

1947
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,679
I agree

1948
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,040
great great we were very open you can

1949
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,480
always send us a mail we'll be very

1950
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,320
happy to discuss about this week

1951
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,860
okay well thank you again to to um all

1952
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,659
till next time

1953
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:28,739
okay

1954
01:15:28,739 --> 01:15:32,178
see ya bye bye
