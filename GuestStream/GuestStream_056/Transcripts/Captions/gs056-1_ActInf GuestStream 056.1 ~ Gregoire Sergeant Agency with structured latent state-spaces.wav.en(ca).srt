00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,794
Hello and welcome. It's September 15,

2
00:00:02,842 --> 00:00:05,834
2023 and we're at the Active Inference

3
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:08,686
Institute in active guest stream number

4
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:12,362
56.1. Today we have Gregory Sargent

5
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:15,150
Petri and we'll be hearing a talk

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,406
followed by a discussion on geometry of

7
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:20,814
world model influences behaviors. First

8
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:23,550
there'll be a presentation and then any

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,302
comments that people have in the live

10
00:00:25,356 --> 00:00:28,006
chat or any other questions. It will be

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,982
great to talk. So thank you a lot for

12
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:33,174
coming, really looking forward to this.

13
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:36,678
So please to you. Thank you

14
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:38,134
very much, Daniel, for the invitation

15
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:40,906
first, it's really very happy to be able

16
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:43,626
to present this work here. So it's a

17
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:48,234
work around some models of

18
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:50,070
consciousness, at least some

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,674
computational models of consciousness,

20
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:53,086
some part of consciousness, and how it

21
00:00:53,108 --> 00:00:55,646
can help to generate different kind of

22
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:59,182
behaviors, especially when we think

23
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:00,880
about, let's say,

24
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,986
artificial agents. So I'm Gregor

25
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,830
Santui. It's a work in collaboration

26
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,286
with david Rodrof, kenneth willie

27
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:12,962
Ford, Daniel Benka. In fact, it's not

28
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:15,106
just one work. It'S a collection of

29
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:18,258
works that have been on for already

30
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,326
around ten years. So if you want to know

31
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:22,966
more. About this group and the work that

32
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:24,886
we're doing, you can go on the page, on

33
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:26,454
my personal Web page, and there's a link

34
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:30,630
to PCM HTML, and. There'S a summary

35
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,890
of all the work. We'Ve been doing and

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,266
some summary of. The work we've been

37
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:38,826
doing and also of some articles that can

38
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,470
be relevant on this subject. So today

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,902
we'll focus more particularly on two

40
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:46,526
articles. So one that is accepted and

41
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:47,886
will appear very soon, the other one

42
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,530
need to resubmit, which give formulation

43
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,954
of, let's say,

44
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,300
autonomous agents or let's say

45
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,218
mathematical formulation of agents that

46
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:03,086
have a world model that is structured

47
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:04,834
geometrically in such a way that this

48
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:06,726
world model captures some features of

49
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:09,862
consciousness. So the first article is,

50
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:13,286
let's say. The review of the

51
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:15,046
experimental results that. We have and

52
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,446
the most recent formalism. That we have

53
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:22,454
on our work, which is the

54
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,946
literature on POMD partial cerebral

55
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,286
stream process, which is optimal

56
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:28,682
control, stochastic optimal control.

57
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,874
And we just try to tweak a. Bit this

58
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:33,482
formalism to introduce the ideas. With

59
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,502
how you can include inside of the world

60
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,166
model of the agent some. Ideas on

61
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:39,006
consciousness and still continue to.

62
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,846
Have algorithms to do inference to find

63
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:42,846
optimal policies and everything. The

64
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:44,354
Zecholia article focuses more

65
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:47,074
particularly on how changing the world

66
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:50,162
model of the agent can change its

67
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,826
behavior, in particular the

68
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:54,322
relationship, the geometry of the world

69
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:56,226
model, the way that it perceives its

70
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:59,202
environment and the way it acts with

71
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:01,878
respect to for agent strategy. So the

72
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:03,366
way that it looks for something, so it

73
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:04,886
will change its behavior in looking for

74
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:07,106
something. So I will start by presenting

75
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:09,594
a. Bit what are all these terms? So,

76
00:03:09,632 --> 00:03:11,738
world model, why you need it. What is a

77
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,466
foraging strategy? How can you define an

78
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,370
agent that is looking for a certain

79
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,802
object? In particular, what is an

80
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:22,006
exploration based on Curiosity or let's

81
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:24,218
say more technically epistemic value.

82
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,046
So let's consider the setting where you

83
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,298
have, let's say, a real world, so that's

84
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:30,240
the space that surround us, 3d space.

85
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,798
You do a setup where you have an agent

86
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,926
which is, let's say, a solid it has a

87
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,778
solid frame, so it has a center three

88
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:38,306
axis. What is in front, what is on its

89
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:40,718
side, what is above? Above it. And it's

90
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,882
looking for an object O, which is itself

91
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:46,006
a solid inside of R three. And all the

92
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:48,086
configuration of the agents and the

93
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:51,286
objects they are defined by, let's say,

94
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:54,822
a reference frame that is external and

95
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:56,774
that characterizes completely their

96
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:58,470
configuration inside of this world.

97
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,594
Now, the agent A, what it wants to do is

98
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:05,114
to find for the object O. But it can

99
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:07,114
only have some noisy observation of

100
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:10,042
where the object O is. So to be able to

101
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:13,106
find O, it needs to have some atriorian

102
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:16,990
where O should be to be able to plan

103
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,694
the consequences of its actions with

104
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:22,494
respect to where O will be once it has

105
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:25,566
moved and to update,

106
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:29,582
to be able to plan how the observation

107
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,666
can act with respect to updating its

108
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,746
prior. So, in another words, so you have

109
00:04:33,768 --> 00:04:35,650
an agent and the agent is looking for O.

110
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,378
It thinks that O is, for example. In

111
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:38,638
this direction, on the right. So it's

112
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,746
going to move towards the right and

113
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,622
makes an observation. If it doesn't see

114
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:43,446
O, it's going to change its belief on

115
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:45,270
where O is. So this is a very standard

116
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,334
formalism that you can find like in

117
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:50,246
POMDP stochastic optimal control. But

118
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:53,354
the one other point we want to really

119
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:55,850
emphasize is the fact that the agent A

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,106
has its own frame of reference and the

121
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,746
way that it's going to give the

122
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:02,862
coordinates of the object, the way that

123
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,240
it will trace where the object is, is

124
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,614
using its own way of computing the

125
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:11,614
coordinates of O. So it has its own way

126
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:13,706
to measure where O is. So it doesn't

127
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:16,466
have to refer to a global frame, a

128
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:18,466
global coordinate system, to be able to

129
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:21,154
know where O is. So for example, I am

130
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:24,050
always centered on myself. When I move,

131
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,330
I see the object. I don't think about

132
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,502
me moving, but I think about the object

133
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:31,254
moving. And this is because when I move,

134
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,558
I change my frame. So the way I'm going

135
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:35,174
to reference the object is going to

136
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:37,446
change accordingly. And the point we

137
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:39,206
want to introduce is the fact that you

138
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:42,186
can have several ways for the agent to

139
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,186
define its own coordinate system with

140
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,866
respect to its environment. And this is

141
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:49,366
a key feature that we want to capture

142
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:51,726
in terms of modeling. But also we think

143
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:53,422
that it is something that is very

144
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:55,278
structuring with respect to models of

145
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:57,246
consciousness. Because when you consider

146
00:05:57,348 --> 00:05:58,800
more generally an agent.

147
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,826
Let'S say, that has a world. Model in

148
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:09,778
which it has its own point of

149
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,842
view perspective on this world model.

150
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:15,518
You kind of start tackling

151
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:17,654
the problem of how to introduce a point

152
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:20,758
of view on the environment of the agent.

153
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:22,840
How can you introduce, in the way that

154
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,402
it is going to encode its environment,

155
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,054
a certain point of view? And in

156
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:30,106
particular, if you think about. It in

157
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:33,674
terms of the role of. Space to be able

158
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,818
to take into account your own

159
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,834
perspective on the environment. You can

160
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:40,254
see that if you take away everything

161
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,966
that fills up the space, you keep just

162
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:43,360
the space itself.

163
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,406
The space allows you to, let's say, to

164
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,390
structure the way that you are going to

165
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,906
fill in some information about the

166
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:56,034
environment. And it's centered on your

167
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:58,114
own point of view in a way that when

168
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,386
you're going to act, you're still going

169
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:04,146
to keep the

170
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:06,994
unfilled space, you're still going to

171
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:09,366
keep the same way of modeling this

172
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,766
space. The space will stay the same when

173
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,446
you move. When I move, the space is the

174
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:16,534
same. But I took into account the fact

175
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,614
that I can move from one point to

176
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:20,546
another in this space without changing

177
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:22,234
the space. And something that is also

178
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:24,234
very important is that with respect to

179
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:26,330
any movement that I can do, the space

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,362
doesn't change. So there's no particular

181
00:07:28,496 --> 00:07:30,106
point in space. With respect to the

182
00:07:30,128 --> 00:07:31,260
movements that I do.

183
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,438
Another property that is very similar is

184
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:36,926
that instead of considering just my

185
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:38,734
actions and the way that I can change my

186
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:41,326
frame while I'm doing an action, you can

187
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:42,718
also imagine taking the frame of

188
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:45,106
somebody else. So it means that you see

189
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:48,146
that the space that you use to be able

190
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,270
to structure your environment doesn't

191
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,314
change when you take the perspective of

192
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:54,942
somebody else. For example, if you

193
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,462
imagine yourself as a solid agent

194
00:07:57,596 --> 00:08:01,542
changing by a rotation your own

195
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:05,222
solid frame and translating, okay,

196
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,566
so this is something that we will use in

197
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,210
fact as a definition for the state

198
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,118
space, the way that the agent encodes

199
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:15,738
its environment. And you will see that

200
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:18,758
there's a natural notion that encodes

201
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:20,650
this idea that you can change

202
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,386
perspective on your environment, on the

203
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,454
world model that you have of your

204
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:27,546
environment, simply by introducing

205
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:28,718
something that's very well known, which

206
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,558
is the notion of a group acting on a

207
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:32,814
certain space. So this is just to sum up

208
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,790
a bit what we're trying to do. So we're

209
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,262
just trying to do like exploration

210
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:38,766
inside of an environment, but we're

211
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,866
adding additional information, which is

212
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,474
that the way the agents is going to

213
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:45,054
encode its environment takes into

214
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:47,240
consideration the fact that it can

215
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,166
change its reference frame on this space

216
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,360
without singling out any point.

217
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,282
Okay, so what do we mean by perspective

218
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:59,126
taking more precisely? So how

219
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:01,686
do we go from the real world? So let's

220
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:05,430
say the world described by the external

221
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,562
frame that allows you to say the agent

222
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,306
is here and the object is here from the

223
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:11,594
internal world of the agent. So you just

224
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:13,514
define a map that will take into

225
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,406
consideration that the agent can have a

226
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:16,938
first perspective on its environment.

227
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,862
The simplest case in the Euclidean case

228
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,926
is just rewriting the coordinates of O

229
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:22,430
inside of the frame of the agent,

230
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,786
reference frame of the agent. And then

231
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:27,774
once the agent moves, its frame solid

232
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:30,114
frame in the real world changes. And

233
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,814
this induces indeed a transformation

234
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:34,978
inside of its internal world, which will

235
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:36,630
lead in a fine transformation.

236
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,862
Okay, but you could imagine also having

237
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,086
other transformations. I don't know if

238
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:45,800
you can see my mouse probably.

239
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,240
Can you see my mouse or not? No. Okay,

240
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,440
so the map CSI can also be

241
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,158
something else than an affined

242
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:58,426
transformation. It could be like any

243
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:00,746
kind of transformation. For example, in

244
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,758
an affined case, the apparent volume of

245
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:05,406
the object doesn't change. But if you

246
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:06,766
change this map and consider, for

247
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,778
example, a projective transformation,

248
00:10:08,954 --> 00:10:11,966
as we will describe later, you can have

249
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:13,426
that the size, apparent size of the

250
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:16,514
object changes. So we went from

251
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:19,074
something that is. A bit already very

252
00:10:19,112 --> 00:10:21,422
well known and not very innovative,

253
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,810
which is that you. Can rewrite.

254
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,246
The motions, depends on the. Frame that

255
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:30,566
you choose to describe them. Into,

256
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:33,382
saying that you can in fact change some

257
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:36,280
frames to be able to account for some

258
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,460
perceptive property.

259
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,266
And what we ask also for the agents that

260
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,554
we consider is that they can imagine the

261
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:46,682
consequences of their moves, which on

262
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:50,234
their future observations. So this is

263
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:51,898
something just to say that the agents

264
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,074
that we consider have a notion of

265
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,918
agency, which is that they can plan the

266
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,406
consequences of their actions so that

267
00:10:57,428 --> 00:10:58,878
they can choose the best action with

268
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:00,286
respect to a certain reward. In

269
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:02,474
particular, the reward that we consider.

270
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:04,994
Is trying to maximize a certain

271
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:05,810
surprise.

272
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,626
So to sum it up, we have an agent that

273
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:14,066
is looking for certain objects. So it

274
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:16,758
has beliefs of where this object is.

275
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,534
And the beliefs lives on an

276
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:22,374
internal state space. So on a world

277
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:25,734
model of the environment, it can make

278
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,310
observation, which allows it to update

279
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,410
its beliefs and then it can predict the

280
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,866
consequences of its actions so that it

281
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:36,266
can plan the way that it should act with

282
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:37,914
respect to a certain objective. So

283
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:39,674
formally, this is simply the notion of

284
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:41,226
Markov decision process, or more

285
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:42,614
generally, like the notion of partially

286
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:44,494
observable Markov. Decision process

287
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:46,830
because we do not have. A complete

288
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,630
information of the environment, but only

289
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,146
some observations that are limited.

290
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:57,440
And it's very related. And let's say.

291
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,782
There'S a strong duality between POMDP

292
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,434
and active inference. So there is really

293
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:05,940
a strong link between both.

294
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,518
So now what I did in the

295
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:12,114
way that I presented it so I presented

296
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:14,422
it the idea I tried to present the idea

297
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,550
of what we're doing. So the general

298
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,846
context POMDPs agents that. Are planning

299
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,370
their action with respect to a certain

300
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,514
objective. Here the objective is to find

301
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:27,114
a. Certain object and I

302
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:30,506
give the formal setting for defining it

303
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,002
which are NDP PMDP. And now I will go

304
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,606
one step further and define it

305
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,414
explicitly and I will continue like this

306
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:38,526
approach for the second part where I

307
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,174
will also present our results and our

308
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:41,726
specificity, where I'll dealt with a

309
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:43,454
general statement, then a bit more

310
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:46,378
precise and then really digging into the

311
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:49,266
result. So here the classical way to

312
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:50,946
define a Markup decision process is to

313
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:52,546
consider that you have a set of

314
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:53,902
configurations of the environment,

315
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:55,474
which is the state space or of the world

316
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:57,186
model in. The way, or at least the way.

317
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,206
That you encode your environment. So

318
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,054
this is something on which you can act,

319
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:03,606
because the agent, when it makes an

320
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:05,126
action, it changes the state of the

321
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:08,426
environment. And the way that the

322
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,906
actions change the environment is with

323
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:15,050
respect to a. Certain Markov kernel,

324
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,614
probability kernel. So it's stochastic,

325
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:20,970
which means that each actions changes

326
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,506
the state of the environment. But you

327
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:24,158
don't know completely. It's not

328
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:26,446
deterministic. You allow some errors in

329
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:28,110
the way that it acts on the environment,

330
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,942
and you have a reward for a function

331
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:32,718
that is associated to the actions that

332
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:34,434
you can do at time T and also the state

333
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:38,894
of the agent at time t. A partially

334
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:40,546
observable Markov decision process is

335
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:41,854
the same thing than a Markov decision

336
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:45,154
process. But you authorize to say that

337
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,834
your observation on your environment are

338
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:49,126
only partial, which means that you do

339
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:52,246
not have a precise information

340
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,806
on the state of the environment. So the

341
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:56,594
way that you need to relate observation

342
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:58,550
and states is through also a probability

343
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,966
kernel, which tells you that if you're

344
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:06,506
at state, for example S, you would

345
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,710
expect to make a certain observation.

346
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,710
Let's say if you think the object is at

347
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,734
X, you expect to see the object at X,

348
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,078
but with a certain error because you

349
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:19,310
know that your sensors are also random,

350
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,622
they can make some mistakes and you keep

351
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,718
similarly a reward function. So it's the

352
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:26,486
same thing that an MDP mark audition

353
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:29,300
process, but you just allow to have some

354
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,654
to get information on your environment

355
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:34,274
through observations that are not

356
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:36,994
complete. In fact, there's a formulation

357
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,106
in terms of partially observable Markov

358
00:14:39,138 --> 00:14:41,574
decision processes. Our particular case

359
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:43,414
of Markov decision processes, which is

360
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:46,562
called belief MDPs,

361
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:50,326
belief Markov decision process and the

362
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,586
only difference that you have between

363
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,898
Markov process and belief MDP is the

364
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,494
fact that the state space is necessarily

365
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,574
continuous in the second case. So POMDPs

366
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:59,114
can be seen as a particular case of

367
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:03,786
MDPs. So we

368
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:06,958
said that the actions of a POMDP act on

369
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:09,518
the state space and you account for the

370
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:11,054
consequences of the actions only through

371
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:13,966
observations. So graphically it means

372
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:15,586
that you have the state space of your so

373
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:18,514
the world model of your environment X on

374
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:21,874
which you reference for example, where

375
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,906
the object is. So the position of the

376
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:26,862
object and then when you act it induces

377
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,706
a consequence on the position of the

378
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,486
object at time t plus one. And then you

379
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:32,166
can make an observation of where you

380
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:33,926
think the object will be or you can make

381
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:35,766
an observation with respect to where the

382
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:37,666
object is, depending if you're planning

383
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,014
into the future or if you're really

384
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:42,246
doing the action. You'Re implementing

385
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:43,578
the consequence of the actions. In the

386
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:45,754
real world. The thing that we're trying

387
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,494
to do in our setting is to replace

388
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:49,994
simply the actions by a change of

389
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,118
perspective. Like I told you, when the

390
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:55,486
agent acts, its coordinate system on the

391
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:57,502
environment changes. So you can always

392
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,286
see it in a way passively, where you

393
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:02,282
just see it as a change of coordinates.

394
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,698
So we want to say that instead of

395
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,430
considering actions on the environment,

396
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,786
we have a space on which there's a

397
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:10,782
natural notion of changing of reference

398
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:13,170
frame and actions are simply certain

399
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,290
kind of changes of frames. We also allow

400
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,966
to have some actions that do not

401
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:20,934
correspond to changes of frames. We just

402
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:23,494
say that we include the possibility that

403
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,526
some actions are changes of frames and

404
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:27,334
the changes of frames have something

405
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:29,194
that is related to all the

406
00:16:29,232 --> 00:16:32,154
transformations that are internal for

407
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,442
the agents. So for example, things that

408
00:16:34,496 --> 00:16:36,890
it knows that a priori,

409
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,386
it's encoded in the way the agents will

410
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:40,810
interact with the environment.

411
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,846
So the way that we do it a bit more

412
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:47,354
formally is that we say that changing

413
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:49,946
perspective is simply through the action

414
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:52,926
of a group. So for example, in the

415
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:56,800
affine case, when the agent

416
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,278
moves, a change of frame is an affine

417
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:02,322
transformation and we say that the world

418
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:05,606
model. So the state space is simply a

419
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:07,814
space on which the group acts. So

420
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:11,526
formally, what does it mean that the

421
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,462
group acts on the space? It's just

422
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:17,718
saying that you have

423
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:21,626
a space. S group g.

424
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,786
There's an application that goes that

425
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,786
takes an element from g and S and that

426
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:28,202
sends back S. In other words, for every

427
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,186
g you can associate a function. From s

428
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,586
to s. And you assume also that it has

429
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,366
good properties, which is that it

430
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,878
satisfies equation one and. That if you

431
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:38,958
don't move, you stay. At the same place.

432
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,294
So this is like just the notion of a g

433
00:17:41,332 --> 00:17:44,642
space, a group acting on space. But now

434
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,426
if we want to include this in MDPs and

435
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:51,362
POMDPs, we just assume that the state

436
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,590
space is a g space, that some actions

437
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,442
are some elements of the group, and that

438
00:17:57,496 --> 00:17:58,670
when we choose the actions that

439
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,134
corresponds to the element of the group,

440
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:01,990
it corresponds to the way that the group

441
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,142
acts on the element. So there is nothing

442
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,174
like very convoluted. It's just saying

443
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,774
that you define the. Collection of

444
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:11,066
functions which you see as. Changes of

445
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:13,754
frames and the way that they act. So the

446
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:15,834
probability kernel from the state.

447
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:18,666
Space to the state space at time. T to

448
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:21,594
time t plus one after the action, after

449
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:23,130
the change of perspective is simply

450
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,454
through the way that the function

451
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,558
changes the state space. So it's just

452
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:30,574
kind of a way of reformulation. But what

453
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,606
is really hidden behind here is that we

454
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,554
have the structure of the group and that

455
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,374
we don't consider any kind of actions.

456
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:39,326
We assume that there is more structure

457
00:18:39,438 --> 00:18:41,090
in the actions that we can consider.

458
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,058
And that it's defined in

459
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:48,158
the way that it's encoded inside of the

460
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:50,326
geometry. Of the space that we have. So

461
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:51,766
we don't separate any more action and

462
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:54,886
state space. We say that the state space

463
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,254
in its geometry encodes already certain

464
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,126
kind of actions which are its change of

465
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:01,046
perspectives. So there are two case that

466
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:02,746
we consider. The first case is where the

467
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,114
state S is the Occlusion space and g,

468
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,340
the FN transformation. It corresponds to

469
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,134
translations and rotations of the agents

470
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,506
and changing rewriting the coordinates

471
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:15,274
of the object inside of the solid

472
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,886
reference frame of the agent. And the

473
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:21,198
second case where the space space is

474
00:19:21,204 --> 00:19:23,426
a projected space and the group is a

475
00:19:23,448 --> 00:19:24,770
projected transformation.

476
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,534
We described what are the generative

477
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:31,154
models that we consider and how we can

478
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,726
include inside of the classical theory

479
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:36,166
of POMDPs the fact that you can take a

480
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:39,922
perspective on your environment.

481
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:43,074
Now we will introduce like a classical

482
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:45,686
notion of epistemic value which will

483
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:49,142
allow us to define what is behavior,

484
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:51,546
what is an exploratory behavior with

485
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:54,586
respect to curiosity. So what it is for

486
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:57,654
an agent to explore its environment

487
00:19:57,702 --> 00:20:01,962
based on curiosity. So curiosity,

488
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,270
or let's say the drive for exploration

489
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,130
is quantity

490
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,266
that will it's, it's a quantity that you

491
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:17,970
will okay, so it's,

492
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,946
okay it's so how do you define it?

493
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:26,258
Just with like very generally. So you

494
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:28,582
start with the agent has a prior on the

495
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,690
state of its environment, then it plans

496
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,646
the consequence of one of its move at

497
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:37,830
the next time, at the next time step.

498
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,614
So this changes the prior that it has on

499
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:41,786
the environment because there's an

500
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,098
action on the environment. So we get a

501
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:46,506
new prior and now it's going to make an

502
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:49,478
observation. So it imagines that it's

503
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:51,374
going to make an observation. Once it

504
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:53,806
makes an observation there's an

505
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:56,478
apostrophe, the prior is updated. So you

506
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:58,286
get an apostrophe. The way that you

507
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:00,586
define curiosity or let's say epistemic

508
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:03,666
value is how informative is the

509
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:07,810
observation that you will do, how far is

510
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,186
the apostrophe from the Apuri? But you

511
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,902
cannot do it for one given observation

512
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:16,514
because the way that you compute it is

513
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:18,354
by planning what will happen at the next

514
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:19,926
step. So you need to consider all the

515
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:21,670
possible observation that you will make.

516
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,398
So the observations are themselves

517
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,974
stochastic with respect to the way that

518
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:28,666
you consider with respect to a priori on

519
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:31,980
the state space of a time t.

520
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,954
As we said, forest actions are

521
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:39,814
changes of frame. So we can also define

522
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:42,570
epistemic value for frames for changes

523
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,474
of frames and in particular something

524
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,566
that we gain, that is I think

525
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:47,118
interesting is that now we have a

526
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:49,870
function that is defined. On a group

527
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,566
that can be a continuous group. So you

528
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:53,598
can allow to have for example, if you

529
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,666
want to maximize it, you can or minimize

530
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:58,340
it, I mean. It depends how you see it.

531
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,466
You could do gradient descent for

532
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:02,942
example, so you can have more analytical

533
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:05,174
tools because you're on a space that is

534
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:08,278
continuous and has some structure. So

535
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:10,790
now to give the formal definition of

536
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,320
epistemic value, so as I said,

537
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,494
it's based on the quantity C that I will

538
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:20,806
define now. So if you give yourself a

539
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:23,242
prior on a space x and you give yourself

540
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:25,046
a probability kernel. So a stochastic

541
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,146
map from X to Y, stochastic map is

542
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:29,866
simply saying that for any x you will

543
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,580
associate a measure on Y.

544
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,726
Then you can get a joint distribution on

545
00:22:35,748 --> 00:22:37,726
x and Y, which is simply given by the

546
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:40,510
product p y knowing x times the prior.

547
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,586
And in fact the quantity C is simply the

548
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:45,940
mutual information between x and Y,

549
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,526
which is saying how far is the joint

550
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,450
distribution with respect to the

551
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,250
independent distribution, the product of

552
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,590
the marginal distribution on X and on Y.

553
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,546
But this is like you see it appears

554
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:02,566
everywhere the mutual information. So

555
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:04,390
this formulation is based on the paper

556
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,298
that is from fiston and all active

557
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:10,146
inference and the Pacific value. Mutual

558
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:11,266
information is something that appears

559
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:12,486
everywhere. But I think that there's a

560
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,214
very. Nice re expression of the mutual

561
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:16,186
information which allows to give a

562
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,406
better interpretation of this quantity,

563
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,314
which is the interpretation. That I was

564
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:22,298
discussing in the previous slide. So if

565
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:23,966
you rewrite mutual information, you can

566
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:26,026
always see it as the coolBACK lyler

567
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:28,638
distance between the Aposterior for a

568
00:23:28,644 --> 00:23:30,986
given observation and the prior coolBACK

569
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:32,654
distance being a way of computing how

570
00:23:32,692 --> 00:23:33,906
far you are, how far the two

571
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:36,034
distribution are. But you need to look

572
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:37,746
at the expectation with respect to the

573
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:39,326
observation that you make. So it's

574
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:41,060
exactly what I was discussing before.

575
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:47,042
So then this is like for any

576
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:50,214
kernel, any kernel from x to Y with

577
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:53,634
a prior on x. But as we were discussing

578
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,446
here, you have to take into so this

579
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:57,126
would be the kernel, but you have to

580
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:58,646
take into consideration that you can do

581
00:23:58,668 --> 00:24:00,954
actions and that your prior R on X. So

582
00:24:00,992 --> 00:24:04,202
the way to compute epistemic value for

583
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:08,220
this kernel here when having only

584
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,994
the prior on x is that you propagate the

585
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,606
prior by the action on x one. Then you

586
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:17,306
get a prior on x one and you can define

587
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:20,286
the epistemic value for this prior and

588
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:23,694
Markov kernel which corresponds to the

589
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:25,714
randomness of your sensors which is

590
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:27,186
always fixed. And this is very

591
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,026
important, this one doesn't change even

592
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:31,618
if you change frames, the kernel that

593
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:34,146
you have relating your prior, what you

594
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,926
think about the state space relating the

595
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:37,814
state space and the observation never

596
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:42,194
changes. And so explicitly

597
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:44,690
this means that after a certain action

598
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,650
or after a certain change of frame,

599
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,170
you get a joint distribution on x and y,

600
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,106
which is the following one here. So this

601
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:55,002
corresponds to the prior propagated on x

602
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:58,266
one and then the epistemic value is

603
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,074
simply the mutual information of this

604
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:02,206
joint distribution. So now how does the

605
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:04,446
algorithm work? The algorithm that

606
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:07,482
corresponds to defining an exploratory

607
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:09,214
behavior for an agent that is looking

608
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:12,754
for so we started with a prior of where

609
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:15,662
O should be. Then you maximize curiosity

610
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:19,614
based on some changes of frames

611
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:23,262
that are around the identity elements

612
00:25:23,326 --> 00:25:25,410
which correspond to not changing frame.

613
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,054
Then you get an action that you can

614
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:30,326
apply, you propagate the prior to the

615
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:32,614
next step with this action and then you

616
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:35,014
just update your Apiori with respect to

617
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:37,426
a certain observation and then it loops

618
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,306
back. So this is the algorithm that we

619
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,860
consider in the second paper

620
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,246
that was listed in the presentation,

621
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:48,634
which corresponds to having an agent

622
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,438
that is looking for a certain object.

623
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:53,774
Its behavior is defined by an

624
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:57,694
exploratory, is driven by

625
00:25:57,732 --> 00:26:01,258
exploration, driven by curiosity,

626
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:03,582
taking into account that its state space

627
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:05,278
is structured by the action of a.

628
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:06,706
Group, so that its state space is

629
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:08,674
structured by the fact that it

630
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:11,220
corresponds. To all the possible ways of

631
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,306
changing frames. So it has inside of the

632
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:15,926
state space, inside of the geometry of

633
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:18,054
the state space, all the possible ways

634
00:26:18,092 --> 00:26:19,430
of changing frames.

635
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,814
And this is like explicitly what we do.

636
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:27,846
So in this context, this is the.

637
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,426
Algorithm that we consider and nothing

638
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:31,418
else, then we get a very interesting

639
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:34,540
result. At least I find it's interesting

640
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,018
in. The way that it's presented here. I

641
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:39,914
find it interesting. And then if you go

642
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:42,266
more into detail it's because the

643
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:44,478
Ecclesian case is very particular. But

644
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,614
what you get is that if you look at the

645
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:50,094
behavior of an agent that is driven by

646
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:52,030
exploration, by curiosity,

647
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,754
but that has state space structured

648
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:02,818
by Ecclesial transformation. So the

649
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:04,850
first case where the agent is simply

650
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,374
encoding its environment in its

651
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:11,142
reference frame but nothing else, then

652
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,102
it doesn't need to move in the second

653
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:18,074
case, where the changes of

654
00:27:18,112 --> 00:27:20,086
charts are given by projective

655
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:22,230
transformations. So the way it's encoded

656
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,762
it's in transformation takes into

657
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:28,486
account a projective

658
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:31,214
deformation of its environment, then it

659
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:33,806
will always try to get closer to the

660
00:27:33,828 --> 00:27:36,282
object. So you have two very separate

661
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:39,870
behaviors. So this is something that is

662
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,970
I think is very interesting to note.

663
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,874
So before going into the details of how

664
00:27:49,912 --> 00:27:53,186
you can prove this statement, I will say

665
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:56,440
a bit more about why it's an interesting

666
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,894
perspective point of view on this

667
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:03,174
subject because and how it goes a bit

668
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:04,966
further than simply considering this

669
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:07,414
very simple setting. What you could

670
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,306
imagine is that encoding the fact that

671
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:13,066
the agent encoding the actions of the

672
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:15,274
agent directly inside of the state space

673
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:17,098
of the agent through geometry could be a

674
00:28:17,104 --> 00:28:19,418
way to stabilize the representations of

675
00:28:19,424 --> 00:28:21,918
the agent. And this is something that

676
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:24,718
we're working on now and there's already

677
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:28,494
literature in this direction. Okay, so

678
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:31,806
now let us proof the statement. And to

679
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:33,586
prove the statement, we need to give a

680
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:37,310
formal precise statement.

681
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,194
So more particularly what we were able

682
00:28:40,232 --> 00:28:43,266
to show is that if you assume that the

683
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,638
agent has as moves staying still, so

684
00:28:45,644 --> 00:28:50,040
it's allowed to stay still. Then if its

685
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,414
changes of frame are. Given by a fine

686
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:56,440
transformation, the agent stays still.

687
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,274
Now, in the projected case, if you

688
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,642
assume that the agent is always looking

689
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:07,354
in the direction of the object, it will

690
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:10,060
always try to get closer to the object.

691
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:17,040
Okay? So the idea of the proof is that

692
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,218
what plays the role for drive of

693
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:25,826
the agent is how big the agent is

694
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:29,394
appearing to is

695
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,214
the size of the object in the reference

696
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:35,266
frame of the agent and it's how big it

697
00:29:35,288 --> 00:29:37,478
appears to be to the agent. So in the

698
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,326
first case, the volume of the object in

699
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:42,754
the internal space of the agent doesn't

700
00:29:42,802 --> 00:29:45,526
change. So it doesn't need to move. In

701
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:48,520
the second case, if it makes a move,

702
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,306
what is informative is to try to make

703
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:53,526
the object bigger because once it's

704
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,134
bigger, the apostrophe will be further

705
00:29:56,182 --> 00:29:58,314
from the prior with respect to a certain

706
00:29:58,352 --> 00:30:00,626
observation. So it will always privilege

707
00:30:00,678 --> 00:30:02,894
moves that allow to make the object look

708
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:05,406
bigger. And in this case, what you can

709
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:10,526
do is you

710
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:12,174
can show that this corresponds in fact

711
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:14,494
to actions or change of frames that gets

712
00:30:14,532 --> 00:30:17,186
you closer to the object. So how do we

713
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:20,274
prove the results? So, as we said, we

714
00:30:20,312 --> 00:30:23,154
consider a change of frame from the real

715
00:30:23,192 --> 00:30:24,946
world to the internal world. Here, I

716
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:26,654
didn't consider changes of perspectives

717
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:28,526
with respect to moves. Here is simply

718
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:30,086
how you relate the real world to the

719
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:32,182
internal world. In the Euclidean case

720
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:34,086
it's clear, it's just that the way that

721
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:35,494
you write the coordinates of the object

722
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:37,586
in the solid frame in the projective

723
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,762
case it's not obvious because

724
00:30:40,816 --> 00:30:42,154
there are several ways that you can

725
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:44,650
relate the solid frame of the agent to

726
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,866
the projective frame. So one way that we

727
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,986
decided to do it is we give some set of

728
00:30:51,008 --> 00:30:52,794
axioms that we consider to be, let's

729
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:55,614
say, coherent with our own experience of

730
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:58,058
space. Which is that we feel that we're

731
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:01,102
always centered on ourself. That the

732
00:31:01,156 --> 00:31:03,278
axis of the soil frame. Of the agent

733
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:06,046
inside of 3D space. So what is in front

734
00:31:06,068 --> 00:31:07,346
of it or what is on the right, what is

735
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:09,666
top are preserved. That there is no

736
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:10,866
point in front of the object that

737
00:31:10,888 --> 00:31:13,714
appears to be at infinity and that that

738
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:16,086
near to the center of the object, the

739
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:19,254
volumes are preserved. So when you do

740
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:22,790
this formulation like this result

741
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,614
is in this article here. So the way that

742
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:30,166
we relate some solid. Frames like some

743
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:33,286
solid reference of the agent to some

744
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:35,306
projectors transformations are in this

745
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:37,034
article, in particular in proposition A,

746
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:39,306
one where we show that this set of

747
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:42,178
axioms limits the set of projected

748
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:43,646
transformation we can consider and we

749
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,946
will only have this projected

750
00:31:45,978 --> 00:31:49,294
transformation. And so the change of

751
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:51,742
frames from the external world to the

752
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:54,546
internal world is given by rewriting the

753
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:56,978
coordinates of the agent of the object

754
00:31:57,064 --> 00:31:59,074
in the solid frame of the agent and then

755
00:31:59,112 --> 00:32:01,410
applying this projective transformation.

756
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,000
So now what we defined here

757
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,954
are the maps that relate the observation

758
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:10,920
of the agent.

759
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,480
Back.

760
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,590
So we define the maps in the Euclidean

761
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,186
and projective case that relate the

762
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,618
observation of the agent observation of

763
00:32:24,624 --> 00:32:27,462
the object to the way that it represents

764
00:32:27,606 --> 00:32:31,200
this object inside of its internal world

765
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,054
here. So this

766
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:38,426
is simply like the POMDP that we defined

767
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,466
before. And now once the agent doesn't

768
00:32:41,498 --> 00:32:43,914
move, it changes its ecclesian reference

769
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,806
frame. So there is a solid reference

770
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,754
frame. So from going from one side

771
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,174
reference frame to another solid

772
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:52,446
reference frame, you can, by applying

773
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:53,906
the projective transformation we had

774
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:55,842
before, define another one that we call

775
00:32:55,896 --> 00:32:58,486
PSI that goes from the state space at

776
00:32:58,508 --> 00:33:00,134
time zero to the state space after

777
00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:02,294
action, after moving. What is very

778
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:05,014
important is that we. Consider the

779
00:33:05,132 --> 00:33:08,034
Markov kernel associated to a. Noisy

780
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:10,294
observation to be of this shape here,

781
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,086
which is that if you know that the

782
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:13,626
object if you think the object is at

783
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,346
point X then you believe that the

784
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:19,386
observation will be around X in the

785
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:22,542
ball around X for a ball of a certain

786
00:33:22,596 --> 00:33:24,474
radius, which is a small radius.

787
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:27,406
Epsilon. Okay? And I need to charge my

788
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:28,720
computer, so sorry.

789
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,920
So now press epistemic value as defined

790
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,396
curve between the

791
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:00,300
previous formula.

792
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,832
What in fact that it has a very simple

793
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:08,064
expression. So the epistemic value of

794
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:10,224
the prior propagated after the

795
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:12,256
transformation phi after this changes of

796
00:34:12,278 --> 00:34:14,560
frame phi. So you have a prior here.

797
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,844
You propagate it on x one through. Phi

798
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,672
and you compute the epistemic value.

799
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:20,896
For this joint for the joint

800
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:23,604
distribution over x one. And y is given

801
00:34:23,642 --> 00:34:25,744
by this formula here. Well, it's simply

802
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,476
integrating over all the possible places

803
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:31,450
where the object could be times the

804
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:36,520
probabilistic volume of the ball

805
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,760
of size epsilon for the propagated

806
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,384
measure and logarithmic of the same

807
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:46,204
quantity. So this is very direct to

808
00:34:46,242 --> 00:34:48,876
right. You can just compute it and you

809
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:51,516
find this expression. But what you have

810
00:34:51,538 --> 00:34:52,828
already here is that if you consider an

811
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:54,332
Euclidean transformation, then the

812
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,924
quantity cubed PSI minus one b epsilon y

813
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:59,136
doesn't change. So then you have the

814
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:01,584
epistemic value that is constant. So

815
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:02,796
basically, if you try to maximize

816
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:04,604
epistemic value, maximize this quantity,

817
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:06,016
you can do anything. You have always one

818
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:08,156
move which is not to move. So you don't

819
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:09,910
move. It's okay. It's perfectly fine.

820
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,388
Now, in the second case where you. Have

821
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:14,036
the projective where you consider that.

822
00:35:14,138 --> 00:35:16,164
The way you relate environment and

823
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,936
internal world is through a projective

824
00:35:17,968 --> 00:35:19,364
transformation, then it's more

825
00:35:19,402 --> 00:35:23,144
complicated. And so you need to use

826
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:25,192
a trick which is that you know that once

827
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:27,320
an observation has been made the support

828
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,216
of the prior will be smaller. And so

829
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:32,332
after one step if you suppose that your

830
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,844
epsilon so the size. Of, let's say

831
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,444
noisiness of your sensor. Is small

832
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:39,548
enough, you have a support that is

833
00:35:39,634 --> 00:35:42,844
of the distribution that's small

834
00:35:42,882 --> 00:35:45,620
enough so that you can do an asymptoteic

835
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,896
development of the quantity in the

836
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:50,256
interval. So this is an equality, but

837
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:54,944
this is an approximation here and

838
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:56,916
now. This is very useful because now

839
00:35:56,938 --> 00:36:00,390
that, you know, doing this in a way

840
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,836
you can say that you just need

841
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:06,964
to develop this quantity at the point

842
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:09,316
where the object is really so if you do

843
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:11,576
it, you get this expression here. And

844
00:36:11,598 --> 00:36:13,304
what appears to play a role is only the

845
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:16,648
determinant of the Jacobian of a

846
00:36:16,654 --> 00:36:18,856
projective transformation which here in

847
00:36:18,878 --> 00:36:21,832
the accelerated case will be one in

848
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:25,224
projective case can be many things. So

849
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:26,972
here also it's not very clear because

850
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:29,208
how do you define CM? So CM is defined

851
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:30,828
as a composition of several maps. I

852
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:32,364
didn't go into the details but it

853
00:36:32,402 --> 00:36:35,596
corresponds to the map that are given by

854
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:39,468
the changes of frame. So if you have the

855
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:42,080
occasion space and the internal spaces

856
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,556
after moving you have a change of frame

857
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:45,936
in the Euclidean space but it

858
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:48,548
corresponds to also a change of frame in

859
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:51,476
the internal space. So the way you

860
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:53,844
define PSI is simply saying that you

861
00:36:53,882 --> 00:36:55,376
inverse the projective transformation

862
00:36:55,408 --> 00:36:58,244
from internal world to external world to

863
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,296
go at time zero. Then you apply the

864
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,088
change of frames and then you apply the

865
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,544
projective transformation to go from

866
00:37:03,582 --> 00:37:07,144
external to internal. And so it is

867
00:37:07,182 --> 00:37:09,544
exactly this formula that you have here

868
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:11,976
and which is very nice with this. And

869
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:13,496
then you have the first term that

870
00:37:13,518 --> 00:37:14,776
doesn't depend on the actions that you

871
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:15,932
do. So you don't need to take it into

872
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:17,756
account. This one will be one and then

873
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:20,636
you just need to compute this one. In

874
00:37:20,658 --> 00:37:21,804
fact this one has a very simple

875
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:24,656
expression so it's expression 2023. And

876
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:27,712
then here you can directly see which

877
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,856
moves correspond to increasing this

878
00:37:29,878 --> 00:37:32,160
quantity and decreasing this quantity

879
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,668
because we want to increase epistemic

880
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:37,584
value. And so this is the result this

881
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,524
allows to prove the result that we said

882
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:41,376
in the first day like in the several

883
00:37:41,408 --> 00:37:44,784
slides before that in the projective

884
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,676
case, if you have enough movements, if

885
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,384
you look at the object then you're

886
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,650
always going to go closer to the object.

887
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,256
A way to interpret it is as if the agent

888
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,056
it was a bit paranoiac or paranoid, a

889
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:00,184
bit like very uncertain on its own

890
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:03,372
beliefs. So it knows the object

891
00:38:03,506 --> 00:38:05,852
might be over there but it's always

892
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:07,676
uncertain. So it needs to go check and

893
00:38:07,698 --> 00:38:10,364
once it's checked it's more certain.

894
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:13,696
But still as it can always be even more

895
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:16,784
certain. It will always try to get more

896
00:38:16,822 --> 00:38:18,080
and more certainty.

897
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,264
And so I only presented in this

898
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,376
presentation all the aspects which are

899
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:27,716
more computational and the algorithm and

900
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,956
some analysis of the algorithm we

901
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:31,684
considered. But we also have some

902
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:34,416
experiments on how this setting allowed

903
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:36,064
to generate different behaviors,

904
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:38,632
behaviors that we would expect explain.

905
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:40,584
For example, some illusions like the

906
00:38:40,782 --> 00:38:42,488
Moon illusions. And I invite you, if

907
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,296
you're interested on this, to listen on

908
00:38:44,398 --> 00:38:48,970
to the online talk of

909
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,988
the MOC Four conference that was in

910
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:56,796
Oxford last week or to check out one

911
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:58,956
of these three papers. And I would like

912
00:38:58,978 --> 00:38:59,916
to thank you very much for your

913
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:00,620
attention.

914
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,590
All right, awesome. Wow.

915
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,392
Very interesting and different ways than

916
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:19,140
how I've seen the POMDP and related

917
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,030
works.

918
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,204
Okay, let's just start off with little

919
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:26,884
context and then I'll read some

920
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:28,388
questions and read some questions from

921
00:39:28,394 --> 00:39:30,712
the live chat. So what brought you to

922
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:33,530
study this question this way?

923
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,640
What question? The question of, okay,

924
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,636
did you come. From a math side and find

925
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:43,996
consciousness and geometries to be

926
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:45,916
interesting or vice versa? What kind of

927
00:39:45,938 --> 00:39:47,244
brought you to want to make this

928
00:39:47,282 --> 00:39:50,364
contribution? So at the beginning so

929
00:39:50,402 --> 00:39:54,156
when I did my PhD in maths, I was more

930
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:56,364
interested, I was interested in, let's

931
00:39:56,412 --> 00:39:59,596
say, all this idea of critical

932
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:02,896
brain hypothesis. So trying to

933
00:40:02,918 --> 00:40:04,444
understand the way that. The brain

934
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,596
processes information and makes it

935
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:09,780
something that can be exploited.

936
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,088
So the critical brain hypothesis tells

937
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,156
you that the activity of the neurons is

938
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:19,092
basically close to a certain criticality

939
00:40:19,156 --> 00:40:20,472
criticality. And the source of

940
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:22,328
statistical physics because. You can

941
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:24,696
model the activation of the. Neurons as,

942
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,544
let's say, statistical system like an

943
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:31,096
Icing model. So I worked a lot on

944
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:33,496
this. Then there's another hypothesis

945
00:40:33,528 --> 00:40:35,708
that is very. Common, which is the

946
00:40:35,714 --> 00:40:38,236
Bayesian brain hypothesis. And so the

947
00:40:38,258 --> 00:40:40,124
Bayesian brain hypothesis led. Me to

948
00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:41,884
active inference, to learning more about

949
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:44,876
optimal control, Bayesian perspective on

950
00:40:44,898 --> 00:40:45,740
optimal.

951
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,984
So my advisor was PhD advisor was.

952
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:53,744
Working with David, and they still work.

953
00:40:53,782 --> 00:40:57,360
Together on trying to implement

954
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,976
some aspects. Of consciousness and how

955
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:03,540
it can influence influence, especially

956
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,264
with their article on the Moon illusion.

957
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:09,240
So I was interested in knowing how

958
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,330
this kind of, let's say,

959
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,436
ideas simply. Like in a very naive

960
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:18,148
way, they interact with the Bayesian

961
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,756
brain hypothesis. And then I continued

962
00:41:20,788 --> 00:41:22,156
in fact, one. Of the lines of my

963
00:41:22,178 --> 00:41:23,644
research is structured like

964
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,204
algebraically structured statistics or

965
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:28,876
machine learning. And so the way that

966
00:41:28,898 --> 00:41:30,988
they see it very geometrically, in fact,

967
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:33,096
let's say geometrically or algebraic,

968
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,716
it's not the same. Thing, but it's very

969
00:41:34,738 --> 00:41:37,810
related, is something that I wanted to

970
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,360
understand a bit better, let's say, to

971
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,236
make it in a formal setting so that it's

972
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,528
simply a particular case of what is in

973
00:41:46,534 --> 00:41:49,264
the literature. So it's specifying what

974
00:41:49,302 --> 00:41:50,964
exists in the literature. And this took

975
00:41:51,002 --> 00:41:53,316
some time because I was more on the

976
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:54,772
active inference, like. The free energy

977
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:57,012
principle side. So I had to read more

978
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:59,388
about optimal control Stochastic,

979
00:41:59,424 --> 00:42:01,528
optimal control Pmdps and understand

980
00:42:01,614 --> 00:42:05,224
that in fact, what we're doing is

981
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:07,256
simply adding more structure on the.

982
00:42:07,278 --> 00:42:10,168
Latent space of the agent, on the.

983
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:13,532
State space of the agent. And doing

984
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:16,332
this allows to ask the question like why

985
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:19,644
is it useful? Why having a state

986
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:20,732
space that encodes different

987
00:42:20,786 --> 00:42:22,204
perspectives? So the motivation comes

988
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:23,752
from consciousness study, cognitive

989
00:42:23,816 --> 00:42:26,096
sciences, but why it can be useful for

990
00:42:26,118 --> 00:42:27,504
robotics. And it's always been like my

991
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:31,052
motivation. Study some statistical

992
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,736
models, more structured models. With

993
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:36,900
more a priori that can be. Useful for

994
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,456
understanding the behavior of a closed

995
00:42:39,488 --> 00:42:41,664
system like an agent, like a collection

996
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:44,624
of neurons, like even like molecular

997
00:42:44,672 --> 00:42:46,900
machines. So it's a very long answer,

998
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,230
but it's okay.

999
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,780
Cool. So you focused on the spatial

1000
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,050
movement epistemic foraging case.

1001
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,264
Is there something special about space

1002
00:43:00,382 --> 00:43:02,380
or can we also think about this

1003
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,276
perspective taking in terms of, for

1004
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:07,768
example, semantic or a narrative

1005
00:43:07,944 --> 00:43:09,340
reference frame?

1006
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,964
I think it's a very important question

1007
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:16,424
because up to now all the work reference

1008
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:18,944
will need to space. So the fang is space

1009
00:43:18,982 --> 00:43:21,536
in terms of a 3D space and not space in

1010
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,976
terms of geometry. And the fact of

1011
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:25,584
writing it as. Geometry allows to get

1012
00:43:25,622 --> 00:43:27,456
out from the classical point of view a

1013
00:43:27,478 --> 00:43:29,556
space as. A 3D space because you see

1014
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:30,916
that there's more and more like for

1015
00:43:30,938 --> 00:43:33,652
example, in geometric deep learning,

1016
00:43:33,706 --> 00:43:36,260
there's more and more the use of space

1017
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,096
to encode invariance of certain objects.

1018
00:43:38,128 --> 00:43:40,120
And these objects are not necessarily

1019
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,116
have the three dimensional structure.

1020
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:45,512
You can have objects that have higher

1021
00:43:45,566 --> 00:43:49,210
groups of environments. So I think that

1022
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,952
it's indeed using. Geometry for other

1023
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,336
contexts. And it's really the aim of

1024
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:56,892
trying. To go to this more general

1025
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:58,940
formulation. Is to be able to apply it

1026
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,956
to real world models. What I mean by

1027
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:02,396
real world models. It means the ones

1028
00:44:02,418 --> 00:44:04,156
that are learned. To be able to have an

1029
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:05,724
agent. In an open environment that will

1030
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:08,352
learn. The way it would learn its

1031
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:10,668
generative model. But they are priori

1032
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:12,464
that it can take a perspective on its

1033
00:44:12,502 --> 00:44:14,336
environment and see what it can do. So

1034
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:17,068
we really wanted to get out. From the

1035
00:44:17,094 --> 00:44:19,524
least for me, go out. From 3D space and

1036
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:22,532
go to implementing. It completely in

1037
00:44:22,586 --> 00:44:26,132
autonomous agents to kind. Of follow

1038
00:44:26,186 --> 00:44:28,316
on that. There's a question in the chat,

1039
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:30,744
great talk. I also wonder whether it

1040
00:44:30,782 --> 00:44:33,364
applies to any modality, not just visual

1041
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:35,210
spatial, but also text.

1042
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,384
Yeah, so for other modalities, like

1043
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:41,544
sound. For example, but I don't know for

1044
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:44,504
applying to text, there's a lot of work

1045
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:47,850
now on large language models and.

1046
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,524
All this idea of prompting and having

1047
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,916
these models being able to have some

1048
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:54,556
kind of imagination. So you would like

1049
00:44:54,578 --> 00:44:57,344
to have these ideas applied in this

1050
00:44:57,382 --> 00:45:00,512
context. But for now, it's not the line

1051
00:45:00,566 --> 00:45:03,152
that I'm trying to do. So I'm trying to

1052
00:45:03,206 --> 00:45:05,424
stay on deep learning. So basically take

1053
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:07,460
standard data set without considering

1054
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,772
text and just try to see. How these

1055
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:14,612
ideas, like in geometric deep learning,

1056
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:17,728
can stabilize representations. So it's

1057
00:45:17,744 --> 00:45:20,164
not the same that it's clearly other

1058
00:45:20,202 --> 00:45:21,940
modalities, especially if we consider

1059
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,744
like, multimodal integration. Like, you

1060
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:26,488
try to rebuild the state space and you

1061
00:45:26,494 --> 00:45:27,924
don't want to see it only as a vector

1062
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:29,224
space, but. You wanted to see it with

1063
00:45:29,262 --> 00:45:30,884
more structure because you want to force

1064
00:45:30,932 --> 00:45:33,016
the way. Like you have constraints, you

1065
00:45:33,038 --> 00:45:34,376
know, a priority, the constraints that

1066
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,620
you're going to have on the way that you

1067
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,632
can take a perspective on one moldality

1068
00:45:38,696 --> 00:45:41,068
or the other. But it's not for text. At

1069
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:42,956
least not but I think maybe. It could be

1070
00:45:42,978 --> 00:45:44,648
used for text, but. It'S not what I'm

1071
00:45:44,664 --> 00:45:46,764
doing now. Can I add something about

1072
00:45:46,802 --> 00:45:49,650
this question? Sorry,

1073
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,770
I just want to rebound on that.

1074
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,528
I have the luck of collaborating with

1075
00:45:56,614 --> 00:46:00,256
real mathematician. I'm just some guy

1076
00:46:00,278 --> 00:46:02,484
with intuition that I've found the right

1077
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:05,136
people to do the work regarding

1078
00:46:05,168 --> 00:46:07,236
multimodality. This is important to

1079
00:46:07,258 --> 00:46:08,792
understand that this is not about

1080
00:46:08,846 --> 00:46:12,180
vision. This is about spatial cognition.

1081
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,872
It's supremodal. The claim is that

1082
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:18,664
vision is just one particular way of

1083
00:46:18,702 --> 00:46:20,868
integrating information, indeed in an

1084
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:23,816
obviously projective manner, but that's

1085
00:46:23,928 --> 00:46:26,396
integrated in a much larger field of

1086
00:46:26,418 --> 00:46:28,796
experience than the field of view or the

1087
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:30,668
visual field. And obviously

1088
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,708
proprioception touch. When you build a

1089
00:46:33,714 --> 00:46:35,356
representation just by touching

1090
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:36,864
something and you get this 3D

1091
00:46:36,902 --> 00:46:38,064
representation of that thing

1092
00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:40,528
automatically in your mind hearing to

1093
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:41,996
the extent that it's about source

1094
00:46:42,028 --> 00:46:44,800
localization and building spatial

1095
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,536
representation, all of that stuff that's

1096
00:46:49,568 --> 00:46:52,036
the claim of the theory is integrated in

1097
00:46:52,058 --> 00:46:54,960
this projective space. There are priors

1098
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,692
from memories, there are stuff from

1099
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:59,124
vision, stuff from addition, stuff from

1100
00:46:59,162 --> 00:47:01,944
proprioception, interoception, you name

1101
00:47:01,982 --> 00:47:04,676
it. All senses contribute to it. So it's

1102
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,644
not vision. The claim is that projective

1103
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:09,672
3D projective geometry in that case is

1104
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,056
beyond vision. Vision is just actually a

1105
00:47:12,078 --> 00:47:14,632
slave to that supremodal representation.

1106
00:47:14,696 --> 00:47:17,390
That's the claim. Awesome.

1107
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,236
Yeah, please. It's important because I

1108
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:25,308
think we work like a group. There are

1109
00:47:25,314 --> 00:47:26,808
several different perspectives. For me,

1110
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:28,256
I'm more on the computational side. So

1111
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,840
it's important to have that because

1112
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,424
clearly something I won't be able to

1113
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:34,236
answer. Cool. Here's a nice following

1114
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,112
question from Vladimir in the chat.

1115
00:47:36,176 --> 00:47:39,920
They wrote if the Eg

1116
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,136
visual sensors have variable resolution,

1117
00:47:43,248 --> 00:47:45,236
for example, higher resolution in the

1118
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:48,004
center, this can naturally lead to

1119
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:50,372
Curiosity based change of orientation

1120
00:47:50,436 --> 00:47:53,896
response within your framework. So is it

1121
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:55,268
a question or an affirmation? So it's

1122
00:47:55,284 --> 00:47:59,124
for E g, right? If there's variable

1123
00:47:59,172 --> 00:48:02,092
sensor precision, for example, higher

1124
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:04,988
precision in the sensor, might you see

1125
00:48:05,074 --> 00:48:09,512
any resulting Curiosity associated

1126
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:12,344
change merely based upon the asymmetry

1127
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,396
or the structure of the sensor field?

1128
00:48:14,578 --> 00:48:16,556
Okay, so I shouldn't say it, but I will

1129
00:48:16,578 --> 00:48:18,128
still say it because I don't know if the

1130
00:48:18,134 --> 00:48:19,920
paper will go out one day or not. But

1131
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,624
this is more attention. This is more

1132
00:48:22,662 --> 00:48:26,336
attention than Curiosity. So you can act

1133
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:28,404
on your sensor. So that you can change

1134
00:48:28,442 --> 00:48:29,908
the way that you integrate them. And

1135
00:48:29,914 --> 00:48:33,140
this really acts as a form of attention.

1136
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,150
So I really went into it.

1137
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,720
What is the interplay between attention

1138
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,720
and curiosity?

1139
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,730
I mean,

1140
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,742
it's the way you're going to move

1141
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:56,626
basically on the way, the. Way that it

1142
00:48:56,648 --> 00:48:59,586
deforms the way that you move. So the

1143
00:48:59,608 --> 00:49:01,346
consequences of your actions are not the

1144
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:03,586
same. So basically curiosity is what

1145
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:06,100
drives actions and the way that you.

1146
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,366
Choose your. Action with respect to

1147
00:49:10,408 --> 00:49:12,454
reward, which is epistemic value and now

1148
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:14,086
attention. Or let's say changing the

1149
00:49:14,108 --> 00:49:15,974
sensors is a way to change the

1150
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:17,794
consequences of your action with respect

1151
00:49:17,842 --> 00:49:19,990
to, let's say, optimizing this value.

1152
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,014
So it's, it's like yeah, I mean.

1153
00:49:23,052 --> 00:49:26,426
It'S it's yeah, I don't know if.

1154
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:28,358
I should say it or not, but okay, let's

1155
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:30,294
say it's okay. I think it's a metric.

1156
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,534
Basically it acts like a sort of metric

1157
00:49:32,582 --> 00:49:35,150
on the space, on the group directly.

1158
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,918
So when you have a function, you want to

1159
00:49:37,924 --> 00:49:39,486
do gradient descent, you choose a

1160
00:49:39,508 --> 00:49:41,006
metric. And the metric is so the

1161
00:49:41,028 --> 00:49:43,166
attention will act as a metric and so

1162
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,074
the metric will allow you to deform, in

1163
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:48,226
fact, the steps that

1164
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:49,586
you will do. And so I think this is how

1165
00:49:49,608 --> 00:49:52,478
it acts. So it's very known that it's

1166
00:49:52,494 --> 00:49:53,890
known that the fact that changing the

1167
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,638
sensors is related to attention, that's

1168
00:49:56,654 --> 00:49:58,406
not something much new, but the fact

1169
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,306
that you can directly in our setting

1170
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:02,214
related to groups and you can relate it

1171
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:04,966
to. Changing the metric on the group is.

1172
00:50:04,988 --> 00:50:07,820
Something that can be done. And I think

1173
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,180
it's interesting.

1174
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,970
All right, another question in the chat.

1175
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,858
What is a formal framework for learning

1176
00:50:18,944 --> 00:50:22,430
geometry from data? How do we move from

1177
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,406
empirical data sets, the files on our

1178
00:50:25,428 --> 00:50:27,054
computers, and the things that we do

1179
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:28,586
deep learning on take into machine

1180
00:50:28,618 --> 00:50:30,702
learning pipelines? And how do we

1181
00:50:30,836 --> 00:50:32,882
utilize geometric approaches and

1182
00:50:32,936 --> 00:50:35,134
formalize to the kind of analytical

1183
00:50:35,182 --> 00:50:36,658
precision that we saw here, some of

1184
00:50:36,664 --> 00:50:38,690
these geometric relationships.

1185
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:43,326
So there are several different fields

1186
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,580
of how to use geometry on data.

1187
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:50,086
It depends how you see geometry. But one

1188
00:50:50,108 --> 00:50:52,722
way is a TDA topological data analysis,

1189
00:50:52,866 --> 00:50:56,150
which is basically trying to, let's say

1190
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,686
you want to provide learning by

1191
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:00,726
geometric stability property of your

1192
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:02,946
data and try to interpret it as a

1193
00:51:02,988 --> 00:51:04,586
certain kind of space. And then you look

1194
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:05,978
at the whole of your space and this is

1195
00:51:05,984 --> 00:51:07,914
something that defines your data set.

1196
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:09,654
So this is one approach. Another one is

1197
00:51:09,712 --> 00:51:13,840
people doing manifold, so they know that

1198
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:18,106
the data lives in a low dimensional

1199
00:51:18,138 --> 00:51:19,566
manifold and they try to learn this

1200
00:51:19,588 --> 00:51:22,126
manifold. So that's another way of doing

1201
00:51:22,148 --> 00:51:24,094
it. So that's lots of work in this

1202
00:51:24,132 --> 00:51:25,326
direction. There are people who are

1203
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,406
interested in variance and equivalents,

1204
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,780
so more in geometric deep learning.

1205
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:32,786
There are people who are interested in

1206
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:35,554
the same setting on a priorities how to

1207
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,686
use geometric aprioris and included in

1208
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:38,822
learning for deep learning,

1209
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:40,246
reinforcement learning. And this is what

1210
00:51:40,268 --> 00:51:43,606
we do with this is where many people do

1211
00:51:43,628 --> 00:51:46,614
this. It's not just us. For us we try to

1212
00:51:46,652 --> 00:51:49,306
focus on this idea of how to exploit it

1213
00:51:49,328 --> 00:51:50,700
for reinforcement learning.

1214
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,922
So in this setting Epistemic value was

1215
00:51:56,976 --> 00:52:00,800
the only driver of action. Is that

1216
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,262
so? It's kind of like an expected free

1217
00:52:03,316 --> 00:52:07,134
energy except without Pragmatic value.

1218
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,434
So we only have the Epistemic term

1219
00:52:09,482 --> 00:52:12,206
remaining? Exactly. In fact if you look

1220
00:52:12,228 --> 00:52:14,066
at in terms of optimal control and not

1221
00:52:14,088 --> 00:52:15,406
by Asian, because you know that there's

1222
00:52:15,438 --> 00:52:17,634
this duality that is most of the time

1223
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:19,858
stated in Active Inference where you

1224
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:22,974
have basically a duality between let's

1225
00:52:23,022 --> 00:52:27,222
say value

1226
00:52:27,276 --> 00:52:28,886
function and a probabilistic version of

1227
00:52:28,908 --> 00:52:32,102
value function. So you can encode on

1228
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:35,266
priors, you can encode all your drives

1229
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:38,714
with priors are with the

1230
00:52:38,752 --> 00:52:40,986
value function directly. So rewards and

1231
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:43,238
so both are kind of dual and they're

1232
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:46,394
dual in a way you can make this

1233
00:52:46,432 --> 00:52:49,494
duality, I don't know if it's explicitly

1234
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,814
dual like in some context this sentence

1235
00:52:51,862 --> 00:52:54,118
makes sense for Active Inference for me

1236
00:52:54,144 --> 00:52:56,346
I'm not completely aware if the duality

1237
00:52:56,378 --> 00:52:59,214
is exactly formal but at least the idea

1238
00:52:59,252 --> 00:53:00,622
is here. So there's no big difference,

1239
00:53:00,676 --> 00:53:02,382
at least the way I see it with value

1240
00:53:02,436 --> 00:53:03,374
function and seeing it

1241
00:53:03,412 --> 00:53:04,994
probabilistically. But the terms of

1242
00:53:05,032 --> 00:53:08,530
Epistemic value is an exploration drive

1243
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,366
which you also find in reinforcement

1244
00:53:10,398 --> 00:53:12,226
learning. Maybe not in this exact

1245
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:13,810
expression. I think that the exact

1246
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,314
expression that was given in the paper

1247
00:53:15,352 --> 00:53:18,818
of. I. Think it's pezulo

1248
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:22,086
and for sure

1249
00:53:22,108 --> 00:53:23,560
I. Know is on the paper.

1250
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,950
It'S very economical

1251
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,958
way to define Epistemic value. So it's

1252
00:53:33,974 --> 00:53:36,122
an exploratory drive, you can always add

1253
00:53:36,176 --> 00:53:39,418
to the value function. But there's a lot

1254
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,520
of problem of trying to explore in fact

1255
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:43,214
your environment to find the good

1256
00:53:43,252 --> 00:53:45,886
policies because if you're in a state

1257
00:53:45,908 --> 00:53:47,662
space that is continuous it's really

1258
00:53:47,716 --> 00:53:50,800
difficult to resolve the p one EP.

1259
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,642
Yes, it's like if you knew which

1260
00:53:58,696 --> 00:54:02,734
curiosities you could get rewarded

1261
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:05,842
from you would have already known

1262
00:54:05,906 --> 00:54:08,760
the answer to the search.

1263
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:14,440
So that's one of the

1264
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,874
challenges with Pragmatic value it

1265
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:21,980
converges well to expectations. But then

1266
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:27,020
this work really

1267
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:30,158
focuses in on Epistemic value and shows

1268
00:54:30,244 --> 00:54:32,350
what it can do alone as a driver.

1269
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,758
So how would you bring Pragmatic value

1270
00:54:35,844 --> 00:54:39,520
into this formalism? You just add it.

1271
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,490
You can put the value functions of some

1272
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,826
of rewards in some way and then you add

1273
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:47,218
the Epistemic value. In fact, when you

1274
00:54:47,224 --> 00:54:49,026
look at the formulation in terms of

1275
00:54:49,128 --> 00:54:53,646
belief MDP for POMDP, the Curiosity

1276
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:55,442
Epistemic value is simply a value

1277
00:54:55,496 --> 00:54:57,886
function, nothing more. It's a one step

1278
00:54:57,928 --> 00:54:59,334
value function. But I mean this is like

1279
00:54:59,372 --> 00:55:01,926
just playing with definitions but so you

1280
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:04,866
can always add a drive for exploration

1281
00:55:04,978 --> 00:55:06,214
and this is something that's really

1282
00:55:06,252 --> 00:55:08,700
often done in reinforcement learning.

1283
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,394
I think it's even standard in not this

1284
00:55:14,432 --> 00:55:16,618
way, not exactly special, but there's a

1285
00:55:16,624 --> 00:55:17,686
book that's called Reinforcement

1286
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:19,562
Learning state of the art and they

1287
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,900
introduce this exploratory drive.

1288
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:24,926
This is a book maybe that has. Ten years

1289
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:26,618
or something like that. So it's

1290
00:55:26,634 --> 00:55:29,198
something that you add up. The way we

1291
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,614
will do it now. Is we can put some

1292
00:55:31,652 --> 00:55:33,358
drives with respect to preferences and

1293
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:34,998
then you add for example, an epistemic

1294
00:55:35,034 --> 00:55:38,146
value and you try to just solve the

1295
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,706
optimization problem. But in terms of

1296
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:42,046
formalism, if you look at the belief

1297
00:55:42,078 --> 00:55:43,474
MDP, it's nothing more than a certain

1298
00:55:43,512 --> 00:55:50,120
value function. So it's not cool.

1299
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:55,030
So space remains

1300
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:00,358
when we translate through it or

1301
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:04,326
when we whether we're in the Euclidean

1302
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:07,002
or in the projective setting space is

1303
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:10,874
basically what is not changed

1304
00:56:10,922 --> 00:56:14,222
through action. Is that the case?

1305
00:56:14,276 --> 00:56:15,200
Okay, yeah.

1306
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,886
The thing is that there's a bit of

1307
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:23,806
technicality so the way that we use is

1308
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:26,366
we use a chart for the projected plane.

1309
00:56:26,398 --> 00:56:27,566
So we need to use homogeneous

1310
00:56:27,598 --> 00:56:30,418
coordinates, so we need to take away a

1311
00:56:30,504 --> 00:56:33,186
lower dimensional plane. So that's why

1312
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:35,358
we always have the. Same like in the way

1313
00:56:35,384 --> 00:56:37,094
that we encoded, we always are in r

1314
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:40,562
three because we chose a chart, we chose

1315
00:56:40,626 --> 00:56:42,774
homogeneous coordinates and we did

1316
00:56:42,812 --> 00:56:44,166
projective transformations from one

1317
00:56:44,188 --> 00:56:46,022
homogeneous coordinate to another

1318
00:56:46,076 --> 00:56:47,654
homogeneous coordinate but it always

1319
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:49,858
lists to a projective transformation.

1320
00:56:49,954 --> 00:56:51,366
So what is hidden in the way. That we

1321
00:56:51,388 --> 00:56:52,778
write it is in fact. We don't have the

1322
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,138
same space in the first case we have

1323
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,226
ecclesian, in the second we have

1324
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:57,926
projective. But the way as we use charts

1325
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:02,106
and we don't put all the details of the

1326
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:03,386
fact that for example, you can compose

1327
00:57:03,418 --> 00:57:06,398
two projective transformations even if

1328
00:57:06,404 --> 00:57:07,646
you write it in charts in terms of

1329
00:57:07,668 --> 00:57:09,358
homogeneous coordinates and it stays a

1330
00:57:09,364 --> 00:57:10,558
projective transformation. This is

1331
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:12,558
something that is okay but we just don't

1332
00:57:12,574 --> 00:57:14,898
write it this way. We stay in charts and

1333
00:57:14,904 --> 00:57:16,222
so that's why there's a similarity

1334
00:57:16,286 --> 00:57:18,142
between because we. Want to implement

1335
00:57:18,206 --> 00:57:20,340
it, there's a similarity. Between the.

1336
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,282
Projective case and projected case.

1337
00:57:25,336 --> 00:57:27,314
Have the same state space r three. But

1338
00:57:27,352 --> 00:57:28,754
the space of transformation is really.

1339
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,118
Different and in fact they are not the

1340
00:57:30,124 --> 00:57:32,326
same space. But what is important for us

1341
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,166
in terms of space is just to tell

1342
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:35,174
yourself that if you take away

1343
00:57:35,212 --> 00:57:36,760
everything that is inside of space,

1344
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,478
everything that populates space, you

1345
00:57:39,484 --> 00:57:41,626
take it away. What you're left with is

1346
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:43,402
with this kind of concepts which already

1347
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:44,778
takes into account the fact that when

1348
00:57:44,784 --> 00:57:47,562
you act you're not changing the space

1349
00:57:47,696 --> 00:57:49,466
and there's no single point that is

1350
00:57:49,488 --> 00:57:51,498
singled out. This is very important

1351
00:57:51,584 --> 00:57:53,418
because it's a very typical like it

1352
00:57:53,424 --> 00:57:55,338
types a lot the object you're looking at

1353
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:57,038
if you move there's no point in the

1354
00:57:57,044 --> 00:57:59,086
space that is changing. There's no point

1355
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,446
that is single out. And when you move

1356
00:58:00,468 --> 00:58:01,806
the space is not changing. So you know

1357
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:03,166
that you already have inside of your

1358
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,214
space a change of charts that is

1359
00:58:05,252 --> 00:58:08,066
encoded. And even more when you can

1360
00:58:08,088 --> 00:58:09,506
imagine that you take the perspective of

1361
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,002
somebody else. And this is really

1362
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:13,906
something that is at the basis of the

1363
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:16,082
space we consider is that the space is

1364
00:58:16,136 --> 00:58:18,674
simply. A way to support the fact that

1365
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:20,290
you can change charts, you can change

1366
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,374
perspectives. And so it's including this

1367
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:24,406
idea inside of agency that we're trying

1368
00:58:24,428 --> 00:58:25,878
to do. So maybe I was not clear in. The

1369
00:58:25,884 --> 00:58:27,526
way that I said it first, but I think

1370
00:58:27,548 --> 00:58:30,520
this is really important.

1371
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:34,620
It's the water we're in. So it's a very

1372
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:39,806
interesting way to approach it. And it

1373
00:58:39,828 --> 00:58:42,590
reminds me way back when, actually

1374
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,594
almost three years ago when we discussed

1375
00:58:45,642 --> 00:58:48,110
the projective consciousness model and

1376
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,426
phenomenal selfhood in live stream

1377
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:54,482
number nine. And we

1378
00:58:54,536 --> 00:58:57,746
talked a lot about flipping between the

1379
00:58:57,768 --> 00:59:01,330
Euclidean and the projective modes.

1380
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:05,240
How an agent could have on one hand

1381
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:10,646
a space in which a

1382
00:59:10,668 --> 00:59:13,894
book is a rectangle and yet also be

1383
00:59:13,932 --> 00:59:16,166
seeing it very close to their face so

1384
00:59:16,188 --> 00:59:19,814
that its visual projection

1385
00:59:19,942 --> 00:59:23,674
was different and yet here there

1386
00:59:23,712 --> 00:59:27,670
was different behavior associated

1387
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:31,706
with the frame alone. So what's

1388
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:34,080
going on there where even though they

1389
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,462
apparently can be reconstructed from

1390
00:59:38,516 --> 00:59:39,360
each other,

1391
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:45,330
what flips can we flip from thinking

1392
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,834
more Euclidean? And then in that

1393
00:59:48,872 --> 00:59:52,414
situation I'm a plane 30,000ft

1394
00:59:52,462 --> 00:59:54,478
above my city so there's nowhere I need

1395
00:59:54,504 --> 00:59:57,186
to go. But then in the projective

1396
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:00,774
setting we do have this kind

1397
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:04,518
of inbuilt epistemic drive

1398
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,800
to be near.

1399
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,890
I think it's hard coded.

1400
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,646
One of the things that it can be useful

1401
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:17,066
for is communication. So using space as

1402
01:00:17,088 --> 01:00:19,146
a way to. Communicate, taking it as a

1403
01:00:19,168 --> 01:00:20,826
priority that. We have very different

1404
01:00:20,928 --> 01:00:23,254
architectures. The way that we treat

1405
01:00:23,312 --> 01:00:25,246
information are not the same. We don't

1406
01:00:25,268 --> 01:00:26,506
have exactly the same connection,

1407
01:00:26,538 --> 01:00:28,254
neurons and everything. But we still

1408
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,494
have a common framework in which we can

1409
01:00:30,532 --> 01:00:33,034
discuss, for example. And visual

1410
01:00:33,082 --> 01:00:34,686
information is something that is very

1411
01:00:34,788 --> 01:00:36,802
immediate for us, which is not obvious

1412
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:38,466
if you take the perspective, the point

1413
01:00:38,488 --> 01:00:40,610
of view, if you go from the idea that

1414
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,486
it's rebuilt and the environment you're

1415
01:00:43,518 --> 01:00:46,438
living on is not exactly the space that

1416
01:00:46,444 --> 01:00:47,766
we see. There's something that we

1417
01:00:47,788 --> 01:00:51,426
constructed for functional reasons

1418
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:53,526
and that one of them could be that we

1419
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:55,910
can communicate very directly with it.

1420
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,166
So I think it's hard coded that. The

1421
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:00,310
state space needs to have this action

1422
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,634
and that all the agents share this

1423
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:03,962
action but they don't share the same

1424
01:01:04,016 --> 01:01:05,994
architecture. So it gives a common base

1425
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:07,626
for. Discussion like true actions, for

1426
01:01:07,648 --> 01:01:09,690
example, change of perspective.

1427
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:13,046
So it's to answer the question eclean

1428
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:15,134
projective we're not going in the

1429
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,958
direction in terms of research where

1430
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,238
we're trying to say that you can go from

1431
01:01:18,244 --> 01:01:20,734
Eclean to projective for the same agent.

1432
01:01:20,852 --> 01:01:23,166
So agents are hard coded with a latent

1433
01:01:23,198 --> 01:01:26,146
space which has some structure and then

1434
01:01:26,168 --> 01:01:27,794
we try to exploit it for function, for

1435
01:01:27,832 --> 01:01:30,402
communication, for multi agent like.

1436
01:01:30,536 --> 01:01:32,530
Behavior so that they can collaborate.

1437
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:38,614
Okay, so each agent is within its own

1438
01:01:38,652 --> 01:01:40,406
projective setting and then the

1439
01:01:40,428 --> 01:01:43,746
Euclidean sets the stage and allows

1440
01:01:43,778 --> 01:01:46,994
that multi perspective. The Euclidean

1441
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:49,866
space, which is the outside. World, is

1442
01:01:49,888 --> 01:01:52,010
just here in this toy. Model because

1443
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,234
it's a way to reference the

1444
01:01:54,272 --> 01:01:56,186
configuration of the world. But for a

1445
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:58,140
network, this would be, for example,

1446
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,558
the configurations of its sensors.

1447
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:04,814
So it's just here. There's this kind of

1448
01:02:04,852 --> 01:02:07,054
ambiguity between space and space. So

1449
01:02:07,092 --> 01:02:08,606
outside space, which is Euclidean and

1450
01:02:08,628 --> 01:02:10,398
inside, which is projective, but the

1451
01:02:10,404 --> 01:02:13,040
outside space is just a way to discuss

1452
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,126
configurations of something that is

1453
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:17,586
related. To the environment. So it can

1454
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,934
be like your sensors, the configuration

1455
01:02:19,982 --> 01:02:21,618
of your sensors or something like this

1456
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,246
information coming from your sensors.

1457
01:02:23,278 --> 01:02:25,426
So you just give a space from it. And

1458
01:02:25,448 --> 01:02:27,494
the geometry is really in the.

1459
01:02:27,532 --> 01:02:29,986
Reconstructed world that is internal.

1460
01:02:30,098 --> 01:02:33,206
But being able to do networks that do

1461
01:02:33,228 --> 01:02:35,254
this is somewhere that we're working on

1462
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:36,982
now. And it's not that obvious because

1463
01:02:37,116 --> 01:02:39,446
there's a lot of algorithms. The problem

1464
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:41,286
algorithmic problems that we try to

1465
01:02:41,308 --> 01:02:43,250
solve. And that we need to solve. And

1466
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,906
this toy model is really like the

1467
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,426
ambiguity comes only from the fact that

1468
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:49,386
it's a toy model. But what is space is

1469
01:02:49,408 --> 01:02:50,986
inside it's, what is reconstructed.

1470
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:52,990
It's the thing that we perceive space

1471
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,774
from sensors as being a whole, as being

1472
01:02:55,812 --> 01:02:57,390
something that structures the

1473
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,718
information. So, David you

1474
01:03:00,724 --> 01:03:04,506
want to say mean. Yes indeed in

1475
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,066
the talk that you are referring to, I

1476
01:03:06,088 --> 01:03:08,226
was giving and also kenneth williford if

1477
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:10,206
I remember. Well, yeah, indeed. The toy

1478
01:03:10,238 --> 01:03:13,826
models encoded a certain world model in

1479
01:03:13,848 --> 01:03:17,878
an Euclidean way. And then using

1480
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:20,150
homogeneous coordinate and this kind of

1481
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,922
stuff to do the projective

1482
01:03:22,066 --> 01:03:25,254
transformation, we just transform the

1483
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:28,520
Euclidean space into a projective space

1484
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:32,034
and you can go. Of course you can invert

1485
01:03:32,082 --> 01:03:33,518
it. I mean, there is an onliner

1486
01:03:33,554 --> 01:03:35,786
division, but you can invert it anyway.

1487
01:03:35,968 --> 01:03:38,026
So you can go from one to the other.

1488
01:03:38,128 --> 01:03:40,046
But Gregor is right. That it. Was a

1489
01:03:40,068 --> 01:03:42,286
choice of modeling. It was a bit

1490
01:03:42,308 --> 01:03:45,114
motivated by my experience as a brain

1491
01:03:45,162 --> 01:03:47,342
scientist. There are reasons to believe

1492
01:03:47,396 --> 01:03:50,186
that memory, for instance, place cells

1493
01:03:50,298 --> 01:03:53,186
and grid cells deaden. Though there are

1494
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,134
new hypothesis about their hyperbolic.

1495
01:03:55,182 --> 01:03:58,162
Characters but usually they are thought

1496
01:03:58,216 --> 01:04:00,014
as encoding space in an ecclesial

1497
01:04:00,062 --> 01:04:05,298
manner. So since when we project future

1498
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:08,646
action, we use sometimes and we have to

1499
01:04:08,668 --> 01:04:11,762
use memory or even if we do remembrance

1500
01:04:11,826 --> 01:04:13,638
of the past and we project ourselves in

1501
01:04:13,644 --> 01:04:15,494
the scenes in the past, there is this

1502
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:19,046
access to memory systems that we used to

1503
01:04:19,068 --> 01:04:20,698
think, and probably this is still the

1504
01:04:20,704 --> 01:04:22,934
case, encode information in an Euclidean

1505
01:04:22,982 --> 01:04:25,242
manner. So it would make sense that then

1506
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:27,434
for the conscious access, there would be

1507
01:04:27,472 --> 01:04:29,434
some operation that would allow us to go

1508
01:04:29,472 --> 01:04:31,694
from Euclidean to projective, which was

1509
01:04:31,732 --> 01:04:33,854
implemented that way at the same time.

1510
01:04:33,892 --> 01:04:37,006
But this is way beyond my abilities in

1511
01:04:37,028 --> 01:04:40,206
math, so Gregor will correct me, there

1512
01:04:40,228 --> 01:04:42,202
is a way of seeing projective geometry

1513
01:04:42,266 --> 01:04:44,622
as being more general, as an extension

1514
01:04:44,766 --> 01:04:47,314
of a fine space by adding point at

1515
01:04:47,352 --> 01:04:49,346
infinity. So if now you think about a

1516
01:04:49,368 --> 01:04:51,150
projective space with a metric.

1517
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:53,666
Basically, the projective space. Is an

1518
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:55,974
extension of Eclidean space. Am I saying

1519
01:04:56,012 --> 01:04:59,880
something completely false? No,

1520
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:03,686
it's one way to seeing it. And there are

1521
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,910
also a lot of operations that use

1522
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,942
dialogues, I would say exchange between

1523
01:05:07,996 --> 01:05:10,026
projective and Eclidean. If you think

1524
01:05:10,048 --> 01:05:12,186
about multiview reconstruction of 3D

1525
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,202
Eclidean space from multiple shots in

1526
01:05:14,256 --> 01:05:16,266
your camera you take several shots of a

1527
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:18,426
building from different perspective and

1528
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:20,566
then you can use a deterministic

1529
01:05:20,598 --> 01:05:22,698
algorithm approach using epipolar

1530
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:24,974
geometry to kind of infer under some

1531
01:05:25,012 --> 01:05:27,326
prior that basically all lines that

1532
01:05:27,348 --> 01:05:28,846
converge at points at infinity are

1533
01:05:28,868 --> 01:05:30,682
actually parallel. Then you reconstruct.

1534
01:05:30,746 --> 01:05:33,030
You go from projective to ecclesiast.

1535
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,274
So there is a deep relationship between

1536
01:05:36,312 --> 01:05:37,938
the two that is possible and probably

1537
01:05:38,024 --> 01:05:39,010
functional.

1538
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:44,286
Yeah, that's about it. And Epipolar

1539
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:46,526
geometry is a subset of projective

1540
01:05:46,558 --> 01:05:50,150
geometry. Just to give some context.

1541
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,244
David has. A better intuition on

1542
01:05:55,282 --> 01:05:57,340
projective spaces than me. This is like

1543
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:02,772
so when he faced notes

1544
01:06:02,856 --> 01:06:09,148
he really has a very intuitive,

1545
01:06:09,244 --> 01:06:12,788
physical, personal, visualization and

1546
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:14,070
most of the time he's right.

1547
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,624
Are we experiencing a projective

1548
01:06:18,672 --> 01:06:20,564
geometry or what is it like to

1549
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:23,060
experience a projective geometry?

1550
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,916
So one problem that there is with this

1551
01:06:26,938 --> 01:06:29,048
model is the fact that you. Need to

1552
01:06:29,054 --> 01:06:31,544
force the point at infinity. To be so

1553
01:06:31,582 --> 01:06:32,728
the plane you take away from the

1554
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:35,720
projected space has to be behind. And so

1555
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,144
you're not really working with real

1556
01:06:37,182 --> 01:06:40,024
maps. No, you can always extend them.

1557
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:42,028
That's okay. But the thing is if you

1558
01:06:42,034 --> 01:06:44,188
want to see it in the way that we see it

1559
01:06:44,354 --> 01:06:46,204
us, which is we have something in front

1560
01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:49,244
of us I find it a bit restrictive to say

1561
01:06:49,282 --> 01:06:51,564
that you cannot see what's behind you.

1562
01:06:51,602 --> 01:06:53,568
I mean, you never see it, right? I mean,

1563
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:55,536
you can imagine it which is not the same

1564
01:06:55,558 --> 01:06:57,968
thing because you change your frame. So

1565
01:06:58,134 --> 01:06:59,984
I can't answer really this question.

1566
01:07:00,022 --> 01:07:02,036
I'm just pointing out the fact that for

1567
01:07:02,058 --> 01:07:04,036
me it's very perturbating to think that

1568
01:07:04,058 --> 01:07:06,196
I have a plane that corresponds to

1569
01:07:06,378 --> 01:07:10,308
discontinuity with respect to I

1570
01:07:10,314 --> 01:07:12,580
have a plane that destroys completely

1571
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:14,560
the way that I can think about movement

1572
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,436
behind me. Which is that if I had to

1573
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:18,296
imagine I had a whole space that is

1574
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:19,880
around me and not just in front of me

1575
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:22,264
things would be very weird in terms of

1576
01:07:22,302 --> 01:07:24,104
transformations. But it's not something

1577
01:07:24,142 --> 01:07:26,444
that is not possible. This is what

1578
01:07:26,482 --> 01:07:28,444
happens when you take psychedelic. You

1579
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:31,416
basically allow the projective

1580
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:33,896
transformation to have all its degrees

1581
01:07:33,928 --> 01:07:35,996
of freedom. But in the perception, like

1582
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:39,196
in sensory motor processes this

1583
01:07:39,218 --> 01:07:41,376
is calibrated, this is restricted. So we

1584
01:07:41,398 --> 01:07:43,376
have to choose certain subset of the

1585
01:07:43,398 --> 01:07:45,344
group. Basically it's only certain

1586
01:07:45,382 --> 01:07:47,136
projected transformation that will be

1587
01:07:47,158 --> 01:07:49,904
used in practice. But now if you go into

1588
01:07:50,022 --> 01:07:52,364
mystical experience or you take drugs

1589
01:07:52,492 --> 01:07:53,916
they are going to mess. Precisely.

1590
01:07:53,948 --> 01:07:56,084
That's the hypothesis with those

1591
01:07:56,122 --> 01:07:57,444
parameters. And now you have the full

1592
01:07:57,482 --> 01:07:58,864
fledged 15 degrees of freedom

1593
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:01,076
transformation. And you see things that

1594
01:08:01,098 --> 01:08:02,884
are very weird, like that looks like

1595
01:08:02,922 --> 01:08:04,932
mandalas or things like that. So that's

1596
01:08:04,996 --> 01:08:07,736
something you can get when you leave too

1597
01:08:07,758 --> 01:08:09,988
much freedom to the projective action.

1598
01:08:10,164 --> 01:08:13,832
Basically. What if

1599
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:15,636
what we're seeing, quote in front of us

1600
01:08:15,678 --> 01:08:17,710
is behind us or something like that?

1601
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,670
What do you mean?

1602
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,324
What was the issue with not being able

1603
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:28,140
to see behind us? The issue is.

1604
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,328
So if you want to see the projected

1605
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:32,704
space as a 3d space, as the way that we

1606
01:08:32,822 --> 01:08:34,848
see it now, you need to take away a

1607
01:08:34,854 --> 01:08:36,444
plane and basically projective

1608
01:08:36,492 --> 01:08:37,936
transformation. So there's a sort of

1609
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:41,296
plane at infinity on which you can I

1610
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:43,136
mean, it doesn't exist in the projected

1611
01:08:43,168 --> 01:08:44,916
space. It exists only in the way you

1612
01:08:45,018 --> 01:08:47,060
define an Ecligian chart, like a 3d,

1613
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:51,216
like R three chart with a plane

1614
01:08:51,248 --> 01:08:53,604
that is taken away, this plane that is

1615
01:08:53,642 --> 01:08:55,296
behind you. If you apply a projective

1616
01:08:55,328 --> 01:08:57,784
transformation in front of you,

1617
01:08:57,822 --> 01:08:59,716
everything will seem fine. You're

1618
01:08:59,748 --> 01:09:01,176
expecting like it's things that you

1619
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,384
experience but then once what happened

1620
01:09:03,422 --> 01:09:05,364
is that it can send things at infinity

1621
01:09:05,412 --> 01:09:07,484
back behind you. So this is something

1622
01:09:07,522 --> 01:09:13,276
that is a bit I mean, for me so

1623
01:09:13,298 --> 01:09:14,908
you can write it explicitly there's no

1624
01:09:14,914 --> 01:09:16,248
problem mathematically but if it's

1625
01:09:16,264 --> 01:09:18,316
really the way that we experience it,

1626
01:09:18,338 --> 01:09:20,988
it's extremely weird to think about so I

1627
01:09:20,994 --> 01:09:22,608
prefer not thinking about it. So this is

1628
01:09:22,614 --> 01:09:25,472
the only thing and I don't take drugs so

1629
01:09:25,606 --> 01:09:28,864
I leave it to other people. It's true

1630
01:09:28,902 --> 01:09:31,872
that taking drugs in this context makes

1631
01:09:31,926 --> 01:09:34,480
complete like you could model it in the

1632
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:37,008
projective framework and not in the

1633
01:09:37,014 --> 01:09:38,596
Euclearian framework because you have a

1634
01:09:38,618 --> 01:09:39,824
huge amount of projective

1635
01:09:39,872 --> 01:09:42,244
transformations that make sense more

1636
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:43,936
than the one that are related to actions

1637
01:09:43,968 --> 01:09:45,876
in the art. So in the presentation I

1638
01:09:45,898 --> 01:09:48,668
gave there was a way to relate ecclesian

1639
01:09:48,704 --> 01:09:50,232
frames to projective frames under

1640
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,456
certain axioms and in fact you have a

1641
01:09:52,478 --> 01:09:54,324
huge much bigger space of projective

1642
01:09:54,372 --> 01:09:56,148
transformations than the one that are

1643
01:09:56,174 --> 01:09:59,784
restricted by the actions

1644
01:09:59,832 --> 01:10:01,996
of the agent. So the actions of the

1645
01:10:02,018 --> 01:10:04,188
agent inside. Of the real space. So the

1646
01:10:04,194 --> 01:10:06,136
Euclidean space induce projective

1647
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:08,156
transformation in its internal world but

1648
01:10:08,178 --> 01:10:09,324
there are much more projective

1649
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:11,504
transformation than these actions and so

1650
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,456
you can imagine in this setting having

1651
01:10:13,558 --> 01:10:16,448
very confusing states of your. Mind in a

1652
01:10:16,454 --> 01:10:19,888
way. Which you

1653
01:10:19,894 --> 01:10:21,510
cannot. In the appeal case.

1654
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,380
I wonder if a creature or a robot

1655
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,860
with 360 degree cameras

1656
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,224
would it not be so perplexed as it

1657
01:10:37,262 --> 01:10:39,560
wouldn't necessarily have a visual

1658
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,610
before or a visual in front and behind?

1659
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,684
And the thing is how do you glue them

1660
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:46,350
together?

1661
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,844
You still have to pick a point of

1662
01:10:50,882 --> 01:10:53,916
convergence, right? I mean you need to

1663
01:10:53,938 --> 01:10:55,992
find a way to do multimodal integration.

1664
01:10:56,056 --> 01:10:58,344
Like, if you want to have a camera

1665
01:10:58,392 --> 01:11:00,944
that's 360, you have the space to

1666
01:11:00,982 --> 01:11:02,396
represent it, so maybe you can represent

1667
01:11:02,428 --> 01:11:04,210
it as a sphere. And in this case,

1668
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,640
the sensors are different. So it's not

1669
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:10,992
necessarily the same robot than the

1670
01:11:11,046 --> 01:11:12,428
models that we are considering. But

1671
01:11:12,454 --> 01:11:14,544
there might be also another homogeneous

1672
01:11:14,592 --> 01:11:17,312
space. So g space, it's a space acting

1673
01:11:17,376 --> 01:11:19,060
which corresponds to the rotations.

1674
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,476
If you say that, it can look 360 and

1675
01:11:23,498 --> 01:11:25,076
then you can rotate and the space of

1676
01:11:25,098 --> 01:11:26,616
observation stays the same. So you can

1677
01:11:26,638 --> 01:11:28,488
always imagine acting on it and so you

1678
01:11:28,494 --> 01:11:30,792
can imagine like having another g space

1679
01:11:30,846 --> 01:11:32,536
structure. And the good thing about it

1680
01:11:32,558 --> 01:11:35,220
is just with respect to the perspective,

1681
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,144
if you have an agent that can take a

1682
01:11:37,182 --> 01:11:38,184
different perspective on its

1683
01:11:38,222 --> 01:11:39,956
environment, which depends on its

1684
01:11:39,998 --> 01:11:42,236
sensors, on its actions, on the kind of

1685
01:11:42,258 --> 01:11:43,756
data you have, then you can define g

1686
01:11:43,778 --> 01:11:45,644
space and you can do exactly the same

1687
01:11:45,682 --> 01:11:48,168
setting. Everything like it's made in

1688
01:11:48,194 --> 01:11:51,136
the more general context so you can

1689
01:11:51,158 --> 01:11:53,152
apply it. And so it's not limited only

1690
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:56,576
to the projective case. We come

1691
01:11:56,598 --> 01:11:58,684
from the PCM projective consciousness

1692
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:02,512
model. But the framework

1693
01:12:02,576 --> 01:12:05,076
now, or at least the way to replace this

1694
01:12:05,098 --> 01:12:08,336
framework inside of optimal

1695
01:12:08,368 --> 01:12:11,604
control is well adapted for any change

1696
01:12:11,642 --> 01:12:14,920
of perspective and not just projective.

1697
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,770
Awesome. Well, where are you going to

1698
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:22,692
go to next? Where will the epistemic

1699
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:26,456
drive take you carrying

1700
01:12:26,488 --> 01:12:29,788
forward? So there are two projects now.

1701
01:12:29,874 --> 01:12:33,180
So the first one is to be able to maybe

1702
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,830
David can talk,

1703
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,728
to implement it so that it can be used

1704
01:12:40,914 --> 01:12:43,456
for monitoring behaviors or to be able

1705
01:12:43,478 --> 01:12:45,728
to predict behaviors or to analyze it.

1706
01:12:45,814 --> 01:12:47,376
So you have model of behaviors of.

1707
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:49,484
Agents like maladati's behaviors,

1708
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,056
things that we already published but in

1709
01:12:51,078 --> 01:12:53,280
a more limited context now to make it

1710
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:55,268
inside of a computational framework so

1711
01:12:55,274 --> 01:12:57,008
that we can use it to analyze

1712
01:12:57,184 --> 01:12:59,476
experiments with humans. So this is the

1713
01:12:59,498 --> 01:13:01,236
first project which is ongoing with

1714
01:13:01,258 --> 01:13:02,948
several students. So on the page that I

1715
01:13:02,954 --> 01:13:05,412
put on the first slide, there's all the

1716
01:13:05,466 --> 01:13:06,880
work that we're doing, the people who

1717
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:08,424
are working with us and we're very

1718
01:13:08,462 --> 01:13:10,376
grateful for them working with us and

1719
01:13:10,478 --> 01:13:12,740
all the ongoing work in this direction.

1720
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,824
And there's the second one, which is

1721
01:13:14,862 --> 01:13:17,512
more like, let's say machine learning.

1722
01:13:17,566 --> 01:13:18,856
And so for me it's very important you

1723
01:13:18,878 --> 01:13:21,308
have effective algorithms, things that

1724
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,004
you can really use in practice, things

1725
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:24,684
that you can really implement and

1726
01:13:24,722 --> 01:13:25,804
implementing when you have group

1727
01:13:25,842 --> 01:13:27,052
structures. There are many, many

1728
01:13:27,106 --> 01:13:28,364
problems that appear. How to do

1729
01:13:28,402 --> 01:13:29,788
sarcastic optimal control when the

1730
01:13:29,794 --> 01:13:31,776
latent space is a homogeneous space is,

1731
01:13:31,798 --> 01:13:33,792
I think, a completely open question. I

1732
01:13:33,846 --> 01:13:35,404
start to have answers in this direction.

1733
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:38,930
So I hopefully the work will

1734
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:42,676
come out soon, let's say January or

1735
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:45,012
something like this. But there's a huge

1736
01:13:45,066 --> 01:13:46,420
work in this direction.

1737
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,710
Cool. Anything else you want to add?

1738
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,940
Thank you very much for the invitation.

1739
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:01,252
A lot to think about mentally

1740
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:04,824
rotate project. I mean, after all, as

1741
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:07,100
you even alluded to with communication,

1742
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,670
this is a perspective taking question.

1743
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,744
Technology is adding some new flavors

1744
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:19,490
and methods, for example,

1745
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,588
asynchronous communication, but it's

1746
01:14:22,604 --> 01:14:24,112
synchronous for the agent when they

1747
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:25,760
perceive it. But all these different

1748
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:30,160
modalities of communication and it's

1749
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,644
quite interesting to think about and

1750
01:14:32,682 --> 01:14:34,752
just really cool that you and colleagues

1751
01:14:34,816 --> 01:14:39,268
are pursuing that from empirical data

1752
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:41,940
analytic and from theoretical

1753
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,784
mathematical approaches. I mean,

1754
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:47,720
on this side for communication. I think

1755
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:49,956
so. It's something I find extremely

1756
01:14:49,988 --> 01:14:52,856
interesting. More generally, if some

1757
01:14:52,878 --> 01:14:54,248
people want to work on the project,

1758
01:14:54,334 --> 01:14:56,056
please tell us, and I will be very

1759
01:14:56,078 --> 01:14:58,600
happy. And even if you have money,

1760
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:00,104
please tell us, and we will be very

1761
01:15:00,142 --> 01:15:00,730
happy.

1762
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:06,890
I agree. Great.

1763
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,856
We're very open. You can always send us

1764
01:15:09,878 --> 01:15:11,440
a mail. We'll be very happy to discuss

1765
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:14,720
about this. Cool. Okay,

1766
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:17,650
well, thank you again to all.

1767
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:21,728
Till next time. Okay, see you.

1768
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:22,124
Bye.
