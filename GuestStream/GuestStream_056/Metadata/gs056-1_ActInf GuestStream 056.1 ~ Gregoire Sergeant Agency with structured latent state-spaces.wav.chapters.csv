First there'll be a presentation and then any comments that people have in the live chat or any other questions.	Gregory Sargent Petri will discuss how world model influences behavior	How geometry of world model influences agents' consciousness

This is something that is very structuring with respect to models of consciousness.	An agent that is looking for an object has its own frame of reference	A world model for agents and foraging
639870	1164770	10:39	POMDPs are agents that are planning their action with respect to a certain objective. Here the objective is to find a. Certain object and I give the formal setting for defining it which are NDP PMDP. There'S a strong duality between POMDP and active inference.	Markov decision process is the notion of partially observable Markov	POMDPs and Markov Decision Process
1166710	1326950	19:26	We introduce a classical notion of epistemic value which will allow us to define what is behavior with respect to curiosity. What it is for an agent to explore its environment based on curiosity. Now we have a function that is defined on a group that can be a continuous group.	We described what are the generative models that we consider	Exploring the world with a classical notion of epistemic value
1327770	2008720	22:07	The algorithm corresponds to having an agent that is looking for a certain object. Its behavior is defined by an exploratory, is driven by exploration, driven by curiosity. The epistemic value is simply the mutual information of this joint distribution.	The epistemic value is based on the quantity C that I will define now	Epistemic Value of Active Inference
2026940	2340620	33:46	In the Euclidean case, the quantity cubed PSI minus one b epsilon y doesn't change. In the projective case, if you have enough movements, you're always going to go closer to the object. And we would also have experiments on how this setting allowed to generate different illusions.	If you consider an Euclidean transformation, then the quantity cubed PSI doesn't change	The epistemic value of the prior propagated after a projective
2348160	2568230	39:08	The motivation comes from consciousness study, cognitive sciences, but why it can be useful for robotics. Study some statistical models, more structured models. With more a priori that can be. Useful for understanding the behavior of a closed system like an agent.	So what brought you to study this question this way? What question	What brought the Bayesian brain to statistics?
2569580	2666740	42:49	Can we also think about this perspective taking in terms of, for example, semantic or a narrative reference frame? The aim is to be able to apply it to real world models. From 3D space and go to implementing. It completely in autonomous agents.	Geometry allows to get out from the classical point of view a space as	Spatial movement and Geometry in deep learning
2666810	2852050	44:26	There's a question in the chat, great talk. I also wonder whether it applies to any modality, not just visual spatial, but also text. How these ideas, like in geometric deep learning, can stabilize representations. This is not about vision, this is about spatial cognition.	There's a question in the chat about whether multimodal integration applies to text	Mathematical multimodality in deep learning
2852420	3009180	47:32	If the Eg visual sensors have variable resolution, for example, higher resolution in the center, this can naturally lead to Curiosity based change of orientation response. What is the interplay between attention and curiosity? Basically it acts like a sort of metric on the space, on the group directly.	If Eg visual sensors have variable resolution, this can naturally lead to Curiosity response	The relationship between attention and curiosity
3012030	3350120	50:12	What is a formal framework for learning geometry from data? How do we move from empirical data sets to machine learning pipelines? And how do we utilize geometric approaches and formalize to analytical precision?	What is a formal framework for learning geometry from data	Learning Geometric Data from Deep Learning
3351770	3891150	55:51	Space is basically what is not changed through action. Between the. Projective case and projected case. Have the same state space r three. But the space of transformation is really. Different. One of the things that it can be useful for is communication.	Space remains when we translate through it or when we	Euclidean and Projective Space
3891310	4089988	1:04:51	Basically, the projective space. Is an extension of Eclidean space. And Epipolar geometry is a subset of projective geometry. But if you leave too much freedom to projective action, psychedelic experiences can result.	Projective space is an extension of Eclidean space	Projective and Eclidean Geometry
4090164	4337160	1:08:10	The way to replace this framework inside of optimal control is well adapted for any change of perspective and not just projective. I wonder if a creature or a robot with 360 degree cameras would it not be so perplexed as it wouldn't necessarily have a visual before or a visual in front and behind?	What if what we're seeing, quote in front of us is behind us	Projective and Mental Science
4337310	4512450	1:12:17	There are two projects now. The first one is to be able to maybe David can talk. The second one is more like machine learning. How to do sarcastic optimal control when the latent space is a homogeneous space is an open question. If some people want to work on the project, please tell us.	There are two projects now. One is for communication; the other is machine learning	Neuroscience and the epistemic drive
