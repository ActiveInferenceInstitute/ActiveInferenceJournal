00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,740
Hello and welcome

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,424
everyone. It's Active Inference guest

3
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:13,816
stream number 48.1 on July 19,

4
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:17,704
2023. We're here with Arthur Giuliani

5
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:20,616
and Adam Safron, also joined by Michael

6
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:22,888
Edward Johnson in discussion. We're

7
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:25,516
going to have a presentation and then a

8
00:00:25,538 --> 00:00:27,816
conversation about deep canals, a deep

9
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:29,428
learning approach to refining the

10
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:31,888
cannilization theory of psychopathology.

11
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:35,092
So thank you all for joining and looking

12
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:36,804
forward to this presentation and

13
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:37,620
discussion.

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,370
Thanks Daniel. I'm very happy to be here

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,996
with Admin Mike to talk about this work

16
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:50,364
and to discuss more broadly this general

17
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:52,124
direction that's emerged over the past

18
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:54,556
few years to try to utilize some of the

19
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:57,330
concepts from the active inference world

20
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,056
and computational modeling more

21
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,184
generally to understand what's going on

22
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:06,736
both in psychopathology and in

23
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:09,924
psychedelic therapy. Yeah, so I'll give

24
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:13,856
a brief presentation and we'll

25
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:15,172
move into a kind of more general

26
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:16,630
discussion of this work.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,680
It'll start with some kind of general

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,228
considerations around psychedelic

29
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:25,688
therapy, some of the neuroscience of

30
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:28,424
psychedelics, and then move kind of more

31
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:29,930
specifically into the model.

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,748
So there is this class of drugs, these

33
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:37,324
serotonergic psychedelic drugs, which

34
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:40,636
include psilocybin, DMT, LSD and others.

35
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:42,556
And the past decade has seen a

36
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:45,096
resurgence of interest in psychedelic

37
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:46,504
therapy, psychedelic assisted

38
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:50,752
psychotherapy, where one or

39
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,544
multiple of these drugs is used in

40
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:55,184
conjunction with a kind of

41
00:01:55,222 --> 00:01:58,876
psychotherapeutic protocol. And there's

42
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,044
been a lot of investment of money and

43
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:03,812
time and clinical resources into

44
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:05,968
utilizing these drugs for treatments

45
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:08,928
depression, anxiety disorders,

46
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,030
substance use disorders and others.

47
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,290
And there seems to be quite a lot of

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,664
positive signals suggesting that these

49
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:21,464
kinds of therapeutic interventions can

50
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:25,208
actually be quite effective. So there's

51
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:27,710
a number of studies suggesting that

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,716
psilocybin assisted psychotherapy can be

53
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:33,192
helpful for depression, anxiety,

54
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:36,284
substance use disorder and others. And

55
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,424
as this work advances, there are more

56
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:41,244
and more larger clinical trials

57
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:45,392
comparing it for example, to the

58
00:02:45,446 --> 00:02:48,960
standard treatments with SSRIs,

59
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,532
with multiple studies suggesting that

60
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,268
pilocybin assisted psychotherapy is at

61
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:59,712
least as effective as the Lexapro

62
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:01,670
kind of standard of care.

63
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,566
All of this seems to suggest, and the

64
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:11,134
timelines are kind of pointing at this

65
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:15,002
idea, that psilocybin

66
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:17,434
treatment for major depressive disorder

67
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:20,130
may be only a couple of years away from

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,506
becoming approved as an

69
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,460
actual treatment in the United States.

70
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,770
Which means that it's quite important

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,226
for us to understand what's going on

72
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:33,670
mechanistically in the brain so that

73
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,222
these kinds of treatments can be best

74
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:39,766
optimized, best determined how to be

75
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:43,946
used for

76
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:47,754
which kinds of mental issues people

77
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,874
might be having, and under what kinds of

78
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,906
treatment protocols we might expect the

79
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:57,166
most success. I think this

80
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:59,566
will also ultimately, hopefully lead to

81
00:03:59,588 --> 00:04:02,714
the development of even better drugs,

82
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:06,094
even better treatment protocols and much

83
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:08,480
more personalized care.

84
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,076
So some of the basics of how these drugs

85
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,888
work on the brain for those who are

86
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:20,128
unfamiliar, so these are the

87
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,564
serotonergic psychedelics. They are

88
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:24,164
serotonergic because they act as

89
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:27,024
agonists for a number of serotonin

90
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:29,024
receptors in the brain and the central

91
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:32,144
nervous system. More broadly, it's

92
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:35,464
thought that most specifically these

93
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:38,360
drugs like psilocybin work through

94
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,736
agonizing, the serotonin five H T

95
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:45,784
two A receptor. And this has

96
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:49,416
been demonstrated multiple

97
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:53,176
times by using blockers antagonists

98
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:55,964
of the five H T two A receptor which

99
00:04:56,002 --> 00:05:00,380
seem to largely remove the effect of

100
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,120
psilocybin or other psychedelic drugs.

101
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,896
And what this two A receptor does when

102
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:10,236
it's agonized is it excites the neuron,

103
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,776
making it more likely to fire. And this

104
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:14,276
is kind of essential to some of the

105
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:15,780
downstream effects.

106
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,636
So given that it seems that this two

107
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:24,068
way receptor that psychedelics are

108
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,464
mainly targeting, the question then

109
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:27,896
becomes well, where in the brain are

110
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,564
these two A receptors? Most widely

111
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:34,564
expressed? And research has focused

112
00:05:34,612 --> 00:05:37,156
on, I would say, three kind of key areas

113
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,532
over the past decade or so. The first

114
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,256
being the thalamus, which is a region

115
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:42,616
involved in the gating of sensory

116
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:45,340
information into the cortex.

117
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,988
There's a lot of expression in the

118
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:49,832
cortex itself, expression for example,

119
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:53,196
in the visual system, which is perhaps

120
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,848
not surprising given the prevalence of

121
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,676
visual hallucinations and psychedelic

122
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,560
use. But therapeutically a lot of focus

123
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,836
has been on the prefrontal cortex where

124
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,284
there is also a dense expression of

125
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:08,884
these receptors. And then also more

126
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:11,328
recent work has looked at the claustrom

127
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,300
which is a small brain region

128
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,504
responsible for coordinating the

129
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,412
transition dynamics of cortical

130
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:22,772
activation. And this too is likely

131
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:25,556
of central importance to the psychedelic

132
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:26,170
effect.

133
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,064
So kind of moving up one level of

134
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:35,088
abstraction to fMRI studies, there are a

135
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,664
few kind of like key takeaways which

136
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:39,600
have been identified from a few

137
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,628
different fMRI studies looking at

138
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:44,790
psychedelic use.

139
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,860
Kind of the main theme has

140
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,664
largely been this idea of increased

141
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:55,448
entropy or increased complexity of the

142
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:58,360
cortical activation in the brain.

143
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,690
So there are various measures of this.

144
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,936
On the right here there's a figure of

145
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,140
one of the common measures of complexity

146
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,680
and looking at various

147
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,876
different kinds of states that an

148
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,636
individual might be in and how that

149
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:19,872
relates to complexity. So you have

150
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,570
individuals in vegetative states or

151
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,604
anesthesized states having relatively

152
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:29,216
low brain activity complexity, you have

153
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:30,784
individuals in awake states having

154
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:33,860
higher complexity and then individuals

155
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,756
who have ingested either psilocybin or

156
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:39,376
LSD showing the highest brain

157
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:40,340
complexity.

158
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,016
Now, along with this, rather than just

159
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:47,076
this kind of like single unified score,

160
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:50,184
there's work looking particularly at the

161
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,924
changes in functional connectivity

162
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,496
between different brain regions or

163
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:56,276
different brain networks. And the

164
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:59,900
general trend seems to be that you have

165
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,816
decreased within network functional

166
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,372
connectivity and increase between

167
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,852
network functional connectivity, which

168
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,092
this kind of can be interpreted as

169
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:10,444
different brain networks which typically

170
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:11,808
don't communicate as much with each.

171
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:13,376
Other, more likely to communicate with

172
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:15,056
each other undo the effects of

173
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,736
psychedelics and the kind

174
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:21,544
of like internal coherence of networks

175
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:23,860
is reduced under psychedelics.

176
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,616
People have maybe heard of this default

177
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,376
mode network right, which is responsible

178
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,856
for a lot of self referential processing

179
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:34,324
which is responsible, which is typically

180
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:36,276
activated, for example, when individuals

181
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,976
are off task, mind wandering, not

182
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:43,956
actively engaged. The default mode

183
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:46,324
network has been kind of consistently

184
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:49,324
implicated in being having less of this

185
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,472
kind of like within network

186
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:52,296
connectivity, less of this functional

187
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:54,844
integration. And this has been

188
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:57,436
hypothesized to be one of the kind of

189
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,624
key mechanisms of the therapeutic effect

190
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:01,760
of psychedelics.

191
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,144
In addition to looking at kind of like

192
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,384
brain network activity on a high level,

193
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:13,396
you can then also zoom in much more

194
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:15,044
deeply and look at what's actually going

195
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:18,790
on at the neuron by neuron level or the

196
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,030
neuron connectivity level.

197
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,144
Here we see kind of very certain, very

198
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:29,210
consistent story around this

199
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,656
psychoplastogenic effect or this

200
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:34,328
neuroplastogenic effect, where there are

201
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,656
a number of different markers of

202
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:38,332
increased plasticity in the brain. So

203
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:40,620
one that's very common is this increased

204
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,244
brain derived neurotropic factor which

205
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:51,264
we see hours after psychedelic use for

206
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:53,836
a variety of different psychedelic

207
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:57,216
drugs. And this is then accompanied a

208
00:09:57,238 --> 00:10:01,120
few hours later by visible increases in

209
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,124
the dendritic spine growth in

210
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:08,404
cortical parameter neurons. So this is

211
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:12,180
both the number of dendritic spines and

212
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,564
the complexity of the spines. You can

213
00:10:14,602 --> 00:10:16,968
see a very clear example of this here on

214
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:20,472
the right, where you have on the top the

215
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:23,764
vehicle and then the bottom the DMT

216
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:27,080
treated pyramidal neuron.

217
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,316
And the difference is very stark. You

218
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,548
don't even have to do any sort of actual

219
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,516
computational analysis for it to be

220
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:37,336
clear that there's quite significant

221
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,980
dendritic growth from a single dosing.

222
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,508
And the changes to functional

223
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:46,128
connectivity, which I mentioned in the

224
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:49,472
previous slide, tend to persist, though

225
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:53,270
in a less extreme form than

226
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,940
what we see during the acute effects.

227
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,516
So the question then becomes, given all

228
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:04,580
of this, how can we attempt to tell

229
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,192
a consistent computational story,

230
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,176
what's actually going on during both the

231
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:11,204
acute effects, the post acute effects,

232
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,564
and in terms of the actual downstream

233
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:16,120
therapeutic outcomes?

234
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,430
So what's kind of been proposed as

235
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,692
one of the leading models of this

236
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:30,004
is the relaxed belief under psychedelics

237
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,508
model, the Rebus model of Carhartt,

238
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:35,612
Harris and Tristan. And so this builds

239
00:11:35,676 --> 00:11:37,916
on the kind of like active inference,

240
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,080
hierarchical predictive processing

241
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,868
framework where we can understand the

242
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:46,144
brain as this series of predictors

243
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,256
stacked kind of like hierarchically

244
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,580
along brain networks.

245
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,484
And predictions are being made

246
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:57,384
by higher level networks that are

247
00:11:57,422 --> 00:12:00,916
attempting to predict the errors

248
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:04,696
of lower level networks. And the

249
00:12:04,718 --> 00:12:06,808
process of basically doing this then

250
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,544
produces this series of belief

251
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,116
landscapes at different levels of

252
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:13,180
spatiotemporal abstraction.

253
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,180
And these belief landscapes, of course,

254
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,268
can encode beliefs with various levels

255
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:23,984
of precision. And it's the

256
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:27,424
modulation of the precision of these

257
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:29,376
beliefs which is believed to take place

258
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:30,850
under psychedelic use.

259
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,220
So here's kind of like a very high level

260
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,774
version of this Rebus model and how

261
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:43,838
belief relaxation might actually happen,

262
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:46,160
right? So given that you have this

263
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,906
series of cortical networks which are

264
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:51,154
representing beliefs at different

265
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:54,818
spatiotemporal scales. We can kind of

266
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,658
think of the thalamus as being kind of

267
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:58,894
like the entry point where sensory

268
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:01,494
information is being gated into this

269
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,546
hierarchical system and the prefrontal

270
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:06,342
cortex as being kind of like one of the

271
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:08,054
highest level. Networks, which is then

272
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:11,586
responsible for both representing

273
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:14,218
the most abstract kinds of beliefs as

274
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:16,582
well as being kind of the primary

275
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:18,986
inhibiting force for all of the

276
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,146
downstream beliefs in the network, in

277
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,380
the system. So what is

278
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,026
this heavy agonism of the five h T two A

279
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,454
receptor supposed to be doing in this

280
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:32,218
case? Well, it's going to be decreasing

281
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:35,790
the prefrontal cortex's ability to make

282
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,502
coherent predictions and coherent

283
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,874
representations of belief, which will

284
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:44,654
then disrupt its ability to inhibit

285
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:47,410
lower levels of the cortical hierarchy.

286
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,882
At the same time, by disrupt this

287
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:54,194
activation of the Salamic or

288
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,242
this disruption of the thalamic gating

289
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:58,754
is going to result in additional sensory

290
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,326
information entering the cortex that

291
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:02,302
wouldn't underwise enter the cortex.

292
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,858
You have these kind of disruptions at

293
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:08,554
these two levels which then

294
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:12,394
result in beliefs being

295
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:15,678
spontaneously represented in ways that

296
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:17,338
they wouldn't normally be represented.

297
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:21,342
And the Rebus model at least is

298
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:23,374
suggesting that this mainly is going to

299
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,722
manifest itself as a kind of relaxation

300
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:27,070
of these beliefs.

301
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,922
So here is a kind of like very simple

302
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:36,740
diagram of what this might look like.

303
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,906
So you have some landscape of beliefs

304
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:43,330
here and you can kind of interpret

305
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,446
the position along the

306
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:51,106
X and Y or, I guess, the X and Z belief

307
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:53,994
in A as being corresponding to some

308
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:55,626
particular belief that might be

309
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,870
represented by the network at this layer

310
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,514
or at this level of representation. And

311
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:04,602
then the Y axis, the height as being the

312
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:06,958
actual precision of that belief. Right?

313
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:09,274
So here we have this kind of very deep

314
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,754
part on the right part of this network

315
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:15,134
or on this landscape and this would

316
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:17,594
be a very strongly represented belief.

317
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:21,114
Let's say what the acute

318
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:22,466
effects of psychedelics are then

319
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,906
understood to be doing right is to be

320
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:25,634
flattening this landscape to be less

321
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:27,246
strongly representing these strongly

322
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,474
represented beliefs to maybe making it

323
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,098
easier for the reversal

324
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:36,294
of this landscape. So to move from one

325
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:38,002
attractor state to another tractor

326
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:38,680
state,

327
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,038
which is meant to be understood to be

328
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,800
kind of therapeutic in various ways,

329
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,762
and then the post acute effect being

330
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:51,498
some kind of return to normalcy, but one

331
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,882
that is not totally complete, one that

332
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,754
still incorporates some of these newly

333
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:57,626
relaxed beliefs, these newly explored

334
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:58,430
beliefs.

335
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,848
Building on this rebus model, karin

336
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:09,532
Harris and colleagues last year proposed

337
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:11,812
this canal model of psychopathology,

338
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:13,576
which basically kind of takes the

339
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,788
intuition that the relaxation,

340
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:19,816
if the Reevis model is correct, if the

341
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:23,124
relaxation of beliefs has a therapeutic

342
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:25,816
outcome. If you kind of take that way of

343
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:29,320
thinking to its logical conclusion, you

344
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,392
might then propose something like this,

345
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:35,810
which would say if

346
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,844
relaxing overly strong beliefs

347
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:41,312
therapeutic, then having overly strong

348
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:42,992
beliefs in the first place is

349
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:45,170
pathological in some kind of way.

350
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,464
And they refer to this development

351
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:52,896
of these overly strongly represented

352
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:57,220
beliefs as canalized beliefs and

353
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,000
this problem generally as canalization

354
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,164
or this process of developing them as

355
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:04,944
canalization. And this is the canal

356
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,808
model of psych pathology. So they kind

357
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:08,250
of build on this idea,

358
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,688
this set of previous work in the

359
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:13,596
literature suggesting that there may be

360
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,752
some primary factor of psychopathology

361
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:17,592
and they suggest that this primary

362
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:20,924
factor is canalization. And in this work

363
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:22,670
they discuss a number of different

364
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,632
psychopathologies which seem to quite

365
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:29,010
clearly fit this canalization type

366
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,120
characterization. So it's very

367
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,864
relatively straightforward I think, to

368
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:36,204
understand things like addiction,

369
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:37,952
depression, anxiety disorders,

370
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,196
obsessive compulsive disorders. All of

371
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:42,230
these involve in one way or another

372
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,460
having some strongly held beliefs,

373
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,728
typically negative, negative beliefs in

374
00:17:49,754 --> 00:17:51,720
the case of like, depression, anxiety,

375
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,116
obsessive compulsive, body image

376
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:57,716
disorder, or in the case of substance

377
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:59,716
use disorder, some very strong beliefs

378
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:02,212
about what kind of behaviors should be

379
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:04,332
taken at any given time in any given

380
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:07,916
context. And then

381
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:10,332
of course, the effect of psychedelics is

382
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:13,660
to undo canalization and

383
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,796
the better able any sort of therapeutic

384
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:18,796
intervention is to undo canalization,

385
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:21,164
the more likely for a positive

386
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:22,480
therapeutic outcome.

387
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,656
So I think this work has a lot of

388
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:29,424
strengths and there's a kind of elegance

389
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:33,376
to it. In our deep

390
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:37,270
Pinal's work that we've worked on,

391
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,396
we kind of identify a couple of

392
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,184
limitations of this canal model and

393
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,776
attempt to extend and refine the model

394
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:46,856
in ways that I think ultimately make it

395
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:49,624
more powerful, while kind of keeping the

396
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:53,210
essential elegant insight that

397
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,044
cannibalization is kind of like

398
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:59,020
intimately tied to pathology.

399
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,036
So the first kind of limitation I think

400
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,448
that we identify is that in

401
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:08,380
the canal model it's very heavily

402
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,696
implied that all forms of

403
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,528
canalization are pathological in one way

404
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:17,892
or another. And as I mentioned just now,

405
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,372
this is clearly the case for a large

406
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,980
class of very common psychopathologies.

407
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,372
It's when we start to look more towards

408
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:29,172
edge cases, I think that these

409
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,064
exceptions start to problematize this

410
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:34,808
understanding, right? So if we consider

411
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,844
psychopathologies such as bipolar,

412
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:39,380
borderline schizophrenia,

413
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,320
depersonalization disorder,

414
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,684
it becomes much more difficult to kind

415
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:48,024
of easily classify these as simply

416
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:51,196
problems of overly strong priors. In

417
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:54,108
many cases here we have problems of

418
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,524
priors that are not so strong or priors

419
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:59,120
that seem to drift over time in ways

420
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,976
that are problematic for both the

421
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:03,776
individual and the people that the

422
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:07,632
individual are close to. And if we

423
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:09,316
think about psychedelics then as being

424
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,456
this kind of panacea to undo

425
00:20:11,488 --> 00:20:13,220
cannibalization and undo

426
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,836
psychopathology, we also run into this

427
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:18,276
other issue which is that there are

428
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:21,320
certain kinds of psychopathologies which

429
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:27,208
are typically issues

430
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:29,176
for use with psychedelics, right? So

431
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,304
schizophrenia being a very clear one,

432
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:33,624
where there's evidence of psychedelic

433
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,284
use being a trigger for the onset of

434
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,380
psychosis in individuals who are

435
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,380
predisposed to schizophrenia.

436
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,704
There's also evidence of the development

437
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:46,624
of depersonalization disorders with

438
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,776
strong psychedelic use. And this is not

439
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,644
what we would expect if psychedelics

440
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:56,400
were simply universally undoing

441
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,620
or getting rid of psychopathologies.

442
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,524
There's also this idea, which I think

443
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,156
Adam is going to develop quite a bit

444
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:09,584
later, that the stability of beliefs

445
00:21:09,712 --> 00:21:11,444
is typically correlated with positive

446
00:21:11,492 --> 00:21:13,092
mental health outcomes, not negative

447
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:16,344
ones. And what is a stable belief if not

448
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:18,568
one that is highly analyzed in some kind

449
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:21,210
of meaningful sense within the system?

450
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,772
And a second limitation is

451
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:33,436
that if you think about an actual

452
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:37,792
dynamical system, one that is

453
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,516
parameterized in some kind of meaningful

454
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,896
way, like a brain, which is

455
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:42,972
parameterized by synaptic connections

456
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:46,556
and then instantiates neural activity

457
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:49,364
patterns over time, and we think about

458
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:51,216
what kinds of optimization landscapes

459
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:53,268
are actually being induced by such a

460
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:57,088
system. We find that there's

461
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,088
not just one kind of canalization,

462
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,416
there's actually two kinds of

463
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:05,224
canalization. And in

464
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:07,256
our deep canals work, we attempt to kind

465
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:09,832
of take inspiration from deep learning

466
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:13,176
literature to tease apart these

467
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,988
two kinds of canalization and understand

468
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:19,004
them a bit more clearly. And they are

469
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:22,284
just to kind of give a preview these two

470
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:23,676
different things, overfitting and

471
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:27,340
plasticity loss. So overfitting is

472
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,576
the problem of your

473
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,632
canalized in a particular kind of way

474
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:37,276
and whatever sort of policy you've

475
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:38,956
learned, whatever sort of set of beliefs

476
00:22:38,988 --> 00:22:41,076
you have, these don't generalize to some

477
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:43,670
other context. You're in context A,

478
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,484
you may be very well adapted, you move

479
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:48,736
to context B and whatever you've learned

480
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:49,990
doesn't apply there,

481
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,056
then plasticity loss is a little bit

482
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:56,936
different. Plasticity loss has to do

483
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,156
with not one's ability to generalize,

484
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:02,424
but rather one's ability to adapt or to

485
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:04,788
learn. So imagine you're in context A,

486
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:07,708
you may or may not be well adapted to

487
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:10,156
context A. If you move to context B,

488
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:12,732
the question becomes are you able to

489
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:16,064
adapt to context B or not? Not. Are you

490
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:18,576
immediately already ready to deal with

491
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:21,984
context B? But given time in context B,

492
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:23,410
can you learn and change?

493
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,976
And we use a very simple recurrent

494
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,484
neural network model to kind of make

495
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:33,572
sense of this. And I think this is

496
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:35,684
important because there can be different

497
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:38,596
kinds of canalization on these different

498
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:41,832
kinds of optimization landscapes and

499
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:45,496
these have unique implications for the

500
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:48,136
treatment of psychopathology. And I

501
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:50,644
think even more importantly,

502
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:52,444
psychedelics work on these different

503
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:54,652
landscapes in different ways. And so

504
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:58,124
understanding how they work is

505
00:23:58,162 --> 00:24:01,832
essential to developing better drugs,

506
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:03,596
better treatment protocols and more

507
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:05,020
personalized treatment.

508
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,844
Okay, so what are these two optimization

509
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:12,416
landscapes? How can we make sense of

510
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:16,064
them? This is kind of like the

511
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:18,876
big overview figure of the deep canal's

512
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:22,404
work. So we kind of start with this

513
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:24,224
intuition of a recurrent neural network,

514
00:24:24,272 --> 00:24:26,100
right? And in a recurrent neural network

515
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,304
there are these two sets of parameters

516
00:24:28,352 --> 00:24:30,036
that you have at any given time. You

517
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:32,308
have the actual weights of the network

518
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:35,748
and then you have the hidden activation

519
00:24:35,844 --> 00:24:37,288
of the network, right? And so the

520
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:39,528
weights of the network are theta and the

521
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:42,024
hidden activation is h and there's some

522
00:24:42,062 --> 00:24:44,276
input into the network at any given time

523
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:47,944
step. And then the output of the network

524
00:24:47,992 --> 00:24:50,716
is a function of both the input and the

525
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:52,876
hidden state. And the hidden state is

526
00:24:52,898 --> 00:24:54,696
updated at every time the hidden

527
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:58,560
activation pattern. And this gives us

528
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,952
essentially these two different

529
00:25:00,006 --> 00:25:03,296
landscapes. One, what we refer to as the

530
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:04,816
inference landscape or the type A

531
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,448
landscape. And this is equivalent to the

532
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,540
neural activation pattern of a brain at

533
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,516
any time. So what gets read off from an

534
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:13,476
fMRI, what gets read off from the EEG is

535
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:16,112
going to correspond to this activity

536
00:25:16,176 --> 00:25:20,164
landscape, but kind of like underlying

537
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:22,440
or supporting this activity landscape is

538
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,436
this other more fundamental landscape

539
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:25,732
which is the actual optimization

540
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:28,168
landscape that is induced by the

541
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:29,690
synaptic weights themselves.

542
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,336
And this is what is the result of

543
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:37,436
right click synaptic connectivity in the

544
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,916
brain between all the sets of neurons in

545
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,676
the brain. This is what is changing when

546
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:43,788
we have various forms of heavy and

547
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,390
plasticity heavy in learning.

548
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,068
And this is what kind of instantiates

549
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:54,524
the possible sets of neural activity

550
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:57,056
patterns, right? So this is kind of like

551
00:25:57,078 --> 00:25:59,190
a way we can start to understand this,

552
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,896
which is when we think about belief

553
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,772
landscapes, right? As I mentioned

554
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:09,376
before, here's a very simple diagram

555
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:10,884
where we have a two dimensional belief

556
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:14,552
landscape. And let's say there's someone

557
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,460
who's depressed or potentially depressed

558
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,344
and they might have a negative self

559
00:26:20,382 --> 00:26:23,576
image. I'm a terrible person, I can't do

560
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:25,112
anything right. Something like this.

561
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:27,544
This would be encoded as a particular

562
00:26:27,742 --> 00:26:30,360
position in this belief landscape.

563
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,112
When the neural activity pattern looks

564
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,424
like this, this belief is what gets

565
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:39,132
expressed, right? And there's

566
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:41,388
another set of neural activity patterns

567
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:42,764
which would correspond to a positive

568
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:44,876
self image, a positive self belief, I'm

569
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:46,988
great, I'm wonderful, or even just, I'm

570
00:26:47,004 --> 00:26:49,508
okay, I'm totally acceptable as a

571
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:51,812
person. And this would be a different

572
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:56,132
set of patterns. So based

573
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:59,024
on the synaptic, the actual connectivity

574
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:01,304
structure of the brain, these two

575
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:04,264
patterns may be more or less likely. So

576
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:05,896
here these are being represented by

577
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:09,290
these two different sets of

578
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,536
neural activation landscapes which are

579
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:14,636
the result of two different positions in

580
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:16,830
this synaptic weight landscape space.

581
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,556
And in this top space, the one

582
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:23,484
that's in the middle of here that then

583
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:26,624
is represented here at the top of part C

584
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:29,650
of the figure, we see that there's very

585
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,504
high precision assigned to or very high

586
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:36,032
likelihood assigned to the negative self

587
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:39,252
image and very low likelihood here

588
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:42,660
assigned to the positive self image.

589
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,408
But in some other part of the synaptic

590
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:49,684
weight landscape, a very different kind

591
00:27:49,722 --> 00:27:51,576
of neural activity landscape might be

592
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:54,024
instantiated. And this one kind of has

593
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:57,364
the inverse properties where negative

594
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:59,944
self image is unlikely and positive self

595
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:02,636
image is much more likely. So we can

596
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:06,284
kind of then understand positions in

597
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:08,396
the neural activity landscape as kind of

598
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:10,076
corresponding to specific

599
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:11,832
phenomenological experiential

600
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:14,076
instantiations of certain kinds of

601
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:15,792
beliefs, right? So like the actual

602
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:19,344
experience of holding a negative self

603
00:28:19,382 --> 00:28:21,520
image or holding a positive self image.

604
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,664
And we can understand positions in the

605
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:27,684
synaptic weight landscape as being

606
00:28:27,722 --> 00:28:29,076
something more general. So in the case

607
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:31,780
of depression, there might be a specific

608
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,384
set of synaptic weight connectivity

609
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:38,436
which would correspond to what you

610
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,040
might call a depressed individual,

611
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,752
someone who might qualify as having

612
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:43,752
major depressive disorder and another

613
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,940
set of synaptic weights connectivity

614
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,450
pattern that wouldn't qualify as that.

615
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,246
Okay, so before I get into the

616
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,286
psychedelic, how psychedelics relate to

617
00:28:59,308 --> 00:29:01,366
this, I think Adam is going to talk a

618
00:29:01,388 --> 00:29:04,534
little bit about some work he's done

619
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:05,960
extending the.

620
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,366
Hello. So,

621
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:28,110
yeah, I've been thinking about this

622
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,886
a while and then along the way I

623
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,682
met Arthur, who also has been thinking

624
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:35,842
about this a while, but in different

625
00:29:35,896 --> 00:29:39,714
ways. And so like

626
00:29:39,752 --> 00:29:42,178
Arthur's background is in basically

627
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,740
consciousness science and a very

628
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,762
peculiar field of computational

629
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:49,718
consciousness science in terms of actual

630
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:51,846
models of what it would be to have a

631
00:29:51,868 --> 00:29:54,646
conscious system, even potentially an

632
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,320
artificially conscious system. And so

633
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,662
I'm coming from more free energy

634
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,978
principle and active inference, my

635
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,186
background and Arthur's coming from more

636
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,586
mainstream machine learning. And so we

637
00:30:06,688 --> 00:30:10,446
were coming together to explore this

638
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:13,054
beast from different perspectives and

639
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:15,806
been finding a lot of, I think, very

640
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:19,566
interesting overlap. And so in terms of

641
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:22,750
Albus, the basic idea is to take Rebus

642
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,930
and expand on it. I love rebus.

643
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,338
It's a great framework and I've been

644
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:31,634
trying to make it, I guess, more

645
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:34,306
flexible in terms of being able to

646
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:36,514
handle a wider range of assumptions. So

647
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:38,466
not just talking about relaxed beliefs,

648
00:30:38,498 --> 00:30:40,306
but also potentially strengthened

649
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,990
beliefs and in different combinations.

650
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,402
This was always part of the rebus

651
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:46,246
framework. And that you can have all

652
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:48,130
sorts of both direct and indirect

653
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,006
effects. When you're dealing with a

654
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:52,586
large predictive hierarchy or any

655
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:54,746
complex system, you change something in

656
00:30:54,768 --> 00:30:56,282
one way, but then you'll get an effect

657
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:58,118
elsewhere. So if you have this hierarchy

658
00:30:58,134 --> 00:31:00,122
of predictions, for instance, you can

659
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:02,974
potentially relax beliefs at higher

660
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:05,022
levels and that can indirectly cause

661
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:07,098
strengthened beliefs at lower levels.

662
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:09,134
So you can both get relaxed and

663
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:10,426
strengthened beliefs and psychedelics

664
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,110
and all sorts of different combinations.

665
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,274
And so with Albus the

666
00:31:16,312 --> 00:31:19,406
idea is so I've been calling as opposed

667
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:21,586
to a belief relaxation. When you get

668
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:25,542
this sort of basically bottom

669
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:28,102
right here, you might see it. So this

670
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:32,582
red would be basically something

671
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:35,874
like a synchronized complex of neural

672
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:40,090
activity, often involving the thalamus,

673
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,426
which would be thought to encode your

674
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:45,514
predictions, or your top down stream of

675
00:31:45,552 --> 00:31:47,706
priors, which then are suppressing the

676
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:49,370
ascending stream of prediction errors.

677
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,798
And so under revis, you're seeing here

678
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:57,578
relaxed predictions, a smaller complex

679
00:31:57,674 --> 00:31:59,914
of synchronized activity. And the gates

680
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,466
are down. Just like Arthur described,

681
00:32:01,498 --> 00:32:03,746
more things are coming in. Rebus will

682
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:07,810
sometimes be described in terms of so

683
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,114
when we're talking about rebus this idea

684
00:32:10,152 --> 00:32:12,146
of relaxing beliefs. We're thinking at

685
00:32:12,168 --> 00:32:15,246
the functional or computational level,

686
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,958
like with David Mars and analyzing the

687
00:32:17,964 --> 00:32:19,810
mind, you have these three, I suppose,

688
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,938
Supervenient levels. They're compatible

689
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:23,922
and synergistic. So computational

690
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:27,206
functional, like abstractly, what is

691
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:29,546
the system doing? Something like the

692
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:31,450
pseudocode of the system and then

693
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,986
implementational mechanistically how

694
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:34,602
it's realized and then in the middle,

695
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:37,286
some sort of algorithmic intermediate

696
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:39,226
abstraction layer. How are these

697
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,666
computations realized via these

698
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:42,710
mechanisms? Some bridging. Principle

699
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,166
description. And so when it comes to

700
00:32:45,188 --> 00:32:47,742
rebus, you can adopt it in different

701
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:49,310
ways and relate to it differently. So

702
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,746
you can relate to it at the functional

703
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:53,726
level or you can relate to it at the

704
00:32:53,748 --> 00:32:55,730
algorithmic or implementational levels

705
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,226
in terms of where you're taking the

706
00:32:58,248 --> 00:33:00,546
account. So, for instance, you might

707
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:02,178
think something like rebus effects is a

708
00:33:02,184 --> 00:33:04,690
very valuable model of something like

709
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,146
what they call quantum change of

710
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:08,094
psychedelics. But you don't necessarily

711
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:09,766
believe in predictive processing, but

712
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,366
you still might be, you could say like a

713
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:14,262
rebus type theorist. Or you might be

714
00:33:14,316 --> 00:33:16,406
thinking in terms of rebus in a more

715
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,886
narrow sense of thinking, of predictive

716
00:33:18,918 --> 00:33:21,786
processing information flows, but then

717
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:24,506
when you get to the overall person and

718
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:26,618
integrated organism and the agent, you

719
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:27,782
might have different interpretations

720
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:31,386
there. So with the work with Albus,

721
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:32,446
basically the idea would be to take

722
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:36,026
predictive processing and models

723
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,414
of psychedelic action and suggest that

724
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:41,726
sometimes not only do

725
00:33:41,748 --> 00:33:42,986
we have these relaxation of belief

726
00:33:43,018 --> 00:33:43,918
landscapes, but we might have the

727
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:45,954
opposite of strengthening. And so

728
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:47,714
specifically, if you're activating these

729
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:50,226
five HD two A neurons, which would be at

730
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:53,006
the deeper levels of the cortical sheet

731
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,818
and also the deeper levels of the

732
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,546
cortical hierarchy, more inwards and

733
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,218
higher up, and these would be the units

734
00:33:58,254 --> 00:33:59,862
that would loop to the thalamus and

735
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:02,150
thereby be able to form large

736
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,550
synchronous integrated complexes.

737
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,694
But that when you excite them too much,

738
00:34:06,732 --> 00:34:08,114
they don't wait for each other to sync

739
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:11,626
up, they fire whenever they can out of

740
00:34:11,648 --> 00:34:13,206
sync. And this relaxes the belief

741
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:16,394
landscape. However, it's not clear this

742
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:18,442
should happen the whole way through for

743
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,746
any amount of increasing the gain on

744
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:23,086
these neurons. So in theory, just

745
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:24,574
increasing the gain a little bit,

746
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:27,790
unless that might help them to sync up,

747
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,274
that might strengthen the belief,

748
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:31,518
whether it's a situationally specific

749
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:33,794
suggestion of you in this context or

750
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:35,218
maybe something old coming to the

751
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:38,130
surface and if you will manifesting.

752
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,246
So Albus basically, in a nutshell,

753
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:44,354
would be saying to take rebus and keep

754
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:47,510
going with it and look for different

755
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,402
combinations of both strengthened,

756
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,170
both directly and indirectly

757
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,270
strengthened and relaxed beliefs.

758
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,038
That's basically it. And so I'm not

759
00:34:58,044 --> 00:34:59,510
going to go into too many more details.

760
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,642
Arthur and I just submitted this for

761
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:04,106
publication. Wish us luck. Hopefully the

762
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:06,170
reviewers will be useful,

763
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,770
maybe even kind, but preferably useful,

764
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,834
and kick it back to Arthur.

765
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:16,720
But before work,

766
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,718
I think it's immensely important that we

767
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:23,040
get these details, right? These are

768
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,714
extremely powerful medicines that could

769
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:27,298
revolutionize things or we could have a

770
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:29,358
backlash if we do it wrong, if we're

771
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:32,542
careless, if we don't see the risks,

772
00:35:32,686 --> 00:35:36,054
but also if we're overly beholden to a

773
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,334
single way of viewing things

774
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:39,414
prematurely, we might also miss

775
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:41,442
opportunities to help, potentially

776
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,570
enormous opportunities. For instance,

777
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,640
you might not think of helping people,

778
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,154
for instance, micro dosing for cognitive

779
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:50,886
decline. You might not have thought of

780
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:53,594
that and that might be a really big deal

781
00:35:53,632 --> 00:35:56,940
that you do think of that. So I guess

782
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,194
for going back to Arthur, one more thing

783
00:35:59,232 --> 00:36:02,638
would be just in terms of, at least for

784
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:04,542
me, experientially. The way I sometimes

785
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,882
think of it is with relation

786
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:10,350
to well being and suffering,

787
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,798
both things matter, like the strength of

788
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:16,702
your positive beliefs and the strength

789
00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:18,642
of your negative beliefs. And sometimes

790
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:19,886
the negative beliefs have positive

791
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:22,194
aspects and vice versa. So it's both

792
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:24,706
like you might relax your beliefs and to

793
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:27,074
use like a Harry Potter metaphor be

794
00:36:27,112 --> 00:36:29,158
somewhat so much out of the grip of the

795
00:36:29,164 --> 00:36:32,326
dementors that usually that under some

796
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:34,406
circumstances might be pursuing you that

797
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:36,390
you have room to be different, to become

798
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,586
different, to think different things

799
00:36:38,688 --> 00:36:41,290
under this different state. But

800
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,894
additionally, and not mutually

801
00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:45,126
exclusively, not necessarily

802
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:47,722
incompatibly maybe synergistically the

803
00:36:47,776 --> 00:36:50,026
strength of what beliefs you're able to

804
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,406
have in that moment and maybe draw upon

805
00:36:52,438 --> 00:36:54,240
from the past could be deeply important.

806
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,086
Your values, the kinds of beliefs that

807
00:36:57,108 --> 00:36:59,358
you call upon in times of need and they

808
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:01,646
give you hope. Maybe those are just

809
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:03,166
originally suggested to you right there

810
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,618
in the session. But maybe there's

811
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:07,138
something else, another belief, and that

812
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:09,314
strengthening it could be a good thing.

813
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,054
And even without a clinical context,

814
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:13,666
like microdosers, for instance, it's not

815
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:15,374
clear exactly they're trying to relax

816
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:17,366
their beliefs, like the range of use

817
00:37:17,388 --> 00:37:18,646
cases, the way we want to relate them

818
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:21,606
and how we want to be in the world. It

819
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:25,654
seems complicated to me. So I will take

820
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:27,670
it back to Arthur.

821
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,416
Great. Yeah. Thanks so much, Adam. OK,

822
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,016
so with that context of Alice, I want to

823
00:37:44,038 --> 00:37:45,952
talk a little bit about how we might

824
00:37:46,006 --> 00:37:50,964
understand at a very high level what

825
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,916
psychedelics are doing to these two

826
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:56,416
belief landscapes. So before I showed

827
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:57,956
you very quickly, I guess I can go back

828
00:37:57,978 --> 00:38:01,016
to it. In the Rebus model there's only

829
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:03,576
one type of optimization landscape and

830
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:06,164
so there's only one type of canalization

831
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:09,016
and what is supposed to be happening is

832
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:12,568
a relaxation of leaves which is

833
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:14,124
strong during the acute effect and

834
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:16,430
persists in the post acute effect.

835
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,796
So with albus though, we might be able

836
00:38:20,818 --> 00:38:22,284
to think about all of this a little bit

837
00:38:22,322 --> 00:38:26,380
differently. We can, enduring the

838
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,012
acute effects of psychedelics,

839
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:29,776
interpret what's happening to the type A

840
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:32,016
landscape as being less of a kind of

841
00:38:32,038 --> 00:38:34,448
universal relaxation and more of a kind

842
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:36,848
of destabilization where under certain

843
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:38,436
circumstances beliefs are being

844
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,580
strengthened, other beliefs. Are being

845
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,304
relaxed. This is changing quite rapidly

846
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:48,116
over the course of time. So a

847
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:50,956
certain belief might be transiently

848
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:53,384
strengthened a few minutes later, it may

849
00:38:53,422 --> 00:38:55,800
no longer be supported or supportable.

850
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,936
And this actually functionally enables a

851
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:04,588
kind of exploration of a wide space

852
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:07,628
of belief instantiations during the

853
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:09,180
acute effects of the drug.

854
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,996
As far as the inference landscape is

855
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,376
concerned, post acute effects, as Adam

856
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:18,400
was saying, it could be the fact that

857
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,236
certain positive beliefs are explored

858
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:23,404
and can be strengthened, other negative

859
00:39:23,452 --> 00:39:25,568
beliefs might be weakened. This is kind

860
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,356
of like the ideal psychotherapeutic

861
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:31,044
outcome. It may be on

862
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:32,228
average that something like a

863
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:34,116
relaxation, a general relaxation of

864
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,396
beliefs is what you might see. But the

865
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,796
way that you get there is likely going

866
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:41,656
to be through a kind of much more

867
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:44,964
complicated process, I think. What's

868
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:47,288
then interesting and related also to

869
00:39:47,294 --> 00:39:49,704
what Adam said about thinking much more

870
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:51,576
broadly about how psychedelics might be

871
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,928
used in terms of neurocognitive

872
00:39:52,964 --> 00:39:54,476
disorders, in addition to kind of like

873
00:39:54,498 --> 00:39:57,516
traditional psychopathologies is to

874
00:39:57,538 --> 00:40:00,076
think about what's happening to the

875
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,964
learning landscape, the kind of like

876
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:04,024
underlying synaptic weight landscape.

877
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,432
And what do we understand is happening

878
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:09,890
here kind of quite clearly is there is

879
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,484
neurogenesis psychoplastogenic effects,

880
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:15,648
there's dendritic growth. And what is

881
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:17,484
this enabling? Well, this is enabling

882
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:20,724
greater connectivity between, within and

883
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:24,436
between networks. And so kind of from a

884
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:28,512
functional learning perspective,

885
00:40:28,576 --> 00:40:30,164
learning theory perspective, what this

886
00:40:30,202 --> 00:40:33,636
means is that gradient information can

887
00:40:33,658 --> 00:40:35,852
flow more easily through these networks.

888
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,764
And what this means is that it's easier

889
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:39,576
to get from one part of the network to

890
00:40:39,598 --> 00:40:41,224
the other part of the network. There are

891
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:43,640
fewer of these kind of optimization

892
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,216
local minima, there are fewer of these

893
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:49,950
kind of tricky saddle points.

894
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,924
And what this means kind of like

895
00:40:52,962 --> 00:40:54,584
functionally is that this plasticity

896
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:56,736
loss that I discussed earlier is going

897
00:40:56,758 --> 00:41:00,096
to be less of an issue. And here it

898
00:41:00,118 --> 00:41:01,824
seems to be kind of like regardless of

899
00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:05,420
the acute, the actual phenomenological

900
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,980
effects, there are very strong

901
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,936
downstream effects on this structural

902
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:15,396
connectivity. And I think there's some

903
00:41:15,418 --> 00:41:17,364
interesting work suggesting that there

904
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:19,780
may actually be independent mechanisms

905
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,436
that are affecting these two landscapes.

906
00:41:22,468 --> 00:41:24,056
So there's recent work suggesting for

907
00:41:24,078 --> 00:41:27,672
example that psychedelics as well as

908
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:30,164
ketamine is able to kind of particularly

909
00:41:30,212 --> 00:41:33,128
bind to receptors in the brain that

910
00:41:33,214 --> 00:41:35,736
produce that result in the kind of

911
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:36,964
release of the brain derived

912
00:41:37,012 --> 00:41:39,084
neurotrophic factor and then the

913
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,136
downstream changes in synaptic weighting

914
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:45,416
and that this may be potentially totally

915
00:41:45,448 --> 00:41:47,136
independent of the five H C two a

916
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:48,290
agonism. Right?

917
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,728
And this has very interesting

918
00:41:51,814 --> 00:41:53,856
implications for future drug design and

919
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,912
development. Okay,

920
00:41:56,966 --> 00:41:59,104
so I'm going to, before my next slide,

921
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:01,316
turn it over to Adam once more to

922
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:04,944
briefly talk a bit about personality

923
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,756
theory and the relationship between

924
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,310
psychedelics and.

925
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,160
Hello again.

926
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,750
So for the past few years I've been

927
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,434
doing some work with a personality

928
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:25,274
researcher, Colin de Jung, on

929
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:28,378
intersections between the way agency is

930
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:30,426
modeled in the free energy principle and

931
00:42:30,448 --> 00:42:32,506
active inference framework and the way

932
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:35,162
that persons are considered in different

933
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:37,354
situations in personality science and

934
00:42:37,392 --> 00:42:38,890
looking for points of intersection.

935
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,266
Personality is actually an extremely

936
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:46,400
deep concept. And if you think of it,

937
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,582
I guess we call it like the normal form

938
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:53,346
of a system in terms of what is

939
00:42:53,368 --> 00:42:55,186
the way you can describe the most of the

940
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,682
system with like the minimal message

941
00:42:57,736 --> 00:43:00,658
length, the account for the most of the

942
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:03,154
least. And what we're trying to account

943
00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:05,286
for is the states that people tend to

944
00:43:05,308 --> 00:43:06,950
occupy, people aren't always happy,

945
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,914
people aren't always sad, people aren't

946
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:11,494
always friendly, they're not always

947
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:13,302
angry. It's all sorts of things that

948
00:43:13,436 --> 00:43:14,646
there's a range that people are

949
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:16,946
encountering but they tend to occupy

950
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:18,778
some states more than others. And you

951
00:43:18,784 --> 00:43:20,986
might call that their personality and

952
00:43:21,008 --> 00:43:23,146
you might call it many systems would

953
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:24,426
have their own personalities in terms of

954
00:43:24,448 --> 00:43:26,266
trying to describe something like their

955
00:43:26,288 --> 00:43:29,698
essence and so they're attracting

956
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:33,258
states. And so with Colin de Jung's

957
00:43:33,274 --> 00:43:36,110
work, he interprets personality and

958
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,894
these major domains of personality that

959
00:43:38,932 --> 00:43:42,366
people have discovered a reliable factor

960
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:43,986
structure ways you can chunk the

961
00:43:44,008 --> 00:43:47,406
variance, the big five as a trait

962
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:49,282
hierarchy but where these different

963
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:51,930
traits are interpreted as cybernetic

964
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,194
control parameters. Specifically

965
00:43:54,322 --> 00:43:56,454
cybernetics in terms of the study of

966
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:58,546
goal seeking systems governed by various

967
00:43:58,578 --> 00:44:01,138
forms of feedback that different stages

968
00:44:01,234 --> 00:44:04,270
of the process of pursuing goals,

969
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,730
evaluating outcomes updating

970
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,290
understanding that basically the

971
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,026
personality as different modes of being

972
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:15,366
in the world. For cybernetic systems,

973
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:17,306
interpreting them as parameters for goal

974
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:19,354
pursuit because we are goal seeking

975
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:22,174
systems trying to pursue the goals we

976
00:44:22,212 --> 00:44:26,206
value. And so I

977
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:29,458
guess moving to this with relation to

978
00:44:29,464 --> 00:44:31,586
what we're talking about now, both in

979
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:33,182
terms of personality formation,

980
00:44:33,246 --> 00:44:34,706
reformation and the structure of

981
00:44:34,728 --> 00:44:35,570
personality.

982
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,334
To. Get to the P factor within

983
00:44:43,452 --> 00:44:46,182
personality theory, this big five

984
00:44:46,236 --> 00:44:48,290
traits, the set of big five traits,

985
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,874
there's a richer or more detailed factor

986
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:55,146
structure, a hierarchical structure for

987
00:44:55,168 --> 00:44:57,434
personality that's been discovered. So

988
00:44:57,552 --> 00:44:59,638
above the Big Five, neuroticism,

989
00:44:59,734 --> 00:45:01,930
agreeableness, conscientiousness,

990
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,278
you'll have a metatrate of their shared

991
00:45:04,294 --> 00:45:05,354
various that's observed called

992
00:45:05,392 --> 00:45:07,626
stability. It's also been called alpha

993
00:45:07,658 --> 00:45:11,646
by, I think, Digman. And then above the

994
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,594
traits of extroversion and openness

995
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:15,086
intellect, you have this MetaTrade of

996
00:45:15,108 --> 00:45:20,560
plasticity and are called beta and

997
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,586
the shared variants of these two. So

998
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:25,986
what's interesting is that within this

999
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:29,426
field of within high top, which is this

1000
00:45:29,448 --> 00:45:30,846
effort to try to characterize

1001
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,878
psychopathology using the same kind of

1002
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,994
data driven methods in personality

1003
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:40,054
science. A principled account of the

1004
00:45:40,092 --> 00:45:41,478
structure of psychopathology, the way

1005
00:45:41,484 --> 00:45:43,286
that personality has a structure and

1006
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,034
trying to account for this, there seems

1007
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:48,620
to be a common factor across

1008
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,094
many forms of psychopathology that's

1009
00:45:51,142 --> 00:45:53,238
referred to as the P factor and it tends

1010
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:55,142
to be the inverse of stability. It's

1011
00:45:55,206 --> 00:45:59,230
high neuroticism, low agreeableness and

1012
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,694
low conscientiousness. And this is

1013
00:46:01,732 --> 00:46:05,898
actually what's

1014
00:46:05,914 --> 00:46:09,774
referred to in the article as this P

1015
00:46:09,812 --> 00:46:12,994
factor, thinking of it as a

1016
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:15,538
lack of flexibility. You could make a

1017
00:46:15,544 --> 00:46:17,454
case for it. But more straightforwardly

1018
00:46:17,582 --> 00:46:19,874
it seems to be a lack of stability. For

1019
00:46:19,912 --> 00:46:21,410
something to be a lack of flexibility

1020
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,622
you would maybe be thinking of something

1021
00:46:23,676 --> 00:46:26,422
more like plasticity, like someone

1022
00:46:26,476 --> 00:46:28,754
having low plasticity. But empirically

1023
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:30,566
that's not what's observed. And so if

1024
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,482
empirically that's not what's observed,

1025
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:34,934
that's a very important detail we should

1026
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:37,354
stop and take note of. So you might say

1027
00:46:37,392 --> 00:46:40,202
that rather than emphasizing the first

1028
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:42,022
principal component of psychopathology,

1029
00:46:42,086 --> 00:46:45,194
it's possible that this Canal model is

1030
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:47,550
actually focusing on the second factor.

1031
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,390
It's not a contest. It's still

1032
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,678
enormously a big factor like the work of

1033
00:46:53,684 --> 00:46:55,838
Stephen Hayes and others showing that a

1034
00:46:55,844 --> 00:46:58,202
lack of flexibility is transdiagnostic.

1035
00:46:58,346 --> 00:47:00,914
But just empirically speaking, the first

1036
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:03,230
principal component of psychopathology

1037
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:06,046
might be more closely related to a lack

1038
00:47:06,078 --> 00:47:09,570
of stability rather than insufficient

1039
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,654
plasticity. I guess

1040
00:47:13,692 --> 00:47:15,558
one more thing to think of in terms of

1041
00:47:15,564 --> 00:47:19,618
stability and like as it's

1042
00:47:19,634 --> 00:47:22,694
not exactly a contest, they're both

1043
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:24,402
important, both need to be considered

1044
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,846
and they're deeply interrelated. So

1045
00:47:25,868 --> 00:47:27,994
Colin describes them as being in a state

1046
00:47:28,032 --> 00:47:30,266
of something like dynamic tension. Like

1047
00:47:30,368 --> 00:47:33,866
if you're insufficiently plastic and

1048
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:35,354
inflexible, you're not going to stay

1049
00:47:35,392 --> 00:47:37,306
stable for long in a changing world,

1050
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,238
but if you don't have a stable base to

1051
00:47:39,264 --> 00:47:41,646
move from, it's going to be hard to be

1052
00:47:41,668 --> 00:47:43,358
plastic and reconfigure yourself in a

1053
00:47:43,364 --> 00:47:45,358
sustainable way either. However, you

1054
00:47:45,364 --> 00:47:47,786
could also see someone being overly

1055
00:47:47,818 --> 00:47:49,618
rigid and excessive stability in a way

1056
00:47:49,624 --> 00:47:51,746
that undermines their plasticity or

1057
00:47:51,848 --> 00:47:54,402
overly flexible in a way that basically

1058
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:57,086
is destabilizing. So a dynamic tension

1059
00:47:57,118 --> 00:47:59,698
but involving synergies also.

1060
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:02,386
And I think in terms of the structure of

1061
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:04,598
personality and well being, this is what

1062
00:48:04,604 --> 00:48:06,726
we need to keep in mind that both are

1063
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:08,758
needed, stability and plasticity. And

1064
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:13,538
this is also just within it's

1065
00:48:13,554 --> 00:48:15,238
actually what this was inspired, I think

1066
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:17,466
in Colin's thinking to consider these

1067
00:48:17,488 --> 00:48:19,286
metatrades this way from machine

1068
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:20,326
learning, I think actually reading

1069
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:22,806
Grossberg and Stability plasticity trade

1070
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:24,666
offs and that's why he interpreted these

1071
00:48:24,688 --> 00:48:27,606
metatrades in those terms. So I guess

1072
00:48:27,648 --> 00:48:32,366
one more thing is there

1073
00:48:32,388 --> 00:48:34,606
is a Petersonian backstory here that I

1074
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:36,926
don't know if I want to get into, but we

1075
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:42,930
can discuss it later if there's yeah,

1076
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,210
back to Arthur.

1077
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:52,056
That was great. Thanks. Adams yeah,

1078
00:48:52,158 --> 00:48:53,784
very, very helpful context which should

1079
00:48:53,822 --> 00:48:56,024
hopefully make this slide here much more

1080
00:48:56,062 --> 00:48:57,470
clear to everyone.

1081
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,888
So given these kind of, like, two meta

1082
00:49:02,904 --> 00:49:05,032
traits, stability and plasticity,

1083
00:49:05,096 --> 00:49:07,016
which, as Adam beautifully described

1084
00:49:07,048 --> 00:49:08,716
you're in this kind of dynamic tension

1085
00:49:08,748 --> 00:49:11,936
with one another, we can kind of

1086
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:13,452
go back to these two optimization

1087
00:49:13,516 --> 00:49:15,712
landscapes and these machine learning

1088
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:17,216
concepts that I discussed earlier and

1089
00:49:17,238 --> 00:49:18,756
couldn't try to understand how these

1090
00:49:18,778 --> 00:49:21,904
things might all relate and ultimately

1091
00:49:22,032 --> 00:49:24,676
relate to psychopathology. So I had

1092
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:28,404
hinted before that there were

1093
00:49:28,442 --> 00:49:29,636
these kind of two types of

1094
00:49:29,658 --> 00:49:31,992
cannibalization. We might say one being

1095
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:35,284
overfitting and another being plasticity

1096
00:49:35,332 --> 00:49:37,448
loss. And we can interpret these as kind

1097
00:49:37,454 --> 00:49:40,616
of like being extremes, the kind of like

1098
00:49:40,638 --> 00:49:43,224
canalized end of how these two

1099
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:45,128
optimization landscapes might manifest.

1100
00:49:45,224 --> 00:49:47,064
So in the type A inference landscape,

1101
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:49,628
this looks like overfitting on one end,

1102
00:49:49,794 --> 00:49:52,588
heavy canalization and underfitting on

1103
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:54,172
the other end in the machine learning

1104
00:49:54,226 --> 00:49:57,330
context, right? So overfitting being

1105
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,024
having very strong rigid beliefs that

1106
00:50:01,062 --> 00:50:02,876
are in a particular environmental

1107
00:50:02,908 --> 00:50:05,436
context, adaptive, but are very unlikely

1108
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:07,420
to be adapted in any other context,

1109
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,436
underfitting being having a set of

1110
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:13,508
beliefs which are not adapted to the

1111
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:15,316
current context and also unlikely to be

1112
00:50:15,338 --> 00:50:16,820
adapted to any other context.

1113
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,656
As far as stability is concerned, I

1114
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:22,664
think we can understand stability, this

1115
00:50:22,702 --> 00:50:24,968
MetaTrade, as kind of representing the

1116
00:50:25,054 --> 00:50:27,336
balance of these two things, right? You

1117
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,490
have high stability when you are either

1118
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,576
overfit to a particular context or

1119
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:36,664
underfit. So this means you're well fit

1120
00:50:36,702 --> 00:50:38,296
to this context that you're in now and

1121
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:40,588
you're also likely to be well fit to

1122
00:50:40,594 --> 00:50:43,484
other future contacts. I think this is

1123
00:50:43,522 --> 00:50:45,132
also in complexity science, sometimes

1124
00:50:45,186 --> 00:50:47,724
described as metastability, right? So

1125
00:50:47,762 --> 00:50:49,920
you're at a stable point that will also

1126
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,376
likely be able to take you to other

1127
00:50:51,398 --> 00:50:54,032
stable points in the future. And this

1128
00:50:54,086 --> 00:50:56,192
kind of like ability to stay stable over

1129
00:50:56,246 --> 00:50:59,680
time is then stability MetaTrade.

1130
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,956
We can then look at the type B, the

1131
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:05,636
learning landscape, where the kind of

1132
00:51:05,658 --> 00:51:07,524
extreme version of canalization is this

1133
00:51:07,562 --> 00:51:08,964
plasticity loss where it's very

1134
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:11,060
difficult to adapt to new contexts.

1135
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,636
The inverse of this is then catastrophic

1136
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:17,576
forgetting, where the problem is not one

1137
00:51:17,598 --> 00:51:19,272
of adapting to new contexts, the problem

1138
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,204
is one of meaningfully retaining

1139
00:51:21,332 --> 00:51:23,564
adaptive strategies and beliefs from

1140
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:25,020
previous contexts.

1141
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,356
And so obviously neither of these are

1142
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,220
desirable.

1143
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,996
What is desirable is some kind of

1144
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:36,396
balance between these two or one is able

1145
00:51:36,418 --> 00:51:38,620
to adapt just enough to new context

1146
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,916
without forgetting previously learned

1147
00:51:43,948 --> 00:51:47,456
things. But here the relationship to the

1148
00:51:47,478 --> 00:51:49,024
Mediterranean plasticity is a bit

1149
00:51:49,062 --> 00:51:51,056
different than stability, right? So as

1150
00:51:51,078 --> 00:51:53,956
is being represented on this graph, the

1151
00:51:53,978 --> 00:51:55,716
more plastic you are, basically the less

1152
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,476
canalized you are in the space, the more

1153
00:51:57,498 --> 00:51:59,604
easy it is to move around. But actually

1154
00:51:59,642 --> 00:52:01,128
extreme versions of this end up

1155
00:52:01,134 --> 00:52:03,428
manifesting as catastrophic forgetting,

1156
00:52:03,524 --> 00:52:04,680
at least in the machine learning

1157
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,736
context. And I think this in particular

1158
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,708
has relevance for psychopathology

1159
00:52:12,884 --> 00:52:15,470
and relevance for this idea,

1160
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,092
maybe complicates this idea, right,

1161
00:52:18,146 --> 00:52:23,532
that psychedelic therapy is

1162
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:25,704
in and of itself likely to always lead

1163
00:52:25,762 --> 00:52:27,840
to positive outcomes.

1164
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,020
Okay? And we can attempt to understand

1165
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:38,584
this by making an effort

1166
00:52:38,632 --> 00:52:41,864
at trying to map or understand various

1167
00:52:41,912 --> 00:52:44,088
forms of psychology in the context of

1168
00:52:44,114 --> 00:52:46,000
these two different learning landscapes.

1169
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,064
And so before I get into this too much,

1170
00:52:48,102 --> 00:52:50,784
I think it's important to say that this

1171
00:52:50,822 --> 00:52:52,892
is very much a kind of like preliminary

1172
00:52:52,956 --> 00:52:55,364
and provisional attempt at making sense

1173
00:52:55,402 --> 00:52:58,276
of these things. I hope that this is

1174
00:52:58,298 --> 00:53:01,636
kind of the start of a much more

1175
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:03,716
fleshed out dialogue looking at how we

1176
00:53:03,738 --> 00:53:05,232
can kind of understand psychopathology

1177
00:53:05,296 --> 00:53:06,472
with respect to machine learning

1178
00:53:06,526 --> 00:53:09,160
concepts. But I think this at least

1179
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,960
gives a good starting point for maybe

1180
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,250
trying to understand where and why

1181
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,044
psychedelic therapy is useful, isn't

1182
00:53:17,092 --> 00:53:17,800
useful,

1183
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,484
which is a bit more nuanced than this

1184
00:53:23,522 --> 00:53:25,752
simple idea of like psychopathology

1185
00:53:25,816 --> 00:53:27,736
means cannibalization and psychedelic

1186
00:53:27,768 --> 00:53:29,480
therapy means reducing cannibalization.

1187
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,208
Right? Okay, so let's try to

1188
00:53:33,234 --> 00:53:36,000
make sense of this a little bit. So for

1189
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,888
the kind of classic set of

1190
00:53:37,974 --> 00:53:40,224
psychopathologies for which there has

1191
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:42,064
been a lot of great research done with

1192
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:44,112
psychedelic therapy and a lot of clear

1193
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:47,188
benefit has been seen. I think we can

1194
00:53:47,194 --> 00:53:49,216
kind of class these within this upper

1195
00:53:49,248 --> 00:53:51,604
left hand corner here, where these are

1196
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:54,404
disorders of both overfitting, which

1197
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:56,312
means in the moment overly strong

1198
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,744
beliefs get represented. These are

1199
00:53:58,782 --> 00:54:01,396
strong attractor points in the neural

1200
00:54:01,428 --> 00:54:07,524
activation landscape and plasticity

1201
00:54:07,572 --> 00:54:09,836
loss in the type B landscape. Which

1202
00:54:09,858 --> 00:54:12,252
means that not only is a certain kind of

1203
00:54:12,386 --> 00:54:14,876
dynamics instantiated, which make, for

1204
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,456
example, in the case of major depressive

1205
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:18,252
disorder, extremely negative self

1206
00:54:18,306 --> 00:54:21,136
evaluations very common, but it's the

1207
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:24,832
case that even given the correct changes

1208
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:29,216
in environmental context. Even given in

1209
00:54:29,238 --> 00:54:31,536
the case of psychedelic cystotherapy, a

1210
00:54:31,558 --> 00:54:33,676
lot of the work with major depressive

1211
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,104
disorder is being done with treatment

1212
00:54:35,152 --> 00:54:37,556
resistant depression, right? And what is

1213
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:41,204
treatment resistant depression but a

1214
00:54:41,242 --> 00:54:43,348
kind of a set of beliefs, a set of

1215
00:54:43,354 --> 00:54:45,750
neural activity patterns which are

1216
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,284
resistant to adaptation, to new

1217
00:54:49,322 --> 00:54:51,320
environmental contexts being whatever

1218
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,236
sort of psychotherapy or previous drug

1219
00:54:53,268 --> 00:54:56,436
was used. So this is high plasticity

1220
00:54:56,468 --> 00:55:01,384
loss, high overhead and rate and

1221
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:03,932
these are kind of fortunately for

1222
00:55:03,986 --> 00:55:05,484
psychedelic therapy and I think maybe

1223
00:55:05,522 --> 00:55:07,404
for psychiatry in general, these are all

1224
00:55:07,442 --> 00:55:10,008
very common and very, very costly

1225
00:55:10,184 --> 00:55:12,168
psychopathologies. Right? So if it is

1226
00:55:12,194 --> 00:55:13,648
the case that psychedelic therapy can

1227
00:55:13,654 --> 00:55:15,196
treat these effectively, that's

1228
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:18,896
fantastic. But I think we can maybe look

1229
00:55:18,918 --> 00:55:21,296
at a more complicated if we start to

1230
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,824
expand to other psychopathologies, the

1231
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,996
story becomes a little bit more

1232
00:55:25,018 --> 00:55:27,956
complicated. Right? So we can look at

1233
00:55:27,978 --> 00:55:29,844
the bottom left hand corner here where

1234
00:55:29,882 --> 00:55:32,176
we have cases of in the inference

1235
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:36,312
landscape still overfitting, but in

1236
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,992
the learning landscape something else

1237
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,276
happening, form of kind of catastrophic

1238
00:55:40,308 --> 00:55:43,050
forgetting or a form of kind of drift of

1239
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,716
the belief landscape that's being

1240
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:50,604
instantiated here. Right? So I think two

1241
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:53,980
kind of representative pathologies here

1242
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,556
typically referred to as some form of

1243
00:55:56,578 --> 00:55:58,748
bipolar disorder or some form of

1244
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:01,308
borderline personality disorder. So in

1245
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:02,816
both of these cases, in the moment to

1246
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:06,348
moment neural activity as it unfolds,

1247
00:56:06,444 --> 00:56:08,396
there are very strong sets of beliefs

1248
00:56:08,428 --> 00:56:10,336
being instantiated at any given time and

1249
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:11,552
these are very difficult to change.

1250
00:56:11,606 --> 00:56:15,736
Right? But the key differentiating

1251
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:18,212
point here being that over longer

1252
00:56:18,266 --> 00:56:20,084
timescales, over the timescales of days

1253
00:56:20,122 --> 00:56:22,836
or weeks, the kinds of beliefs that are

1254
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:24,484
instantiated change quite a lot. Right?

1255
00:56:24,522 --> 00:56:26,468
So someone who's bipolar, if they're in

1256
00:56:26,474 --> 00:56:28,036
a manic episode or in a depressive

1257
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:30,436
episode, the nature of the belief

1258
00:56:30,468 --> 00:56:32,104
landscape being instantiated is very

1259
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:34,484
different for borderline individuals

1260
00:56:34,532 --> 00:56:37,524
from a daily or weekly basis, the nature

1261
00:56:37,572 --> 00:56:39,596
of one's beliefs about the people that

1262
00:56:39,618 --> 00:56:41,612
are close to them can change very

1263
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:44,412
rapidly, very extremely in certain

1264
00:56:44,466 --> 00:56:48,430
cases. And so here the

1265
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,024
benefit of psychedelic therapy is a bit

1266
00:56:53,062 --> 00:56:56,336
more mixed where there is likely the

1267
00:56:56,358 --> 00:56:59,250
case that to the extent to which the

1268
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,896
kind of overt type A beliefs can be

1269
00:57:02,918 --> 00:57:04,896
updated and changed to be more positive,

1270
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:07,376
be hopefully more relaxed, that's

1271
00:57:07,408 --> 00:57:09,652
positive. But to the extent to which

1272
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:11,956
plasticity may be being increased when

1273
00:57:11,978 --> 00:57:14,736
it's not actually needed, when there's

1274
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:16,816
not actually meaningful therapeutic

1275
00:57:16,848 --> 00:57:19,016
benefits of that, it's a bit

1276
00:57:19,038 --> 00:57:21,530
questionable. I think there's clear

1277
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,488
borderline, or rather bipolar for

1278
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:26,856
example, is often individuals with

1279
00:57:26,878 --> 00:57:29,228
bipolar are often excluded from

1280
00:57:29,314 --> 00:57:33,052
psychedelic trials under

1281
00:57:33,106 --> 00:57:34,924
the assumption for example, that

1282
00:57:34,962 --> 00:57:37,016
psychedelics may trigger a manic episode

1283
00:57:37,048 --> 00:57:39,596
or may trigger psychosis. And I think

1284
00:57:39,618 --> 00:57:42,400
that is a valid concern.

1285
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,944
So on kind of that topic then, this

1286
00:57:46,982 --> 00:57:49,084
bottom right hand corner would be cases

1287
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,116
of both underfooting and catastrophic

1288
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:52,856
forgetting with I think schizophrenia

1289
00:57:52,908 --> 00:57:54,212
being kind of like the most clear

1290
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:55,670
manifestation of this.

1291
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,916
And here there's very little work

1292
00:58:01,018 --> 00:58:03,030
currently looking at trying to treat

1293
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,356
schizophrenia with psychedelic therapy.

1294
00:58:06,388 --> 00:58:11,672
I think for pretty good reasons though

1295
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:14,856
I would say to the

1296
00:58:14,878 --> 00:58:16,600
extent to which there are secondary

1297
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:20,044
manifestations, secondary issues like

1298
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:21,516
depression, anxiety that people with

1299
00:58:21,538 --> 00:58:23,372
schizophrenia might have, these actually

1300
00:58:23,426 --> 00:58:26,956
may be treatable with some form of

1301
00:58:26,978 --> 00:58:30,392
psychedelic therapy. And then lastly,

1302
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:33,856
this upper right hand corner here would

1303
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:36,384
correspond to underfitting in the type A

1304
00:58:36,422 --> 00:58:38,604
landscape along with plasticity loss.

1305
00:58:38,652 --> 00:58:40,784
So I think a good example of this is

1306
00:58:40,822 --> 00:58:44,820
something like ADHD, where there are not

1307
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:47,556
very particularly strong beliefs that

1308
00:58:47,578 --> 00:58:48,964
are being instantiated at any given

1309
00:58:49,002 --> 00:58:52,384
time, but it's

1310
00:58:52,432 --> 00:58:53,828
difficult to change these set of

1311
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:57,272
beliefs. Nonetheless, I think here

1312
00:58:57,406 --> 00:59:00,964
there's a case where it's not totally

1313
00:59:01,012 --> 00:59:03,224
clear how the benefit will actually play

1314
00:59:03,262 --> 00:59:07,304
out in both of these cases. I've heard

1315
00:59:07,342 --> 00:59:09,464
interesting work around like microdosing

1316
00:59:09,592 --> 00:59:11,310
may be of interest.

1317
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,876
I think yeah, more research has to be

1318
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:18,636
done to be seen. Right, and then what

1319
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:19,964
would microdosing be doing? Right,

1320
00:59:20,002 --> 00:59:22,576
microdosing would be very slowly kind of

1321
00:59:22,598 --> 00:59:25,728
like decreasing plasticity loss just a

1322
00:59:25,734 --> 00:59:29,020
little bit, potentially also decreasing

1323
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,096
underfitting, as Adam has kind of

1324
00:59:32,118 --> 00:59:33,830
suggested in the Albus model.

1325
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:41,058
And here we have just kind of like a

1326
00:59:41,064 --> 00:59:42,274
brief overview of more or less

1327
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,986
everything I've described about how

1328
00:59:44,008 --> 00:59:47,266
these two landscapes are different. I

1329
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:48,934
think most of these things I've said

1330
00:59:48,972 --> 00:59:51,030
before pretty clearly right so the type

1331
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,346
A landscape corresponds

1332
00:59:55,378 --> 00:59:56,998
to the neural activity pattern. This is

1333
00:59:57,004 --> 00:59:58,562
the hidden state of the RNN.

1334
00:59:58,706 --> 01:00:00,266
Overcannilization is going to be

1335
01:00:00,288 --> 01:00:02,234
stereotyped mental circuits, very

1336
01:00:02,272 --> 01:00:04,074
strongly held beliefs. Under

1337
01:00:04,112 --> 01:00:05,914
canalization is going to be these

1338
01:00:05,952 --> 01:00:08,170
inconsistently deployed circuits.

1339
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:12,158
It looks like overfitting in the

1340
01:00:12,164 --> 01:00:13,946
canalized case, underfitting in the non

1341
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:16,606
canalized case going to correspond to

1342
01:00:16,628 --> 01:00:19,562
stability, the metatrate. I hadn't

1343
01:00:19,626 --> 01:00:22,206
discussed this before, but I think

1344
01:00:22,228 --> 01:00:23,674
there's a relationship between cognitive

1345
01:00:23,722 --> 01:00:26,050
flexibility and this inference landscape

1346
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,494
psychedelics are mainly going to affect

1347
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:32,820
the work at the acute level care.

1348
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,106
And this is by directly exciting the

1349
01:00:35,128 --> 01:00:37,294
neurons or inducing forms of hadavian

1350
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,858
plasticity and the outcome is going to

1351
01:00:39,864 --> 01:00:41,494
be a mixture of relaxation and

1352
01:00:41,532 --> 01:00:43,026
strengthening of the kind that Adam

1353
01:00:43,058 --> 01:00:45,766
described in the Albus case. The type B

1354
01:00:45,788 --> 01:00:47,158
landscape then is working on the

1355
01:00:47,164 --> 01:00:49,046
synaptic weights and these are the

1356
01:00:49,068 --> 01:00:51,366
actual network parameters in our RNN

1357
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,394
model. Over canalization is this

1358
01:00:54,432 --> 01:00:57,500
inability to learn or adapt over time.

1359
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,986
Under canalization is the inability to

1360
01:01:01,008 --> 01:01:02,814
retain information right? And those

1361
01:01:02,852 --> 01:01:04,366
correspond to plasticity loss and

1362
01:01:04,388 --> 01:01:07,934
catastrophic forgetting. This also is

1363
01:01:07,972 --> 01:01:09,994
kind of the traditional plasticity

1364
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:14,080
metatrate, which I think corresponds to

1365
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:17,694
this longer term constructed

1366
01:01:17,742 --> 01:01:21,086
psychological flexibility. The effects

1367
01:01:21,118 --> 01:01:22,962
are going to mainly be mediated post

1368
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:25,346
acutely with psychedelics and these are

1369
01:01:25,368 --> 01:01:27,614
the more downstream metaplastic effects,

1370
01:01:27,742 --> 01:01:29,990
the psychoplastogenic effects.

1371
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:34,054
And I think on the whole the effect here

1372
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:36,150
is a relaxation of canalization.

1373
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,638
And yeah, these are just the references.

1374
01:01:41,734 --> 01:01:43,798
So those are the slides I have that's

1375
01:01:43,814 --> 01:01:45,702
kind of the overview of the Deep canals

1376
01:01:45,766 --> 01:01:49,274
model, I think. Now I'll turn

1377
01:01:49,312 --> 01:01:52,782
it over to Mike who's going to share

1378
01:01:52,836 --> 01:01:55,166
some thoughts both about this work and

1379
01:01:55,188 --> 01:01:57,280
some of his own work and kind of this

1380
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:00,234
approach to understanding psychedelics

1381
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:01,230
more broadly.

1382
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:09,714
Ah, great. Yeah, thank you for that

1383
01:02:09,752 --> 01:02:11,060
overview. That was great.

1384
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:17,862
So I guess I'm just in general very

1385
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:20,966
optimistic about this corner of

1386
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:24,134
neuroscience, that there are these very

1387
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:26,806
intuitive models that are very sort of

1388
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:30,058
clinically significant and I

1389
01:02:30,064 --> 01:02:33,818
also think there is a lot

1390
01:02:33,824 --> 01:02:35,514
of responsibility to sort of get things

1391
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:38,890
right here as well. As Adam noted.

1392
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:46,446
I have just a few comments and for

1393
01:02:46,468 --> 01:02:50,522
the viewers, I'm not speaking for Arthur

1394
01:02:50,586 --> 01:02:53,614
and Adam, I'm just grateful for the

1395
01:02:53,652 --> 01:02:55,330
invitation to join the discussion.

1396
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,498
So I wanted to note quickly

1397
01:03:00,664 --> 01:03:05,954
three research themes dealing with the

1398
01:03:05,992 --> 01:03:08,440
implementation of this class of model.

1399
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:13,126
So just broadly kind of pointing at both

1400
01:03:13,228 --> 01:03:17,750
Deep Canals and Andrebus and Albus.

1401
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:23,094
So in 2019

1402
01:03:23,142 --> 01:03:26,554
I wrote Neural Annealing and that was

1403
01:03:26,592 --> 01:03:28,998
sort of developing the canalization

1404
01:03:29,094 --> 01:03:31,450
frame within the context of energy

1405
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,920
buildup in the eigen modes of a system.

1406
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:39,594
So you have the nice annealing

1407
01:03:39,642 --> 01:03:41,274
metaphor, you have a temperature

1408
01:03:41,322 --> 01:03:43,710
parameter and entropic disintegration.

1409
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:49,106
Robin Carter said a beautiful paper on

1410
01:03:49,128 --> 01:03:52,610
that dantropic brain

1411
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,498
and then you sort of have

1412
01:03:56,584 --> 01:04:01,206
a post heating result where

1413
01:04:01,388 --> 01:04:04,854
the microstructure of your system is

1414
01:04:04,892 --> 01:04:08,854
sort of a result of how

1415
01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:12,426
hot and how long the heating was.

1416
01:04:12,528 --> 01:04:16,214
So it's an alternative take on belief

1417
01:04:16,262 --> 01:04:19,914
relaxation. And I do think that there

1418
01:04:19,952 --> 01:04:22,086
are some pluses in terms of sort of

1419
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:23,706
explicitly making the annealing

1420
01:04:23,738 --> 01:04:30,126
metaphor. And I

1421
01:04:30,148 --> 01:04:32,414
think that two things that I'd point

1422
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,154
out. One, top down models or top down

1423
01:04:35,192 --> 01:04:39,362
predictive models as energy sinks and

1424
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:41,890
eigen modes as the places where energy

1425
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,114
can build up or almost sort of hide from

1426
01:04:44,152 --> 01:04:47,622
top down models. So you get

1427
01:04:47,756 --> 01:04:50,594
this phenomenon of semantically neutral

1428
01:04:50,642 --> 01:04:53,110
energy or semantically illegible energy

1429
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,678
we can say, which is sort of

1430
01:04:56,844 --> 01:05:00,482
kind of how perhaps

1431
01:05:00,626 --> 01:05:03,014
psychedelics music and meditation all

1432
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:05,946
sort of allow energy building. The

1433
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:07,578
energy that they contribute to the

1434
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:10,010
system can evade the top tone models.

1435
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:14,558
And yeah, just to note, one item that

1436
01:05:14,564 --> 01:05:18,266
I'm looking at now is what is Deep

1437
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:20,666
Canals? Has the inference landscape

1438
01:05:20,698 --> 01:05:22,590
versus learning landscape distinction?

1439
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:26,434
And how would one sort of build

1440
01:05:26,472 --> 01:05:28,046
that distinction within the neural

1441
01:05:28,078 --> 01:05:31,778
Annealing framework? And guess one

1442
01:05:31,864 --> 01:05:34,546
metaphor that I'm considering is the

1443
01:05:34,568 --> 01:05:37,766
self as sort of a magnet to sort

1444
01:05:37,788 --> 01:05:41,126
of apply a

1445
01:05:41,148 --> 01:05:43,874
constraint, a uniform focusing

1446
01:05:43,922 --> 01:05:45,938
constraint on the system as it's

1447
01:05:45,954 --> 01:05:49,974
cooling. The second item

1448
01:05:50,022 --> 01:05:52,874
that I wanted to mention, so I have this

1449
01:05:52,912 --> 01:05:54,986
piece, autism as a disorder of

1450
01:05:55,008 --> 01:05:58,426
dimensionality. And this brings in

1451
01:05:58,448 --> 01:06:02,462
the concept of network density that it

1452
01:06:02,516 --> 01:06:05,998
may very well be that people on the

1453
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:08,366
spectrum have literally more neurons and

1454
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:12,480
or more synapses. And there's this great

1455
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,646
Michelangelo quote, I saw the angel in

1456
01:06:15,668 --> 01:06:17,460
the stone, and I set him free.

1457
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:20,946
And sort of the thicker networks you

1458
01:06:20,968 --> 01:06:22,834
have, the more stone you have to work

1459
01:06:22,872 --> 01:06:25,234
with, but you actually have to do the

1460
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:29,426
work. So you

1461
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:32,680
sort of have to do sort of well,

1462
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:35,446
normally you sort of inherit these

1463
01:06:35,548 --> 01:06:38,482
highly pretrained optimized circuits,

1464
01:06:38,546 --> 01:06:40,730
almost like asics application specific

1465
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,090
integrated circuit.

1466
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:47,674
And then this is kind of more an

1467
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,274
untrained network, and you have to train

1468
01:06:49,312 --> 01:06:53,114
it yourself. And within the Deep Canals

1469
01:06:53,162 --> 01:06:55,246
framework, this would show up as both

1470
01:06:55,348 --> 01:06:58,654
underfitting and higher capacity for

1471
01:06:58,692 --> 01:06:59,710
plasticity.

1472
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:05,746
So I think that's going to be an

1473
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:07,620
interesting thread to pull.

1474
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:12,594
Finally. So I just posted that last

1475
01:07:12,632 --> 01:07:16,562
week, principles of Vaso Computation and

1476
01:07:16,696 --> 01:07:19,814
as an implementation level account of

1477
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:22,966
active inference. And this is a big

1478
01:07:22,988 --> 01:07:25,542
rabbit hole. I don't think we have time

1479
01:07:25,596 --> 01:07:29,126
to go down it today. But I

1480
01:07:29,148 --> 01:07:31,754
just comment that I really like the way

1481
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:35,146
Deep Canals explicitly splits out the

1482
01:07:35,168 --> 01:07:36,806
learning landscape and the inference

1483
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:39,834
landscape, that I think that making this

1484
01:07:39,872 --> 01:07:42,366
distinction is increasingly going to

1485
01:07:42,388 --> 01:07:43,120
make sense.

1486
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,680
Back to Arthur. Yeah, awesome.

1487
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,344
Well, thank you all for the

1488
01:07:55,382 --> 01:07:57,584
presentations. Arthur and Adam, feel

1489
01:07:57,622 --> 01:07:59,796
free to pick up where Michael left off,

1490
01:07:59,818 --> 01:08:01,364
or I can bring in some questions from

1491
01:08:01,402 --> 01:08:03,350
the chat or from what I've written down.

1492
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:26,176
Just a quick comment. I do think that in

1493
01:08:26,198 --> 01:08:27,968
the Deep Canals framework, it's going to

1494
01:08:27,974 --> 01:08:29,890
be interesting to sort of look into

1495
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:35,830
metabolic demands, and sort of different

1496
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,364
metabolic disorders are pretty hot in

1497
01:08:43,402 --> 01:08:46,232
brain science right now. And I do think

1498
01:08:46,286 --> 01:08:48,792
that it'll be interesting to look at

1499
01:08:48,846 --> 01:08:52,376
sort of what the metabolic profile is in

1500
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:54,328
terms of each of the four items in the

1501
01:08:54,334 --> 01:08:57,644
quadrant, if one

1502
01:08:57,682 --> 01:08:59,692
quadrant or another quadrant is

1503
01:08:59,826 --> 01:09:03,884
particularly associated with more

1504
01:09:03,922 --> 01:09:05,710
metabolic demands in the system.

1505
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:11,020
Arthur yeah.

1506
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:16,026
No, that's fascinating. I'd love

1507
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:17,354
to kind of hear a little bit more about

1508
01:09:17,392 --> 01:09:19,690
this comment you made about the salt as

1509
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,834
a magnet that's applying these

1510
01:09:21,872 --> 01:09:25,294
constraints. Oh,

1511
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:31,982
yeah. So there's the,

1512
01:09:32,116 --> 01:09:34,814
like, psychedelics the the effects are

1513
01:09:34,852 --> 01:09:38,914
not or sort of the you

1514
01:09:38,952 --> 01:09:41,250
sort of get pulled back into position

1515
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,020
after after some time.

1516
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:49,718
And I

1517
01:09:49,724 --> 01:09:53,366
can't say that this is a full theory at

1518
01:09:53,388 --> 01:09:57,234
this point, but in the neuroscience

1519
01:09:57,282 --> 01:10:00,682
notation 2018, I talked

1520
01:10:00,736 --> 01:10:04,026
about the self as kind

1521
01:10:04,048 --> 01:10:07,162
of the god of the gaps in terms of

1522
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:08,970
aligning different scales.

1523
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:13,786
You have circuits which kind of pull in

1524
01:10:13,808 --> 01:10:14,778
different ways and you have the

1525
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:16,678
mesoscale systems which pull in

1526
01:10:16,704 --> 01:10:19,002
different ways and you have the overall

1527
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:21,038
brain wide systems that pull in

1528
01:10:21,044 --> 01:10:22,830
different ways. And kind of the self is

1529
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,574
sort of the thing that tries to make

1530
01:10:24,612 --> 01:10:25,940
everything work together.

1531
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:32,354
And an alternate frame would

1532
01:10:32,392 --> 01:10:35,506
be sort of this alpha is just kind

1533
01:10:35,528 --> 01:10:38,802
of this slow gravity toward

1534
01:10:38,866 --> 01:10:39,910
disalignment.

1535
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:46,546
Yeah, I don't have anything particularly

1536
01:10:46,658 --> 01:10:47,720
more to share.

1537
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:51,366
Yeah, that makes sense. It's

1538
01:10:51,398 --> 01:10:54,342
interesting. Well to combine the heating

1539
01:10:54,406 --> 01:10:58,294
up and the magnetism, different metals

1540
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:00,586
and connections there to alchemy and

1541
01:11:00,608 --> 01:11:02,662
everything different metals when heated

1542
01:11:02,726 --> 01:11:05,130
up and cooled down in specific ways

1543
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,686
change their magnetic profile. So of

1544
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:10,366
course this is all just concordances but

1545
01:11:10,388 --> 01:11:12,510
they're very interesting. And then also

1546
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:16,034
to the metabolic angle that

1547
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:19,534
reminded me of the trilogy by Dale

1548
01:11:19,582 --> 01:11:23,186
Pendel with Pharmaconosis and

1549
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:25,646
the other two books where treated

1550
01:11:25,678 --> 01:11:28,806
alongside traditional psychoactives we

1551
01:11:28,828 --> 01:11:31,286
could say like caffeine and nicotine and

1552
01:11:31,308 --> 01:11:33,142
some of the other substances that were

1553
01:11:33,196 --> 01:11:36,326
mentioned here. Also there's tea,

1554
01:11:36,508 --> 01:11:39,480
sugar and these are treated as

1555
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:43,820
psychedelic or at least as in the same

1556
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:48,938
pantheon of neurocognitive modifying in

1557
01:11:48,944 --> 01:11:51,466
the sense that the destinies of

1558
01:11:51,488 --> 01:11:55,978
individuals and of empires ride

1559
01:11:56,074 --> 01:12:00,000
on the sense making and decision making

1560
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:03,360
influence of sugar, for example.

1561
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,126
So it definitely broadens our

1562
01:12:06,148 --> 01:12:08,882
perspective to include the so called

1563
01:12:08,936 --> 01:12:13,550
classical molecules like LSD.

1564
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:15,426
But also maybe we could think more

1565
01:12:15,448 --> 01:12:18,054
broadly about antioxidants or about

1566
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:19,702
different lipids or about different

1567
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:24,230
metabolic connections.

1568
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,686
Michael Pollan's recent book this is

1569
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:30,858
Your Mind on plants I think it kind of

1570
01:12:30,864 --> 01:12:32,874
has that what you're saying in mind

1571
01:12:32,912 --> 01:12:36,186
because it includes caffeine, not

1572
01:12:36,288 --> 01:12:37,914
introduces a psychedelic but just

1573
01:12:37,952 --> 01:12:41,018
discussed among also psychedelics. I

1574
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,114
think I remember he focuses on masculine

1575
01:12:43,162 --> 01:12:46,382
but it is a different

1576
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:48,874
way of being in the world, potentially

1577
01:12:48,922 --> 01:12:51,166
radically different like if caffeine is

1578
01:12:51,188 --> 01:12:54,686
in your life or it is not, it's a

1579
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:58,418
different life world. And different

1580
01:12:58,504 --> 01:13:01,970
extended niche. I'll go to

1581
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,466
a question in the live chat so anyone

1582
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:07,810
can give a thought. So Matt asks

1583
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:11,094
is there any way how to approach the

1584
01:13:11,132 --> 01:13:14,246
individual reactions to psychedelics in

1585
01:13:14,268 --> 01:13:16,646
terms of positive or negative results of

1586
01:13:16,668 --> 01:13:19,426
treatment using the ideas of deep

1587
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,974
canals? So how can we approach

1588
01:13:22,102 --> 01:13:24,618
predictions and explanations at the

1589
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:27,834
individual scale with

1590
01:13:27,872 --> 01:13:29,420
what you're sharing today?

1591
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:41,556
One thing for this

1592
01:13:41,578 --> 01:13:43,844
is kind of like a meta comment, but if

1593
01:13:43,882 --> 01:13:49,360
we're actually going to do computational

1594
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,270
psychiatry and we actually are going to

1595
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,680
and precision medicine so the goal being

1596
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,290
to create models of sufficient detail

1597
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,496
that they could actually guide our

1598
01:14:01,518 --> 01:14:02,988
practice and guide our practice in a way

1599
01:14:02,994 --> 01:14:05,036
where we know for an individual what

1600
01:14:05,058 --> 01:14:06,632
they might need in any given context.

1601
01:14:06,696 --> 01:14:08,924
So precision medicine with respect to

1602
01:14:08,962 --> 01:14:12,172
standard antidepressants people,

1603
01:14:12,226 --> 01:14:13,484
sometimes they'll go for a long time

1604
01:14:13,522 --> 01:14:14,796
before they find ones that work, and

1605
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:16,028
sometimes things are made worse, and

1606
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,124
then they might deal with antidepressant

1607
01:14:18,172 --> 01:14:19,536
withdrawal if they're looking for the

1608
01:14:19,558 --> 01:14:21,408
right one, and if they're in a state of

1609
01:14:21,414 --> 01:14:24,592
acute distress, that could be a hard

1610
01:14:24,646 --> 01:14:28,196
lot. And so if you can help to speed up

1611
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:31,572
that process of finding what works and

1612
01:14:31,626 --> 01:14:34,500
what might hurt also to avoid that, the

1613
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,804
ability to help people is immense. And

1614
01:14:36,842 --> 01:14:40,568
so for that so the

1615
01:14:40,574 --> 01:14:43,108
meta comment is I have to just say I'm

1616
01:14:43,124 --> 01:14:45,444
not convinced that an act of inference.

1617
01:14:45,572 --> 01:14:48,664
We're doing the job. I think we're not

1618
01:14:48,702 --> 01:14:50,696
acknowledging our uncertainty and I

1619
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:53,224
think the models are under specified

1620
01:14:53,352 --> 01:14:56,076
with respect to the complexity of the

1621
01:14:56,098 --> 01:14:57,372
effects we would expect on different

1622
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,740
scales and in characterizing the systems

1623
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,964
and we need to be more patient and

1624
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:05,196
modest. But what we don't know before we

1625
01:15:05,218 --> 01:15:07,676
go on rushing in headlong into telling

1626
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,824
the rest of psychiatry how they should

1627
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:12,256
comport themselves and what models they

1628
01:15:12,278 --> 01:15:14,844
should use based on psychedelic science.

1629
01:15:14,892 --> 01:15:18,284
And plausible models, hopeful models,

1630
01:15:18,412 --> 01:15:21,268
but very early days. And with the

1631
01:15:21,274 --> 01:15:23,136
reality being complex in the ways we're

1632
01:15:23,168 --> 01:15:25,364
seeing here, this was not an easy set of

1633
01:15:25,402 --> 01:15:27,588
lectures or a set of talks like what we

1634
01:15:27,594 --> 01:15:30,608
were going through. And, yeah, if we're

1635
01:15:30,624 --> 01:15:31,764
actually going to be able to handle

1636
01:15:31,812 --> 01:15:33,764
these powerful medicines responsibly,

1637
01:15:33,892 --> 01:15:36,616
we got to go into the weeds. The one

1638
01:15:36,638 --> 01:15:38,680
more meta comment was like I think I saw

1639
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,280
someone say how can something like help

1640
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:43,096
everything? I don't know if this is

1641
01:15:43,118 --> 01:15:44,264
right but it's almost like a violation

1642
01:15:44,312 --> 01:15:45,804
of no free lunch theorems or something.

1643
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:48,030
It's like how could something just be

1644
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,572
good across the board without something

1645
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:51,932
is off? You've calculated wrong

1646
01:15:51,986 --> 01:15:54,620
somewhere you had to pay the price

1647
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,428
either in some trade off that wasn't

1648
01:15:56,444 --> 01:15:59,376
acknowledged. But that being said there

1649
01:15:59,398 --> 01:16:01,504
are some things which are generally good

1650
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:03,664
for a lot of things like being more

1651
01:16:03,702 --> 01:16:04,480
flexible.

1652
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,900
If you can get something like

1653
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:12,708
metastability I

1654
01:16:12,714 --> 01:16:15,476
think I'm a church member of the I'm a

1655
01:16:15,578 --> 01:16:16,708
faithful member of the church of

1656
01:16:16,714 --> 01:16:19,396
criticality. I think Mark Miller might

1657
01:16:19,418 --> 01:16:22,432
have indoctrinated me with optimal grips

1658
01:16:22,576 --> 01:16:24,408
but basically like the ability to have

1659
01:16:24,494 --> 01:16:26,376
an optimal grip on existence in your

1660
01:16:26,398 --> 01:16:28,776
soul, not too tight, not too loose and

1661
01:16:28,798 --> 01:16:30,776
being able to move around and be

1662
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:33,516
flexible in itinerants. Something kind

1663
01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:35,484
of like mindfulness is just like

1664
01:16:35,522 --> 01:16:37,596
sriracha for the soul. It's good for

1665
01:16:37,618 --> 01:16:39,804
everything almost you just put on this,

1666
01:16:39,842 --> 01:16:41,950
put it on, that makes it better.

1667
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,336
I buy that there might be some things

1668
01:16:44,358 --> 01:16:46,496
that are good across the board but I

1669
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:48,924
wouldn't call though psychedelics

1670
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:51,856
necessarily putting you in this state of

1671
01:16:51,878 --> 01:16:53,856
optimal criticality or anything in

1672
01:16:53,878 --> 01:16:55,724
general. The rhetoric I'm uncomfortable

1673
01:16:55,772 --> 01:16:58,516
with of saying psychedelics do X. I

1674
01:16:58,538 --> 01:17:01,248
would prefer to say which psychedelic.

1675
01:17:01,344 --> 01:17:03,236
Psychedelics tend to do x but just a

1676
01:17:03,258 --> 01:17:05,776
little more qualifier like not weasel

1677
01:17:05,808 --> 01:17:06,916
words but just like a little bit more

1678
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:10,896
like this psychedelic

1679
01:17:10,928 --> 01:17:13,236
might do x in this context with this

1680
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:15,096
dose in this sentence setting but that

1681
01:17:15,118 --> 01:17:17,256
being said there do also though seem to

1682
01:17:17,278 --> 01:17:20,320
be across. The board, broad,

1683
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,984
sweeping, not super, but overarching

1684
01:17:23,032 --> 01:17:25,864
statements that we can make that express

1685
01:17:25,912 --> 01:17:28,668
a lot with a little. And so I don't want

1686
01:17:28,674 --> 01:17:33,196
to be so much of a splitter and a

1687
01:17:33,218 --> 01:17:34,616
prickly person finding all the details

1688
01:17:34,648 --> 01:17:36,656
that these powerful things we can

1689
01:17:36,678 --> 01:17:39,536
basically give to people to guide our

1690
01:17:39,558 --> 01:17:41,248
research. I don't want to leave that on

1691
01:17:41,254 --> 01:17:44,608
table either. I guess that's a

1692
01:17:44,614 --> 01:17:46,096
bunch of meta level commentary that did

1693
01:17:46,118 --> 01:17:47,330
not address the thing.

1694
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,076
I think that's useful. That's very

1695
01:17:51,098 --> 01:17:52,356
helpful. I think to have all that

1696
01:17:52,378 --> 01:17:55,652
context. With respect to the question

1697
01:17:55,706 --> 01:17:58,724
itself, I would maybe offer this, which

1698
01:17:58,762 --> 01:18:01,450
might be helpful, which know, I think

1699
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,912
you mentioned it, Adam, and it's very

1700
01:18:03,966 --> 01:18:05,336
frequently mentioned this idea of set

1701
01:18:05,358 --> 01:18:07,124
and setting, right. As being heavily

1702
01:18:07,172 --> 01:18:09,860
predictive of the quality of the acute

1703
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,600
psychedelic experience, and often also,

1704
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:14,196
to some extent, the quality of the post

1705
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:17,292
acute experience. And I think we can

1706
01:18:17,346 --> 01:18:19,224
understand this in the deep canals

1707
01:18:19,272 --> 01:18:21,580
model, quite straightforwardly.

1708
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,976
So I'll just quickly pull back up one

1709
01:18:26,998 --> 01:18:30,720
of these slides here. Yeah.

1710
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:34,220
Right. So what is set and setting?

1711
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:37,844
So set is mindset, which would

1712
01:18:37,882 --> 01:18:41,156
basically be some combination of your

1713
01:18:41,178 --> 01:18:42,576
current position in the synaptic weight

1714
01:18:42,608 --> 01:18:44,596
landscape and the current state of your

1715
01:18:44,618 --> 01:18:46,036
neural activation landscape. Right. So

1716
01:18:46,058 --> 01:18:48,872
your place in both landscapes is your

1717
01:18:48,926 --> 01:18:53,290
mindset, and the setting is

1718
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,704
what is generating this input. Right.

1719
01:18:55,742 --> 01:18:57,336
What is generating the x into the

1720
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:00,452
network. And that's some complicated

1721
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:04,236
function of the environment. And then we

1722
01:19:04,258 --> 01:19:07,432
can understand the evolution of movement

1723
01:19:07,496 --> 01:19:09,452
through the inference landscape during

1724
01:19:09,506 --> 01:19:11,692
the acute effects of the drug as then

1725
01:19:11,746 --> 01:19:13,116
kind of like very directly and

1726
01:19:13,138 --> 01:19:14,608
straightforwardly being a function of

1727
01:19:14,614 --> 01:19:17,632
these two things. Right. Because both of

1728
01:19:17,766 --> 01:19:19,916
these things are basically what's

1729
01:19:19,948 --> 01:19:21,884
affecting how this landscape evolves

1730
01:19:21,932 --> 01:19:23,488
over time and how you move through the

1731
01:19:23,494 --> 01:19:27,388
landscape. And so with

1732
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:28,916
this in mind, I guess we can then start

1733
01:19:28,938 --> 01:19:31,300
to characterize and think about, okay,

1734
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:34,916
well, what kinds of we

1735
01:19:34,938 --> 01:19:36,004
can maybe be a little bit more

1736
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:39,716
mechanistic about how does input

1737
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,812
from the environment, the setting,

1738
01:19:41,876 --> 01:19:45,288
actually, given that we relatively fix

1739
01:19:45,374 --> 01:19:47,556
the actual synaptic weight landscape,

1740
01:19:47,588 --> 01:19:49,704
how is that changing the dynamics over

1741
01:19:49,742 --> 01:19:51,564
time or the other way around? Right?

1742
01:19:51,602 --> 01:19:54,888
Like, how is fixing the input,

1743
01:19:55,064 --> 01:19:56,968
the environmental context relatively

1744
01:19:56,984 --> 01:20:00,364
stable and looking at individuals who

1745
01:20:00,402 --> 01:20:01,916
are at different fixed points, at

1746
01:20:01,938 --> 01:20:04,256
different points of time, going to

1747
01:20:04,278 --> 01:20:07,440
change the dynamics of the event?

1748
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:10,576
Right. And I think given that this is a

1749
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:13,024
highly stochastic process, given that

1750
01:20:13,062 --> 01:20:15,552
these dynamics of albus are at play

1751
01:20:15,606 --> 01:20:17,636
right. Where certain beliefs are being

1752
01:20:17,658 --> 01:20:18,884
strengthened, other beliefs are being

1753
01:20:18,922 --> 01:20:22,564
relaxed, I think

1754
01:20:22,602 --> 01:20:24,340
at least having this hold on, okay,

1755
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:26,244
well, set and setting is really

1756
01:20:26,282 --> 01:20:28,020
important. And it's important because

1757
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:30,564
these are explicitly conditioning the

1758
01:20:30,602 --> 01:20:34,256
way in which both the landscape,

1759
01:20:34,368 --> 01:20:37,560
the inference landscape is shaped and

1760
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,716
how you move around it and how it's

1761
01:20:39,748 --> 01:20:42,140
being dynamically perturbed.

1762
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,276
Yeah, hopefully that answers a little

1763
01:20:47,298 --> 01:20:48,270
bit the question.

1764
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,392
Nice. I just want to

1765
01:20:53,446 --> 01:20:55,810
jump in there, just thinking about

1766
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:00,704
biomarkers if

1767
01:21:00,742 --> 01:21:04,112
we're looking for something that's of

1768
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:07,636
high clinical specificity, we want to

1769
01:21:07,658 --> 01:21:10,996
sort of be able to measure what's going

1770
01:21:11,018 --> 01:21:14,516
on in

1771
01:21:14,538 --> 01:21:17,990
a very careful way. So first of all,

1772
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,560
what is temperature parameter?

1773
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,644
We talk about, okay, psychedelics

1774
01:21:24,692 --> 01:21:26,490
increase the temperature parameter. But

1775
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,832
how high? And do different substances

1776
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:34,476
and dosages sort of differ in

1777
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:38,076
interesting ways? Probably, yes. And

1778
01:21:38,098 --> 01:21:40,104
then also sort of measuring temperature

1779
01:21:40,152 --> 01:21:42,136
parameter, measuring the temperature

1780
01:21:42,168 --> 01:21:43,720
parameter in different parts of the

1781
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:46,144
body. So you might have a different

1782
01:21:46,262 --> 01:21:49,036
temperature, like not literal

1783
01:21:49,068 --> 01:21:52,844
temperature, but computational entropic

1784
01:21:52,892 --> 01:21:55,796
integration in different parts of your

1785
01:21:55,818 --> 01:22:00,052
body and also the

1786
01:22:00,106 --> 01:22:03,216
plasticity status in different networks

1787
01:22:03,248 --> 01:22:07,764
throughout your body. So I guess I

1788
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:12,196
see a big frontier here as

1789
01:22:12,298 --> 01:22:14,260
thinking some doing some careful

1790
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,800
thinking around biomarkers and

1791
01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:20,988
proxies and inferring these sort of

1792
01:22:21,074 --> 01:22:25,064
things that we are talking about as core

1793
01:22:25,112 --> 01:22:27,596
and I think they are core and we should

1794
01:22:27,618 --> 01:22:30,830
be able to find good marks for them.

1795
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,564
Yeah, that's totally correct. And yeah,

1796
01:22:35,602 --> 01:22:38,136
I just want to repeat it for my own sake

1797
01:22:38,168 --> 01:22:40,096
even. Right, which is that these two

1798
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:43,648
things which I think were maybe one is I

1799
01:22:43,654 --> 01:22:45,196
think already a core part of the deep

1800
01:22:45,228 --> 01:22:46,916
canals work right. Which is that I was

1801
01:22:46,938 --> 01:22:48,544
showing these single images of these toy

1802
01:22:48,592 --> 01:22:51,030
optimization landscapes. But of course,

1803
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,556
the human being, the nervous system has

1804
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:57,536
multiple many of these landscapes

1805
01:22:57,568 --> 01:23:00,360
hierarchically organized, right? And

1806
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:02,616
they influence each other in a

1807
01:23:02,638 --> 01:23:09,816
complicated way. And the

1808
01:23:09,838 --> 01:23:12,732
project forward is to understand where

1809
01:23:12,786 --> 01:23:14,364
these landscapes are, what they look

1810
01:23:14,402 --> 01:23:17,676
like and how we can find biomarkers to

1811
01:23:17,698 --> 01:23:21,196
them and begin. If these two kinds of

1812
01:23:21,218 --> 01:23:23,984
characterizations are true, this

1813
01:23:24,022 --> 01:23:26,428
overfitting underfitting plasticity loss

1814
01:23:26,604 --> 01:23:29,340
and catastrophic forgetting,

1815
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:33,536
then it's a very meaningful project to

1816
01:23:33,558 --> 01:23:36,156
be able to quantify that objectively

1817
01:23:36,188 --> 01:23:38,336
somehow an individual. And that's when

1818
01:23:38,358 --> 01:23:39,876
you can start to get to this point that

1819
01:23:39,898 --> 01:23:41,936
Ada was talking about of precision

1820
01:23:41,968 --> 01:23:44,020
medicine and understanding like okay,

1821
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:45,812
well, actually it turns out like these

1822
01:23:45,866 --> 01:23:47,716
networks are catalyzed in this kind of

1823
01:23:47,738 --> 01:23:50,744
way. And because of that we can say with

1824
01:23:50,782 --> 01:23:53,272
much more certainty that this kind of

1825
01:23:53,406 --> 01:23:55,816
psychedelic intervention is going to

1826
01:23:55,838 --> 01:23:57,080
likely be helpful.

1827
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,376
I don't know if this potentially brings

1828
01:24:02,408 --> 01:24:06,600
in some of the work with vascular

1829
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,996
and neurovascular and

1830
01:24:10,018 --> 01:24:12,030
visceral integration that you're doing.

1831
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,096
So there's like a sense in the free

1832
01:24:14,118 --> 01:24:16,000
energy principle where the overall

1833
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:19,596
phenotype and extended phenotype

1834
01:24:19,628 --> 01:24:21,888
in terms of its constructing and

1835
01:24:21,894 --> 01:24:22,976
coupling within constructing its

1836
01:24:22,998 --> 01:24:26,728
Econiche, its success in manifesting

1837
01:24:26,764 --> 01:24:30,052
this phenotype there is one

1838
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:31,664
free energy functional for this overall

1839
01:24:31,712 --> 01:24:34,560
effort as a kind of prediction that's

1840
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,628
enacted through the dynamics. But you

1841
01:24:36,634 --> 01:24:38,632
could also break it down in terms of

1842
01:24:38,686 --> 01:24:41,896
subsystems with local gradients and

1843
01:24:41,998 --> 01:24:44,216
local autopoietic processes that are in

1844
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:45,816
like they're brought together into an

1845
01:24:45,838 --> 01:24:48,680
overall system, hopefully with synergies

1846
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,504
and they have to be to be an organism

1847
01:24:52,552 --> 01:24:54,796
and an agent. And we call this like a

1848
01:24:54,818 --> 01:24:58,216
thing to the extent it has thingness.

1849
01:24:58,408 --> 01:25:01,276
It's coming together. I guess think of

1850
01:25:01,298 --> 01:25:04,172
maybe like energy landscape, something

1851
01:25:04,226 --> 01:25:07,024
like let's just say right now, in this

1852
01:25:07,062 --> 01:25:10,636
moment, my explicitly felt beliefs.

1853
01:25:10,668 --> 01:25:12,896
But my body also though might have a

1854
01:25:12,918 --> 01:25:15,088
different opinion, different parts of

1855
01:25:15,094 --> 01:25:17,644
it, in terms of what it's implicitly

1856
01:25:17,692 --> 01:25:19,684
optimizing its revealed preference from

1857
01:25:19,722 --> 01:25:22,036
its inaction that may or may not

1858
01:25:22,058 --> 01:25:24,996
correspond to how I feel about it. It

1859
01:25:25,018 --> 01:25:26,676
might be difference of opinion. I might

1860
01:25:26,698 --> 01:25:27,876
not even be tuning in. I might be

1861
01:25:27,898 --> 01:25:29,088
ignoring it maybe because I don't want

1862
01:25:29,114 --> 01:25:31,444
to. And so it's kind of like the score

1863
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:36,216
kept by the body might have its own be

1864
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:38,008
describable as its own information

1865
01:25:38,094 --> 01:25:40,056
geometry which is being tracked to

1866
01:25:40,078 --> 01:25:42,604
degrees and is in different degrees of

1867
01:25:42,802 --> 01:25:46,396
alignment with different ones at

1868
01:25:46,418 --> 01:25:48,380
different levels of a control hierarchy.

1869
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,460
So plausible?

1870
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,910
Absolutely, I think so,

1871
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,656
yeah. I think of

1872
01:25:58,678 --> 01:26:02,352
the body as sort of a parliament of

1873
01:26:02,406 --> 01:26:06,924
different networks. And alignment

1874
01:26:06,972 --> 01:26:08,596
is the scarce resource. Coordination is

1875
01:26:08,618 --> 01:26:11,236
always the scarce resource. And how does

1876
01:26:11,258 --> 01:26:13,988
the body keep alignment and when does it

1877
01:26:13,994 --> 01:26:17,364
go wrong too? And I guess I see

1878
01:26:17,402 --> 01:26:21,316
this as sort of harmonically mediated.

1879
01:26:21,428 --> 01:26:24,440
Each part of the body has some choice of

1880
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:27,720
what else in the body to listen to. And

1881
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:30,616
depending on the particular sort of

1882
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:33,100
location in the information topology,

1883
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,452
different parts of the body have

1884
01:26:35,506 --> 01:26:38,444
different carrots and sticks by which to

1885
01:26:38,482 --> 01:26:40,430
try to control other parts of the body.

1886
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,964
So if your stomach is very unhappy,

1887
01:26:44,092 --> 01:26:46,530
it's going to start grumbling and then

1888
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:51,104
it'll let the body know, okay, I need

1889
01:26:51,142 --> 01:26:54,336
some food, I really seriously need

1890
01:26:54,358 --> 01:26:57,616
some food. And then the rest

1891
01:26:57,638 --> 01:26:59,276
of the body, they can sort of turn away

1892
01:26:59,318 --> 01:27:02,192
from it and then it'll just get louder

1893
01:27:02,336 --> 01:27:04,116
and then you have to turn it away from

1894
01:27:04,138 --> 01:27:05,952
it more and it'll get louder. And that's

1895
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,504
of course a negative dynamic. If it gets

1896
01:27:08,542 --> 01:27:11,496
what it wants, maybe it sort of gives a

1897
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:15,400
very harmonious uh and

1898
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:18,296
sort of tries to give carriage the rest

1899
01:27:18,318 --> 01:27:22,936
of the I just uh there's

1900
01:27:22,968 --> 01:27:24,350
an ecosystem there.

1901
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,956
I'll go to another question in the live

1902
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:34,404
chat. So Bert asks what

1903
01:27:34,442 --> 01:27:36,596
do you think of the average of solving

1904
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:39,496
within a generative hierarchy and the

1905
01:27:39,518 --> 01:27:42,296
impact of temporary openness moving it

1906
01:27:42,318 --> 01:27:45,204
upwards? And then I asked to clarify

1907
01:27:45,252 --> 01:27:47,200
what do you mean the average of solving?

1908
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,292
And Bert wrote where predictions meet

1909
01:27:49,346 --> 01:27:51,916
incoming signals like discussed in

1910
01:27:51,938 --> 01:27:53,884
Rebus, where top down predictions are

1911
01:27:53,922 --> 01:27:57,144
softened in precision and thus solved.

1912
01:27:57,192 --> 01:27:57,790
For.

1913
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,776
I think Arthur will be able to get into

1914
01:28:03,798 --> 01:28:07,408
the details of that better than I

1915
01:28:07,414 --> 01:28:11,196
would. But one thing I'm wondering

1916
01:28:11,228 --> 01:28:14,790
there is sometimes

1917
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,980
I love the entropic brain,

1918
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,556
but sometimes I wonder in terms

1919
01:28:23,578 --> 01:28:27,736
of the connections, whether I don't how

1920
01:28:27,838 --> 01:28:30,488
we're having more or less entropy and

1921
01:28:30,574 --> 01:28:33,096
whether that matters the how. So for

1922
01:28:33,118 --> 01:28:35,352
instance, you can think of a free energy

1923
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:37,736
landscape that's been flattened or you

1924
01:28:37,758 --> 01:28:39,644
can think of one where you're better

1925
01:28:39,682 --> 01:28:44,188
able and you have more energy for the

1926
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:46,216
manifold activity is better of climbing

1927
01:28:46,248 --> 01:28:48,236
up or down the peaks that are there for

1928
01:28:48,258 --> 01:28:50,796
the more enduring belief landscape. So

1929
01:28:50,818 --> 01:28:52,684
it's like, in the moment, it could be

1930
01:28:52,722 --> 01:28:56,044
that my

1931
01:28:56,082 --> 01:28:57,976
previous way of thinking is unavailable

1932
01:28:58,008 --> 01:29:00,156
to me and I no longer believe those

1933
01:29:00,178 --> 01:29:04,550
things at any level. Or I can

1934
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,996
support more novel inferences that I

1935
01:29:09,018 --> 01:29:10,644
wouldn't. Otherwise I can kind of move

1936
01:29:10,682 --> 01:29:13,844
into an area of mind space that would

1937
01:29:13,882 --> 01:29:15,284
otherwise be difficult, potentially

1938
01:29:15,332 --> 01:29:18,296
because of a greater energy into the

1939
01:29:18,318 --> 01:29:21,640
system, greater thoroughput noise.

1940
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:27,676
Yeah. So as I think I understand the

1941
01:29:27,698 --> 01:29:29,132
question, right, it's basically asking

1942
01:29:29,186 --> 01:29:32,284
about trying to optimize for this free

1943
01:29:32,322 --> 01:29:37,112
energy variable

1944
01:29:37,176 --> 01:29:39,384
and in the context of deep canals,

1945
01:29:39,432 --> 01:29:40,968
right? Like this is the loss function

1946
01:29:41,074 --> 01:29:43,424
that's driving the optimization of the

1947
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:45,436
learning landscape, the synaptic weight

1948
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:47,616
landscape. Right. The entire

1949
01:29:47,718 --> 01:29:49,836
connectivity structure of the nervous

1950
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:52,572
system is trying to get to this point of

1951
01:29:52,646 --> 01:29:54,464
low free energy. And I think there's

1952
01:29:54,512 --> 01:29:58,356
lots of for any given individual in

1953
01:29:58,378 --> 01:30:00,516
a given environment, assuming the

1954
01:30:00,538 --> 01:30:02,196
environment is relatively fixed, right?

1955
01:30:02,218 --> 01:30:04,436
There's like an optimal, there's a

1956
01:30:04,458 --> 01:30:07,332
global optimal. And it's very likely

1957
01:30:07,396 --> 01:30:10,840
that the individual is in some local

1958
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:14,136
optima that is maybe close to it,

1959
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,864
maybe far from it, but that's just

1960
01:30:17,902 --> 01:30:21,448
inherently what within the

1961
01:30:21,454 --> 01:30:23,048
context of the active inputs. That's

1962
01:30:23,064 --> 01:30:24,056
what we're assuming that the nervous

1963
01:30:24,088 --> 01:30:25,836
system is doing, is doing this

1964
01:30:25,858 --> 01:30:29,924
gradientism in the space and openness

1965
01:30:30,072 --> 01:30:33,548
then is going to correspond

1966
01:30:33,644 --> 01:30:37,264
to this plasticity MetaTrade or

1967
01:30:37,302 --> 01:30:40,672
be one of the components of it. And it

1968
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:43,904
is in the deep canals model then going

1969
01:30:43,942 --> 01:30:47,172
to correspond to an ability to move

1970
01:30:47,226 --> 01:30:48,996
around this optimization landscape more

1971
01:30:49,018 --> 01:30:50,548
easily. Right? It's going to be a

1972
01:30:50,554 --> 01:30:52,644
flattening of the landscape, or more

1973
01:30:52,682 --> 01:30:54,308
precisely, I guess, a smoothing of the

1974
01:30:54,314 --> 01:30:57,396
landscape such that it's

1975
01:30:57,428 --> 01:31:01,064
less likely that the individual,

1976
01:31:01,182 --> 01:31:02,808
the nervous system will get stuck in

1977
01:31:02,814 --> 01:31:05,876
these local optima. So maybe it won't

1978
01:31:05,908 --> 01:31:07,448
mean that the individual will arrive at

1979
01:31:07,454 --> 01:31:09,236
the global optima. I think it's

1980
01:31:09,268 --> 01:31:11,612
difficult to say what that even might be

1981
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:14,588
or how individuals might get to such a

1982
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,504
place at all. But I think it is likely

1983
01:31:16,552 --> 01:31:20,316
that the individual will be more likely

1984
01:31:20,348 --> 01:31:24,224
to find a more

1985
01:31:24,262 --> 01:31:27,584
global optima and more easily move from

1986
01:31:27,622 --> 01:31:30,496
one optimal to another. And I think

1987
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:32,336
that's kind of what this openness is

1988
01:31:32,358 --> 01:31:33,510
corresponding to.

1989
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,470
Yeah. Okay.

1990
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,736
In neural kneeling, I mentioned the

1991
01:31:45,758 --> 01:31:47,796
idea of psychedelic extrapolated

1992
01:31:47,908 --> 01:31:51,028
volition, kind of a play on a coherent

1993
01:31:51,124 --> 01:31:53,972
extrapolated volition from the AI safety

1994
01:31:54,036 --> 01:31:57,530
crowd. And it's this sort of sense that

1995
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,724
if temporarily you have more control

1996
01:32:01,842 --> 01:32:05,630
over sort of low level shaping of

1997
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,720
your cognition, your emotion, and maybe

1998
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:13,936
sort of based on this attractor that we

1999
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:17,296
call the self, or I

2000
01:32:17,318 --> 01:32:20,050
guess based on what is a good question,

2001
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:25,076
then what are good signs? That you

2002
01:32:25,098 --> 01:32:27,796
should be trusted with that power or you

2003
01:32:27,818 --> 01:32:29,220
should trust yourself with that power

2004
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:33,124
rather. And what are telltale signs that

2005
01:32:33,162 --> 01:32:35,076
you shouldn't trust yourself with that

2006
01:32:35,098 --> 01:32:38,616
power? And I don't have an answer, but I

2007
01:32:38,638 --> 01:32:40,090
think it's an interesting question.

2008
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:43,336
Yes, I am normal and can be trusted with

2009
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:45,944
the key to the doors of perception. Let

2010
01:32:45,982 --> 01:32:49,932
me in exactly. I have a short

2011
01:32:50,066 --> 01:32:53,372
question. Where is action in this

2012
01:32:53,426 --> 01:32:54,030
model?

2013
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,956
So imagine

2014
01:33:02,988 --> 01:33:04,416
many places Arthur will get into that.

2015
01:33:04,438 --> 01:33:09,196
But for what I was thinking with Albus

2016
01:33:09,228 --> 01:33:11,792
is that actually the five HD two A

2017
01:33:11,846 --> 01:33:15,204
system. I talk

2018
01:33:15,242 --> 01:33:16,980
about two regimes, potentially.

2019
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:22,512
One is more towards overt

2020
01:33:22,576 --> 01:33:25,716
inaction and modifying the world and

2021
01:33:25,738 --> 01:33:28,024
strengthened beliefs potentially of that

2022
01:33:28,062 --> 01:33:30,648
variety. And the other might be more of

2023
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:32,330
adapting to the world.

2024
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:37,032
Robin has a really excellent paper

2025
01:33:37,086 --> 01:33:39,636
called A Tale of Two Receptors where he

2026
01:33:39,678 --> 01:33:43,416
talks about five H T, one A receptors.

2027
01:33:43,528 --> 01:33:45,068
The ones that antidepressants tend to

2028
01:33:45,074 --> 01:33:47,244
act on because they tend to reduce this

2029
01:33:47,282 --> 01:33:49,628
excitatory signaling, talking about them

2030
01:33:49,634 --> 01:33:51,676
as a kind of passive coping. And so this

2031
01:33:51,698 --> 01:33:54,948
would correspond in there's some machine

2032
01:33:54,984 --> 01:33:56,448
learning models of this by Diane and

2033
01:33:56,454 --> 01:33:57,568
colleagues where they talk about

2034
01:33:57,574 --> 01:33:58,816
opponency between dopamine and

2035
01:33:58,838 --> 01:34:01,008
serotonin. And they're focusing on the

2036
01:34:01,014 --> 01:34:02,424
one A as a kind of like patients

2037
01:34:02,492 --> 01:34:04,660
promoting parameter, keeping you from

2038
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:06,212
confidently charging into your policy.

2039
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:09,588
So that would tend to inhibit, I guess,

2040
01:34:09,674 --> 01:34:12,884
patterns of either overt inaction or

2041
01:34:12,922 --> 01:34:16,736
potentially even some kinds of mental

2042
01:34:16,768 --> 01:34:19,336
stimulation too. You could maybe even

2043
01:34:19,358 --> 01:34:20,676
think of like even if you're not overtly

2044
01:34:20,708 --> 01:34:23,560
inactive enacting something externally,

2045
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:26,680
there might be more or less brave type

2046
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,268
styles of thoughts that you might be

2047
01:34:28,274 --> 01:34:29,340
willing to entertain,

2048
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,244
going places you might not otherwise be

2049
01:34:35,282 --> 01:34:37,976
willing to go, and being able to handle

2050
01:34:38,008 --> 01:34:39,692
the swings in expected free energy.

2051
01:34:39,826 --> 01:34:42,608
That might happen as you try to pursue a

2052
01:34:42,614 --> 01:34:46,112
given path of policies. But the idea

2053
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:48,704
would be that there might be something

2054
01:34:48,742 --> 01:34:50,428
more like a micro dosing mesodosing

2055
01:34:50,444 --> 01:34:52,304
regime which might be more of what

2056
01:34:52,422 --> 01:34:54,556
initially sculpted the five H two A

2057
01:34:54,598 --> 01:34:56,368
system which evolved with a gene

2058
01:34:56,384 --> 01:34:59,076
duplication event around the time of the

2059
01:34:59,098 --> 01:35:00,548
Cambrian Explosion with the advent of

2060
01:35:00,554 --> 01:35:02,384
jawed fishes. I'm personally

2061
01:35:02,432 --> 01:35:03,636
interpreting this as having the

2062
01:35:03,658 --> 01:35:06,436
significance of evolving in the context

2063
01:35:06,468 --> 01:35:08,616
of predator prey arms races. I suspect I

2064
01:35:08,638 --> 01:35:11,636
could be wrong, but that basically it's

2065
01:35:11,828 --> 01:35:15,112
locally trying to strengthen patterns of

2066
01:35:15,246 --> 01:35:17,640
policy pursuit to pursue particular

2067
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:20,056
goals in a given context. And to come

2068
01:35:20,078 --> 01:35:21,288
back to what I was mentioning earlier

2069
01:35:21,304 --> 01:35:22,668
with that work by Robin of like a kind

2070
01:35:22,674 --> 01:35:25,436
of act of coping. But it seems with

2071
01:35:25,458 --> 01:35:32,252
rebus there's almost like not

2072
01:35:32,306 --> 01:35:35,676
that kind of story, and that it's

2073
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:37,712
more you're adjusting to the world and

2074
01:35:37,766 --> 01:35:40,224
actually, if under a very alter state,

2075
01:35:40,262 --> 01:35:41,468
you are overtly enacting, that's

2076
01:35:41,484 --> 01:35:43,168
actually kind of a dangerous thing. I

2077
01:35:43,174 --> 01:35:45,024
don't know how much to make of this that

2078
01:35:45,062 --> 01:35:47,744
the five Http receptors are less

2079
01:35:47,782 --> 01:35:49,508
expressed on, like, motor cortex. I

2080
01:35:49,514 --> 01:35:51,316
don't think we know enough to make too

2081
01:35:51,338 --> 01:35:53,456
much of it. But it's like some dreams

2082
01:35:53,488 --> 01:35:54,988
you might not want to act out as they're

2083
01:35:55,024 --> 01:35:56,152
happening, but they still might

2084
01:35:56,206 --> 01:35:59,844
powerfully impact you. So I'm

2085
01:35:59,892 --> 01:36:01,672
currently actually wondering whether

2086
01:36:01,726 --> 01:36:04,904
this other rebus like regime might have

2087
01:36:04,942 --> 01:36:06,456
been specifically sculpted in the

2088
01:36:06,478 --> 01:36:10,344
context of bonding and

2089
01:36:10,382 --> 01:36:12,216
actually opening the self to include

2090
01:36:12,248 --> 01:36:14,188
others. And that might have been some of

2091
01:36:14,194 --> 01:36:16,088
the primary selective pressures. I don't

2092
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:17,356
know how to think of that in terms of

2093
01:36:17,378 --> 01:36:18,220
inaction.

2094
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,576
And one more detail that might kind of

2095
01:36:22,598 --> 01:36:24,896
like not sure what to make of it that

2096
01:36:24,918 --> 01:36:27,650
kind of goes through both of those

2097
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:30,848
excuse the phone would be

2098
01:36:31,014 --> 01:36:32,544
anthropologically, I believe like

2099
01:36:32,582 --> 01:36:35,452
psychedelics are oftentimes used in ways

2100
01:36:35,526 --> 01:36:37,908
that would be both like creating a kind

2101
01:36:37,914 --> 01:36:40,196
of group solidarity and might be used in

2102
01:36:40,218 --> 01:36:43,764
the context of pursuing goals together

2103
01:36:43,802 --> 01:36:44,868
in the world. So for instance, like a

2104
01:36:44,874 --> 01:36:46,436
hunting party, they might all do

2105
01:36:46,458 --> 01:36:47,748
psychedelics together or something that

2106
01:36:47,754 --> 01:36:49,752
looks a lot like breath work before

2107
01:36:49,886 --> 01:36:52,756
going out, maybe going to war. So that's

2108
01:36:52,788 --> 01:36:54,408
a very different type that kind of

2109
01:36:54,494 --> 01:36:56,916
includes both a relaxation of the normal

2110
01:36:56,948 --> 01:36:59,710
boundaries of the self and a kind of

2111
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,070
gearing you up for pursuing goals in the

2112
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:04,764
you know, there's got to be another

2113
01:37:04,802 --> 01:37:07,036
story of like, so Arthur's expertise is

2114
01:37:07,058 --> 01:37:09,468
machine learning. And so it's like you

2115
01:37:09,474 --> 01:37:11,484
want these systems to act intelligently

2116
01:37:11,532 --> 01:37:13,856
and not act in other times. And so

2117
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:15,936
basically now we're in the language of

2118
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:17,696
policies, and when you deploy them and

2119
01:37:17,718 --> 01:37:20,880
how and so complicated.

2120
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,308
Yeah. I would say that action manifests

2121
01:37:25,324 --> 01:37:27,008
itself at a few different places. It's

2122
01:37:27,024 --> 01:37:28,596
true, I didn't mention it here. Yeah, I

2123
01:37:28,618 --> 01:37:30,676
think it's very important, obviously. I

2124
01:37:30,698 --> 01:37:32,960
think what the kind of most implicit

2125
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,270
place where it exists right, is that

2126
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:37,384
these belief landscapes are being

2127
01:37:37,422 --> 01:37:39,608
instantiated ultimately for the sake of

2128
01:37:39,694 --> 01:37:42,548
adaptive behavior. Adaptive behavior,

2129
01:37:42,644 --> 01:37:44,328
adaptive action right, in some sort of

2130
01:37:44,334 --> 01:37:46,872
environmental context. And that's the

2131
01:37:46,926 --> 01:37:48,376
kind of like framework, the deep

2132
01:37:48,408 --> 01:37:49,804
learning framework that we're using or

2133
01:37:49,842 --> 01:37:53,176
like the artificial agent framework,

2134
01:37:53,208 --> 01:37:54,876
right. Is that the assumption is that

2135
01:37:54,898 --> 01:37:58,428
the system is supporting some sort of

2136
01:37:58,514 --> 01:38:00,396
agent that's embodied in some sort of

2137
01:38:00,418 --> 01:38:03,570
environment which is changing over time

2138
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,416
such that it can either be adaptive or

2139
01:38:06,438 --> 01:38:09,072
not adaptive. I think then the question

2140
01:38:09,126 --> 01:38:11,776
of how action actually plays into the

2141
01:38:11,798 --> 01:38:13,600
evolution of these belief landscapes

2142
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:19,376
during psychedelics or not acting

2143
01:38:19,408 --> 01:38:22,230
in the world is a very clear way to

2144
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,724
modify one's setting, right? So acting

2145
01:38:26,772 --> 01:38:29,032
is a way of modifying the function

2146
01:38:29,166 --> 01:38:31,624
that's providing the sensory input into

2147
01:38:31,662 --> 01:38:34,936
the system which is going to change how

2148
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:37,624
the activity patterns are evolving over

2149
01:38:37,662 --> 01:38:39,064
time, right, which are going to affect

2150
01:38:39,112 --> 01:38:42,632
the acute quality of the trip, affect

2151
01:38:42,696 --> 01:38:44,844
how beliefs are either being

2152
01:38:44,882 --> 01:38:47,870
strengthened or relaxed. And I think

2153
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:51,228
it's already clear that there's a kind

2154
01:38:51,234 --> 01:38:54,776
of whole set of folk psychology

2155
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:56,576
that's been built around what is or

2156
01:38:56,598 --> 01:39:00,080
isn't a good way to cultivate

2157
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:03,344
a helpful setting and that of course all

2158
01:39:03,382 --> 01:39:05,716
is a function of action in the world. I

2159
01:39:05,738 --> 01:39:08,596
think then there's also this kind of

2160
01:39:08,618 --> 01:39:11,444
more subtler form of action which is how

2161
01:39:11,482 --> 01:39:14,368
one thinks, how one deploys attention

2162
01:39:14,544 --> 01:39:16,856
essentially during this experience. And

2163
01:39:16,878 --> 01:39:18,936
I think this deployment of attention has

2164
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:22,376
a huge effect on whether there end up

2165
01:39:22,398 --> 01:39:25,300
being rebus or CBIS like effects.

2166
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:28,380
Right? So whether one allows oneself to

2167
01:39:28,530 --> 01:39:30,712
go down certain thought rabbit holes,

2168
01:39:30,856 --> 01:39:32,748
whether one allows oneself to get kind

2169
01:39:32,754 --> 01:39:34,332
of stuck in certain kinds of thought

2170
01:39:34,386 --> 01:39:35,260
patterns.

2171
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:42,624
I think this form of mental action has

2172
01:39:42,742 --> 01:39:47,824
a very big downstream effect and

2173
01:39:47,862 --> 01:39:50,736
I think a lot of I'd love to see much

2174
01:39:50,758 --> 01:39:52,096
more work on this. I think it's very

2175
01:39:52,118 --> 01:39:53,556
important, I think it's kind of

2176
01:39:53,578 --> 01:39:56,356
essential and I think this is kind of

2177
01:39:56,378 --> 01:39:57,924
one of the most interesting things about

2178
01:39:57,962 --> 01:40:02,470
these psychedelic experiences is that

2179
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,424
in some sense, like the most extreme

2180
01:40:05,472 --> 01:40:08,116
rebus model and the most extreme thebis

2181
01:40:08,148 --> 01:40:10,504
model could be true for two different

2182
01:40:10,542 --> 01:40:13,096
individuals, right? Someone could say I

2183
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:14,744
went to hell and I was there for 8 hours

2184
01:40:14,782 --> 01:40:18,668
straight, or say

2185
01:40:18,834 --> 01:40:21,692
I had a completely selfless experience,

2186
01:40:21,826 --> 01:40:25,576
I let go of all beliefs and experienced

2187
01:40:25,688 --> 01:40:27,484
nothing for 8 hours straight and it was

2188
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:30,360
great. Right? And clearly those involve

2189
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:35,036
two very different neural regimes and

2190
01:40:35,058 --> 01:40:36,768
I think the nature of that and

2191
01:40:36,854 --> 01:40:38,368
obviously, given that they involve the

2192
01:40:38,374 --> 01:40:40,128
same drug and they involve not such a

2193
01:40:40,134 --> 01:40:41,296
different setting, it's obvious that

2194
01:40:41,318 --> 01:40:44,916
they have something very important to do

2195
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:46,404
with how attention is deployed during

2196
01:40:46,442 --> 01:40:47,190
this experience.

2197
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:53,670
Yeah, I do think that this

2198
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,344
frame of attention, I mean, attention is

2199
01:40:56,382 --> 01:40:59,256
so important for everything. And I do

2200
01:40:59,278 --> 01:41:00,600
think that there's something interesting

2201
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:03,464
kind of digging into the Attention and

2202
01:41:03,502 --> 01:41:08,092
Albus framework that yeah,

2203
01:41:08,146 --> 01:41:10,664
I'm really curious to see how that'll

2204
01:41:10,712 --> 01:41:14,030
develop. I would also say that

2205
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,300
in terms of active inference and action,

2206
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:21,360
there is a cost to holding an intention

2207
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:26,016
and then once you discharge your

2208
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:27,730
intention, you can release that cost.

2209
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:32,836
So I guess I would have to think

2210
01:41:32,858 --> 01:41:34,592
about how to apply that to the Canals

2211
01:41:34,656 --> 01:41:35,380
framework.

2212
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,576
Fred Barrett, I don't know if he's

2213
01:41:40,608 --> 01:41:43,236
published it yet, but this is kind of

2214
01:41:43,258 --> 01:41:45,556
like a follow up to a Klaus truly

2215
01:41:45,588 --> 01:41:49,016
central model that Arthur alluded to is

2216
01:41:49,038 --> 01:41:51,416
emphasizing basically a lack of

2217
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:53,976
executive control and placing that as

2218
01:41:53,998 --> 01:41:55,876
central to the psychedelic spirits.

2219
01:41:55,908 --> 01:41:58,388
Like not controlling your mental action

2220
01:41:58,484 --> 01:42:01,096
in directed ways as much and then trying

2221
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:03,676
to counter more of the types of

2222
01:42:03,698 --> 01:42:04,988
cognition and phenomenology sort of

2223
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:07,804
psychedelics based on just releasing of

2224
01:42:07,922 --> 01:42:10,320
the normal more agentic modes of policy

2225
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:12,876
selection around attention as mental

2226
01:42:12,908 --> 01:42:15,196
action, although not using active

2227
01:42:15,228 --> 01:42:15,920
inference.

2228
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:22,560
Yeah, very interesting. Adam,

2229
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:27,652
your introduction there of course,

2230
01:42:27,706 --> 01:42:31,204
attention as covert action, which was

2231
01:42:31,242 --> 01:42:33,636
echoed by Arthur and Michael, both of

2232
01:42:33,658 --> 01:42:38,788
you said it really introduces a

2233
01:42:38,794 --> 01:42:40,932
case where we can use active inference

2234
01:42:40,996 --> 01:42:42,788
to find continuity between what's

2235
01:42:42,804 --> 01:42:44,520
happening inside the agent and outside

2236
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:46,536
the agent. Because on one hand we could

2237
01:42:46,558 --> 01:42:49,128
kind of take a belief oriented frame and

2238
01:42:49,134 --> 01:42:50,252
we could say, well, what's happening

2239
01:42:50,306 --> 01:42:52,172
inside the agent are beliefs about

2240
01:42:52,226 --> 01:42:53,612
things, beliefs about hidden states,

2241
01:42:53,666 --> 01:42:55,528
beliefs about observations, beliefs

2242
01:42:55,544 --> 01:42:57,864
about policy. So that's kind of a belief

2243
01:42:57,912 --> 01:43:00,312
oriented view where everything is framed

2244
01:43:00,456 --> 01:43:03,484
basically cognitively. Or we could take

2245
01:43:03,522 --> 01:43:06,028
a very action oriented view and then we

2246
01:43:06,034 --> 01:43:07,756
could think about the interface in a

2247
01:43:07,778 --> 01:43:11,676
more inactive way and then also even the

2248
01:43:11,698 --> 01:43:15,888
realm of where many active entities

2249
01:43:16,064 --> 01:43:19,492
dare not tread in mental action with

2250
01:43:19,546 --> 01:43:21,908
attention as covert action. And so then

2251
01:43:21,914 --> 01:43:25,190
we have, like, a total active account

2252
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,904
that is mathematically isomorphic with

2253
01:43:28,942 --> 01:43:30,948
the total belief based account. They're

2254
01:43:30,964 --> 01:43:32,136
both just maps. They're not the

2255
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:34,520
territory. The territory is the person

2256
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:36,904
in the room. So all of this is just

2257
01:43:36,942 --> 01:43:39,116
talking about the formalism and how we

2258
01:43:39,138 --> 01:43:41,388
choose to interpret the formalism in

2259
01:43:41,394 --> 01:43:44,124
terms of it being more inferential or it

2260
01:43:44,162 --> 01:43:47,676
being more active. And so there's a lot

2261
01:43:47,698 --> 01:43:51,104
of ways to go, I guess, in our

2262
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:54,450
closing minutes, I would love to hear

2263
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:58,912
what are the next moves or what are some

2264
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:02,770
areas that you would hope that people

2265
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:04,150
look into?

2266
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,230
Michael and then the.

2267
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:16,070
Know is, I think

2268
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,756
my favorite mental move is to try to

2269
01:44:18,778 --> 01:44:21,412
drop down on my level of abstraction.

2270
01:44:21,556 --> 01:44:24,916
Okay, how is this implemented? What's

2271
01:44:24,948 --> 01:44:27,764
going on here? And then I do think that

2272
01:44:27,902 --> 01:44:30,924
details of implementation are really

2273
01:44:30,962 --> 01:44:33,836
generative to look into and, like, the

2274
01:44:33,858 --> 01:44:37,224
biomarkers and the proxies for figuring

2275
01:44:37,272 --> 01:44:40,056
out how to parameterize okay, exactly

2276
01:44:40,178 --> 01:44:42,976
how hot are we talking about with this

2277
01:44:42,998 --> 01:44:44,896
temperature parameter and so on in

2278
01:44:44,918 --> 01:44:46,130
different parts of the body.

2279
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:51,712
I have kind of my niche that I'm working

2280
01:44:51,766 --> 01:44:55,892
on in the Vasomuscular system, which is

2281
01:44:56,026 --> 01:44:58,710
a rabbit hole. But, yeah,

2282
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:03,972
I do think that the

2283
01:45:04,026 --> 01:45:07,220
deep canals framework specifically

2284
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:11,540
and the canalization paradigm

2285
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:15,464
in general, it's good enough that

2286
01:45:15,502 --> 01:45:17,472
we should be able to dig into mechanism.

2287
01:45:17,556 --> 01:45:19,790
So I'm looking forward to that.

2288
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:29,854
Great. Adam or

2289
01:45:29,892 --> 01:45:30,670
Arthur.

2290
01:45:33,490 --> 01:45:36,722
You can go first. Doesn't matter. Okay.

2291
01:45:36,776 --> 01:45:39,234
Yeah, I'll go. Sure. Yeah. I mean,

2292
01:45:39,272 --> 01:45:41,794
first I want to echo this idea. I think

2293
01:45:41,832 --> 01:45:43,586
Mexicans is very important. This is one

2294
01:45:43,608 --> 01:45:45,860
of the people we've talked to about

2295
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:48,834
talked with about deep canals. This idea

2296
01:45:48,872 --> 01:45:50,646
of, like, well, this is great. We have

2297
01:45:50,668 --> 01:45:52,646
these two axes. It'd be wonderful if

2298
01:45:52,668 --> 01:45:54,786
there were some biological correlates

2299
01:45:54,818 --> 01:45:56,866
you could look for. I think that's

2300
01:45:56,898 --> 01:46:00,074
incredibly important. My background is

2301
01:46:00,112 --> 01:46:03,286
also in machine learning, in deep

2302
01:46:03,318 --> 01:46:05,834
learning. So I'm currently doing some

2303
01:46:05,872 --> 01:46:07,546
work around simulating some of these

2304
01:46:07,568 --> 01:46:11,066
things. I think especially for these

2305
01:46:11,088 --> 01:46:12,410
albus dynamics,

2306
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:16,814
being able to kind of study under what

2307
01:46:16,852 --> 01:46:18,334
circumstances you get these different

2308
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:19,758
kinds of effects, even in kind of,

2309
01:46:19,764 --> 01:46:21,246
like, simple Tory models, is kind of

2310
01:46:21,268 --> 01:46:23,250
important to see how they unfold.

2311
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:28,146
And then we brought it up at the end. I

2312
01:46:28,168 --> 01:46:30,914
think it's really important. It's very

2313
01:46:30,952 --> 01:46:32,866
interesting to me is the role of the

2314
01:46:32,888 --> 01:46:35,746
deployment of attention in this. And

2315
01:46:35,768 --> 01:46:38,102
there's lines of work where people are

2316
01:46:38,156 --> 01:46:41,078
trying various researchers are trying to

2317
01:46:41,084 --> 01:46:42,806
connect, for example, meditation to

2318
01:46:42,828 --> 01:46:45,030
psychedelic research. And kind of

2319
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,662
certain people are trying to tell

2320
01:46:46,716 --> 01:46:50,406
unified stories about what's going on

2321
01:46:50,428 --> 01:46:51,606
in the brain when people meditate,

2322
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:53,370
what's going on under psychedelics,

2323
01:46:53,710 --> 01:46:55,126
some of them using these active

2324
01:46:55,158 --> 01:46:58,058
inference models. But I think in all of

2325
01:46:58,064 --> 01:46:59,894
these cases, the deployment of attention

2326
01:46:59,942 --> 01:47:01,546
and how the deployment of tension

2327
01:47:01,578 --> 01:47:03,598
changes over time is kind of a key

2328
01:47:03,684 --> 01:47:07,978
aspect of this. And it's

2329
01:47:07,994 --> 01:47:09,838
not as present in the deep canals model

2330
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:14,162
right now. But I think any

2331
01:47:14,216 --> 01:47:16,418
really robust future kind of like model

2332
01:47:16,504 --> 01:47:18,546
of these things is going to have to talk

2333
01:47:18,568 --> 01:47:20,260
about attention quite a bit.

2334
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:29,566
Well, I guess next steps would be seeing

2335
01:47:29,588 --> 01:47:35,006
how the review process goes, but also I

2336
01:47:35,028 --> 01:47:38,126
guess helping Arthur to establish a

2337
01:47:38,148 --> 01:47:40,542
field of psychedelic machine learning.

2338
01:47:40,676 --> 01:47:42,114
Psychedelic inspired machine learning

2339
01:47:42,152 --> 01:47:46,020
where we try to make systems more

2340
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:48,786
flexible and capable, better. They can

2341
01:47:48,808 --> 01:47:51,538
handle edge cases better, imagine better

2342
01:47:51,624 --> 01:47:53,454
in terms of real time policy selection,

2343
01:47:53,502 --> 01:47:56,386
learn in ways that not too much, not too

2344
01:47:56,408 --> 01:47:59,886
little, and then maybe so that's

2345
01:47:59,918 --> 01:48:02,118
useful, potentially earlier. Like you

2346
01:48:02,124 --> 01:48:04,246
have a driverless vehicle, do I change

2347
01:48:04,348 --> 01:48:06,486
lanes or don't I? You send it back to

2348
01:48:06,508 --> 01:48:08,186
the Tesla, dojo what do you want it to

2349
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:09,900
learn, what do you not want it to learn?

2350
01:48:10,990 --> 01:48:17,530
But then down the line well

2351
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,658
before we even get there, as you're

2352
01:48:19,664 --> 01:48:20,906
going into this you could see the

2353
01:48:20,928 --> 01:48:22,946
capacity for a rich bi directional flow

2354
01:48:22,998 --> 01:48:26,506
between machine learning and psychedelic

2355
01:48:26,538 --> 01:48:28,254
inspired machine learning. So it's like

2356
01:48:28,292 --> 01:48:29,546
you get a bunch of machine learners

2357
01:48:29,578 --> 01:48:30,846
together and a bunch of people who know

2358
01:48:30,868 --> 01:48:32,446
a lot about the cognitive science and

2359
01:48:32,468 --> 01:48:33,998
biology and maybe phenomenology of

2360
01:48:34,004 --> 01:48:36,882
psychedelics. And in addition to

2361
01:48:36,936 --> 01:48:37,906
designing better machine learning

2362
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:39,026
systems, they could probably tell you

2363
01:48:39,048 --> 01:48:40,738
more about how psychedelics act. And so

2364
01:48:40,744 --> 01:48:42,430
you can have this kind of virtuous cycle

2365
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:46,294
between the biology and the field,

2366
01:48:46,492 --> 01:48:49,958
but you keep going with that before we

2367
01:48:49,964 --> 01:48:51,222
get there. We'll keep going, but before

2368
01:48:51,276 --> 01:48:54,646
we get there. Very interested in the

2369
01:48:54,668 --> 01:48:57,494
implications for best practices. So for

2370
01:48:57,532 --> 01:48:58,150
instance,

2371
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:01,974
oftentimes you might want semantically

2372
01:49:02,022 --> 01:49:04,074
neutral energy to kind of get them.

2373
01:49:04,112 --> 01:49:05,526
You're just turning up the heat, you're

2374
01:49:05,558 --> 01:49:08,186
just maybe at first breaking up, I call

2375
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:10,214
them defenses, but the usual structure.

2376
01:49:10,342 --> 01:49:12,622
But then the question is at what point

2377
01:49:12,756 --> 01:49:14,522
do you try to direct the canalization

2378
01:49:14,586 --> 01:49:17,726
process? Do you wait till after or maybe

2379
01:49:17,908 --> 01:49:20,446
when the metal is hot, is that a really

2380
01:49:20,468 --> 01:49:23,486
good time to do it? And maybe there's no

2381
01:49:23,508 --> 01:49:24,994
one single question. This might depend

2382
01:49:25,032 --> 01:49:27,838
on the substance, the set, the setting,

2383
01:49:27,854 --> 01:49:29,694
the dose, the person. So getting clarity

2384
01:49:29,742 --> 01:49:32,834
on that could be fateful for many people

2385
01:49:32,872 --> 01:49:35,430
in terms of the outcomes they have. And

2386
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:38,658
specifically what I'm gunning for is I'm

2387
01:49:38,674 --> 01:49:40,226
on a mission to make compassion

2388
01:49:40,258 --> 01:49:45,254
meditation treatment as usual for all

2389
01:49:45,452 --> 01:49:46,994
psychedelic psychotherapy and preferably

2390
01:49:47,042 --> 01:49:49,318
all therapy. And so the question is if

2391
01:49:49,324 --> 01:49:50,950
you're in a state of enhanced

2392
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:52,966
imaginative capacity, maybe you're

2393
01:49:52,998 --> 01:49:54,458
having more ability to tune into your

2394
01:49:54,464 --> 01:49:56,346
interceptive system, whether you've just

2395
01:49:56,368 --> 01:49:58,118
increased the channels or maybe you're

2396
01:49:58,134 --> 01:49:59,258
better capable of because maybe your

2397
01:49:59,264 --> 01:50:00,938
inflammation went down a bit and you can

2398
01:50:00,944 --> 01:50:03,694
tune in better because it feels better

2399
01:50:03,732 --> 01:50:06,286
to do so. Some combination that might be

2400
01:50:06,308 --> 01:50:08,414
a really good opportunity to do certain

2401
01:50:08,452 --> 01:50:09,966
meditations that might update you in

2402
01:50:09,988 --> 01:50:12,318
particular ways like try to direct the

2403
01:50:12,324 --> 01:50:13,746
re Annealing process, maybe not just

2404
01:50:13,768 --> 01:50:15,314
like afterwards integration, but during

2405
01:50:15,352 --> 01:50:17,394
the session. And so if we could get

2406
01:50:17,432 --> 01:50:21,522
clarity on something like how to

2407
01:50:21,576 --> 01:50:23,566
canalize and recanalyze, like Annealing

2408
01:50:23,598 --> 01:50:24,946
schedules. It's going to be complicated,

2409
01:50:24,978 --> 01:50:26,966
but that's, I think, where we need to

2410
01:50:26,988 --> 01:50:29,880
head. And then finally for all this,

2411
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:35,346
that would be enough. But recentering

2412
01:50:35,378 --> 01:50:37,462
the conversation on psychedelics, on

2413
01:50:37,516 --> 01:50:38,906
basically meaning and connection would

2414
01:50:38,928 --> 01:50:41,754
be enough. But I'm wondering down the

2415
01:50:41,792 --> 01:50:44,806
line, when we talk of alignment, we're

2416
01:50:44,838 --> 01:50:46,586
talking about our alignment with our

2417
01:50:46,608 --> 01:50:48,394
values and maybe the alignments of

2418
01:50:48,432 --> 01:50:52,574
machines with our values. And so does

2419
01:50:52,612 --> 01:50:54,558
this actually end up going to some of

2420
01:50:54,564 --> 01:50:56,222
the conversations that are happening now

2421
01:50:56,276 --> 01:50:58,686
about increasingly advanced AI and our

2422
01:50:58,708 --> 01:51:00,638
relationships to it? Could there be a

2423
01:51:00,644 --> 01:51:02,286
story of cannibalization and

2424
01:51:02,308 --> 01:51:05,086
recalyzation? You want some things to

2425
01:51:05,108 --> 01:51:07,186
hold fast and you want some things to be

2426
01:51:07,208 --> 01:51:09,426
more fluid. This might be it's always

2427
01:51:09,448 --> 01:51:10,834
been a timely conversation. We've always

2428
01:51:10,872 --> 01:51:12,146
been dealing with this with us, the

2429
01:51:12,168 --> 01:51:14,662
alignment problem of us, which we often

2430
01:51:14,716 --> 01:51:18,406
fail, but the alignment problem with

2431
01:51:18,428 --> 01:51:20,070
these technologies we're developing.

2432
01:51:21,610 --> 01:51:25,080
Okay, wow. Well,

2433
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:29,640
so many great topics. Thank you all.

2434
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:33,078
All I have in closing, turn on, tune in,

2435
01:51:33,164 --> 01:51:36,600
act in, first serve. Thank you.

2436
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:38,646
See you all next time.
