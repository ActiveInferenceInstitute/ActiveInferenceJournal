00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,900
hello and welcome everyone it's active

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,019
inference guest stream number 48.1 on

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,480
July 19 2023

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,180
we're here with Arthur Giuliani and Adam

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,000
saffron also joined by Michael Edward

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,160
Johnson in discussion we're going to

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,560
have a presentation and then a

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,840
conversation about deep canals a deep

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,580
learning approach to refining the

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,560
canalization theory of Psychopathology

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,100
so thank you all for joining and looking

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,899
forward to this presentation and

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,380
discussion

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,280
thanks Daniel I'm very happy to be here

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,960
uh with admin Mike to talk about this

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,780
work and to discuss more broadly

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,780
um this General Direction that's emerged

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,219
over the past few years to try to

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,980
utilize some of the concepts from the

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,020
active inference World

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,140
um and computational modeling more

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,420
generally to understand what's going on

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,799
both in Psychopathology and in

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,020
psychedelic therapy uh yeah so I'll give

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,280
a brief a presentation and we'll move

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,780
into a kind of more General discussion

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,260
of this work

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,680
it'll start uh with some kind of General

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,360
considerations around psychedelic

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,740
therapy some of the Neuroscience of

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,360
psychedelics

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,380
um and then move kind of more

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,520
specifically into the model

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,740
so there is this class of drugs the

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,380
serotonergic Psychedelic drugs which

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,380
include psilocybin DMT LSD and others

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,600
and the past decade has seen a

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,240
Resurgence of interest in psychedelic

39
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,560
therapy psychedelic assisted

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,299
Psychotherapy

41
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,960
um where one or multiple of these drugs

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,320
is used in conjunction with a kind of

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,380
psycho therapeutic protocol

44
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,540
um and there's been a lot of investment

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,960
of money and time and clinical resources

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
into utilizing these drugs for

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,880
treatments depression anxiety disorders

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,660
substance use disorders and others

49
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,540
and there seems to be quite a lot of

50
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,440
um

51
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,900
positive signals suggesting that these

52
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,599
kinds of therapeutic interventions can

53
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,020
actually be uh quite effective

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,220
um so there's a number of studies

55
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,220
suggesting that

56
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,840
psilocybin assisted Psychotherapy can be

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,840
helpful for depression anxiety substance

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
use disorder and others

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,700
um and as this work advances

60
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,860
um they're more and more larger clinical

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,879
trials comparing it for example to uh

62
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,340
the standard treatments with ssris

63
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,760
with multiple studies suggesting that

64
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,440
psilocybin assisted Psychotherapy is at

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,500
least as effective as

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,440
the Lexapro kind of didn't care

67
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,840
all of this seems to suggest and the

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
timelines are kind of pointing at this

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,940
idea that

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
psilocybin treatment for major

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,180
depressive disorder maybe only a couple

72
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,800
of years away

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,440
um from becoming uh

74
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,659
approved as natural treatment in the

75
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,300
United States which

76
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,220
means that it's quite important for us

77
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,239
to understand what's going on

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,420
mechanistically in the brain so that

79
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,220
these kinds of treatments can be best

80
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,280
optimized best determines how to be used

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,239
um

82
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,379
yeah

83
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,340
or which kinds of

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,019
mental issues people might be having and

85
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,159
under what

86
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,500
kinds of treatment protocols we might

87
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,280
expect the most success I think

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,400
this will also ultimately hopefully lead

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,760
to the development of even better drugs

90
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,220
even better treatment protocols

91
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,099
um and much more personalized okay

92
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,199
so some of the basics of how these drugs

93
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,060
work on the brain for those who are

94
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,220
unfamiliar right so they're these are

95
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,440
the serous synergic psychedelics they

96
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,240
are search energy because they act as

97
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,000
agonists for a number of Serotonin

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,040
receptors in the brain and the central

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,560
nervous system more broadly

100
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,860
um it's thought that most specifically

101
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,040
uh these drugs like psilocybin work

102
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,240
through agonizing the serotonin

103
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,740
5-ht2a receptor

104
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,880
um

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,240
and this has been

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,520
demonstrated multiple times by using

107
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,220
blockers

108
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,040
antagonists of the 5ht2a receptor which

109
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,440
seemed to largely remove the effect of

110
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,139
psilocybin or other psychedelic drugs

111
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,320
and what this 2A receptor does when it's

112
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,020
agonized is it

113
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,100
excites the neuron making it more likely

114
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,080
to Fire and this is kind of essential to

115
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,539
some of the downstream effects

116
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,160
so given that

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,440
um it seems that this this 2A receptor

118
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,780
that psychedelics are mainly targeting

119
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,100
the question then become the school

120
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,620
where in the brain or these two a

121
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,000
receptors most widely expressed

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,460
and research has focused on I would say

123
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,100
three kind of key areas over the past

124
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,139
decade or so the first being the

125
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,880
thalamus which is a region involved in

126
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,460
the gating of sensory information into

127
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,919
the cortex there's a lot of expression

128
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,380
in the cortex itself

129
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,699
expression for example in the visual

130
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,380
system

131
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,300
which is perhaps not surprising given

132
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,520
the prevalence of visual hallucinations

133
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,060
and Technology use but therapeutically a

134
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,979
lot of focus has been on the prefrontal

135
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,020
cortex where there is also a dense

136
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,340
expression of these receptors and then

137
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,320
also more recent work has looked at the

138
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,460
claustrum which is a small brain region

139
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,620
responsible for coordinating the

140
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,440
transition dynamics of cortical

141
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,780
activation

142
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,880
and this too is likely of essential

143
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,800
importance to the Psychedelic effect

144
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,280
so kind of moving up one level of

145
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,340
abstraction to fmri studies there are a

146
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,620
few kind of like key takeaways

147
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,600
um which have I been identified from a

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,840
few different uh fmri studies looking at

149
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,080
um psychedelic use

150
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,520
um kind of the main theme has largely

151
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,560
been this idea of increased entropy or

152
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,100
increased complexity of the cortical

153
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,979
activation in the brain

154
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,340
um so there are various measures of this

155
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,160
um on the right here there's a figure of

156
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,720
one of the common measures of complexity

157
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,759
and

158
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,800
looking at various different kinds of

159
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,960
states that an individual might be in

160
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,960
and how that relates to complexity right

161
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,599
so you have individuals like vegetative

162
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,039
States

163
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,259
um or anesthetized anesthetized States

164
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,840
having relatively low brain activity

165
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,360
complexity you have individuals in awake

166
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,819
States like higher complexity and then

167
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,000
individuals who who have ingested either

168
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,819
psilocybin or LSD I'm showing the

169
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,080
highest brain complexity

170
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:45,180
now along with this uh rather than just

171
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,919
this kind of like single unified score

172
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,340
there's work looking particularly at the

173
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,020
changes in functional connectivity

174
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,580
between different brain regions or

175
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,680
different brain networks

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,280
um and the general Trend uh seems to be

177
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,380
that you have decreased within Network

178
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,000
functional connectivity and increase

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,919
between Network functional connectivity

180
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,380
right which this kind of can be

181
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,539
interpreted as different uh brain

182
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:10,740
networks which typically don't

183
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,419
communicate as much with each other more

184
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:13,740
likely to communicate with each other

185
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,860
ones you the effects of psychedelics

186
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,639
um

187
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,460
and the kind of like internal coherence

188
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,860
of networks uh is reduced under

189
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,720
psychedelics

190
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,500
um

191
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,720
people have maybe heard of this default

192
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,400
mode Network right which is responsible

193
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,620
for a lot of self-referential processing

194
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,320
which is responsible which is typically

195
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,299
activated for example when individuals

196
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,240
are off task

197
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,299
mind-wandering not like actively engaged

198
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,180
um the default mode network has been

199
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,700
kind of like consistently implicated in

200
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,800
being having less of this kind of like

201
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,899
within network connectivity less of this

202
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,000
functional integration

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,040
um and this has been hypothesized to be

204
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,580
one of the kind of key mechanisms of

205
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,500
the therapeutic effect of psychotics

206
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,279
in addition to looking at kind of like

207
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,200
brain network activity on a high level

208
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,500
uh you can then also zoom in much more

209
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,060
deeply and look at what's actually going

210
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,260
on

211
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,140
um at the neuron by neuron level or the

212
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,660
neuron connectivity level

213
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,620
um

214
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,200
here we see kind of very certain very

215
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,519
consistent

216
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,140
um story around this uh

217
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,860
psychoplastogenic effect to this

218
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,620
neuropathogenic effect where there are a

219
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,180
number of different markers of increased

220
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,940
plasticity in the brain so one that's

221
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,880
very common is this increased uh brain

222
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,420
derived neurotropic Factor

223
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,920
which we see hours after psychedelic use

224
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,000
um

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,040
for a variety of different uh

226
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,100
psychedelic drugs and this is then

227
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,760
accompanied a few hours later by visible

228
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,100
increases in the dendritic spine growth

229
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,399
in cortical pyramidal neurons so this is

230
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,180
both the number of dendritic spines and

231
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,700
the complexity of the spines so you can

232
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,980
see a very clear example of this here on

233
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,200
the right

234
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,260
where you have on the top the vehicle

235
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,740
and then the bottom to DMT treated uh

236
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,339
pyramidal neuron and the difference is

237
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,019
very very Stark you don't even have to

238
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,940
do any sort of um

239
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,519
actual computational analysis for it to

240
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,019
be clear that there's um quite

241
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,640
significant dendritic growth from a

242
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,720
single dosing

243
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,579
and the changes to functional

244
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,260
connectivity which I mentioned in the

245
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,940
previous slide

246
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,660
um tend to persist though in a less

247
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,019
extreme form than what we see during the

248
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,680
IQ effects

249
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,660
so the question then becomes given all

250
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,040
of this how can we attempt to tell a

251
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,740
consistent computational story what's

252
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,600
actually going on during both the acute

253
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,060
facts the post-acute effects and in

254
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,700
terms of the actual Downstream

255
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,660
therapeutic outcomes

256
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,720
so what's kind of been proposed

257
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,420
um as uh the one of the leading models

258
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,339
of this is the relaxed belief under

259
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,220
psychedelics model on the Rebus model of

260
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,560
Carhartt Harrison

261
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,079
um and so this Builds on the kind of

262
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,579
like active inference hierarchical

263
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,820
prediction processing uh framework where

264
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,800
we can understand the brain as the

265
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,220
series of predictors stacked kind of

266
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,740
like hierarchically along uh brain

267
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,420
Networks

268
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,160
um and

269
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,140
predictions are being made by higher

270
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,060
level Networks

271
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,279
um that are attempting to

272
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
uh predicts the errors of lower level

273
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
Networks

274
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,079
um

275
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,300
and the process of basically doing this

276
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,600
then produces this series of belief

277
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,640
Landscapes at different levels of spatio

278
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,040
temporal abstraction

279
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,060
um

280
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,160
and these belief Landscapes of course

281
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,459
can encode leaks with various levels of

282
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,079
precision

283
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,640
um and it's the modulation of this the

284
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,680
Precision of these beliefs which is

285
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,300
believed to take place under psychedelic

286
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,479
use

287
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,920
so here's kind of like a very high level

288
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,860
uh version of this three of this model

289
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,380
and how belief relaxation might actually

290
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,079
happen right so given that you have this

291
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,980
uh series of cortical networks which are

292
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,240
representing beliefs of different

293
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,480
spatial temporal scales we can

294
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,339
um kind of think of the thalamus as

295
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,079
being kind of like the entry point where

296
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,200
sensory information is being gated into

297
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,959
this hierarchical system and the

298
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,820
prefrontal cortex is being kind of like

299
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,620
one of the highest level networks right

300
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,380
which is then responsible for

301
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,540
um both representing the most abstract

302
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,839
kinds of beliefs as well as being kind

303
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,899
of the primary inhibiting force for all

304
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,459
of the downstream beliefs in the network

305
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,680
in the system

306
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,760
right so what is uh this had the agonism

307
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,040
of the 5ht2a receptor supposed to be

308
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,779
doing in this case

309
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,820
um well it's going to be decreasing the

310
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,760
prefrontal cortex's ability to make

311
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,680
coherence

312
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,540
um predictions and coherence

313
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,940
representations of belief which will

314
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,700
then disrupt its ability to inhibit

315
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,240
lower levels of the cortical hierarchy

316
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,940
at the same time by disrupt the this

317
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,339
activation of the

318
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,800
um salami or the destruction of Islamic

319
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,019
gating right is going to result in

320
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,700
additional sensory information entering

321
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,560
the cortex that wouldn't underwise onto

322
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,260
the cortex you have uh these kind of

323
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,779
disruptions at these two levels

324
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,800
um

325
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,120
which then results in uh beliefs being

326
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,720
uh spontaneously represented in ways

327
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,620
that they wouldn't normally be

328
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,980
represented and the Rebus model at least

329
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,579
um

330
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,399
is suggesting that this mainly is going

331
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,079
to manifest itself as a kind of

332
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,760
relaxation of these beliefs

333
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,779
so here is a kind of like very simple

334
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,500
diagram of what this might look like

335
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,959
um so you have some landscape of beliefs

336
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:40,680
here

337
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,180
and you can kind of interpret the

338
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,320
position along the uh the X and Y

339
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,660
or I'm going to see x and z believe in a

340
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,120
as being corresponding to some

341
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,560
particular belief that might be

342
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,680
represented by the network of this layer

343
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,740
or at this level of representation and

344
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,680
then the y-axis the height as being the

345
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,380
actual Precision of that belief right

346
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,000
um so here we have this kind of very

347
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,100
deep part on the right part of this

348
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,060
network or on this landscape and this

349
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,339
would be a very strongly represented

350
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,820
belief let's say

351
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,320
what the acute effects that psychedelics

352
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,519
have been understood to be doing right

353
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,620
is to be flattening the Sunscape to be

354
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,360
less strongly representing who strongly

355
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,579
represented beliefs to me making it

356
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,160
easier for the

357
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,680
um reversal of this landscape so to move

358
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,620
from uh one attractive state to another

359
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,600
attractive state

360
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,579
um

361
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,160
which is meant to be understood to be

362
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,260
kind of therapeutic in various ways

363
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,839
and then the post-acute effect being

364
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,600
some kind of return to normalcy but one

365
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,940
that is not totally complete one that

366
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,860
still incorporates some of these newly

367
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,660
relaxed beliefs these newly explored

368
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,079
beliefs

369
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,480
building on this Rebus model

370
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,660
um car and Harrison colleagues last year

371
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,980
proposed this canal model of

372
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,139
Psychopathology which basically kind of

373
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,540
takes the intuition that through

374
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,660
relaxation you know if the Revis model

375
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,899
is correct if the relaxation of beliefs

376
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,959
as a therapeutic outcome uh if you kind

377
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,820
of take that way of thinking to its

378
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,800
logical conclusion

379
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,040
um you might then uh propose something

380
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,260
like this which would say

381
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,060
um

382
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,060
if relaxing overly strong beliefs is

383
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,399
therapeutic then having overly strong

384
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,079
beliefs in the first place is

385
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,959
pathological in some kind of way

386
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,740
um and they refer to this uh

387
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,980
development to these overly strongly

388
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,920
represented beliefs as catalyzed beliefs

389
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,399
or and this problem generally is

390
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,199
canalization or this process of

391
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,380
developing them as analyzation and this

392
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,540
is the canal model of Psych pathology so

393
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,959
they kind of build on this idea uh this

394
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,880
you know set of previous work in the

395
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,740
literature suggesting that there may be

396
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,540
some primary factor of Psychopathology

397
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,640
and they suggest that this primary

398
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,740
factor is canalization

399
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,839
and in this work they discussed a number

400
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,400
of different

401
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,679
um psychopathologies which seem to quite

402
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,240
clearly fit this

403
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,880
um catalyzation type

404
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,020
um characterization so it's very

405
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,919
relatively straightforward I think to

406
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,120
understand things like addiction

407
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,059
depression anxiety disorders

408
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,320
obsessive-compulsive disorders all of

409
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,140
these involve in one way or another

410
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,260
having some strongly held beliefs

411
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,840
um typically negative negative beliefs

412
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,880
uh in the case of like depression

413
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,679
anxiety

414
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,179
um obsessive compulsive body image

415
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,919
disorder

416
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,780
um or in the case of you know substance

417
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,820
use disorder or some very strong beliefs

418
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,940
about what kind of behaviors should be

419
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,500
taken at any given time in any given

420
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,860
context

421
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,000
and then of course the effect of

422
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,960
psychedelics is to undo canalization

423
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,440
um and the better able any sort of

424
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,000
therapeutic intervention is to undue

425
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,940
canalization the more likely for a

426
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,140
positive therapeutic outcome

427
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,820
so I think this work has a lot of

428
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,460
strengths and there's a kind of Elegance

429
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,960
to it

430
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,780
um in our Canal's work that we had been

431
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,500
worked on

432
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,360
we kind of identify a couple of

433
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,299
limitations of this canal model and

434
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,640
attempt to extend and refine the model

435
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,919
in ways that I think ultimately make it

436
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,440
more powerful while kind of keeping the

437
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,200
the essential elegant Insight that

438
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,700
canalization is kind of like intimately

439
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,620
tied to like mythology

440
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,120
so the first kind of limitation I think

441
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,240
that we identify is that

442
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,340
um in the canal model it's very heavily

443
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,740
implied that all

444
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,080
uh forms of canalization are

445
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,900
pathological in one way or another

446
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,600
um and as I mentioned just now uh this

447
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,059
is clearly the case for a large Class A

448
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,000
very common psychopathologies

449
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
um it's when we start to look more

450
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,400
towards edge cases I think uh that these

451
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,140
exceptions start to problematize this

452
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,539
understanding right

453
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,299
um so if we consider Psychopathology is

454
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,440
such as bipolar borderline schizophrenia

455
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,059
depersonalization disorder

456
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:42,720
um

457
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,760
it becomes much more difficult to kind

458
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,500
of

459
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,539
easily classify these as simply problems

460
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,960
of overly strong priors in many cases

461
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,140
here we have problems of priors that are

462
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,360
not so strong or priors that seem to

463
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,640
drift over time in ways that are

464
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,640
problematic for both the individual and

465
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,440
uh the people that the individual are

466
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,480
close to

467
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,179
and if we think about psychedelics then

468
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,580
as being this kind of Panacea to undo

469
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,220
canalization and undo

470
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,980
um Psychopathology we also run into this

471
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,480
other issue which is that there are

472
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,360
certain kinds of psychopathologies which

473
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,220
are uh

474
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,640
typically uh

475
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,980
issues for use with psychedelics right

476
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,919
so schizophrenia being a very clear one

477
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,660
where there's evidence of psychedelic

478
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,419
use being a trigger for the onset of

479
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,340
psychosis and individuals who are

480
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,340
predisposed to schizophrenia

481
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,440
um there's also evidence of the

482
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,059
development of depersonalization

483
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,980
disorders with psychic with strong

484
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,419
psychedelic use

485
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,940
and this is not what we would expect if

486
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,799
psychedelics were simply

487
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,120
um

488
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,179
universally undoing uh

489
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,299
or getting rid of psychopathologies

490
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,539
there's also this idea which I think

491
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,160
Adam is going to develop quite a bit

492
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,020
later that

493
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,620
um

494
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,140
the stability of beliefs are is

495
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,640
typically correlated with positive

496
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,559
mental health outcomes not negative ones

497
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,679
and what is a stable belief if not one

498
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,840
that is highly penalized in some kind of

499
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,760
meaningful sense within within the

500
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,940
system

501
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,820
foreign

502
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,140
limitation is that

503
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,320
if you think about an actual dynamical

504
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,380
system one that uh

505
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,240
is parametrized in some kind of

506
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,679
meaningful way like a brain you know

507
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,240
which is parametrized by synaptic

508
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,659
connections and then instantiates uh

509
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,900
neural activity patterns over time and

510
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,039
we think about what kinds of

511
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:51,600
optimization Landscapes are actually

512
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,140
being induced by inside the system

513
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,200
uh we find that there's not just one

514
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,600
kind of catalyzation there's actually

515
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,360
two kinds of catalyzation

516
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,780
um and in our deep canals work we

517
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,820
attempt to kind of take inspiration from

518
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,020
Deep learning literature to tease apart

519
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,580
these two kinds of penalization and

520
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,100
understand them a bit more clearly

521
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,000
um

522
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,760
and they are just to kind of give a

523
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,799
a preview these two different things

524
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,799
overfitting in plasticity loss

525
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,059
um so overfitting is the problem uh

526
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,760
you have your catalyzed in a particular

527
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,419
kind of way and whatever sort of

528
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,580
policy you've learned whatever sort of

529
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,320
extent beliefs you have these don't

530
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,600
generalize to some other context during

531
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,159
context a

532
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,740
you may be very well adapted you move to

533
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,780
context B and whatever you've learned

534
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,620
doesn't apply there

535
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,059
then plasticity loss is a little bit

536
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:54,960
different

537
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,539
um elasticity loss has to do with one's

538
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,580
not one's ability to generalize for

539
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,700
other one's ability to adapt or to learn

540
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,460
so imagine you're in context a you may

541
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,400
or may not be well adapted to context a

542
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,799
if you move to context B the question

543
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,919
becomes are you able to adapt to contact

544
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,620
speed or not not are you immediately

545
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,159
already ready to deal with context B but

546
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,740
given time in context B can you learn

547
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,100
and change

548
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,220
and we use a very simple recurrent

549
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,600
neural network model to kind of make

550
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,340
sense of this

551
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,799
and I think this is important because

552
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,179
there can be different kinds of

553
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,539
canalization on these different kinds of

554
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,919
optimization Landscapes and these have

555
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:46,140
unique implications for the treatment of

556
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,460
psychopathology

557
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,659
and I think uh even more importantly

558
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,559
psychedelics work on these different

559
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,840
landscapes in different ways and so

560
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,320
understanding how they work uh is

561
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,840
essential to developing

562
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,240
better drugs better treatment protocols

563
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,500
and more personalized treatment

564
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,539
Okay so

565
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,919
what are these two optimization

566
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,240
Landscapes how can we make sense of them

567
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,860
this is kind of like the big overview

568
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,100
figure of the deep canals work

569
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,059
um

570
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,919
so we kind of start with this intuition

571
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,780
of our current neural network right and

572
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,280
in a recurrent neural network there are

573
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,600
these kind of twos there are these two

574
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,159
sets of parameters so you have at any

575
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,500
given time you have the actual weights

576
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,460
of the network

577
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,580
and then you have the hidden activation

578
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,620
of the network right and so the weights

579
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,900
of the network are data and the hidden

580
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,539
activation is H and there's some input

581
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,720
into the network at any given time step

582
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,179
um and then the output of the network is

583
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,880
a function of both the input and the

584
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,980
hidden State and the hidden state is

585
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,840
updated at every time the hidden

586
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,120
activation pattern

587
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,280
great and this gives us essentially

588
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,280
these two different Landscapes uh one

589
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,840
what we refer to as the inference

590
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,640
landscape or the type a landscape and

591
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,900
this is equivalent to the neural

592
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,880
activation pattern of a brain at any

593
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,620
time right so what gets read off from an

594
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,620
fmri what gets read off from the EEG is

595
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,200
going to correspond to this activity

596
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,840
landscape

597
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,460
but uh kind of like underlying or

598
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,559
supporting this activity landscape is

599
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,480
this other more fundamental landscape

600
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,799
which is the actual optimization

601
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,320
landscape that is induced by the

602
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,320
synaptic weights themselves

603
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,640
and this is what is the result of uh

604
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,500
right like synaptic connectivity in the

605
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,020
brain between all the sets of neurons in

606
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,760
the brain this is what is changing when

607
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,860
we have various forms of like heavy and

608
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,679
plasticity heavy and learning

609
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,659
um

610
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,919
and this is what kind of like

611
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,179
instantiates the possible sex of neural

612
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,940
activity patterns right so this is kind

613
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,320
of like a way we can start to understand

614
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,179
this

615
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,860
um

616
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,980
which is when we think about belief

617
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,140
Landscapes right as I mentioned before

618
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,360
you know here's a very simple diagram

619
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,980
where we have a two-dimensional belief

620
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,279
landscape and let's say there's uh you

621
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,140
know someone who's depressed or

622
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,900
potentially depressed and they might

623
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,059
have a negative self-image you know I'm

624
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,760
a terrible person I I can't do anything

625
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,980
right something like this this would be

626
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,039
encoded as a particular position in this

627
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,960
belief landscape

628
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,220
um you know where the neural activity

629
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,980
pattern looks like this this belief is

630
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,440
what gets expressed right

631
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,220
um

632
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,500
and there's another you know set of

633
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,880
neural activity patterns which would

634
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,620
correspond to a positive self-image and

635
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,179
positive self belief you know I'm great

636
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,179
I'm wonderful or even just I'm okay I'm

637
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,760
totally acceptable as a person

638
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,320
um and this would be a different set of

639
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,240
patterns

640
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,260
so uh based on the synaptic the actual

641
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,059
connectivity structure of the brain

642
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,400
right uh these two patterns May or be

643
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,919
maybe more or less likely so here these

644
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,900
are being represented by these uh two

645
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,279
different

646
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,480
um sets uh neural activation Landscapes

647
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,980
which are the result of two different

648
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,720
positions in the synaptic weight

649
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,100
landscape space and in this top space

650
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,559
um the one that's in the middle here

651
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,779
uh that then is represented here at the

652
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:28,320
top of uh part C of the figure we see

653
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,140
that there's very high Precision

654
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,140
assigned to or very high likelihood

655
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,260
assigned to the negative self-image

656
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,140
and very low likelihood here assigned to

657
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,080
the positive self-image

658
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,980
but in some other part of the uh

659
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,200
synaptic weight landscape a very

660
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,760
different kind of neural activity

661
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,980
landscape might be instantiated

662
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,500
um and this one kind of has the inverse

663
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,140
properties where negative self-image is

664
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,720
unlikely and positive self-image is much

665
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,340
more likely

666
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,279
um so we can kind of then understand

667
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,559
positions in the neural activity

668
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,299
landscape is kind of corresponding to

669
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,940
specific phenomenological experiential

670
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,159
instantiations of certain kinds of

671
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,900
beliefs right so like the actual

672
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,640
experience of

673
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,860
uh holding a negative supplement or

674
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,740
holding a positive self-image

675
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,799
and we can understand positions in the

676
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,720
synaptic weight landscape as being

677
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,279
something more General so in the case of

678
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,779
depression

679
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,460
um there might be a specific set of

680
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,880
synaptic weight connectivity which would

681
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,179
correspond to what you might call you

682
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:40,679
know a depressed individual someone who

683
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,120
might qualify as having a major

684
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,279
depressive disorder and another set of

685
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,500
synoptic weights connectivity pattern

686
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,320
that wouldn't qualify as that way

687
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,460
okay so before I get into this

688
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,400
psychedelic uh oh psychedelics relate to

689
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,500
this um I think Adam is going to talk a

690
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,419
little bit about

691
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,700
um some work he's done extending the

692
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,419
Rebus model

693
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,460
hello

694
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,000
so yeah I've been uh

695
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,880
thinking about this a while and then

696
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,299
along the way I met Arthur who also has

697
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,760
been thinking about this a while but in

698
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,860
different ways and so

699
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,760
um uh like Arthur's background isn't

700
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,279
um basically Consciousness science and a

701
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,159
very uh peculiar uh field of

702
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,020
computational Consciousness science in

703
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,299
terms of actual models of what it would

704
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,179
be to have a conscious system uh even

705
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:55,559
potentially an artificially conscious

706
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,659
system and so

707
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,600
um I'm coming from more free energy

708
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,980
principle and active inference my

709
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,320
background and Arthur's coming from more

710
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,539
mainstream machine learning and so we

711
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:10,500
we're coming together to explore uh this

712
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,140
beast from different perspectives and

713
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,120
been finding a lot of uh

714
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,760
I think very interesting overlaps

715
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,820
and so uh in terms of Albus the basic

716
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,340
idea is to take Rebus

717
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,659
um and expand on it we I love Rebus it's

718
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,100
a great framework

719
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,020
um and I'm I've been trying to make it I

720
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,080
guess more flexible in terms of being

721
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,580
able to handle like a wider range of

722
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,559
assumptions so not just talking about

723
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,960
relaxed beliefs but also potentially

724
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,159
strengthen beliefs in different

725
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,240
combinations

726
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,520
uh this was always part of the Rebus

727
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,380
framework and that you can have all

728
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,000
sorts of both direct and indirect

729
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,399
effects when you're dealing with a large

730
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,799
predictive hierarchy or any you know

731
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,779
complex system you change something in

732
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,220
one way but then you'll get an effect

733
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,140
elsewhere so if you have this hierarchy

734
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,059
of predictions for instance you can

735
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,120
potentially relax beliefs at higher

736
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,980
levels and that can indirectly cause

737
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,500
strength and beliefs at lower levels so

738
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,539
you can both get relaxed and strengthen

739
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,039
beliefs in psychedelics in all sorts of

740
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,539
different combinations

741
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,159
and so

742
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:14,820
um

743
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,700
with Albus the idea is um so I've been

744
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,039
calling uh as opposed to a belief

745
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:23,100
relaxation when you get this sort of

746
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,399
um basically a bottom right here you

747
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,279
might see it so this red would be

748
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,120
basically uh a something like a

749
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,020
synchronized complex of neural activity

750
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,820
um and potentially you've often

751
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,700
involving the thalamus which would be

752
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,200
thought to encode your predictions or

753
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,620
your top-down stream of priors which

754
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,120
then are suppressing the ascending

755
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,039
stream prediction errors

756
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,440
um and so under Rebus you're seeing here

757
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,000
uh relaxed predictions a smaller uh

758
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,700
complex of synchronized activity and the

759
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,200
gates are down just like Arthur

760
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,600
described more things are coming in

761
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,919
Rebus will sometimes be described in

762
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,760
terms of uh so when we're talking about

763
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,520
Rebus this idea of relaxing beliefs

764
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,220
we're thinking at the um functional or

765
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,860
computational level so like David Myers

766
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,840
and analyzing the mind you have these

767
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,000
three I suppose uh supervenient levels

768
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,220
out there compatible and synergistic so

769
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,679
computational functional

770
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,659
um like abstractly what is the system

771
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,059
doing uh something like the pseudocode

772
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,220
of the system and then implementational

773
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,960
mechanistically how's realized and then

774
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,820
in the middle some sort of algorithm

775
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,740
algorithmic intermediate abstraction

776
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,779
layer how are these computations

777
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,580
realized via these mechanisms some

778
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,860
bridging principle description

779
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,559
and so when it comes to Rebus

780
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,120
um you can adopt it in different ways

781
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,740
and relate to it differently so you can

782
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,960
relate to it at the functional level

783
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,820
um or you can relate to it at the

784
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,220
algorithmic or implementational levels

785
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,260
um in terms of where you're taking the

786
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,600
account so for instance uh you might

787
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,340
think something like Rebus effects is a

788
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,559
very valuable model of something like

789
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,179
what they call Quantum change with

790
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,159
psychedelics but you don't necessarily

791
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,020
believe in predictive processing but you

792
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,399
still might be you could say like a

793
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,340
Revis type theorist or you might be

794
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,260
thinking in terms of like Rebus like in

795
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,539
a more narrow sense of thinking of uh

796
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,480
predictive processing information flows

797
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,220
um but then when you get to like the

798
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,380
overall person and integrated organism

799
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,940
and the agent uh you might have

800
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,100
different interpretations there

801
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,740
um so with the work with Albus basically

802
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,940
the idea would be to take predictive

803
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,240
processing and to and models of

804
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,460
psychedelic action and suggest that

805
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,600
sometimes

806
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,240
um not only uh do we have these

807
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,740
relaxational belief Landscapes but we

808
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,940
might have the opposite of strengthening

809
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,460
and so specifically if you're activating

810
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,159
these five HD 2A neurons which would be

811
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,500
at the deeper levels of the cortical

812
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,960
sheet and also the deeper levels of the

813
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,640
cortical hierarchy more inwards and

814
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,440
higher up and these will be the Unice

815
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,559
Loop of the thalamus and thereby be able

816
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,600
to form large synchronous integrated

817
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,399
complexes

818
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:06,659
um but then when you excite them too

819
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:07,980
much they don't wait for each other to

820
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,219
sync up they fire or whenever they can

821
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,379
how to sink and this relaxes a belief

822
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,359
landscape however

823
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,159
it's not clear this should happen the

824
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,260
whole way through for any amount of

825
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,960
increasing the gain on these neurons So

826
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,060
in theory just increasing the gain a

827
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,940
little bit unless uh that might help

828
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,800
them to sync up that might strengthen

829
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,080
the belief whether it's a situationally

830
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,760
specific suggestion of you in this

831
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,159
context or maybe something old coming to

832
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,080
the surface and uh if you will

833
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,060
manifesting

834
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,339
um so Albus basically in a nutshell

835
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,659
would be saying

836
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,060
um to take Rebus and keep going with it

837
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,839
and look for different combinations of

838
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:52,139
both strengthened both directly and

839
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,480
indirectly strengthened and relaxed

840
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,859
beliefs

841
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:58,260
that's basically it and so I'm not going

842
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,119
to go into too many more details Arthur

843
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,740
and I just submitted this uh for

844
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,140
publication uh wish us luck hopefully

845
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,080
the reviewers will be useful

846
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,380
um maybe even kind but preferably useful

847
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,040
and um yeah I'll kick it back to Arthur

848
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,660
but before I do

849
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,420
um like this work uh

850
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,820
I think it's immensely important that we

851
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,760
get these details right these are

852
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,680
um extremely powerful medicines that

853
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,119
could revolutionize things or we could

854
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,280
have a backlash if we do it wrong if

855
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,260
we're careless if we

856
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,780
um don't see the risks but also if we're

857
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,720
overly beholden to like a single way of

858
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,180
viewing things prematurely we might also

859
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,040
miss opportunities to help

860
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,320
potentially enormous opportunities for

861
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,700
instance like you might not think of

862
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,260
helping people

863
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,060
um like look for instance micro dosing

864
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,700
for cognitive decline you might not have

865
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,079
thought of that

866
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,640
um and that might be a really big deal

867
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,780
that you do think of them so uh I guess

868
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,160
before going back to Arthur one more

869
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,520
thing would be just in terms of uh

870
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,900
at least for me like experientially like

871
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,359
the way I sometimes think of it as like

872
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,480
um with relation to well-being and uh

873
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,740
suffering

874
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,880
um

875
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,280
both things matter like the strength and

876
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,720
the strength of your positive beliefs

877
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,000
and the strength of your negative

878
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,140
beliefs and sometimes the negative

879
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,640
beliefs have positive aspects and vice

880
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,280
versa so it's it's both like you might

881
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,960
relax your beliefs and like after he's

882
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,119
like a Harry Potter metaphor like be

883
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,680
someone like out of it so much out of

884
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,599
the grip of the Dementors that usually

885
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:33,359
uh that under some circumstances might

886
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,400
be pursuing you that you have room to be

887
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,680
different to become different uh to

888
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,300
think different things under this

889
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,859
different state

890
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,260
um but additionally and not

891
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,180
um mutually exclusively not necessarily

892
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,880
in compatibly maybe synergistically the

893
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,099
strength of what beliefs you're able to

894
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,500
have in that moment and maybe draw upon

895
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,260
from the past could be deeply important

896
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,180
uh your values the kinds of beliefs that

897
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,400
you call upon in times of need and that

898
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,900
give you hope

899
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,160
um maybe those are just originally

900
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,480
suggested to you right there in the

901
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,280
session but maybe there's something else

902
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,280
another belief in that strengthening it

903
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,440
could be a good thing and even without a

904
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,839
clinical context like microdosers for

905
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,760
instance it's not clear they're exactly

906
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,079
they're trying to relax their beliefs

907
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,180
like the range of use cases the way we

908
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,440
want to relate them how we want to be in

909
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,700
the world

910
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,300
um

911
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,500
it seems complicated to me so I will

912
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,420
get back to Arthur

913
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,400
yeah thanks so much Adam

914
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,920
so with that context with all this uh I

915
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,839
want to talk a little bit about how we

916
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,320
might understand uh at a very high level

917
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,520
um

918
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,859
what psychedelics are doing to these two

919
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,079
uh Elite landscapes

920
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,420
so before I showed you very quickly I

921
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,520
guess I can go back to it

922
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,900
um in the Rebus model you know there's

923
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,060
only one type of optimization landscape

924
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,400
uh and so there's only one type of uh

925
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,220
canalization and what is you know

926
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,960
supposed to be happening is a relaxation

927
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,820
of beliefs

928
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,680
um which is strong during the acute

929
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,900
effect and persists in the post-acute

930
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,000
effect

931
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,940
so with uh Elvis though we might be able

932
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,380
to think about all of this a little bit

933
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,000
differently

934
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,540
um we can in during the acute effects of

935
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,220
psychedelics interpret what's happening

936
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,619
to the type a landscape as being less of

937
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:34,020
the kind of universal relaxation and

938
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,119
more of a kind of destabilization where

939
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,339
under certain circumstances beliefs are

940
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,320
being strengthened other beliefs are

941
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,859
being relaxed this is uh changing quite

942
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:48,060
rapidly over the course of time so you

943
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,060
know a certain belief may be

944
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,500
transiently strengthened a few minutes

945
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,020
later it may no longer be supported or

946
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,579
supportable

947
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:57,780
um

948
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,180
and this actually functionally you know

949
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,760
enables a kind of exploration of all the

950
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,000
POS of a wide space of belief

951
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
instantiations during the acute effects

952
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,140
of the drug

953
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,940
um

954
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,859
the uh as far as the inference landscape

955
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,780
is concerned you know post-acute effects

956
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,000
as Adam was saying it could be the fact

957
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,920
that certain positive beliefs are

958
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,260
explored and can be strengthened

959
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,119
um other negative beliefs might be

960
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,480
weakened this is kind of like the ideal

961
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,800
psychotherapeutic outcome

962
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,820
um

963
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,859
it may be you know on average if it's

964
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:33,359
something like a relaxation a general

965
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,119
relaxation of beliefs is uh what you

966
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,460
might see but the way that you get there

967
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,400
is likely going to be through a kind of

968
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,220
much more complicated process

969
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,320
I think what's that interesting and

970
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,359
related to also to what Adam said about

971
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,700
uh thinking much more broadly about how

972
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,380
psychedelics might be used in terms of

973
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,180
neurocognitive disorders in addition to

974
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,020
kind of like traditional

975
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,000
psychopathologies

976
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,339
um is to think about what's happening to

977
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:01,920
the the learning landscape the kind of

978
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,300
like underlying synaptic weight

979
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,240
landscape and what do we understand is

980
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,880
happening here kind of quite clearly is

981
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,839
there is uh neurogenesis

982
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,040
psychoplastogenic facts um there's

983
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,900
dendritic growth and what is this

984
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,880
enabling well this is enabling uh

985
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,700
greater connectivity between within and

986
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,560
in between networks

987
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,280
um

988
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,240
and so kind of from a functional uh

989
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,339
learning perspective learning theory

990
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:32,099
perspective what this means uh is that

991
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,380
gradient information can flow more

992
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,240
easily through these networks

993
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,440
um and what this means is that it's

994
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,119
easier to get from one part of the

995
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,380
network to the other part of the network

996
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,839
there are fewer of these kind of

997
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,119
optimization

998
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,079
uh local

999
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,420
um Minima there are fewer of these kind

1000
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,820
of like tricky saddle points

1001
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,040
um and what this means kind of like

1002
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,599
functionally is that this plasticity

1003
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,880
loss that I discussed earlier is going

1004
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,220
to be less of an issue

1005
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,140
and here it seems to be kind of like

1006
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,140
regardless of the acute uh the actual

1007
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,140
phenomenological effects uh you know

1008
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,180
there are very strong Downstream effects

1009
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,680
on uh this structural connectivity and I

1010
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,700
think

1011
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,839
um you know there's some interesting

1012
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,880
work suggesting that there may actually

1013
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,520
be independent mechanisms

1014
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,020
um that are affecting these two

1015
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,339
Landscapes so there's a reason we're

1016
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:25,920
suggesting for example that uh

1017
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,040
psychedelics as well as ketamine is able

1018
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,320
to kind of like particularly bind to

1019
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,560
receptors in the brain that produce that

1020
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,359
are results in the kind of release of

1021
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,820
the brain derived neurotropic factor and

1022
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,579
then the downstream changes in synaptic

1023
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:44,520
weighting and that this may be uh

1024
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,440
potentially totally independent of the

1025
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,200
5hc2a agonism right

1026
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,400
um

1027
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,900
and this has very interesting

1028
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,940
implications for future drug design and

1029
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,359
development

1030
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,859
okay so I'm going to before my next

1031
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:01,260
slide turn it over to Adam once more uh

1032
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,540
to briefly talk a bit about

1033
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,200
um

1034
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,060
personality theory and the relationship

1035
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,640
between uh psychedelics and personality

1036
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,859
hello again

1037
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,640
so um

1038
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,740
so for the past few years I've been

1039
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,440
doing some work with a personality

1040
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,440
researcher Colin De Young

1041
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,900
on intersections between the way agency

1042
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,359
is modeled in the free energy principle

1043
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,400
and active inference framework and the

1044
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,040
way that persons are considered in

1045
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,839
different situations and personality

1046
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:38,160
science and looking for points of

1047
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,440
intersection and so

1048
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,500
um you know it's personally personality

1049
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,119
is actually an extremely deep concept

1050
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,640
and if you think of it it's

1051
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,260
um I guess we call it like the normal

1052
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,859
form of a system in terms of it's uh

1053
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:54,780
what is the way you can describe the

1054
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,520
most of the system

1055
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,200
um with like the minimal message length

1056
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,579
the

1057
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,040
um account for the most with the least

1058
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,660
and what we're trying to account for is

1059
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,819
the states that people tend to occupy

1060
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,500
people aren't always happy people aren't

1061
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,500
always sad people aren't always you know

1062
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,119
friendly they're not always angry it's

1063
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,619
all sorts of things that are there

1064
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:14,760
there's a range that people are

1065
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,619
encountering but there's they tend to

1066
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,720
occupy some states more than others and

1067
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,099
you might call that the person their

1068
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:22,079
personality and you might call that the

1069
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,579
person many systems would have their own

1070
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:24,780
Personalities in terms of trying to

1071
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,540
describe uh something with their essence

1072
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,900
and so uh they're attracting States

1073
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,020
and so with uh Colin the Young's work

1074
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,960
um he interprets personality and these

1075
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,000
um major domains of Personality that

1076
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,060
people have discovered uh a reliable

1077
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,160
Factor structure ways you can Funk the

1078
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,520
variance uh the big five as a trade

1079
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,319
hierarchy but where these different

1080
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:52,020
traits are interpreted as cybernetic

1081
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,140
control parameters uh specifically

1082
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,339
cybernetics in terms of the study of

1083
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,680
goal seeking systems governed by various

1084
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,020
forms of feedback that different stages

1085
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,680
of uh the process of pursuing goals uh

1086
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,200
evaluating outcomes updating

1087
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,680
um that and you understanding that

1088
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,140
basically the personality as different

1089
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,640
modes of being in the world for

1090
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,140
cybernetic systems interpreting them as

1091
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,839
parameters for goal Pursuit because we

1092
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,819
are goal seeking systems trying to

1093
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,460
pursue the goals we value

1094
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,359
um

1095
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:25,920
and so

1096
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,220
I guess moving to this the and with

1097
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,680
relation we're talking about now both in

1098
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,180
terms of Personality formation

1099
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,800
reformation and the structure of

1100
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,540
Personality

1101
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,200
um

1102
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,359
the piece so

1103
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,599
okay to get to the P Factor uh

1104
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,200
within personality theory this big five

1105
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,240
traits the set of big five traits

1106
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,480
there's a uh richer or more detailed uh

1107
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,160
Factor structure

1108
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,260
um a hierarchical uh structure for

1109
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,119
personality that's been discovered

1110
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,599
um so above the big five neuroticism

1111
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,280
agreeableness conscientiousness

1112
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,440
you'll have a metatrase of their shared

1113
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,940
varias that's observed called stability

1114
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,099
it's also been called Alpha by think

1115
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:09,599
digmin

1116
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,240
um and then above the traits of

1117
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,220
extroversion and openness intellect you

1118
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,619
have this metatrade of plasticity

1119
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:21,000
and um are called beta and

1120
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,339
the shared variance of these two

1121
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:25,619
so what's interesting is that within uh

1122
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:27,480
this field of

1123
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,760
um within high top which is this effort

1124
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,000
to try to characterize Psychopathology

1125
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,800
using the same kind of data-driven

1126
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,099
methods and personality science a

1127
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,740
principled account of the structure of

1128
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,240
Psychopathology the way that personality

1129
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,740
has a structure you're trying to account

1130
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,040
for this there seems to be a common

1131
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,160
factor across many forms of

1132
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,660
Psychopathology that's referred to as

1133
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,640
the P factor and it tends to be the

1134
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,500
inverse of stability it's high

1135
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,940
neuroticism

1136
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,579
uh low agreeableness and low

1137
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:02,099
conscientiousness and this is actually

1138
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,260
uh

1139
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,099
uh what's referred to in the article

1140
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,119
um as

1141
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,480
um this P Factor

1142
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,300
thinking of it as a lack of flexibility

1143
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,560
you could make a case for it but more

1144
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,780
straightforwardly it seems to be a lack

1145
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,640
of stability for something to be a lack

1146
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,980
of flexibility you would maybe be

1147
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,960
thinking of something more like uh

1148
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,880
plasticity like someone having low

1149
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,220
plasticity but empirically that's not

1150
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,200
what's observed and so empirically

1151
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,420
that's not what's observed that's a very

1152
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,640
important detail we should stop and take

1153
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,060
note of so you might say that um rather

1154
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,800
than emphasizing the first principle

1155
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,359
component of Psychopathology it's

1156
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:45,359
possible that this canal models is

1157
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,819
actually focusing on the second Factor

1158
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:50,180
um it's not you know it's not a contest

1159
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,400
it's still enormously a big factor like

1160
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,380
the work of Stephen Hayes and others

1161
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,000
showing like a lack of flexibility is

1162
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,119
trans diagnostic but just empirically

1163
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,920
speaking the first principle component

1164
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,319
of Psychopathology might be more closely

1165
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,280
related to a lack of stability rather

1166
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,040
than insufficient plasticity

1167
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,900
yeah

1168
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,180
um well I guess one more thing to think

1169
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,740
of in terms of stability and plasticity

1170
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,920
like as I said it's not like a it's not

1171
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,680
exactly a contest uh they're um they're

1172
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,940
both important both need to be

1173
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,200
considered and they're deeply

1174
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,420
interrelated so Colin describes them as

1175
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,619
being in a state of something like

1176
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:31,079
Dynamic tension like if you're

1177
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:34,079
insufficiently uh plastic and then

1178
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,700
flexible you're not going to stay stable

1179
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,040
for long in a changing world uh but if

1180
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,480
you don't have a stable base to move

1181
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,700
from uh it's going to be hard to be

1182
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,560
plastic and reconfigure yourself in a

1183
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,540
sustainable way either however you can

1184
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,880
also see someone being over um overly

1185
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,680
rigid and excessive stability in a way

1186
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,900
that undermines their plasticity or

1187
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,599
overly flexible in a way that basically

1188
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:57,119
is destabilizing so a dynamic tension

1189
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,440
but involving synergies also and I think

1190
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,940
in terms of the structure of personality

1191
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,099
and well-being this is what we need to

1192
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,140
keep in mind that both are needed

1193
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,160
stability and plasticity and this is uh

1194
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,540
also just within um

1195
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,000
it's actually what this was inspired I

1196
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,400
think of in Collins thinking to consider

1197
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,140
these metatrades this way uh from

1198
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:19,980
machine learning I think actually

1199
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,839
reading grossberg and stability

1200
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,119
plasticity trade-offs and that's why he

1201
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:25,500
interpreted these meta traits in those

1202
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,359
terms uh so I guess one more thing is uh

1203
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,099
um

1204
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,500
there's a petersonian backstory here

1205
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,700
they don't know if I want to get into

1206
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,099
but we can discuss it later if there's

1207
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:41,339
interest so

1208
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,859
yeah back to Arthur

1209
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,819
that was great thanks Adam

1210
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,640
yeah very very helpful context which

1211
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,500
should hopefully make uh this slide here

1212
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,319
much more clear to everyone

1213
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,480
um

1214
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,060
so given these kind of like two meta

1215
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,400
traits uh stability and plasticity which

1216
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,079
as Adam you know beautifully described

1217
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,760
her in this kind of like Dynamic tension

1218
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,380
with one another

1219
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,040
um

1220
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,020
we can kind of go back to these two

1221
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,359
optimization Landscapes and these

1222
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,619
machine learning Concepts that I

1223
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,180
discussed earlier and kind of try to

1224
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,619
understand how these things might all

1225
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,619
relate and ultimately you know relate to

1226
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:24,060
psychopathology

1227
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,819
so I had hinted before that they're

1228
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,020
um

1229
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,700
were these kind of two types of

1230
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,040
canalization we might say one being

1231
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,339
overfitting and another being plasticity

1232
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,560
loss and we can interpret these as kind

1233
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,619
of like being extremes uh that kind of

1234
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:43,319
like analyzed end of uh how these two

1235
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:45,060
optimization Landscapes might manifest

1236
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,400
so in the type a in-print landscape this

1237
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,800
looks like overfitting on one end

1238
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,800
heavy canalization and underfitting on

1239
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,420
the other end in machine learning

1240
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,619
context right so overfitting being uh

1241
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:01,260
having very strong rigid beliefs that

1242
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,000
are in a particular environmental

1243
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,520
context adaptive that are very unlikely

1244
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,460
to be adopted in any other context

1245
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,560
underfitting being having a set of

1246
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,619
beliefs which are not adapted to the

1247
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,480
current context and also unlikely to be

1248
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,839
adapted to any other context awesome as

1249
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,940
far as stability is concerned I I think

1250
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,800
we can understand stability this

1251
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,839
metatrader is kind of representing the

1252
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,480
balance of these two things right you

1253
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,940
have high stability when you are an

1254
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,440
either

1255
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,180
um overfits to a particular contact

1256
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,160
store underfit

1257
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,140
um so this means you're well fit to this

1258
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,760
context that you're right now and you're

1259
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,859
also likely the wealth that's other

1260
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:42,780
future context

1261
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,640
um I think this is also in complexity

1262
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,380
science sometimes described as meta

1263
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,700
stability right

1264
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,740
um so you're in a stable Point that'll

1265
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,480
also likely be able to take you to other

1266
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,280
stable points in the future

1267
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,680
and this kind of like ability to stay

1268
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,260
stable over time is then uh stability

1269
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,079
metatrade

1270
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:04,020
we uh can then look at the type B the

1271
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,700
learning landscape where the kind of

1272
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,619
extreme version of canalization is this

1273
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:09,059
plasticity loss where it's very

1274
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:12,059
difficult to adapt to new contacts

1275
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:12,900
um

1276
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,780
the inverse of this is then catastrophic

1277
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,700
forgetting where the problem is not one

1278
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,619
of adapted to new context the problem is

1279
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:22,079
one of meaningfully retaining adaptive

1280
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,880
strategies and beliefs from previous

1281
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,619
contexts

1282
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:26,700
um

1283
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,099
and so obviously you know neither of

1284
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,740
these are desirable

1285
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,460
um

1286
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,079
what is desirable is some kind of

1287
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,940
balance between these two right where

1288
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,920
one is able to adapt just enough to new

1289
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,760
contacts without being uh

1290
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,980
without forgetting previously learned

1291
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,819
things

1292
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:47,700
but here the relationship uh to the

1293
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,140
metatrade of plasticity is a bit

1294
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,180
different than stability right so as it

1295
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,460
is being represented on this crop

1296
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,020
um you know the more plastic you are

1297
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,880
basically the less analyzed you are in

1298
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,319
this space the more easy it is to move

1299
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,220
around

1300
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,839
um but actually extreme versions of this

1301
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:02,760
end up manifesting is catastrophic

1302
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,440
forgetting police in the machine

1303
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,119
learning context

1304
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:08,339
um and I think this in particular has

1305
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:10,680
relevance for

1306
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,520
um

1307
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,059
psych pathology and relevance for this

1308
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:18,180
idea maybe complicates this idea right

1309
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,520
that uh

1310
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,740
psychedelic therapy

1311
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,559
is uh in and of itself likely to always

1312
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,540
lead to positive outcomes

1313
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,980
okay and we can attempt to understand

1314
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,480
this by uh making an effort at trying to

1315
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,339
map or understand

1316
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:43,380
um various forms of Psychopathology in

1317
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,700
the context of these two different

1318
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,500
learning Landscapes

1319
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,940
um and so before I get into this too

1320
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,460
much I think it's important to say that

1321
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,260
um this is very much a kind of like

1322
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,960
preliminary and provisional attempt at

1323
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,880
making sense of these things

1324
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,980
um I hope that this is kind of the start

1325
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,020
of a

1326
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,420
a much more fleshed dialogue looking at

1327
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,500
how we can kind of understand

1328
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,240
Psychopathology with respect to machine

1329
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,859
learning Concepts

1330
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:09,900
um but I think this at least gives like

1331
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,359
a good starting point for maybe trying

1332
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,880
to understand where and why

1333
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,160
um psychedelic therapy is useful isn't

1334
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,599
useful

1335
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,660
um

1336
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,640
which is a bit more nuanced than the

1337
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,800
simple idea of like Psychopathology

1338
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,839
means canalization and psychedelic

1339
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,520
therapy means reducing canalization

1340
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,380
right

1341
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,960
okay so let's uh try to make sense of

1342
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,160
this a little bit

1343
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,099
though for the kind of classic set of

1344
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:40,380
Psychopathology is for which there has

1345
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,240
been a lot of great research done with

1346
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,160
psychedelic therapy and a lot of clear

1347
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,200
benefit has been seen

1348
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,819
um I think you we can kind of class

1349
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:50,040
these within this upper left-hand corner

1350
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,859
here where these are disorders of both

1351
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:55,559
overfitting which means in the moment

1352
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,839
over the strong beliefs get represented

1353
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,579
you know these are strong attractor

1354
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:01,980
points in the neural activation

1355
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,900
landscape

1356
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,359
um and

1357
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:09,000
uh plasticity Loft in the type B

1358
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,400
landscape which means that not only is a

1359
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,980
certain kind of Dynamics instantiated

1360
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,660
right which make for example in the case

1361
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,980
of the major depressive disorder

1362
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,260
extremely negative self-evaluations very

1363
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,099
common but it's the case that even given

1364
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,800
the correct changes in environmental

1365
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,559
context even in the you know even given

1366
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,480
in the case of you know psychedelic

1367
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,000
system therapy a lot of the work with

1368
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,680
major depressive disorders being done

1369
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,540
with treatment resistant depression

1370
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,520
right and what is treatment resistant

1371
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,780
depression but uh a kind of a set of

1372
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,040
beliefs a set of neural activity

1373
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,220
patterns which are

1374
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:49,380
resistant to adaptation to new

1375
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,119
environmental contexts being you know

1376
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,680
whatever sort of psychotherapy or

1377
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,680
previous drug was used

1378
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,880
so this is a high plasticity loss

1379
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,559
however fitting right

1380
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,020
I think we can then uh

1381
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,700
and these are you know kind of

1382
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,680
unfortunately you know for psychedelic

1383
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,300
therapy and I think maybe for psychiatry

1384
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,920
in general these are all very very

1385
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,380
common and very very costly uh

1386
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,420
psychopathologies right so if it is the

1387
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,859
case in psychedelic therapy can treat

1388
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,859
these effectively that's fantastic

1389
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:17,520
um

1390
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,500
but I think we can maybe look at a more

1391
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,359
complicated you know if we start to

1392
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,760
expand to other psychopathologies

1393
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,079
um this story becomes a little bit more

1394
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:26,760
complicated right

1395
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,319
um so let's look we can look at the

1396
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,180
bottom left-hand corner here where we

1397
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,760
have cases of in the inference landscape

1398
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,059
still overfitting but um

1399
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:38,040
in the learning landscape something else

1400
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,440
happening a form of catastrophic

1401
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,900
forgetting or form of kind of drift of

1402
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,220
the

1403
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,220
um

1404
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,780
the belief landscape that's being

1405
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,579
instantiated here right so I think two

1406
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:52,619
kind of Representative

1407
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,660
um pathologies here are typically

1408
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,119
referred to as some form of bipolar

1409
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,400
disorder or some form of borderline

1410
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,619
personality disorder right so in both of

1411
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,020
these cases in the moment to moment

1412
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,020
uh neural activity as it unfolds there

1413
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,700
are very strong sets of beliefs being

1414
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,619
instantiated at any given time and these

1415
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:12,900
are very difficult to change right

1416
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,460
um but

1417
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,800
the key differentiating Point here being

1418
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,440
that over longer time scales over the

1419
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,599
time scales of days or weeks

1420
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:22,980
um the kinds of beliefs that are

1421
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,720
instantiated change quite a lot right so

1422
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,700
someone who's bipolar if they're in a

1423
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,339
manic episode or in a depressive episode

1424
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:31,079
the nature of the belief Landscaping

1425
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:33,240
instantiated is very different

1426
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,099
um for borderline individuals from a

1427
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,859
daily or weekly basis the nature of

1428
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:39,839
one's beliefs about the people that were

1429
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,839
close to them can change very rapidly

1430
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,440
um very extremely very in certain cases

1431
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,020
and so here the

1432
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:49,619
um

1433
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,980
benefit of psychedelic therapy uh is a

1434
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,400
bit more mixed where there is likely the

1435
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,880
case that to the extent to which the uh

1436
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,940
kind of overt type A beliefs can be

1437
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,740
updated and changed to be more positive

1438
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,079
be hopefully more relaxed

1439
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:09,480
um that's positive but to the extent to

1440
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,760
which plasticity may be being increased

1441
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,520
when it's not actually needed when

1442
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,260
there's not actually like a meaningful

1443
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,540
therapeutic benefit to that

1444
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,280
um it's a bit questionable I think you

1445
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,220
know there's clear

1446
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,780
borderline or rather bipolar for example

1447
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,079
is often individuals with bipolar are

1448
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,559
often excluded from psychedelic files

1449
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:32,579
um

1450
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,099
under the assumption for example that

1451
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:37,020
psychedelics may trigger a manic episode

1452
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,300
or may trigger psychosis

1453
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:44,119
um and I think that is a valid concern

1454
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,859
um so on kind of that topic we can then

1455
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:48,780
this bottom right hand corner would be

1456
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,520
cases of both underfooting and

1457
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,260
catastrophic forgetting with I think

1458
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,880
schizophrenia being kind of like the

1459
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,520
most clear manifestation of this

1460
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,480
um

1461
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,400
and here

1462
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,839
um you know there's very little work

1463
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,540
currently looking at trying to treat uh

1464
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,599
schizophrenia with psychedelic therapy I

1465
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:07,619
think for

1466
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:10,020
pretty good reasons

1467
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,040
um

1468
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,140
though I would say

1469
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,460
um

1470
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,020
to the extent to which there are

1471
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,500
secondary uh manifestations secondary

1472
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,300
issues like depression anxiety that

1473
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,800
people with schizophrenia might have you

1474
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,559
know these actually may be treatable

1475
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:29,520
um with some form of psychedelic therapy

1476
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,619
and then lastly this upper right hand

1477
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,000
corner here

1478
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,640
uh would correspond to underfitting in

1479
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,799
the type a landscape along with

1480
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:39,540
plasticity laws so I think a good

1481
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,140
example of this is something like ADHD

1482
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,900
um where there are not very uh

1483
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,880
particular strong beliefs that are being

1484
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,400
instantiated at any given time

1485
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,599
um

1486
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,880
but it's difficult to change these side

1487
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,280
of beliefs nonetheless

1488
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,520
um I think here there's a case uh where

1489
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,339
it's not totally clear on how the

1490
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:04,680
benefit will actually play out

1491
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,339
um

1492
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:07,079
in both of these cases I you know I've

1493
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:08,700
heard interesting work around like micro

1494
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:12,540
dosing maybe of issue interest

1495
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,540
um

1496
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,980
I think yeah more research has to be

1497
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,780
done to be seen right and then what

1498
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,220
would micro dosing be doing right micro

1499
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,559
dosing would be like very slowly uh kind

1500
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,760
of like

1501
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,040
decreasing plasticity loss just a little

1502
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,000
bit

1503
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,040
um potentially also decreasing

1504
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,780
underfitting right

1505
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,000
as Adam had kind of suggested in the

1506
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,480
office model

1507
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,160
and here we have just kind of like a

1508
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,180
brief overview of more or less

1509
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,099
everything I've described about how

1510
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:46,319
these two Landscapes are different

1511
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,540
um I think most of these things I've

1512
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,819
said before pretty clearly right so the

1513
00:59:50,819 --> 00:59:54,119
type a landscape

1514
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:56,400
it corresponds to the neural activity

1515
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,960
pattern this is the hidden state of the

1516
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,359
RNN over canalization is going to be

1517
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:02,400
stereotyped mental circuits very

1518
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,859
strongly held beliefs under canalization

1519
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:06,780
is going to be these inconsistently

1520
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,880
deployed circuits

1521
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,839
um

1522
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,299
it looks like uh overfitting in the

1523
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:13,980
canalized case underfitting in the

1524
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,359
non-catalyzed space

1525
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,400
going to correspond to stability to

1526
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,960
metatrate

1527
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,960
um I hadn't discussed this before but

1528
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,920
um I think there's a relationship

1529
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,720
between cognitive flexibility and this

1530
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,540
inference landscape

1531
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,319
psychedelics are mainly going to have

1532
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:33,180
faculty uh work at the acute level care

1533
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,220
and this is by directly exciting the

1534
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,260
neurons or inducing forms of how to be

1535
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,900
in plasticity and the outcome is going

1536
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,579
to be a mixture of relaxation and

1537
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:42,960
strengthening of the kind that Adam

1538
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,660
described in the the Albus case the type

1539
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,280
B landscape then is working on the

1540
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,079
synaptic weights and these are the

1541
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,480
actual Network parameters in our RNN

1542
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,480
model over canalization is this

1543
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,960
inability to learn or adapt over time

1544
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,200
under canalization is the inability to

1545
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,940
retain information right and those

1546
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,500
correspond to plasticity loss and

1547
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,660
catastrophic forgetting

1548
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,059
this also is kind of the traditional

1549
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:12,059
plasticity not a trait

1550
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,040
um which I think corresponds to this

1551
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,760
more uh this longer term

1552
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,700
constructive psychological flexibility

1553
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,140
um the effects are going to mainly be

1554
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,480
mainly to post acutely with psychedelics

1555
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,339
and these are the more Downstream

1556
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:28,260
metaplastic effects um the

1557
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,839
psychoplastogenic effects

1558
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:33,359
um and I think on the whole the outcome

1559
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,339
the effect here is a relaxation of

1560
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:38,000
catalyzation

1561
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:41,280
and uh yeah these are just the

1562
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,260
references so those those are the slides

1563
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,059
I have that's kind of the overview of

1564
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:47,280
the deep canals model

1565
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,180
um I think now I'll turn it over to Mike

1566
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,160
who um who's going to share some

1567
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,500
thoughts both about this work and some

1568
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,099
of his own work and kind of this uh

1569
01:01:58,099 --> 01:02:00,359
approach to understanding psychedelics

1570
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:02,839
more broadly

1571
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:09,780
uh great uh yeah thank you for the that

1572
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,660
overview that was great

1573
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:16,500
um so I guess uh I'm just in general

1574
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,859
very very optimistic about this corner

1575
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:23,700
of uh of Neuroscience that uh there are

1576
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,339
these very intuitive models uh that are

1577
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:28,619
very sort of clinically significant and

1578
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:29,460
uh

1579
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,380
and I also think

1580
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,140
you know there there is a lot of

1581
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,520
responsibility to sort of get things

1582
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,220
right here uh as well because as I

1583
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,420
remembered

1584
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,319
so uh yeah I I have just a few comments

1585
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:47,700
um and uh for the for the viewers uh I

1586
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,940
I'm not speaking uh for for Arthur and

1587
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,700
Adam um I'm just grateful for uh the

1588
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,099
invitation to join the discussion

1589
01:02:56,099 --> 01:03:00,359
uh so I wanted to to know uh quickly

1590
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:03,960
three research teams dealing with

1591
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,520
uh

1592
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,040
the implementation of this class of

1593
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,520
model uh so just broadly kind of

1594
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,700
pointing at uh both deep canals and uh

1595
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,900
andrewbis uh and uh and Albus

1596
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,900
um so um

1597
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,099
in 2018 I wrote neural annealing and

1598
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:28,319
that was sort of uh developing the

1599
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,200
canalization frame within the context of

1600
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,420
energy buildup in the eigen modes of a

1601
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,460
system

1602
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,720
um so you have the the nice

1603
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,160
annealing metaphor uh you have a

1604
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,780
temperature parameter and entropic

1605
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,660
disintegration uh

1606
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:48,599
uh Robin character said a a beautiful

1607
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:52,859
paper on that um uh potential brain

1608
01:03:52,859 --> 01:03:58,040
and uh then you you sort of have a post

1609
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,920
uh heating result uh where the

1610
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,900
microstructure of your system

1611
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,619
uh is sort of a result of the

1612
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:11,579
uh sort of how hot and how long the the

1613
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,920
heating was so

1614
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,440
it's it's an alternative take on belief

1615
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,880
relaxation

1616
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,520
and I do think that like there are some

1617
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,859
pluses in terms of sort of explicitly

1618
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,980
making the annealing metaphor

1619
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,540
um and uh

1620
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,920
uh I think that's uh like two things

1621
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,900
that I'd point out uh one top-down

1622
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,359
models or top-down predictive models as

1623
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:38,460
energy sinks

1624
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,700
um and eigen modes as the places where

1625
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,500
energy can build up for almost sort of

1626
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,559
hide from top-down models

1627
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,400
um so you get this uh this phenomenon of

1628
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,660
semantically neutral energy or

1629
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,700
semantically illegible energy you can

1630
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:58,819
say uh which is sort of kind of how

1631
01:04:58,819 --> 01:05:02,339
uh perhaps uh psychedelics music and

1632
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:05,460
rotation all sort of allow energy but

1633
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,839
um they're the energy that they

1634
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:08,940
contribute to the system can evade the

1635
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,339
top-down models

1636
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:14,460
um and uh yeah just to note one item

1637
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,099
that I'm looking at now is what is

1638
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:17,940
um

1639
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,640
deep canals has the inference landscape

1640
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,920
versus learning landscape distinction

1641
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,700
and how would one sort of build that

1642
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,559
distinction within the neural annealing

1643
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,520
framework and uh this one one metaphor

1644
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,339
that I'm I'm considering is the self as

1645
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:38,720
sort of a magnet uh to sort of

1646
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:43,920
uh apply a constraint a uniform focusing

1647
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,900
constraint on the system as it uh as

1648
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,359
it's cooling

1649
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:51,180
um the second uh item that I I want to

1650
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,880
mention that so I have this piece autism

1651
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,819
as a disorder of dimensionality

1652
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,220
and uh this brings in the concept of

1653
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:03,420
network density uh that it may very well

1654
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,220
be that uh

1655
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,380
people on the Spectrum have literally

1656
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,440
more neurons and or more synapses and

1657
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,700
there's this

1658
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:15,059
great Michelangelo Michelangelo quote I

1659
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:16,920
saw the angel in the stone and I set him

1660
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,059
free

1661
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:21,000
um and sort of the thicker networks you

1662
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,920
have the more Stone you have to work

1663
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,319
with but you actually have to do the

1664
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:26,460
work

1665
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,260
um so

1666
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:31,260
uh you you sort of have to have to do

1667
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:33,079
sort of well

1668
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:35,460
normally you sort of inherit these

1669
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:38,579
highly pre-trained optimized circuits

1670
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:40,859
almost like Asics application specific

1671
01:06:40,859 --> 01:06:43,319
integrated circuit

1672
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,200
um and then uh

1673
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,359
this is kind of more uh an untrained

1674
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:51,480
Network and you have to turn it yourself

1675
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,280
um and uh within the Deep canals

1676
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,200
framework this would show up as both

1677
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,619
underfitting and a higher capacity for

1678
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:00,500
plasticity

1679
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,099
uh

1680
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:05,579
so I think that's uh that's gonna be a

1681
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:09,020
an interesting thread

1682
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,319
um

1683
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,720
finally uh so I just posted that last

1684
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,839
week principles of vessel computation

1685
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,319
and as an implementation level account

1686
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:21,240
of active inference

1687
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,660
and this is a big rabbit hole um I I

1688
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,319
don't think we have time to to go down

1689
01:07:27,319 --> 01:07:31,260
today uh but I just comment that I

1690
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,900
really like the way deep canals

1691
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,640
explicitly splits out the learning

1692
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,859
landscape and the inference landscape

1693
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:39,960
that uh I think that making this

1694
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,480
distinction is increasingly going to

1695
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,839
make sense

1696
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,960
uh back to back Arthur

1697
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,260
yeah yeah awesome well thank you all for

1698
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,660
the presentations Arthur and Adam feel

1699
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,520
free to to pick up where Michael left

1700
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,960
off or I can bring in some questions

1701
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,760
from the chat or from what I've written

1702
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,000
down

1703
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:19,319
yeah

1704
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,960
all right just uh yeah

1705
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,660
just a quick comment um I do think that

1706
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:27,839
uh in in the Deep canals framework it's

1707
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,279
going to be interesting to sort of look

1708
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,719
into

1709
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:35,219
uh metabolic demands uh and like sort of

1710
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:36,319
different

1711
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,500
uh like

1712
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:42,960
metabolic disorders are are pretty hot

1713
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,020
in brain science right now and I do

1714
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,359
think that uh it'll be interesting to to

1715
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,279
look at sort of

1716
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:52,799
what the metabolic profile is in terms

1717
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,620
of each of the four items of a quadrant

1718
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:56,219
um

1719
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:59,540
if one quadrant or another quadrant is

1720
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:03,179
particularly associated with uh

1721
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:07,339
um more metabolic demands in the system

1722
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:12,540
Arthur yeah

1723
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,698
yeah that's fascinating I was I'm

1724
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:16,799
actually I'd love to kind of hear a

1725
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,000
little bit more about this comment you

1726
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,259
made about the cell

1727
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:22,020
as a magnet that's applying these

1728
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:24,380
constraints

1729
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,880
oh yeah so

1730
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,080
there's a

1731
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:34,560
the like psychedelics the the effects

1732
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,120
are not

1733
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,279
or sort of the

1734
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:40,620
you sort of get pulled back into

1735
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,660
position after

1736
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,000
some time

1737
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,080
and uh

1738
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,960
you know I can't say that this is a full

1739
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,460
full Theory uh at this point but um

1740
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:59,219
in the Neuroscience meditation

1741
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:03,719
2018 I talked about um the self as

1742
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:05,400
kind of the

1743
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,860
the god of the gaps in terms of aligning

1744
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,140
different scales of uh

1745
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:13,260
like you you have circuits which kind of

1746
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,880
pull in different ways and you have the

1747
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,800
mesoscale systems Which pull in

1748
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,540
different ways and you have the the

1749
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,179
overall brainwise systems that pull in

1750
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:22,860
different ways and kind of the self is

1751
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,540
sort of the thing that I'll try is to

1752
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,120
make everything work together

1753
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,100
um

1754
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:34,380
and an alternate frame would be sort of

1755
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:37,380
this self is just kind of this

1756
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,679
slow gravity toward disalignment

1757
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:45,320
uh yeah um I don't have anything

1758
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:49,400
particularly uh more to share

1759
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,860
that's it yeah no that's interesting

1760
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,679
well to combine the heating up and the

1761
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,860
magnetism different metals and

1762
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,659
connections there to Alchemy and

1763
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:02,699
everything different Metals when heated

1764
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:05,219
up and cooled down in specific ways

1765
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,820
change their magnetic profile so of

1766
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,440
course this is all just concordances but

1767
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,540
they're very interesting and then also

1768
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,600
to the um the metabolic angle

1769
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,140
that reminded me of the um the trilogy

1770
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,100
by Dale pendell with uh pharmacist and

1771
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,739
and the other two books where treated

1772
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,920
alongside traditional psychoactives we

1773
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,380
could say like caffeine and nicotine and

1774
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,179
some of the other substances that were

1775
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:35,580
mentioned here also there's

1776
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:39,840
tea sugar and these are treated as

1777
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,380
psychedelic or at least as uh in the

1778
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,260
same

1779
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:49,140
Pantheon of neurocognitive modifying in

1780
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,600
the sense that the Destinies of

1781
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,140
individuals and of of Empires

1782
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:57,239
ride on

1783
01:11:57,239 --> 01:12:00,600
the uh sense making and decision making

1784
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,440
influence of sugar for example

1785
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,179
so it definitely broadens our

1786
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:09,000
perspective to include the the so-called

1787
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,100
classical

1788
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,000
molecules like LSD but also maybe we

1789
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,460
could think more broadly about

1790
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,960
antioxidants or about different lipids

1791
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,960
or about different metabolic

1792
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,219
um

1793
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:25,080
connections

1794
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,780
Michael pollan's uh recent book this is

1795
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,840
your mind on Plants I think like it kind

1796
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,060
of has that what you're saying in mind

1797
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,580
because like it includes caffeine

1798
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,620
um not like introduced as a psychedelic

1799
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,620
but just disgust among uh also

1800
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,120
psychedelics I think their memory

1801
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,460
focuses on masculine but

1802
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,040
um just it is a different way of being

1803
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,380
in the world uh potentially radically

1804
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,480
different like if caffeine is in your

1805
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,980
life where it is not

1806
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,060
um

1807
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,320
it's a different life world

1808
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,199
and different extended niche

1809
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,540
um I'll go to a question in the live

1810
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,420
chat so anyone can can give a thought so

1811
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,400
Matt asks

1812
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,159
is there any way how to approach the

1813
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:14,340
individual reactions to psychedelics in

1814
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,679
terms of positive or negative results of

1815
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:20,040
treatment using the ideas of deep canals

1816
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,980
so how can we approach predictions and

1817
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:27,480
explanations at the individual scale

1818
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,099
with what you're sharing today

1819
01:13:35,659 --> 01:13:39,739
one thing for wow

1820
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:42,900
this is kind of like a meta comment but

1821
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,480
like if we're actually

1822
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,940
going to do

1823
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:52,080
um computational Psychiatry and we

1824
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,540
actually are going to and precision

1825
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,179
medicine so look at the goal being to

1826
01:13:57,179 --> 01:14:00,239
create models of sufficient detail that

1827
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,800
they could actually guide our practice

1828
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,360
and guide our practice in a way where we

1829
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,460
know for an individual what they might

1830
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,980
need in any given context so Precision

1831
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,360
medicine with respect to like standard

1832
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,980
antidepressants

1833
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,080
um you know people sometimes will go for

1834
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,520
a long time before they find ones that

1835
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,960
work and sometimes things are made worse

1836
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,179
and they might deal with antidepressant

1837
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:19,620
withdrawal as they're looking for the

1838
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,540
right one and if they're in a state of

1839
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,120
acute distress that could be um

1840
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,540
a hard lot and so like if you can help

1841
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,580
to speed up that process of finding what

1842
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,040
works uh the ability to and what might

1843
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,560
hurt also to avoid that I mean the

1844
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,340
ability to help people's immense and so

1845
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:40,500
for that it's um like part of this so

1846
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,360
the meta comment is like

1847
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,040
um I have to say I'm not convinced that

1848
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,320
an active inference uh we're doing the

1849
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,040
job

1850
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,380
I I think we're not acknowledging our

1851
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,040
uncertainty and I think the models are

1852
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,860
underspecified with respect to the

1853
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,699
complexity of the effects we would

1854
01:14:56,699 --> 01:14:58,260
expect on different scales and in

1855
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,120
characterizing the systems

1856
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,159
and we need to be more patient and

1857
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,179
modest

1858
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:05,699
but what we don't know before we go on

1859
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:07,920
rushing in headlong into telling the

1860
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,900
rest of Psychiatry how they should

1861
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,360
comport themselves and what models they

1862
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,460
should use uh based on psychedelic

1863
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:17,520
science and plausible models hopeful

1864
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,360
models but very early days and with the

1865
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,159
reality being complex in the ways we're

1866
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:25,020
seeing here like this was not an easy

1867
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,120
set of lectures you know or a set of

1868
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,380
talks like what we're going through this

1869
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:31,080
is like and yeah if we're actually going

1870
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,400
to be able to handle these powerful

1871
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,679
medicines responsibly we got to go into

1872
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:36,900
the weeds and so anyway so the one more

1873
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,820
meta comment was like I think I saw like

1874
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:39,960
someone say oh how can something like

1875
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,420
help everything you're like yeah it's

1876
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,320
almost I don't know if this is right

1877
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,760
it's almost like a violation of like no

1878
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,020
free lunch theorems or something it's

1879
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,900
like how could something just be good

1880
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,400
across the board without you know

1881
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,900
something is off you've calculated wrong

1882
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,159
somewhere

1883
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:55,260
um you had to pay the price either in

1884
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,400
like some trade-off that wasn't

1885
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,440
acknowledged or

1886
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,820
um but that being said there are some

1887
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,980
things which are generally good for a

1888
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:04,320
lot of things like being more flexible

1889
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:08,760
or like if if you can get something like

1890
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,580
meta stability like like I said there's

1891
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,380
almost like I'm I'm I think I'm a church

1892
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:16,080
member of the the or I'm a faithful

1893
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,179
member of the Church of criticality uh I

1894
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:20,040
think Mark Miller might have uh

1895
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,140
indoctrinated me with like Optimal grips

1896
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:24,239
but basically like the ability to have

1897
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,280
like an optimal grip on existence in

1898
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,380
your soul not too tight not too loose

1899
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,360
and being able to move around and be

1900
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,580
like flexible in itinerant like

1901
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,620
something kind of like mindfulness is

1902
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,260
just like Sriracha for the soul it's

1903
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,880
good for everything almost you just need

1904
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,460
to put on this put on that makes it

1905
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:44,040
better I I I I buy that there might be

1906
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,300
some things that are good across the

1907
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,000
board but I wouldn't call though

1908
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,580
uh psychedelics necessarily

1909
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,020
um putting you in this like state of

1910
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,400
optimal criticality or anything it's

1911
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,140
like in general like the rhetoric I'm

1912
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,460
uncomfortable with of saying

1913
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:59,340
psychedelics do X I would prefer to say

1914
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,239
like

1915
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,100
um which psychedel like psychedelics

1916
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,659
tend to do X but just a little more

1917
01:17:03,659 --> 01:17:06,360
qualifier like not weasel words but just

1918
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,560
like a little bit more like uh

1919
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,179
this psychedelic might do X in this

1920
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:14,280
context with this dose and this sentence

1921
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,500
setting but that being said there do

1922
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,080
also those seem to be across the board

1923
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:22,080
um broads um sweeping not super but

1924
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,440
overarching statements that we can make

1925
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,260
that Express a lot with a little and so

1926
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:29,820
like I don't want to be so much of like

1927
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:33,900
a splitter and like a a a prickly person

1928
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,820
finding all the details that like these

1929
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,040
powerful things we can basically give to

1930
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,260
people to guide like our research I got

1931
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,520
I don't want to leave that on table

1932
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,760
either so yeah so I guess um that's a

1933
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,260
bunch of metal level commentary that did

1934
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:49,500
not address the thing so

1935
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,780
I did that too so that's very helpful I

1936
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,179
think to have all that context

1937
01:17:54,179 --> 01:17:56,460
um with respect to the question itself I

1938
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:57,239
would

1939
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,400
um maybe offer this which might be

1940
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,860
helpful which is you know I think

1941
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,900
you mentioned it Adam and it's very

1942
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,580
frequently mentioned this idea of satin

1943
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,199
setting right as being like heavily

1944
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,840
predictive of the quality of the acute

1945
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,960
psychedelic experience and often also to

1946
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,100
some extent the quality of the

1947
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,140
post-acute experience

1948
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,600
um and I think we can understand this in

1949
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,580
the Deep canals model quite quite

1950
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,199
straightforwardly

1951
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:23,460
um

1952
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,320
so I'll just

1953
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,840
quickly pull back up one of these slides

1954
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,340
here

1955
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:30,179
um

1956
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:32,340
yeah right so

1957
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,699
what is satin setting so

1958
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:38,280
um set is mindset which would basically

1959
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,980
be some combination of the current uh

1960
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,480
your current position in the synaptic

1961
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,400
weight landscape and the current state

1962
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,780
of your neural activation landscape

1963
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,120
right so your place in both Landscapes

1964
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:53,159
is your mindset and uh the setting is

1965
01:18:53,159 --> 01:18:55,739
the what is generating this input right

1966
01:18:55,739 --> 01:18:57,420
what is generating the X into the

1967
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,880
network and that's you know some

1968
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,620
complicated function of the environment

1969
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:03,300
right

1970
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,820
um and then we can understand right the

1971
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:08,280
evolution of movement through the

1972
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,140
inference landscape during the acute

1973
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:12,300
effects of the drug as then kind of like

1974
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,860
vary directly and straightforwardly

1975
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,239
being a function of these two things

1976
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:16,500
right

1977
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,480
um because both of these these things

1978
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,820
are are basically what's affecting how

1979
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,920
this landscape evolves over time and how

1980
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,000
you move through the landscape

1981
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:28,260
um and so you know with this in mind I

1982
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,640
guess we can then start to characterize

1983
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,040
and think about like okay well what

1984
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:35,699
kinds of uh you know we can maybe be a

1985
01:19:35,699 --> 01:19:37,380
little bit more mechanistic about like

1986
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,960
how does input

1987
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,880
from the environment the setting

1988
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:42,900
actually

1989
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,239
given you know that we relatively fix

1990
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:47,280
the actual synaptic one of the way

1991
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,140
landscape how is that changing the

1992
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,060
Dynamics over time or the other way

1993
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:54,000
around right like how our uh is fixing

1994
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,140
the input

1995
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,120
the environmental context relatively

1996
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,560
stable

1997
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,960
um and looking at individuals who are at

1998
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,219
different fixed points at different

1999
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,739
points of time I'm going to change the

2000
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:08,159
Dynamics but yeah the event right and I

2001
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,980
think given that this is a highly

2002
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,500
stochastic process given that these

2003
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,840
dynamics of Albus are are at play right

2004
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,760
where like certain beliefs are being

2005
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,020
strengthened other beliefs are being

2006
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,520
relaxed

2007
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,080
um

2008
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,060
I think at least having this hold on

2009
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,400
okay well set and setting is really

2010
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,719
important and it's important because

2011
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,179
like these are explicitly conditioning

2012
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:32,100
the way in which

2013
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,100
uh both the landscape the inference

2014
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,400
landscape is shaped and how you move

2015
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,500
around it and how it's being you know

2016
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,760
dynamically perturbed

2017
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,400
um yeah hopefully that answers a little

2018
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,800
bit the question

2019
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,080
nice uh

2020
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,020
I just want to jump in there just

2021
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,040
thinking about

2022
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,199
um biomarkers

2023
01:20:58,199 --> 01:20:59,820
that uh

2024
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:02,340
I mean if if we're looking for something

2025
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:06,540
that's of high clinical specificity

2026
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:08,880
uh we want to sort of be able to measure

2027
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,320
what's

2028
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,460
what's going on uh at a very careful in

2029
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:19,140
a very careful way so like first of all

2030
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:22,500
what is temperature parameter uh you

2031
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,719
know we we talk about okay psychedelics

2032
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,640
increase the temperature parameters but

2033
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,840
um like how high and do do different

2034
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:34,260
substances and dosages uh sort of differ

2035
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:37,260
in interesting ways probably yes

2036
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,780
uh and then also sort of measuring

2037
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:42,000
temperature parameter measuring the

2038
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,500
temperature parameter in different parts

2039
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,840
of the body so you might have a

2040
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,699
different uh temperature

2041
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:50,280
like not the real temperature but uh

2042
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,040
kind of computational like entropic

2043
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,800
concentration uh in different parts of

2044
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,239
your body

2045
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:59,040
um and also

2046
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,300
um the plasticity status in different

2047
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,620
networks throughout your body

2048
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,000
so

2049
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,440
I guess I

2050
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,600
I see a big

2051
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,620
Frontier here uh as thinking some doing

2052
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,500
some careful thinking around

2053
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,679
um biomarkers and proxies and inferring

2054
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:22,140
these these sort of things that we we

2055
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,540
are talking about as

2056
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:27,540
core and I think they are core and we

2057
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,820
should be able to find a good uh good

2058
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,179
marks

2059
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,960
yeah that's

2060
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,360
totally correct and yeah I just want to

2061
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,940
like repeat it for my own occasion right

2062
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:40,380
which is it like yeah these two things

2063
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:43,800
which I think were maybe one was is I

2064
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,239
think already a core part of the deep

2065
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:46,920
Penance work right which is that I was

2066
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,600
showing these single images of these toy

2067
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,300
optimization Landscapes but of course

2068
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,679
um

2069
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:54,540
the human being the nervous system right

2070
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:57,600
uh has multiple many of these Landscapes

2071
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,000
hierarchically organized right

2072
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,760
um and they influence each other in a

2073
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,560
complicated way

2074
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,340
um

2075
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,900
and

2076
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,000
the kind of like

2077
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,840
yeah the project for it is to understand

2078
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,219
where these Landscapes are what they

2079
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:17,640
look like and how we can find biomarkers

2080
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,920
to them yeah and again you know if he's

2081
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,699
two kinds of characterizations are true

2082
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:25,140
um this overfitting underfitting

2083
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:28,560
plasticity loss and uh catastrophic

2084
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,620
forgetting then it would

2085
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,780
it's a very meaningful project to be

2086
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,300
able to you know quantify that

2087
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:38,040
objectively somehow an individual and

2088
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,659
that's when you can start to get to this

2089
01:23:39,659 --> 01:23:41,640
point that Adam was talking about like

2090
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,140
Precision medicine and understanding

2091
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,239
like okay well actually it turns out

2092
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:47,219
right like these networks are catalyzed

2093
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:49,080
in this kind of way and because of that

2094
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:52,380
we can say with much more certainty that

2095
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,179
this kind of you know psychedelic

2096
01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:56,400
intervention is going to likely be

2097
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,600
helpful

2098
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,699
so

2099
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,800
I'm wondering I don't know if this like

2100
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,120
potentially brings in some of the work

2101
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,719
with like um uh

2102
01:24:05,719 --> 01:24:08,840
vascular and neuroviscellular uh

2103
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,100
neurovascular and visceral integration

2104
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:12,780
that you're doing but like

2105
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,159
so there's like a sense in like the free

2106
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:16,320
energy principle where the overall

2107
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,880
phenotype

2108
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,040
and an extended phenotype in terms of

2109
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,260
its cut its constructing and coupling

2110
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,699
with and constructing its Eco Niche

2111
01:24:23,699 --> 01:24:24,840
there's

2112
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,000
um it's success and manifesting this

2113
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,140
phenotype

2114
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,960
um it's there's one for energy function

2115
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,300
for this overall effort as a kind of

2116
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,520
prediction that's enacted through the

2117
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,380
Dynamics but you could also like break

2118
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:40,140
it down in terms of like subsystems with

2119
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:42,840
like local gradients and like local auto

2120
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,520
poetic processes that are in like

2121
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,199
they're brought together into an overall

2122
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:49,380
system hopefully with synergies

2123
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,199
um but and they have to be to be in an

2124
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:54,600
organism and an agent we call this like

2125
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,880
I think

2126
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:58,980
to the extent it has thickness it's

2127
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:00,659
coming together but I guess so you could

2128
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:02,820
I guess think of maybe like a energy

2129
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:05,580
landscape you know something like uh

2130
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,140
let's just say like right now in this

2131
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:10,320
moment like my uh explicitly felt

2132
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,080
beliefs but my my body also might have a

2133
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,300
different opinion different parts of it

2134
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,159
and it in terms of like what it's

2135
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,020
implicitly optimizing it's revealed

2136
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,780
preference from its in action that may

2137
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,880
or may not correspond to how I feel

2138
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,380
about it I might not even it might be

2139
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:27,120
difference of opinion I might even be

2140
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,739
tuning in I might be ignoring it because

2141
01:25:28,739 --> 01:25:30,780
I don't want to and so it's kind of like

2142
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:33,300
the score kept by the body might have

2143
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,679
its own

2144
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:37,739
um uh be describable as its own like

2145
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:39,659
information geometry which is being

2146
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:41,520
tracked to degrees and is in different

2147
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,239
degrees of uh alignment with

2148
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:47,100
um different ones at different levels of

2149
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,540
a control hierarchy so plausible right

2150
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:56,340
yeah absolutely I I think so um yeah uh

2151
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:59,040
and like I I think of I think the body

2152
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:02,400
is sort of um uh a parliament of

2153
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,940
different uh networks and uh

2154
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,739
you know alignment is the scarce

2155
01:26:07,739 --> 01:26:09,179
resource coordination is always a

2156
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:11,400
scarcity resource and uh like how does

2157
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,159
the body keep alignment and when does it

2158
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:17,820
go wrong too and I guess I I see this as

2159
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:19,620
sort of

2160
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,780
um I mean harmonically mediated each

2161
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:25,020
part of the body has some choice of what

2162
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:27,000
else in the body to listen to

2163
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,480
and depending on the particular sort of

2164
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,480
location in the information topology

2165
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,520
uh different parts of the body have

2166
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,580
different carrots and sticks by which to

2167
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,739
try to control other parts of the body

2168
01:26:40,739 --> 01:26:43,739
uh so if if your stomach is very unhappy

2169
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:46,260
uh it's going to start rambling and then

2170
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:49,440
it's uh it'll it'll let the body know

2171
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:53,580
okay I need some food like I really

2172
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,800
seriously need some food

2173
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,020
um and then yeah the rest of the body

2174
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:00,600
they can sort of turn away from it uh

2175
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,000
and then it'll just get louder and then

2176
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,739
you have to turn it away from it more a

2177
01:27:04,739 --> 01:27:06,600
little bit louder and that's a of course

2178
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,880
a negative Dynamic if it gets What It

2179
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,860
Wants maybe it's sort of

2180
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:15,300
gives a very harmonious hum uh and uh

2181
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:18,060
and sort of tries to give give Carriage

2182
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:22,440
the rest of the body so yeah I just uh

2183
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:26,059
there's an ecosystem there

2184
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,060
I'll go to another question in the live

2185
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:33,960
chat so Bert asks

2186
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:36,120
what do you think of the average of

2187
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,820
solving within a generative hierarchy

2188
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,520
and the impact of temporary openness

2189
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,040
moving it upwards

2190
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,659
and then I asked to clarify what do you

2191
01:27:45,659 --> 01:27:47,940
mean the average of solving and Bert

2192
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,920
wrote where predictions meet incoming

2193
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,679
signals like discussed in Rebus where

2194
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:55,080
top down predictions are softened in

2195
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:59,360
precision and dust and thus solved for

2196
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,580
oh

2197
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,900
I think Arthur will be able to get into

2198
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,460
the details of that

2199
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:06,600
um

2200
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,120
better than I would but the uh one thing

2201
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,500
I'm

2202
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,980
wondering there is um

2203
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:17,699
sometimes like like in like again I love

2204
01:28:17,699 --> 01:28:22,739
the entropic brain uh but sometimes I

2205
01:28:22,739 --> 01:28:25,380
wonder in terms of like the connections

2206
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:28,920
whether I don't so how we're having more

2207
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,679
or less entropy and whether that matters

2208
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:34,320
the how so for instance like you can

2209
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,000
think of like a free energy landscape

2210
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,040
that's been flattened or you can think

2211
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,440
of one where like you're better able and

2212
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,600
you have like more like energy for like

2213
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,060
this uh you know the manifold activity

2214
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,800
is better of like climbing up or down

2215
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,480
the the Peaks that are there for the

2216
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,000
more enduring belief landscape so it's

2217
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,820
like in the moment it could be that

2218
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,620
um uh

2219
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,540
my previous way of thinking is

2220
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,760
unavailable to me and I no longer

2221
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,980
believe those things at any level

2222
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:07,679
um or I I can uh support more novel

2223
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,780
inferences that I wouldn't otherwise I

2224
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:12,960
can kind of move into an area of Mind

2225
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,760
space that would otherwise be difficult

2226
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,320
potentially because

2227
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,540
of of greater energy into the system

2228
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:20,820
greater thorough put

2229
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,299
nice

2230
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,780
yeah so as I as I think I understand the

2231
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:29,280
question right it's basically asking

2232
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,400
about trying to optimize for this free

2233
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,260
energy

2234
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,260
um

2235
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:38,940
variable and in the con the context of

2236
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,679
deep canals right like this is the loss

2237
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:42,780
function that's driving the optimization

2238
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,880
of the the learning landscape the

2239
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,159
synaptic great landscape right but like

2240
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:49,380
the entire connectivity structure of the

2241
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,960
nervous system is like trying to get to

2242
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,120
this point of like low-free energy and I

2243
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,699
think there's lots of uh there's you

2244
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:58,920
know for any given individual in a given

2245
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,139
environment assuming the environment is

2246
01:30:01,139 --> 01:30:02,820
relatively fixed right there's like an

2247
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:04,199
optimal

2248
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:06,780
um there's a global optimal and it's

2249
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:10,199
very likely that the individual is in

2250
01:30:10,199 --> 01:30:12,719
some local Optima

2251
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,760
um that is maybe close to it maybe far

2252
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,020
from it

2253
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:16,920
um

2254
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,380
but that's just inherently you know

2255
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,780
um what was you know within the context

2256
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,400
of the active entrance that's what we're

2257
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,540
assuming that the nervous system is

2258
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:26,580
doing is is doing this great into some

2259
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:31,080
in the space and openness then is going

2260
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,040
to

2261
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,580
uh correspond to this plasticity

2262
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:38,699
metatrade or be one of the components of

2263
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:42,780
it and it is in the Deep canals model

2264
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:46,560
then going to correspond to an ability

2265
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,360
to move around this optimization

2266
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,340
landscape more easily right it's going

2267
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,080
to be a flattening of a landscape or

2268
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,540
more precisely I guess a student of the

2269
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:56,100
landscape

2270
01:30:56,100 --> 01:31:00,239
um such that it's less likely that

2271
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,460
the individual the nervous system will

2272
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:04,560
get stuck in these local Optimum

2273
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,540
so maybe it won't mean that the

2274
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:07,980
individual will arrive at the global

2275
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,960
Optimum I think it's difficult to say

2276
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:11,940
what that even you know might be or

2277
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:14,340
however our individuals might get to

2278
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,139
such a place at all but I think it is

2279
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:19,620
likely that the individual will be will

2280
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:22,260
be more likely to find a more

2281
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:26,760
uh more Global Optimum and more easily

2282
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,060
move from one uh option to another right

2283
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,560
and I think that's kind of what this

2284
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,500
this openness is corresponding to

2285
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,000
um

2286
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,380
yeah

2287
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,480
it's okay

2288
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,980
oh I

2289
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,739
so in in neural kneeling I uh I

2290
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:44,940
mentioned the

2291
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:47,760
uh the idea of psychedelic extrapolating

2292
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,940
volition kind of a play on uh coherent

2293
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:53,340
extrapolated position from uh from the

2294
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:56,460
AI safety crowd and it's this sort of

2295
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,980
sense that um

2296
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,679
if temporarily you have more control

2297
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,639
over sort of low level shaping of of

2298
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:06,780
your

2299
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:09,780
your condition your emotion

2300
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,600
um and you know maybe sort of based on

2301
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,400
this this attractor that we call the

2302
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:18,000
South uh or you know I I guess like

2303
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,239
based on what is a good question

2304
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:23,400
um then

2305
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,440
what are good signs that you should be

2306
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,960
trusted with that power or you should

2307
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,580
trust yourself with that power rather

2308
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:33,000
and what are what are telltale signs

2309
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,980
that you shouldn't trust yourself with

2310
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:37,560
that power and um you know I I don't

2311
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,179
have an answer but I think it's an

2312
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:40,679
interesting question

2313
01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:43,440
yes I am normal and can be trusted with

2314
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:46,080
the key to the doors of perception let

2315
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,239
me in exactly

2316
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:51,420
um I have a short question

2317
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:55,699
where is action in this model

2318
01:32:58,440 --> 01:32:59,699
so

2319
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:01,699
um

2320
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,199
imagine many places Arthur will get into

2321
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:05,880
that but for

2322
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,280
um what I was thinking with

2323
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,820
um Albus is that actually the 5-ht2a

2324
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,380
system

2325
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,219
um

2326
01:33:14,219 --> 01:33:18,000
I I talk about two regimes potentially

2327
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,719
um one is more towards

2328
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:25,500
um overt in action and modifying the

2329
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,580
world and strength and beliefs

2330
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:29,219
potentially of that variety and the

2331
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:31,679
other might be more of um adapting to

2332
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:36,120
the world uh it's so uh Robin has a a

2333
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,739
really excellent paper called The Tale

2334
01:33:37,739 --> 01:33:40,139
of Two receptors where he talks about

2335
01:33:40,139 --> 01:33:44,040
5hc two five ht1a receptors the ones

2336
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,139
that antidepressants tend to act on

2337
01:33:46,139 --> 01:33:47,340
um because they tend to reduce this

2338
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,139
excitatory signaling

2339
01:33:49,139 --> 01:33:50,460
um talk about them as a kind of passive

2340
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,100
coping and so this would correspond and

2341
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,739
there's some machine learning models of

2342
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:57,179
this by Diane and colleagues of like

2343
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:58,380
where they talk about opponency between

2344
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,900
dopamine serotonin and they're focusing

2345
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,580
on the 1A as a kind of like patients

2346
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,620
promoting parameter keeping you from

2347
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:06,120
like confidently charging into your

2348
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,760
policy so that would tend to

2349
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,580
inhibit I guess patterns of

2350
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,440
um either Overton action or potentially

2351
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,920
even some kinds of um uh mental

2352
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,139
simulation too if it's like you could

2353
01:34:19,139 --> 01:34:20,159
maybe even think of like even if you're

2354
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,440
not overtly inactive enacting something

2355
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:25,199
externally uh there might be more or

2356
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,840
less uh Brave type styles of thoughts

2357
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,860
that you might be willing to entertain

2358
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:30,300
going

2359
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,340
um

2360
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:35,040
going places you might not otherwise

2361
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,560
um be willing to go and being able to

2362
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,300
handle the swings and expected free

2363
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,060
energy that might happen as you try to

2364
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:44,580
pursue a given path of policies

2365
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:47,580
so but the idea would be that

2366
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,320
um there might be something more like a

2367
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,120
micro dosing Mesa dosing regime which

2368
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,639
might be more of what initially sculpted

2369
01:34:53,639 --> 01:34:56,100
the five hd2a system which evolved with

2370
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,020
the gene duplication event around the

2371
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:00,120
time of uh the Cambrian explosion with

2372
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,159
the Advent of jawed fishes I'm

2373
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:03,480
personally interpreting this as having

2374
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,580
the significance of

2375
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:07,380
um evolving the context of Predator prey

2376
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:09,179
arms races I suspect I could be wrong

2377
01:35:09,179 --> 01:35:11,940
but that basically it's

2378
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:14,580
um locally trying to strengthen patterns

2379
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:17,760
of policy pursuit to pursue particular

2380
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,980
goals in a given context and this to

2381
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,480
come back to what was I think earlier

2382
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,920
without work by Robin of like a kind of

2383
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:26,880
active coping but it seems with Rebus

2384
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:31,340
um there's almost like um a

2385
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,900
not that kind of story

2386
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:37,199
um and that it's more your adjusting to

2387
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,719
the world and actually if under a very

2388
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:41,280
alter say you are overtly enacting

2389
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,540
that's actually kind of a dangerous

2390
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:44,760
thing I don't know how much to make of

2391
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,139
this at the

2392
01:35:46,139 --> 01:35:48,420
um 582 receptors are less expressed on

2393
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:50,639
like motor cortex I don't think we know

2394
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:52,440
enough to make too much of it but it's

2395
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,120
like some dreams you might not want to

2396
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,679
act out as they're happening but they

2397
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,260
still might powerfully impact you

2398
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:01,560
so um I'm currently actually wondering

2399
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,020
whether this other Rebus like regime

2400
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:06,480
might have been specifically sculpted in

2401
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,760
the context of

2402
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,639
um bonding and actually opening the self

2403
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:13,920
to include others and that might have

2404
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,120
been some of the primary selective

2405
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,800
pressures I don't know how to think of

2406
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,900
that in terms of an action

2407
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:22,260
um but uh and one more detail that might

2408
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,659
kind of like uh not sure what to make of

2409
01:36:24,659 --> 01:36:26,040
it the kind of

2410
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,860
goes through both of those

2411
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:31,260
excuse the phone uh would be

2412
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,639
um anthropologically I believe like

2413
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:35,639
psychedelics are oftentimes used in ways

2414
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:38,100
that would be both like creating a kind

2415
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:40,260
of group solidarity and might be used in

2416
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:42,540
the context of

2417
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:44,219
um pursuing goals together in the world

2418
01:36:44,219 --> 01:36:45,480
so for instance like a hunting party

2419
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,280
they might all do psychedelics together

2420
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,300
or something that looks a lot like

2421
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,699
breath work before uh going out maybe

2422
01:36:50,699 --> 01:36:53,159
you know going to war so that's a very

2423
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:55,080
different type that kind of includes

2424
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:56,940
both a relaxation of the normal

2425
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:59,340
boundaries of the self and the kind of

2426
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:02,219
like uh gearing you up for pursuing

2427
01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:04,320
goals in the world so but you know

2428
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,460
there's got to be another story of like

2429
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,320
like those Arthur's expertise is machine

2430
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,600
learning and so it's like uh these you

2431
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,580
want these systems to act intelligently

2432
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,920
and not act in other times and so

2433
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,080
basically now we're in the language of

2434
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,820
policies and when you deploy them and

2435
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,860
how and yes so

2436
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:22,699
complicated

2437
01:37:23,219 --> 01:37:25,500
yeah I would say that action manifests

2438
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,120
itself in a few different places it's

2439
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,860
trying to mention it here yeah I think

2440
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:30,780
it's really important obviously I mean I

2441
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:32,219
think what the kind of like most

2442
01:37:32,219 --> 01:37:34,679
implicit place where it exists right is

2443
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:35,820
that

2444
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:37,440
um these belief Landscapes are being

2445
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,719
instantiated ultimately for the sake of

2446
01:37:39,719 --> 01:37:42,540
adaptive Behavior adaptive Behavior

2447
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,460
adaptive action right in some sort of

2448
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:47,040
environmental context and that's the

2449
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,840
kind of like framework deep learning

2450
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,620
framework that we're using or like the

2451
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:53,880
artificial agent framework right is that

2452
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,560
like the assumption is that the system

2453
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,820
is

2454
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:59,280
supporting some sort of agent that's

2455
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,900
embodied in some sort of environment

2456
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,500
which is you know changing over time

2457
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,300
um such that it can either be adaptive

2458
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,880
or not adaptive I think then the

2459
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,400
question of how action actually plays

2460
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,960
into the evolution of these belief

2461
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,639
Landscapes you know during psychedelics

2462
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:15,960
or not

2463
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:16,620
um

2464
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:19,980
you know acting is a acting in the world

2465
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:22,820
is a very clear way to

2466
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:27,120
modify one's setting right so action is

2467
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,639
a way of modifying the function that's

2468
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:31,860
providing the sensory input into the

2469
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:34,139
system which is going to evolve change

2470
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:37,500
how the activity patterns are evolving

2471
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,120
over time right which is going to affect

2472
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:42,120
the acute quality of the trip

2473
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,760
um it affects how beliefs are either

2474
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:47,040
being strengthened or relaxed

2475
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,139
um and I think you know it's it's

2476
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:50,580
already clear that

2477
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:52,320
there's a kind of whole

2478
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,340
um

2479
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:54,900
that of like folk psychology right

2480
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:56,580
that's been built around like what is or

2481
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,500
is a good way to

2482
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,540
uh cultivate

2483
01:39:00,540 --> 01:39:03,480
a helpful setting and that of course all

2484
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,820
is a function of action in the world I

2485
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,679
think that there's also

2486
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,719
um this kind of more subtler form of

2487
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:13,320
action which is how one thinks Holland

2488
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,179
deploys attention right essentially

2489
01:39:15,179 --> 01:39:17,580
during this experience and I think this

2490
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:19,500
deployment of attention has a huge

2491
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:22,679
effect on whether there end up being

2492
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:26,159
Rebus or cbis like effects right so

2493
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:29,159
whether one allows oneself to go down

2494
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:31,560
certain thought rabbit holes whether one

2495
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,480
allows oneself to get kind of stuck in

2496
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:36,120
certain kinds of thought patterns

2497
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:37,500
um

2498
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:41,460
I think this form of mental action

2499
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:46,440
yeah has a very big Downstream effect

2500
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,460
um

2501
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:50,639
and I think a lot of I'd love to see

2502
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:52,199
much more work on this I think it's very

2503
01:39:52,199 --> 01:39:55,199
important I think it's kind of essential

2504
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:56,699
um and I think this is kind of one of

2505
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:58,440
the most interesting things about these

2506
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,560
psychedelic

2507
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,960
experiences is that

2508
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,460
in some sense like the most extreme

2509
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:07,620
revised model and the most extreme uh

2510
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,179
Phoebus model

2511
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:10,560
could be true for two different

2512
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,900
individuals right someone could say you

2513
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,400
know I went to hell and I was there for

2514
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,800
eight hours straight or

2515
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:17,639
um

2516
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:20,520
or say you know I had a completely

2517
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:23,219
selfless experience I like let go of all

2518
01:40:23,219 --> 01:40:26,040
beliefs and experience you know nothing

2519
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,719
for eight hours straight it was great

2520
01:40:27,719 --> 01:40:30,300
right and like um clearly those involve

2521
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:34,280
like two very different neural regimes

2522
01:40:34,739 --> 01:40:37,080
and I think the nature and you know

2523
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,580
obviously given that they involve the

2524
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:40,260
same drug and they involve not such a

2525
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:43,560
different setting it's obvious that they

2526
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,179
um something very important to do with

2527
01:40:45,179 --> 01:40:46,739
how attention is deployed during this

2528
01:40:46,739 --> 01:40:49,400
experience yeah

2529
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:54,780
yeah just I do think that this Frame of

2530
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:56,699
attention I mean attention is so

2531
01:40:56,699 --> 01:40:59,340
important for for everything and I do

2532
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:00,540
think that there's something interesting

2533
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:03,000
kind of digging into the the attention

2534
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,340
and Elvis uh

2535
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:07,679
framework that um

2536
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,020
yeah I'm really curious to see how

2537
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:13,380
that'll that'll develop I I would also

2538
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:15,199
say that um

2539
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:18,139
in terms of active inference and action

2540
01:41:18,139 --> 01:41:23,040
there is a cost to holding an attention

2541
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,320
um and then you once you know you

2542
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,940
discharge your intention you can release

2543
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:29,040
that cost

2544
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,820
um so I I guess I would have to think

2545
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,800
about how to apply that to the Canal's

2546
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,159
framework

2547
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:40,560
um Fred Barrett um I don't know if he's

2548
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,000
published it yet

2549
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,219
but this is kind of like a follow-up to

2550
01:41:44,219 --> 01:41:46,320
a a cloud Sterling Central model that

2551
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:49,679
Arthur alluded to uh um is emphasizing

2552
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,380
basically um a lack of executive control

2553
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:55,080
and placing that is Central to the

2554
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:56,580
Psychedelic experience like it's not

2555
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:58,800
controlling your mental action and

2556
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,260
directed ways as much and then trying to

2557
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:03,780
come from more of the um types of

2558
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,100
cognition and phenomenology sort of

2559
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,679
psychedelics based on just releasing of

2560
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,080
uh the normal more agentic modes of

2561
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,600
policy selection around attention as

2562
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:15,000
mental action although he uh not using

2563
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,739
active inference speak so

2564
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,460
yes

2565
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:24,000
you have very interesting Adam you're

2566
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,020
um

2567
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:27,719
your introduction there of of course

2568
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:30,540
attention as covert action

2569
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:32,880
which was echoed by by Arthur and

2570
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,280
Michael both of you said

2571
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:39,420
it really introduces uh a case where we

2572
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,400
can use active inference to find

2573
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,080
continuity between what's happening

2574
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,119
inside the agent and outside the agent

2575
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:46,800
because on one hand we could kind of

2576
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,320
take a belief-oriented frame and we

2577
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:50,520
could say well what's happening inside

2578
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,440
the agent are beliefs about things

2579
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:54,000
beliefs about hidden States beliefs

2580
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,340
about observations beliefs about policy

2581
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:58,560
so that's kind of a belief-oriented view

2582
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,020
where everything is framed it basically

2583
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:03,860
cognitively or we could take a very

2584
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:06,239
action-oriented View and then we could

2585
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:08,040
think about the interface in a more

2586
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:11,820
inactive way and then also even the

2587
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:14,940
realm of where where many active

2588
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:17,699
entities uh dare not tread

2589
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:20,340
in mental action with attention as

2590
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:22,679
covert action and so then we have like a

2591
01:43:22,679 --> 01:43:25,920
a total active account

2592
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,040
that is mathematically isomorphic with

2593
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,960
the total belief-based accounts they're

2594
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,580
both just Maps they're not the territory

2595
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:35,280
the territories the person in the room

2596
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,800
so all of this is just talking about the

2597
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,199
formalism and how we choose to interpret

2598
01:43:40,199 --> 01:43:42,600
the formalism in terms of it being more

2599
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:46,500
inferential or it being more active

2600
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,780
um and so there's a lot of

2601
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:50,280
ways to go

2602
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,260
I guess in our closing

2603
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:55,260
minutes I would love to hear

2604
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:57,300
what are the next

2605
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:01,260
moves or what are some areas that you um

2606
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:05,719
would hope that people look into

2607
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:10,280
Michael and then the authors

2608
01:44:10,739 --> 01:44:13,920
okay so I know it's

2609
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,179
um

2610
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:18,540
I think my my favorite mental move is to

2611
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:20,340
try to drop down on my level of

2612
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:23,100
abstraction okay how how is this

2613
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:25,260
implemented um what's what's going on

2614
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:26,520
here and then

2615
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,800
I do think that details of

2616
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,360
implementation

2617
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,580
um are really generative to look into

2618
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:36,360
and like to buy markers and proxies for

2619
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,699
you know figuring out how to have

2620
01:44:38,699 --> 01:44:41,880
parameterize okay exactly how hot is are

2621
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:43,260
we talking about with this temperature

2622
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:45,179
parameter and so on and in different

2623
01:44:45,179 --> 01:44:47,040
parts of the body

2624
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,040
um I I have kind of my

2625
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:52,739
my Niche that I'm I'm working on in the

2626
01:44:52,739 --> 01:44:56,400
Vaso muscular system uh which is a

2627
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,960
rebital but um

2628
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:00,659
yeah I just think that like

2629
01:45:00,659 --> 01:45:02,940
I do think that this

2630
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:05,900
like the Deep canals framework

2631
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:10,679
specifically and the canalization

2632
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:13,440
Paradigm in general

2633
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,100
um

2634
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,260
it's good enough that we should be able

2635
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,600
to dig into mechanisms so I'm I'm

2636
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,440
looking forward to that

2637
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,920
great

2638
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,340
Adam

2639
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,820
or Arthur the government doesn't so um

2640
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:35,100
or Arthur you can go first feel like it

2641
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:36,239
doesn't matter

2642
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:38,639
okay yeah okay sure

2643
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,560
um yeah I mean first I want to Echo this

2644
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:42,840
idea uh I think back to this is very

2645
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:44,280
important this is one of you know the

2646
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,260
people we've talked to about

2647
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:48,960
talked with about deep canals this idea

2648
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,699
of like well this is great you have

2649
01:45:50,699 --> 01:45:52,139
these two axes you know it'd be

2650
01:45:52,139 --> 01:45:53,520
wonderful if there was some like

2651
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,340
biological correlates you could look for

2652
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:58,739
um I think that's incredibly important

2653
01:45:58,739 --> 01:46:00,900
um my background was also in machine

2654
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:04,800
learning uh in deep learning so I'm

2655
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,600
currently doing some work around like

2656
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,820
simulating some of these things I think

2657
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:12,119
uh especially for these Albus Dynamics

2658
01:46:12,119 --> 01:46:14,340
uh

2659
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,679
being able to kind of like study under

2660
01:46:16,679 --> 01:46:18,360
what circumstances you've got these

2661
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:19,920
different kinds of effects even in kind

2662
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,420
of like simple toy models is kind of

2663
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:23,940
important to see how they unfold

2664
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:25,199
um

2665
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:27,540
and then I'm also you know we brought it

2666
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:30,000
up at the end I think it's really

2667
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,739
important it's very interesting to me is

2668
01:46:31,739 --> 01:46:33,540
that the role of the deployment of

2669
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:35,639
attention in this

2670
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:37,619
um and there's lines of work where

2671
01:46:37,619 --> 01:46:39,360
people are trying

2672
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,980
you know various researchers are trying

2673
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:42,840
to connect for example meditation to

2674
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:45,420
psychedelic research and kind of certain

2675
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:47,159
people are trying to tell unified

2676
01:46:47,159 --> 01:46:48,540
stories about

2677
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,619
um

2678
01:46:49,619 --> 01:46:51,300
what's going on in the brain when people

2679
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:52,560
meditate what's going on they're just

2680
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,940
psychedelics

2681
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:55,199
um some of them using these active

2682
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:56,940
imprints models

2683
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:59,040
um but I think in all of these cases the

2684
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,840
deployment of attention and how the

2685
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,340
deployment of tension changes over time

2686
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:05,940
is kind of a key aspect of this

2687
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:08,699
um and it's not as it's not as present

2688
01:47:08,699 --> 01:47:11,580
in the Deep canals model right now but I

2689
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:13,080
think

2690
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,960
any any really robust future kind of

2691
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,179
like model or these things is going to

2692
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:21,860
happen talk about attention quite a bit

2693
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,820
um I guess next steps would be um seeing

2694
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:33,659
how the review process goes but also

2695
01:47:33,659 --> 01:47:34,679
um

2696
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:38,219
I guess helping Arthur to establish a

2697
01:47:38,219 --> 01:47:40,400
field of psychedelic machine learning

2698
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,179
psychedelic inspired machine learning

2699
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:46,040
where we use we try to make systems more

2700
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:48,900
flexible and capable better they can

2701
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:51,420
handle edge cases better imagine better

2702
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:53,340
in terms of real-time policy selection

2703
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:56,280
learn in ways that uh not too much not

2704
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,500
too little

2705
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:01,139
and then maybe you know so that's useful

2706
01:48:01,139 --> 01:48:02,400
potentially earlier like you have a

2707
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,040
driverless vehicle do I change lanes or

2708
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,139
don't I you send it back to the Tesla

2709
01:48:07,139 --> 01:48:08,760
Dojo what do you want to learn what do

2710
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,500
you not wanted to learn

2711
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:13,679
um but then down the line

2712
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:15,739
um

2713
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:19,560
before we even get there you know as

2714
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,000
you're going into this you could see the

2715
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,739
capacity for like a rich bi-directional

2716
01:48:22,739 --> 01:48:25,580
flow between machine learning and

2717
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:27,960
psychedelic inspired machine learning so

2718
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,219
it's like you get a bunch of machine

2719
01:48:29,219 --> 01:48:30,600
Learners together and a bunch of people

2720
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,980
who know a lot about the cognitive

2721
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,360
science and biology and maybe

2722
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,219
phenomenology of psychedelics

2723
01:48:35,219 --> 01:48:37,560
and in addition to designing better

2724
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:38,699
machine Learning Systems they could

2725
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:39,780
probably tell you more about how

2726
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:41,159
psychedelics act and so you can have

2727
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:43,699
this kind of virtuous cycle between

2728
01:48:43,699 --> 01:48:46,619
the biology and the field

2729
01:48:46,619 --> 01:48:48,659
but you keep going with that

2730
01:48:48,659 --> 01:48:50,639
um I guess before we get there we'll

2731
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:52,500
keep going but before we get there

2732
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:53,100
um

2733
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:55,739
very interested in the implications for

2734
01:48:55,739 --> 01:48:58,020
Best Practices so for instance like

2735
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:01,020
there might be like when so oftentimes

2736
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:02,400
you might want semantically neutral

2737
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,320
energy to kind of get them you're

2738
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,719
turning up the heat you're just maybe at

2739
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:08,340
first breaking up you know like home

2740
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:10,679
defenses but the usual structure but

2741
01:49:10,679 --> 01:49:13,139
then the question is at what point do

2742
01:49:13,139 --> 01:49:14,520
you try to direct the canalization

2743
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:17,400
process do you wait till after or maybe

2744
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:20,340
when the when the metal is hot is that a

2745
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:22,199
really good time to do it and so these

2746
01:49:22,199 --> 01:49:23,760
are the kinds and maybe there's no one

2747
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,280
single question this might depend on the

2748
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:28,260
substance the set the setting the dose

2749
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:30,179
the person is so getting Clarity on that

2750
01:49:30,179 --> 01:49:33,060
could be uh faithful for many people in

2751
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:34,320
terms of

2752
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,520
um the outcomes they have and I

2753
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:38,520
specifically what I'm uh gunning for is

2754
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,260
I'm on a mission to make uh compassion

2755
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:44,219
meditation uh treatment as usual for uh

2756
01:49:44,219 --> 01:49:46,739
all psychedelic Psychotherapy and

2757
01:49:46,739 --> 01:49:48,600
preferably All Therapy and so the

2758
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,100
question is like if you're in a state of

2759
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:52,679
enhanced imaginative capacity maybe

2760
01:49:52,679 --> 01:49:54,420
you're having more ability to tune into

2761
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:56,400
your interceptive system whether you've

2762
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,780
just increased the channels or maybe

2763
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:59,219
you're better capable of because maybe

2764
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:00,900
your inflammation went down a bit you

2765
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:02,280
can tune in better because it doesn't

2766
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:04,800
feel it feels better to do so some

2767
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,780
combination that might be a really good

2768
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:08,880
opportunity to do certain meditations

2769
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,679
that might update you in particular ways

2770
01:50:10,679 --> 01:50:12,960
like try to direct the re-annealing

2771
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,520
process maybe not just like afterwards

2772
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:16,500
integration but during the session and

2773
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,540
so if we could get clarity on something

2774
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:20,159
like

2775
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:23,100
um how to catalyze and recanalyze in the

2776
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:24,540
like annealing schedules like it's going

2777
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:26,460
to be complicated but that's I think

2778
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:28,920
where we need to head and then finally

2779
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:32,040
um for all this I'm very uh

2780
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:35,580
that would be enough but um re-centering

2781
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:37,619
the conversation on psychedelics on

2782
01:50:37,619 --> 01:50:39,000
basically meaning and connection would

2783
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,139
be enough

2784
01:50:40,139 --> 01:50:42,780
but I'm wondering uh down the line when

2785
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:44,400
we talk of alignment

2786
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,440
we're talking about our alignment with

2787
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,420
our values and maybe the alignments of

2788
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:50,280
machines with our values

2789
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:51,739
and so

2790
01:50:51,739 --> 01:50:54,540
does this actually end up going to some

2791
01:50:54,540 --> 01:50:55,860
of the conversations that are happening

2792
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:58,619
now about increasingly Advanced Ai and

2793
01:50:58,619 --> 01:51:00,719
our relationships to it could there be a

2794
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:03,239
story of canalization and recanalyzation

2795
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:06,300
uh you want some things to hold fast and

2796
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:07,739
you want some things to be more fluid

2797
01:51:07,739 --> 01:51:10,080
this might be it's always been a timely

2798
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,280
conversation we've always been dealing

2799
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:12,780
with this with us the alignment problem

2800
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:16,260
of us which we often fail but the

2801
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:18,060
alignment problem

2802
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:21,800
that these Technologies were developing

2803
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,920
wow well

2804
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:30,060
so many great topics thank you all

2805
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:33,659
I have in closing turn on tune in actin

2806
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:35,580
first serve

2807
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:37,020
thank you

2808
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:40,100
see you all next time
