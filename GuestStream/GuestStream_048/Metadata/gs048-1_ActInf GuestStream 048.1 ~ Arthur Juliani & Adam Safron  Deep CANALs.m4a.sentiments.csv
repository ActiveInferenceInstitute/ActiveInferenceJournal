4200	4750	A	0.546256959438324	You.
6720	8476	B	0.915437638759613	Hello and welcome everyone.
8658	15244	B	0.9131416082382202	It's Active Inference guest stream number 48.1 on July 19, 2023.
15442	22472	B	0.8444435596466064	We're here with Arthur Giuliani and Adam Safron, also joined by Michael Edward Johnson in discussion.
22616	31888	B	0.8087865710258484	We're going to have a presentation and then a conversation about deep canals, a deep learning approach to refining the cannilization theory of psychopathology.
32064	37620	B	0.9870791435241699	So thank you all for joining and looking forward to this presentation and discussion.
40780	41764	C	0.7058283686637878	Thanks Daniel.
41812	68400	C	0.9415772557258606	I'm very happy to be here with Admin Mike to talk about this work and to discuss more broadly this general direction that's emerged over the past few years to try to utilize some of the concepts from the active inference world and computational modeling more generally to understand what's going on both in psychopathology and in psychedelic therapy.
68920	76630	C	0.7335191965103149	Yeah, so I'll give a brief presentation and we'll move into a kind of more general discussion of this work.
79800	89930	C	0.9092938899993896	It'll start with some kind of general considerations around psychedelic therapy, some of the neuroscience of psychedelics, and then move kind of more specifically into the model.
92220	100636	C	0.7457877993583679	So there is this class of drugs, these serotonergic psychedelic drugs, which include psilocybin, DMT, LSD and others.
100818	117280	C	0.5085880756378174	And the past decade has seen a resurgence of interest in psychedelic therapy, psychedelic assisted psychotherapy, where one or multiple of these drugs is used in conjunction with a kind of psychotherapeutic protocol.
118180	131030	C	0.6277665495872498	And there's been a lot of investment of money and time and clinical resources into utilizing these drugs for treatments depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and others.
132460	144360	C	0.9493241310119629	And there seems to be quite a lot of positive signals suggesting that these kinds of therapeutic interventions can actually be quite effective.
144720	155230	C	0.8175957798957825	So there's a number of studies suggesting that psilocybin assisted psychotherapy can be helpful for depression, anxiety, substance use disorder and others.
155920	181670	C	0.6886793971061707	And as this work advances, there are more and more larger clinical trials comparing it for example, to the standard treatments with SSRIs, with multiple studies suggesting that pilocybin assisted psychotherapy is at least as effective as the Lexapro kind of standard of care.
187170	205460	C	0.7025312185287476	All of this seems to suggest, and the timelines are kind of pointing at this idea, that psilocybin treatment for major depressive disorder may be only a couple of years away from becoming approved as an actual treatment in the United States.
206150	233740	C	0.5166375041007996	Which means that it's quite important for us to understand what's going on mechanistically in the brain so that these kinds of treatments can be best optimized, best determined how to be used for which kinds of mental issues people might be having, and under what kinds of treatment protocols we might expect the most success.
234510	248480	C	0.9485452771186829	I think this will also ultimately, hopefully lead to the development of even better drugs, even better treatment protocols and much more personalized care.
251940	261724	C	0.8754833340644836	So some of the basics of how these drugs work on the brain for those who are unfamiliar, so these are the serotonergic psychedelics.
261852	269572	C	0.8446294665336609	They are serotonergic because they act as agonists for a number of serotonin receptors in the brain and the central nervous system.
269626	283160	C	0.8540222644805908	More broadly, it's thought that most specifically these drugs like psilocybin work through agonizing, the serotonin five H T two A receptor.
284860	303120	C	0.7479144334793091	And this has been demonstrated multiple times by using blockers antagonists of the five H T two A receptor which seem to largely remove the effect of psilocybin or other psychedelic drugs.
304100	311440	C	0.6981754899024963	And what this two A receptor does when it's agonized is it excites the neuron, making it more likely to fire.
311510	315780	C	0.8428537249565125	And this is kind of essential to some of the downstream effects.
317800	329060	C	0.8042283058166504	So given that it seems that this two way receptor that psychedelics are mainly targeting, the question then becomes well, where in the brain are these two A receptors?
329140	331480	C	0.8618311882019043	Most widely expressed?
332300	338984	C	0.8925055861473083	And research has focused on, I would say, three kind of key areas over the past decade or so.
339102	345340	C	0.8609541058540344	The first being the thalamus, which is a region involved in the gating of sensory information into the cortex.
345680	358336	C	0.6305974125862122	There's a lot of expression in the cortex itself, expression for example, in the visual system, which is perhaps not surprising given the prevalence of visual hallucinations and psychedelic use.
358518	367408	C	0.8420325517654419	But therapeutically a lot of focus has been on the prefrontal cortex where there is also a dense expression of these receptors.
367584	380360	C	0.9008094668388367	And then also more recent work has looked at the claustrom which is a small brain region responsible for coordinating the transition dynamics of cortical activation.
381260	386170	C	0.7817723155021667	And this too is likely of central importance to the psychedelic effect.
390080	404790	C	0.8090062737464905	So kind of moving up one level of abstraction to fMRI studies, there are a few kind of like key takeaways which have been identified from a few different fMRI studies looking at psychedelic use.
405960	418360	C	0.7272675633430481	Kind of the main theme has largely been this idea of increased entropy or increased complexity of the cortical activation in the brain.
419420	421690	C	0.8726093173027039	So there are various measures of this.
423180	438300	C	0.9123280048370361	On the right here there's a figure of one of the common measures of complexity and looking at various different kinds of states that an individual might be in and how that relates to complexity.
438820	460340	C	0.7249211072921753	So you have individuals in vegetative states or anesthesized states having relatively low brain activity complexity, you have individuals in awake states having higher complexity and then individuals who have ingested either psilocybin or LSD showing the highest brain complexity.
462680	474840	C	0.854090690612793	Now, along with this, rather than just this kind of like single unified score, there's work looking particularly at the changes in functional connectivity between different brain regions or different brain networks.
475580	491808	C	0.543979823589325	And the general trend seems to be that you have decreased within network functional connectivity and increase between network functional connectivity, which this kind of can be interpreted as different brain networks which typically don't communicate as much with each.
491814	503860	C	0.7338422536849976	Other, more likely to communicate with each other undo the effects of psychedelics and the kind of like internal coherence of networks is reduced under psychedelics.
505400	521400	C	0.6133660674095154	People have maybe heard of this default mode network right, which is responsible for a lot of self referential processing which is responsible, which is typically activated, for example, when individuals are off task, mind wandering, not actively engaged.
522940	533180	C	0.5924451351165771	The default mode network has been kind of consistently implicated in being having less of this kind of like within network connectivity, less of this functional integration.
533840	541760	C	0.8570390939712524	And this has been hypothesized to be one of the kind of key mechanisms of the therapeutic effect of psychedelics.
545860	561030	C	0.6859031319618225	In addition to looking at kind of like brain network activity on a high level, you can then also zoom in much more deeply and look at what's actually going on at the neuron by neuron level or the neuron connectivity level.
562680	577760	C	0.7859331369400024	Here we see kind of very certain, very consistent story around this psychoplastogenic effect or this neuroplastogenic effect, where there are a number of different markers of increased plasticity in the brain.
577940	594668	C	0.8379608988761902	So one that's very common is this increased brain derived neurotropic factor which we see hours after psychedelic use for a variety of different psychedelic drugs.
594844	607568	C	0.840307891368866	And this is then accompanied a few hours later by visible increases in the dendritic spine growth in cortical parameter neurons.
607744	614016	C	0.858059823513031	So this is both the number of dendritic spines and the complexity of the spines.
614128	627080	C	0.8511717915534973	You can see a very clear example of this here on the right, where you have on the top the vehicle and then the bottom the DMT treated pyramidal neuron.
627580	630136	C	0.63947993516922	And the difference is very stark.
630168	639980	C	0.6227684617042542	You don't even have to do any sort of actual computational analysis for it to be clear that there's quite significant dendritic growth from a single dosing.
642180	655940	C	0.8580102324485779	And the changes to functional connectivity, which I mentioned in the previous slide, tend to persist, though in a less extreme form than what we see during the acute effects.
658440	676120	C	0.8126651644706726	So the question then becomes, given all of this, how can we attempt to tell a consistent computational story, what's actually going on during both the acute effects, the post acute effects, and in terms of the actual downstream therapeutic outcomes?
678480	693760	C	0.90277498960495	So what's kind of been proposed as one of the leading models of this is the relaxed belief under psychedelics model, the Rebus model of Carhartt, Harris and Tristan.
694260	710580	C	0.8380227088928223	And so this builds on the kind of like active inference, hierarchical predictive processing framework where we can understand the brain as this series of predictors stacked kind of like hierarchically along brain networks.
711400	722520	C	0.6215383410453796	And predictions are being made by higher level networks that are attempting to predict the errors of lower level networks.
724060	733180	C	0.8886581063270569	And the process of basically doing this then produces this series of belief landscapes at different levels of spatiotemporal abstraction.
735040	741280	C	0.8851575255393982	And these belief landscapes, of course, can encode beliefs with various levels of precision.
742660	750850	C	0.8390126824378967	And it's the modulation of the precision of these beliefs which is believed to take place under psychedelic use.
754750	764222	C	0.8636962175369263	So here's kind of like a very high level version of this Rebus model and how belief relaxation might actually happen, right?
764276	772862	C	0.8810394406318665	So given that you have this series of cortical networks which are representing beliefs at different spatiotemporal scales.
773006	787014	C	0.8509902954101562	We can kind of think of the thalamus as being kind of like the entry point where sensory information is being gated into this hierarchical system and the prefrontal cortex as being kind of like one of the highest level.
787052	801900	C	0.7672350406646729	Networks, which is then responsible for both representing the most abstract kinds of beliefs as well as being kind of the primary inhibiting force for all of the downstream beliefs in the network, in the system.
803070	810080	C	0.7505780458450317	So what is this heavy agonism of the five h T two A receptor supposed to be doing in this case?
810530	827410	C	0.806639552116394	Well, it's going to be decreasing the prefrontal cortex's ability to make coherent predictions and coherent representations of belief, which will then disrupt its ability to inhibit lower levels of the cortical hierarchy.
827830	842302	C	0.6997504234313965	At the same time, by disrupt this activation of the Salamic or this disruption of the thalamic gating is going to result in additional sensory information entering the cortex that wouldn't underwise enter the cortex.
842466	857338	C	0.6873347163200378	You have these kind of disruptions at these two levels which then result in beliefs being spontaneously represented in ways that they wouldn't normally be represented.
857434	867070	C	0.8700312972068787	And the Rebus model at least is suggesting that this mainly is going to manifest itself as a kind of relaxation of these beliefs.
870470	876740	C	0.8748423457145691	So here is a kind of like very simple diagram of what this might look like.
877270	901094	C	0.920127272605896	So you have some landscape of beliefs here and you can kind of interpret the position along the X and Y or, I guess, the X and Z belief in A as being corresponding to some particular belief that might be represented by the network at this layer or at this level of representation.
901222	906314	C	0.8854967355728149	And then the Y axis, the height as being the actual precision of that belief.
906362	906958	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
907124	917594	C	0.5504606366157532	So here we have this kind of very deep part on the right part of this network or on this landscape and this would be a very strongly represented belief.
917642	934034	C	0.7358019351959229	Let's say what the acute effects of psychedelics are then understood to be doing right is to be flattening this landscape to be less strongly representing these strongly represented beliefs to maybe making it easier for the reversal of this landscape.
934082	958430	C	0.7105241417884827	So to move from one attractor state to another tractor state, which is meant to be understood to be kind of therapeutic in various ways, and then the post acute effect being some kind of return to normalcy, but one that is not totally complete, one that still incorporates some of these newly relaxed beliefs, these newly explored beliefs.
963560	983880	C	0.7651395201683044	Building on this rebus model, karin Harris and colleagues last year proposed this canal model of psychopathology, which basically kind of takes the intuition that the relaxation, if the Reevis model is correct, if the relaxation of beliefs has a therapeutic outcome.
984220	1005170	C	0.5071154236793518	If you kind of take that way of thinking to its logical conclusion, you might then propose something like this, which would say if relaxing overly strong beliefs therapeutic, then having overly strong beliefs in the first place is pathological in some kind of way.
1006580	1023140	C	0.695108950138092	And they refer to this development of these overly strongly represented beliefs as canalized beliefs and this problem generally as canalization or this process of developing them as canalization.
1023800	1026268	C	0.6691644787788391	And this is the canal model of psych pathology.
1026304	1039260	C	0.6507602334022522	So they kind of build on this idea, this set of previous work in the literature suggesting that there may be some primary factor of psychopathology and they suggest that this primary factor is canalization.
1040080	1051020	C	0.7468775510787964	And in this work they discuss a number of different psychopathologies which seem to quite clearly fit this canalization type characterization.
1051180	1059696	C	0.6560739278793335	So it's very relatively straightforward I think, to understand things like addiction, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders.
1059808	1085180	C	0.5007461309432983	All of these involve in one way or another having some strongly held beliefs, typically negative, negative beliefs in the case of like, depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive, body image disorder, or in the case of substance use disorder, some very strong beliefs about what kind of behaviors should be taken at any given time in any given context.
1087440	1102480	C	0.5976871252059937	And then of course, the effect of psychedelics is to undo canalization and the better able any sort of therapeutic intervention is to undo canalization, the more likely for a positive therapeutic outcome.
1104660	1110230	C	0.9348636269569397	So I think this work has a lot of strengths and there's a kind of elegance to it.
1111800	1139020	C	0.5110737681388855	In our deep Pinal's work that we've worked on, we kind of identify a couple of limitations of this canal model and attempt to extend and refine the model in ways that I think ultimately make it more powerful, while kind of keeping the essential elegant insight that cannibalization is kind of like intimately tied to pathology.
1140720	1155250	C	0.7825018763542175	So the first kind of limitation I think that we identify is that in the canal model it's very heavily implied that all forms of canalization are pathological in one way or another.
1155620	1162980	C	0.8350815773010254	And as I mentioned just now, this is clearly the case for a large class of very common psychopathologies.
1164120	1172410	C	0.7055701613426208	It's when we start to look more towards edge cases, I think that these exceptions start to problematize this understanding, right?
1173340	1190540	C	0.6417927742004395	So if we consider psychopathologies such as bipolar, borderline schizophrenia, depersonalization disorder, it becomes much more difficult to kind of easily classify these as simply problems of overly strong priors.
1190880	1205250	C	0.8525643348693848	In many cases here we have problems of priors that are not so strong or priors that seem to drift over time in ways that are problematic for both the individual and the people that the individual are close to.
1206580	1229016	C	0.4959715008735657	And if we think about psychedelics then as being this kind of panacea to undo cannibalization and undo psychopathology, we also run into this other issue which is that there are certain kinds of psychopathologies which are typically issues for use with psychedelics, right?
1229038	1240380	C	0.5525590181350708	So schizophrenia being a very clear one, where there's evidence of psychedelic use being a trigger for the onset of psychosis in individuals who are predisposed to schizophrenia.
1241920	1248130	C	0.851110577583313	There's also evidence of the development of depersonalization disorders with strong psychedelic use.
1248900	1259620	C	0.6124557256698608	And this is not what we would expect if psychedelics were simply universally undoing or getting rid of psychopathologies.
1260760	1273672	C	0.6039247512817383	There's also this idea, which I think Adam is going to develop quite a bit later, that the stability of beliefs is typically correlated with positive mental health outcomes, not negative ones.
1273806	1281210	C	0.7950876951217651	And what is a stable belief if not one that is highly analyzed in some kind of meaningful sense within the system?
1286240	1313830	C	0.7558278441429138	And a second limitation is that if you think about an actual dynamical system, one that is parameterized in some kind of meaningful way, like a brain, which is parameterized by synaptic connections and then instantiates neural activity patterns over time, and we think about what kinds of optimization landscapes are actually being induced by such a system.
1315800	1322280	C	0.7376002073287964	We find that there's not just one kind of canalization, there's actually two kinds of canalization.
1324060	1336460	C	0.5751562714576721	And in our deep canals work, we attempt to kind of take inspiration from deep learning literature to tease apart these two kinds of canalization and understand them a bit more clearly.
1338000	1345100	C	0.6079096794128418	And they are just to kind of give a preview these two different things, overfitting and plasticity loss.
1345600	1361984	C	0.6122703552246094	So overfitting is the problem of your canalized in a particular kind of way and whatever sort of policy you've learned, whatever sort of set of beliefs you have, these don't generalize to some other context.
1362112	1374744	C	0.6169266700744629	You're in context A, you may be very well adapted, you move to context B and whatever you've learned doesn't apply there, then plasticity loss is a little bit different.
1374942	1382808	C	0.5970170497894287	Plasticity loss has to do with not one's ability to generalize, but rather one's ability to adapt or to learn.
1382894	1388508	C	0.6028605699539185	So imagine you're in context A, you may or may not be well adapted to context A.
1388594	1395200	C	0.796019971370697	If you move to context B, the question becomes are you able to adapt to context B or not?
1395350	1395664	C	0.45971304178237915	Not.
1395702	1399504	C	0.8719891309738159	Are you immediately already ready to deal with context B?
1399622	1403410	C	0.8454333543777466	But given time in context B, can you learn and change?
1405700	1411510	C	0.6483786106109619	And we use a very simple recurrent neural network model to kind of make sense of this.
1412360	1427080	C	0.6477606296539307	And I think this is important because there can be different kinds of canalization on these different kinds of optimization landscapes and these have unique implications for the treatment of psychopathology.
1427500	1433980	C	0.7441880106925964	And I think even more importantly, psychedelics work on these different landscapes in different ways.
1434130	1445020	C	0.5260972380638123	And so understanding how they work is essential to developing better drugs, better treatment protocols and more personalized treatment.
1447700	1451436	C	0.8669694066047668	Okay, so what are these two optimization landscapes?
1451468	1453010	C	0.5857897996902466	How can we make sense of them?
1454740	1459490	C	0.8822606801986694	This is kind of like the big overview figure of the deep canal's work.
1461060	1464436	C	0.9018637537956238	So we kind of start with this intuition of a recurrent neural network, right?
1464458	1469716	C	0.8367811441421509	And in a recurrent neural network there are these two sets of parameters that you have at any given time.
1469818	1476856	C	0.8529149889945984	You have the actual weights of the network and then you have the hidden activation of the network, right?
1476878	1484910	C	0.9052035212516785	And so the weights of the network are theta and the hidden activation is h and there's some input into the network at any given time step.
1485840	1491628	C	0.8007742166519165	And then the output of the network is a function of both the input and the hidden state.
1491794	1495900	C	0.8864284157752991	And the hidden state is updated at every time the hidden activation pattern.
1497440	1501040	C	0.8437097668647766	And this gives us essentially these two different landscapes.
1501620	1505356	C	0.9027408361434937	One, what we refer to as the inference landscape or the type A landscape.
1505388	1509108	C	0.8620737791061401	And this is equivalent to the neural activation pattern of a brain at any time.
1509194	1529690	C	0.8976232409477234	So what gets read off from an fMRI, what gets read off from the EEG is going to correspond to this activity landscape, but kind of like underlying or supporting this activity landscape is this other more fundamental landscape which is the actual optimization landscape that is induced by the synaptic weights themselves.
1531340	1540344	C	0.846653938293457	And this is what is the result of right click synaptic connectivity in the brain between all the sets of neurons in the brain.
1540392	1545390	C	0.6735153794288635	This is what is changing when we have various forms of heavy and plasticity heavy in learning.
1547840	1555792	C	0.7884604930877686	And this is what kind of instantiates the possible sets of neural activity patterns, right?
1555846	1566020	C	0.8266238570213318	So this is kind of like a way we can start to understand this, which is when we think about belief landscapes, right?
1566090	1571764	C	0.8116356134414673	As I mentioned before, here's a very simple diagram where we have a two dimensional belief landscape.
1571892	1580772	C	0.8967424035072327	And let's say there's someone who's depressed or potentially depressed and they might have a negative self image.
1580836	1584152	C	0.9796755313873291	I'm a terrible person, I can't do anything right.
1584206	1585112	C	0.8318331241607666	Something like this.
1585246	1590360	C	0.8839020729064941	This would be encoded as a particular position in this belief landscape.
1590940	1596610	C	0.8587953448295593	When the neural activity pattern looks like this, this belief is what gets expressed, right?
1598340	1610070	C	0.9401799440383911	And there's another set of neural activity patterns which would correspond to a positive self image, a positive self belief, I'm great, I'm wonderful, or even just, I'm okay, I'm totally acceptable as a person.
1610520	1613060	C	0.7995145916938782	And this would be a different set of patterns.
1614200	1623940	C	0.8347576856613159	So based on the synaptic, the actual connectivity structure of the brain, these two patterns may be more or less likely.
1624020	1636830	C	0.9120665192604065	So here these are being represented by these two different sets of neural activation landscapes which are the result of two different positions in this synaptic weight landscape space.
1637200	1662660	C	0.7695475816726685	And in this top space, the one that's in the middle of here that then is represented here at the top of part C of the figure, we see that there's very high precision assigned to or very high likelihood assigned to the negative self image and very low likelihood here assigned to the positive self image.
1663240	1672612	C	0.8826314806938171	But in some other part of the synaptic weight landscape, a very different kind of neural activity landscape might be instantiated.
1672756	1681640	C	0.6755869388580322	And this one kind of has the inverse properties where negative self image is unlikely and positive self image is much more likely.
1682080	1694636	C	0.9059608578681946	So we can kind of then understand positions in the neural activity landscape as kind of corresponding to specific phenomenological experiential instantiations of certain kinds of beliefs, right?
1694658	1701520	C	0.710453450679779	So like the actual experience of holding a negative self image or holding a positive self image.
1702660	1708500	C	0.8910646438598633	And we can understand positions in the synaptic weight landscape as being something more general.
1708570	1729450	C	0.5402224659919739	So in the case of depression, there might be a specific set of synaptic weight connectivity which would correspond to what you might call a depressed individual, someone who might qualify as having major depressive disorder and another set of synaptic weights connectivity pattern that wouldn't qualify as that.
1734390	1745960	C	0.8885924816131592	Okay, so before I get into the psychedelic, how psychedelics relate to this, I think Adam is going to talk a little bit about some work he's done extending the.
1761410	1762160	D	0.5208580493927002	Hello.
1763570	1776258	D	0.8020229339599609	So, yeah, I've been thinking about this a while and then along the way I met Arthur, who also has been thinking about this a while, but in different ways.
1776344	1796166	D	0.8534877300262451	And so like Arthur's background is in basically consciousness science and a very peculiar field of computational consciousness science in terms of actual models of what it would be to have a conscious system, even potentially an artificially conscious system.
1796348	1805530	D	0.6061161160469055	And so I'm coming from more free energy principle and active inference, my background and Arthur's coming from more mainstream machine learning.
1805680	1817150	D	0.9546509981155396	And so we were coming together to explore this beast from different perspectives and been finding a lot of, I think, very interesting overlap.
1817650	1824660	D	0.8782564997673035	And so in terms of Albus, the basic idea is to take Rebus and expand on it.
1825590	1826930	D	0.9763416051864624	I love rebus.
1827270	1836014	D	0.909958004951477	It's a great framework and I've been trying to make it, I guess, more flexible in terms of being able to handle a wider range of assumptions.
1836062	1841990	D	0.5808541774749756	So not just talking about relaxed beliefs, but also potentially strengthened beliefs and in different combinations.
1842570	1845058	D	0.840250551700592	This was always part of the rebus framework.
1845154	1848754	D	0.834242045879364	And that you can have all sorts of both direct and indirect effects.
1848802	1856694	D	0.7902587652206421	When you're dealing with a large predictive hierarchy or any complex system, you change something in one way, but then you'll get an effect elsewhere.
1856742	1867098	D	0.765949010848999	So if you have this hierarchy of predictions, for instance, you can potentially relax beliefs at higher levels and that can indirectly cause strengthened beliefs at lower levels.
1867194	1872110	D	0.6172098517417908	So you can both get relaxed and strengthened beliefs and psychedelics and all sorts of different combinations.
1872630	1880862	D	0.8588923811912537	And so with Albus the idea is so I've been calling as opposed to a belief relaxation.
1881006	1887046	D	0.6075103282928467	When you get this sort of basically bottom right here, you might see it.
1887068	1909370	D	0.7135541439056396	So this red would be basically something like a synchronized complex of neural activity, often involving the thalamus, which would be thought to encode your predictions, or your top down stream of priors, which then are suppressing the ascending stream of prediction errors.
1909790	1919066	D	0.8215190172195435	And so under revis, you're seeing here relaxed predictions, a smaller complex of synchronized activity.
1919178	1920398	D	0.6544363498687744	And the gates are down.
1920484	1922954	D	0.7979996800422668	Just like Arthur described, more things are coming in.
1923092	1931406	D	0.8906244039535522	Rebus will sometimes be described in terms of so when we're talking about rebus this idea of relaxing beliefs.
1931438	1940962	D	0.733029842376709	We're thinking at the functional or computational level, like with David Mars and analyzing the mind, you have these three, I suppose, Supervenient levels.
1941026	1942914	D	0.9251870512962341	They're compatible and synergistic.
1942962	1948360	D	0.8751750588417053	So computational functional, like abstractly, what is the system doing?
1948890	1958374	D	0.8959364295005798	Something like the pseudocode of the system and then implementational mechanistically how it's realized and then in the middle, some sort of algorithmic intermediate abstraction layer.
1958502	1961206	D	0.8653734922409058	How are these computations realized via these mechanisms?
1961238	1962246	D	0.7892265319824219	Some bridging.
1962278	1963682	D	0.7126259803771973	Principle description.
1963846	1968986	D	0.6741353273391724	And so when it comes to rebus, you can adopt it in different ways and relate to it differently.
1969018	1978482	D	0.8815215229988098	So you can relate to it at the functional level or you can relate to it at the algorithmic or implementational levels in terms of where you're taking the account.
1978536	1986958	D	0.649439811706543	So, for instance, you might think something like rebus effects is a very valuable model of something like what they call quantum change of psychedelics.
1987054	1992818	D	0.8260370492935181	But you don't necessarily believe in predictive processing, but you still might be, you could say like a rebus type theorist.
1992994	2008460	D	0.8632239103317261	Or you might be thinking in terms of rebus in a more narrow sense of thinking, of predictive processing information flows, but then when you get to the overall person and integrated organism and the agent, you might have different interpretations there.
2009070	2025258	D	0.7672178149223328	So with the work with Albus, basically the idea would be to take predictive processing and models of psychedelic action and suggest that sometimes not only do we have these relaxation of belief landscapes, but we might have the opposite of strengthening.
2025434	2044550	D	0.7766686081886292	And so specifically, if you're activating these five HD two A neurons, which would be at the deeper levels of the cortical sheet and also the deeper levels of the cortical hierarchy, more inwards and higher up, and these would be the units that would loop to the thalamus and thereby be able to form large synchronous integrated complexes.
2045210	2051974	D	0.5749253630638123	But that when you excite them too much, they don't wait for each other to sync up, they fire whenever they can out of sync.
2052022	2054102	D	0.706534206867218	And this relaxes the belief landscape.
2054246	2061670	D	0.556907057762146	However, it's not clear this should happen the whole way through for any amount of increasing the gain on these neurons.
2061750	2078130	D	0.6835644245147705	So in theory, just increasing the gain a little bit, unless that might help them to sync up, that might strengthen the belief, whether it's a situationally specific suggestion of you in this context or maybe something old coming to the surface and if you will manifesting.
2078950	2095270	D	0.8295391201972961	So Albus basically, in a nutshell, would be saying to take rebus and keep going with it and look for different combinations of both strengthened, both directly and indirectly strengthened and relaxed beliefs.
2095850	2097046	D	0.5901709198951721	That's basically it.
2097148	2099510	D	0.7619736194610596	And so I'm not going to go into too many more details.
2099590	2102278	D	0.8469831943511963	Arthur and I just submitted this for publication.
2102374	2103414	D	0.7333316206932068	Wish us luck.
2103542	2113834	D	0.7963641881942749	Hopefully the reviewers will be useful, maybe even kind, but preferably useful, and kick it back to Arthur.
2113882	2121982	D	0.5478248596191406	But before work, I think it's immensely important that we get these details, right?
2122116	2142754	D	0.4135500490665436	These are extremely powerful medicines that could revolutionize things or we could have a backlash if we do it wrong, if we're careless, if we don't see the risks, but also if we're overly beholden to a single way of viewing things prematurely, we might also miss opportunities to help, potentially enormous opportunities.
2142882	2149794	D	0.6614620685577393	For instance, you might not think of helping people, for instance, micro dosing for cognitive decline.
2149922	2154938	D	0.5338551998138428	You might not have thought of that and that might be a really big deal that you do think of that.
2155104	2163690	D	0.8174494504928589	So I guess for going back to Arthur, one more thing would be just in terms of, at least for me, experientially.
2163770	2178286	D	0.6751718521118164	The way I sometimes think of it is with relation to well being and suffering, both things matter, like the strength of your positive beliefs and the strength of your negative beliefs.
2178318	2180974	D	0.6726606488227844	And sometimes the negative beliefs have positive aspects and vice versa.
2181022	2200060	D	0.6872657537460327	So it's both like you might relax your beliefs and to use like a Harry Potter metaphor be somewhat so much out of the grip of the dementors that usually that under some circumstances might be pursuing you that you have room to be different, to become different, to think different things under this different state.
2200830	2214240	D	0.5892786979675293	But additionally, and not mutually exclusively, not necessarily incompatibly maybe synergistically the strength of what beliefs you're able to have in that moment and maybe draw upon from the past could be deeply important.
2215090	2220400	D	0.6672967672348022	Your values, the kinds of beliefs that you call upon in times of need and they give you hope.
2220770	2223850	D	0.8743265271186829	Maybe those are just originally suggested to you right there in the session.
2223930	2229314	D	0.6161991953849792	But maybe there's something else, another belief, and that strengthening it could be a good thing.
2229352	2240120	D	0.6007142663002014	And even without a clinical context, like microdosers, for instance, it's not clear exactly they're trying to relax their beliefs, like the range of use cases, the way we want to relate them and how we want to be in the world.
2241290	2243158	D	0.6489258408546448	It seems complicated to me.
2243324	2247670	D	0.8839972615242004	So I will take it back to Arthur.
2258000	2258412	C	0.7671424746513367	Great.
2258466	2258684	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2258722	2259980	C	0.9725360870361328	Thanks so much, Adam.
2261040	2274420	C	0.8267872929573059	OK, so with that context of Alice, I want to talk a little bit about how we might understand at a very high level what psychedelics are doing to these two belief landscapes.
2275080	2278710	C	0.7060658931732178	So before I showed you very quickly, I guess I can go back to it.
2279240	2296430	C	0.841644287109375	In the Rebus model there's only one type of optimization landscape and so there's only one type of canalization and what is supposed to be happening is a relaxation of leaves which is strong during the acute effect and persists in the post acute effect.
2298000	2303020	C	0.7655025124549866	So with albus though, we might be able to think about all of this a little bit differently.
2304160	2319936	C	0.7288103103637695	We can, enduring the acute effects of psychedelics, interpret what's happening to the type A landscape as being less of a kind of universal relaxation and more of a kind of destabilization where under certain circumstances beliefs are being strengthened, other beliefs.
2319968	2321472	C	0.6472197771072388	Are being relaxed.
2321616	2326692	C	0.7603234648704529	This is changing quite rapidly over the course of time.
2326826	2335800	C	0.6077364683151245	So a certain belief might be transiently strengthened a few minutes later, it may no longer be supported or supportable.
2337900	2349180	C	0.6090851426124573	And this actually functionally enables a kind of exploration of a wide space of belief instantiations during the acute effects of the drug.
2352320	2364844	C	0.7602587342262268	As far as the inference landscape is concerned, post acute effects, as Adam was saying, it could be the fact that certain positive beliefs are explored and can be strengthened, other negative beliefs might be weakened.
2364972	2368080	C	0.676476776599884	This is kind of like the ideal psychotherapeutic outcome.
2369860	2376692	C	0.7166452407836914	It may be on average that something like a relaxation, a general relaxation of beliefs is what you might see.
2376826	2384616	C	0.6482554078102112	But the way that you get there is likely going to be through a kind of much more complicated process, I think.
2384638	2404024	C	0.5446337461471558	What's then interesting and related also to what Adam said about thinking much more broadly about how psychedelics might be used in terms of neurocognitive disorders, in addition to kind of like traditional psychopathologies is to think about what's happening to the learning landscape, the kind of like underlying synaptic weight landscape.
2404152	2414988	C	0.7545207738876343	And what do we understand is happening here kind of quite clearly is there is neurogenesis psychoplastogenic effects, there's dendritic growth.
2415084	2416284	C	0.5017897486686707	And what is this enabling?
2416332	2421860	C	0.8712365627288818	Well, this is enabling greater connectivity between, within and between networks.
2423240	2435852	C	0.7170538306236267	And so kind of from a functional learning perspective, learning theory perspective, what this means is that gradient information can flow more easily through these networks.
2436016	2440708	C	0.5655857920646667	And what this means is that it's easier to get from one part of the network to the other part of the network.
2440804	2449950	C	0.6520588397979736	There are fewer of these kind of optimization local minima, there are fewer of these kind of tricky saddle points.
2451360	2457970	C	0.684171199798584	And what this means kind of like functionally is that this plasticity loss that I discussed earlier is going to be less of an issue.
2459220	2472832	C	0.7265117168426514	And here it seems to be kind of like regardless of the acute, the actual phenomenological effects, there are very strong downstream effects on this structural connectivity.
2472976	2482436	C	0.8798885941505432	And I think there's some interesting work suggesting that there may actually be independent mechanisms that are affecting these two landscapes.
2482468	2507612	C	0.7891666889190674	So there's recent work suggesting for example that psychedelics as well as ketamine is able to kind of particularly bind to receptors in the brain that produce that result in the kind of release of the brain derived neurotrophic factor and then the downstream changes in synaptic weighting and that this may be potentially totally independent of the five H C two a agonism.
2507676	2508290	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
2510420	2514720	C	0.9051663279533386	And this has very interesting implications for future drug design and development.
2516500	2528310	C	0.8775938153266907	Okay, so I'm going to, before my next slide, turn it over to Adam once more to briefly talk a bit about personality theory and the relationship between psychedelics and.
2532090	2533160	D	0.5446026921272278	Hello again.
2537290	2558890	D	0.8104512691497803	So for the past few years I've been doing some work with a personality researcher, Colin de Jung, on intersections between the way agency is modeled in the free energy principle and active inference framework and the way that persons are considered in different situations in personality science and looking for points of intersection.
2562770	2565066	D	0.6539395451545715	Personality is actually an extremely deep concept.
2565098	2581266	D	0.8406445384025574	And if you think of it, I guess we call it like the normal form of a system in terms of what is the way you can describe the most of the system with like the minimal message length, the account for the most of the least.
2581448	2591826	D	0.6143977046012878	And what we're trying to account for is the states that people tend to occupy, people aren't always happy, people aren't always sad, people aren't always friendly, they're not always angry.
2591858	2598266	D	0.7827854752540588	It's all sorts of things that there's a range that people are encountering but they tend to occupy some states more than others.
2598368	2610320	D	0.8233642578125	And you might call that their personality and you might call it many systems would have their own personalities in terms of trying to describe something like their essence and so they're attracting states.
2610850	2633106	D	0.8100804090499878	And so with Colin de Jung's work, he interprets personality and these major domains of personality that people have discovered a reliable factor structure ways you can chunk the variance, the big five as a trait hierarchy but where these different traits are interpreted as cybernetic control parameters.
2633298	2654394	D	0.8861942291259766	Specifically cybernetics in terms of the study of goal seeking systems governed by various forms of feedback that different stages of the process of pursuing goals, evaluating outcomes updating understanding that basically the personality as different modes of being in the world.
2654432	2662800	D	0.725701093673706	For cybernetic systems, interpreting them as parameters for goal pursuit because we are goal seeking systems trying to pursue the goals we value.
2664370	2675570	D	0.8922017216682434	And so I guess moving to this with relation to what we're talking about now, both in terms of personality formation, reformation and the structure of personality.
2679750	2680066	C	0.5602861046791077	To.
2680088	2696710	D	0.7202925086021423	Get to the P factor within personality theory, this big five traits, the set of big five traits, there's a richer or more detailed factor structure, a hierarchical structure for personality that's been discovered.
2696870	2706090	D	0.6720550060272217	So above the Big Five, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, you'll have a metatrate of their shared various that's observed called stability.
2706430	2708830	D	0.9008101224899292	It's also been called alpha by, I think, Digman.
2709490	2722900	D	0.5328626036643982	And then above the traits of extroversion and openness intellect, you have this MetaTrade of plasticity and are called beta and the shared variants of these two.
2723270	2737714	D	0.6095260977745056	So what's interesting is that within this field of within high top, which is this effort to try to characterize psychopathology using the same kind of data driven methods in personality science.
2737842	2754710	D	0.6579680442810059	A principled account of the structure of psychopathology, the way that personality has a structure and trying to account for this, there seems to be a common factor across many forms of psychopathology that's referred to as the P factor and it tends to be the inverse of stability.
2754790	2760634	D	0.7968044877052307	It's high neuroticism, low agreeableness and low conscientiousness.
2760762	2774290	D	0.5156024098396301	And this is actually what's referred to in the article as this P factor, thinking of it as a lack of flexibility.
2774710	2776066	D	0.7994981408119202	You could make a case for it.
2776088	2779422	D	0.6809662580490112	But more straightforwardly it seems to be a lack of stability.
2779566	2787554	D	0.4960547387599945	For something to be a lack of flexibility you would maybe be thinking of something more like plasticity, like someone having low plasticity.
2787602	2789938	D	0.5847724080085754	But empirically that's not what's observed.
2790034	2796186	D	0.627274215221405	And so if empirically that's not what's observed, that's a very important detail we should stop and take note of.
2796288	2807550	D	0.5228766202926636	So you might say that rather than emphasizing the first principal component of psychopathology, it's possible that this Canal model is actually focusing on the second factor.
2808610	2810030	D	0.6335509419441223	It's not a contest.
2810530	2818202	D	0.6673168540000916	It's still enormously a big factor like the work of Stephen Hayes and others showing that a lack of flexibility is transdiagnostic.
2818346	2831330	D	0.6083893775939941	But just empirically speaking, the first principal component of psychopathology might be more closely related to a lack of stability rather than insufficient plasticity.
2833210	2845634	D	0.6956343650817871	I guess one more thing to think of in terms of stability and like as it's not exactly a contest, they're both important, both need to be considered and they're deeply interrelated.
2845682	2849654	D	0.8375181555747986	So Colin describes them as being in a state of something like dynamic tension.
2849782	2864542	D	0.695745050907135	Like if you're insufficiently plastic and inflexible, you're not going to stay stable for long in a changing world, but if you don't have a stable base to move from, it's going to be hard to be plastic and reconfigure yourself in a sustainable way either.
2864676	2875630	D	0.8121249079704285	However, you could also see someone being overly rigid and excessive stability in a way that undermines their plasticity or overly flexible in a way that basically is destabilizing.
2875710	2879698	D	0.7880581617355347	So a dynamic tension but involving synergies also.
2879864	2888626	D	0.6937050819396973	And I think in terms of the structure of personality and well being, this is what we need to keep in mind that both are needed, stability and plasticity.
2888658	2906060	D	0.8197227120399475	And this is also just within it's actually what this was inspired, I think in Colin's thinking to consider these metatrades this way from machine learning, I think actually reading Grossberg and Stability plasticity trade offs and that's why he interpreted these metatrades in those terms.
2906990	2924210	D	0.6265720725059509	So I guess one more thing is there is a Petersonian backstory here that I don't know if I want to get into, but we can discuss it later if there's yeah, back to Arthur.
2926630	2927314	C	0.9827191829681396	That was great.
2927352	2927602	C	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
2927656	2937470	C	0.9244911670684814	Adams yeah, very, very helpful context which should hopefully make this slide here much more clear to everyone.
2940000	2963540	C	0.6475210189819336	So given these kind of, like, two meta traits, stability and plasticity, which, as Adam beautifully described you're in this kind of dynamic tension with one another, we can kind of go back to these two optimization landscapes and these machine learning concepts that I discussed earlier and couldn't try to understand how these things might all relate and ultimately relate to psychopathology.
2964040	2970288	C	0.7212651968002319	So I had hinted before that there were these kind of two types of cannibalization.
2970384	2975780	C	0.5783924460411072	We might say one being overfitting and another being plasticity loss.
2975860	2985128	C	0.8338940143585205	And we can interpret these as kind of like being extremes, the kind of like canalized end of how these two optimization landscapes might manifest.
2985224	2995148	C	0.5463628768920898	So in the type A inference landscape, this looks like overfitting on one end, heavy canalization and underfitting on the other end in the machine learning context, right?
2995234	3016820	C	0.6090120673179626	So overfitting being having very strong rigid beliefs that are in a particular environmental context, adaptive, but are very unlikely to be adapted in any other context, underfitting being having a set of beliefs which are not adapted to the current context and also unlikely to be adapted to any other context.
3018280	3027016	C	0.8298553824424744	As far as stability is concerned, I think we can understand stability, this MetaTrade, as kind of representing the balance of these two things, right?
3027118	3034520	C	0.6033313870429993	You have high stability when you are either overfit to a particular context or underfit.
3034860	3042060	C	0.9023768305778503	So this means you're well fit to this context that you're in now and you're also likely to be well fit to other future contacts.
3042480	3047228	C	0.8500187993049622	I think this is also in complexity science, sometimes described as metastability, right?
3047394	3052770	C	0.7691778540611267	So you're at a stable point that will also likely be able to take you to other stable points in the future.
3053300	3059680	C	0.784525454044342	And this kind of like ability to stay stable over time is then stability MetaTrade.
3061140	3071060	C	0.5397828221321106	We can then look at the type B, the learning landscape, where the kind of extreme version of canalization is this plasticity loss where it's very difficult to adapt to new contexts.
3072940	3085020	C	0.5653122663497925	The inverse of this is then catastrophic forgetting, where the problem is not one of adapting to new contexts, the problem is one of meaningfully retaining adaptive strategies and beliefs from previous contexts.
3086880	3090220	C	0.8036527633666992	And so obviously neither of these are desirable.
3092480	3104530	C	0.5762986540794373	What is desirable is some kind of balance between these two or one is able to adapt just enough to new context without forgetting previously learned things.
3104980	3110192	C	0.779695451259613	But here the relationship to the Mediterranean plasticity is a bit different than stability, right?
3110246	3118820	C	0.5699379444122314	So as is being represented on this graph, the more plastic you are, basically the less canalized you are in the space, the more easy it is to move around.
3118970	3125480	C	0.5560136437416077	But actually extreme versions of this end up manifesting as catastrophic forgetting, at least in the machine learning context.
3125820	3147840	C	0.5449082851409912	And I think this in particular has relevance for psychopathology and relevance for this idea, maybe complicates this idea, right, that psychedelic therapy is in and of itself likely to always lead to positive outcomes.
3153360	3153724	C	0.7123860716819763	Okay?
3153762	3166000	C	0.8600935935974121	And we can attempt to understand this by making an effort at trying to map or understand various forms of psychology in the context of these two different learning landscapes.
3166340	3176310	C	0.7484996914863586	And so before I get into this too much, I think it's important to say that this is very much a kind of like preliminary and provisional attempt at making sense of these things.
3177080	3187396	C	0.5564443469047546	I hope that this is kind of the start of a much more fleshed out dialogue looking at how we can kind of understand psychopathology with respect to machine learning concepts.
3187588	3209480	C	0.5955263376235962	But I think this at least gives a good starting point for maybe trying to understand where and why psychedelic therapy is useful, isn't useful, which is a bit more nuanced than this simple idea of like psychopathology means cannibalization and psychedelic therapy means reducing cannibalization.
3209560	3210190	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3211280	3214770	C	0.7897430658340454	Okay, so let's try to make sense of this a little bit.
3215140	3225590	C	0.8319736123085022	So for the kind of classic set of psychopathologies for which there has been a lot of great research done with psychedelic therapy and a lot of clear benefit has been seen.
3226040	3238132	C	0.5374332666397095	I think we can kind of class these within this upper left hand corner here, where these are disorders of both overfitting, which means in the moment overly strong beliefs get represented.
3238276	3249552	C	0.684108555316925	These are strong attractor points in the neural activation landscape and plasticity loss in the type B landscape.
3249636	3266480	C	0.5678938627243042	Which means that not only is a certain kind of dynamics instantiated, which make, for example, in the case of major depressive disorder, extremely negative self evaluations very common, but it's the case that even given the correct changes in environmental context.
3267700	3276868	C	0.6770716905593872	Even given in the case of psychedelic cystotherapy, a lot of the work with major depressive disorder is being done with treatment resistant depression, right?
3276954	3294090	C	0.6726224422454834	And what is treatment resistant depression but a kind of a set of beliefs, a set of neural activity patterns which are resistant to adaptation, to new environmental contexts being whatever sort of psychotherapy or previous drug was used.
3295100	3311176	C	0.7079930305480957	So this is high plasticity loss, high overhead and rate and these are kind of fortunately for psychedelic therapy and I think maybe for psychiatry in general, these are all very common and very, very costly psychopathologies.
3311208	3311500	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3311570	3316160	C	0.9116164445877075	So if it is the case that psychedelic therapy can treat these effectively, that's fantastic.
3317540	3325504	C	0.51419997215271	But I think we can maybe look at a more complicated if we start to expand to other psychopathologies, the story becomes a little bit more complicated.
3325552	3326244	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3326442	3349564	C	0.6457094550132751	So we can look at the bottom left hand corner here where we have cases of in the inference landscape still overfitting, but in the learning landscape something else happening, form of kind of catastrophic forgetting or a form of kind of drift of the belief landscape that's being instantiated here.
3349602	3349804	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3349842	3360712	C	0.5045298933982849	So I think two kind of representative pathologies here typically referred to as some form of bipolar disorder or some form of borderline personality disorder.
3360856	3371552	C	0.5820057392120361	So in both of these cases, in the moment to moment neural activity as it unfolds, there are very strong sets of beliefs being instantiated at any given time and these are very difficult to change.
3371606	3372210	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3373300	3384244	C	0.8257818818092346	But the key differentiating point here being that over longer timescales, over the timescales of days or weeks, the kinds of beliefs that are instantiated change quite a lot.
3384282	3384484	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
3384522	3405180	C	0.5039754509925842	So someone who's bipolar, if they're in a manic episode or in a depressive episode, the nature of the belief landscape being instantiated is very different for borderline individuals from a daily or weekly basis, the nature of one's beliefs about the people that are close to them can change very rapidly, very extremely in certain cases.
3406480	3427840	C	0.745572566986084	And so here the benefit of psychedelic therapy is a bit more mixed where there is likely the case that to the extent to which the kind of overt type A beliefs can be updated and changed to be more positive, be hopefully more relaxed, that's positive.
3427920	3439572	C	0.7591445446014404	But to the extent to which plasticity may be being increased when it's not actually needed, when there's not actually meaningful therapeutic benefits of that, it's a bit questionable.
3439636	3458776	C	0.6815415024757385	I think there's clear borderline, or rather bipolar for example, is often individuals with bipolar are often excluded from psychedelic trials under the assumption for example, that psychedelics may trigger a manic episode or may trigger psychosis.
3458968	3462400	C	0.6475440263748169	And I think that is a valid concern.
3464420	3475670	C	0.5039215087890625	So on kind of that topic then, this bottom right hand corner would be cases of both underfooting and catastrophic forgetting with I think schizophrenia being kind of like the most clear manifestation of this.
3477560	3486356	C	0.4795863628387451	And here there's very little work currently looking at trying to treat schizophrenia with psychedelic therapy.
3486388	3508300	C	0.672385036945343	I think for pretty good reasons though I would say to the extent to which there are secondary manifestations, secondary issues like depression, anxiety that people with schizophrenia might have, these actually may be treatable with some form of psychedelic therapy.
3509520	3518604	C	0.5384385585784912	And then lastly, this upper right hand corner here would correspond to underfitting in the type A landscape along with plasticity loss.
3518652	3534096	C	0.4680502414703369	So I think a good example of this is something like ADHD, where there are not very particularly strong beliefs that are being instantiated at any given time, but it's difficult to change these set of beliefs.
3534128	3546676	C	0.5778390765190125	Nonetheless, I think here there's a case where it's not totally clear how the benefit will actually play out in both of these cases.
3546788	3551310	C	0.9080581068992615	I've heard interesting work around like microdosing may be of interest.
3554880	3557740	C	0.8078218698501587	I think yeah, more research has to be done to be seen.
3557810	3559756	C	0.782709538936615	Right, and then what would microdosing be doing?
3559778	3573830	C	0.7000200748443604	Right, microdosing would be very slowly kind of like decreasing plasticity loss just a little bit, potentially also decreasing underfitting, as Adam has kind of suggested in the Albus model.
3579030	3585700	C	0.8485950231552124	And here we have just kind of like a brief overview of more or less everything I've described about how these two landscapes are different.
3586950	3596674	C	0.7128567099571228	I think most of these things I've said before pretty clearly right so the type A landscape corresponds to the neural activity pattern.
3596722	3598562	C	0.5158663988113403	This is the hidden state of the RNN.
3598706	3603686	C	0.5163533091545105	Overcannilization is going to be stereotyped mental circuits, very strongly held beliefs.
3603798	3608170	C	0.5554994940757751	Under canalization is going to be these inconsistently deployed circuits.
3609950	3618350	C	0.7798513770103455	It looks like overfitting in the canalized case, underfitting in the non canalized case going to correspond to stability, the metatrate.
3618850	3632820	C	0.8209673166275024	I hadn't discussed this before, but I think there's a relationship between cognitive flexibility and this inference landscape psychedelics are mainly going to affect the work at the acute level care.
3633190	3644982	C	0.5395263433456421	And this is by directly exciting the neurons or inducing forms of hadavian plasticity and the outcome is going to be a mixture of relaxation and strengthening of the kind that Adam described in the Albus case.
3645116	3651980	C	0.91930091381073	The type B landscape then is working on the synaptic weights and these are the actual network parameters in our RNN model.
3652590	3657500	C	0.7678490281105042	Over canalization is this inability to learn or adapt over time.
3658030	3662414	C	0.6850966215133667	Under canalization is the inability to retain information right?
3662452	3665870	C	0.8519312739372253	And those correspond to plasticity loss and catastrophic forgetting.
3666930	3679250	C	0.8420481085777283	This also is kind of the traditional plasticity metatrate, which I think corresponds to this longer term constructed psychological flexibility.
3680390	3689990	C	0.826053261756897	The effects are going to mainly be mediated post acutely with psychedelics and these are the more downstream metaplastic effects, the psychoplastogenic effects.
3691130	3696150	C	0.7612664103507996	And I think on the whole the effect here is a relaxation of canalization.
3698890	3701638	C	0.6395655274391174	And yeah, these are just the references.
3701734	3708362	C	0.8765575885772705	So those are the slides I have that's kind of the overview of the Deep canals model, I think.
3708416	3721230	C	0.7998508214950562	Now I'll turn it over to Mike who's going to share some thoughts both about this work and some of his own work and kind of this approach to understanding psychedelics more broadly.
3726210	3727906	A	0.8815237283706665	Ah, great.
3728088	3730094	A	0.8721266984939575	Yeah, thank you for that overview.
3730142	3731060	A	0.9827191829681396	That was great.
3733030	3757370	A	0.8457409143447876	So I guess I'm just in general very optimistic about this corner of neuroscience, that there are these very intuitive models that are very sort of clinically significant and I also think there is a lot of responsibility to sort of get things right here as well.
3757520	3758890	A	0.8266873359680176	As Adam noted.
3761470	3775330	A	0.8629378080368042	I have just a few comments and for the viewers, I'm not speaking for Arthur and Adam, I'm just grateful for the invitation to join the discussion.
3777110	3788440	A	0.864786684513092	So I wanted to note quickly three research themes dealing with the implementation of this class of model.
3789130	3797750	A	0.9056439995765686	So just broadly kind of pointing at both Deep Canals and Andrebus and Albus.
3799550	3813920	A	0.9036219120025635	So in 2019 I wrote Neural Annealing and that was sort of developing the canalization frame within the context of energy buildup in the eigen modes of a system.
3815410	3823710	A	0.6028056740760803	So you have the nice annealing metaphor, you have a temperature parameter and entropic disintegration.
3825670	3852426	A	0.5439834594726562	Robin Carter said a beautiful paper on that dantropic brain and then you sort of have a post heating result where the microstructure of your system is sort of a result of how hot and how long the heating was.
3852528	3857210	A	0.8320367932319641	So it's an alternative take on belief relaxation.
3857790	3864590	A	0.8319479823112488	And I do think that there are some pluses in terms of sort of explicitly making the annealing metaphor.
3866530	3872846	A	0.8370701670646667	And I think that two things that I'd point out.
3872948	3885410	A	0.8284122943878174	One, top down models or top down predictive models as energy sinks and eigen modes as the places where energy can build up or almost sort of hide from top down models.
3886550	3904840	A	0.8766718506813049	So you get this phenomenon of semantically neutral energy or semantically illegible energy we can say, which is sort of kind of how perhaps psychedelics music and meditation all sort of allow energy building.
3905630	3910010	A	0.8347363471984863	The energy that they contribute to the system can evade the top tone models.
3911710	3918810	A	0.9169188141822815	And yeah, just to note, one item that I'm looking at now is what is Deep Canals?
3918890	3922590	A	0.836231529712677	Has the inference landscape versus learning landscape distinction?
3923010	3929102	A	0.8806158900260925	And how would one sort of build that distinction within the neural Annealing framework?
3929246	3946710	A	0.8512066006660461	And guess one metaphor that I'm considering is the self as sort of a magnet to sort of apply a constraint, a uniform focusing constraint on the system as it's cooling.
3948570	3956090	A	0.8179448246955872	The second item that I wanted to mention, so I have this piece, autism as a disorder of dimensionality.
3956910	3969802	A	0.6574809551239014	And this brings in the concept of network density that it may very well be that people on the spectrum have literally more neurons and or more synapses.
3969946	3977460	A	0.7012819647789001	And there's this great Michelangelo quote, I saw the angel in the stone, and I set him free.
3977990	3985860	A	0.6802679300308228	And sort of the thicker networks you have, the more stone you have to work with, but you actually have to do the work.
3986470	4002090	A	0.7812677621841431	So you sort of have to do sort of well, normally you sort of inherit these highly pretrained optimized circuits, almost like asics application specific integrated circuit.
4003470	4010060	A	0.6694655418395996	And then this is kind of more an untrained network, and you have to train it yourself.
4011390	4019710	A	0.7193081974983215	And within the Deep Canals framework, this would show up as both underfitting and higher capacity for plasticity.
4022130	4027620	A	0.9058336019515991	So I think that's going to be an interesting thread to pull.
4030310	4031010	A	0.46433359384536743	Finally.
4031160	4041030	A	0.8987894058227539	So I just posted that last week, principles of Vaso Computation and as an implementation level account of active inference.
4041530	4043990	A	0.8388015031814575	And this is a big rabbit hole.
4044330	4048550	A	0.5719093084335327	I don't think we have time to go down it today.
4048700	4063120	A	0.7591232657432556	But I just comment that I really like the way Deep Canals explicitly splits out the learning landscape and the inference landscape, that I think that making this distinction is increasingly going to make sense.
4070100	4071280	A	0.7518613338470459	Back to Arthur.
4072020	4073680	B	0.9367396235466003	Yeah, awesome.
4073750	4075900	B	0.9698180556297302	Well, thank you all for the presentations.
4075980	4083350	B	0.8733060956001282	Arthur and Adam, feel free to pick up where Michael left off, or I can bring in some questions from the chat or from what I've written down.
4102020	4103580	A	0.8320558071136475	Just a quick comment.
4103740	4124744	A	0.7759720087051392	I do think that in the Deep Canals framework, it's going to be interesting to sort of look into metabolic demands, and sort of different metabolic disorders are pretty hot in brain science right now.
4124862	4145710	A	0.721627950668335	And I do think that it'll be interesting to look at sort of what the metabolic profile is in terms of each of the four items in the quadrant, if one quadrant or another quadrant is particularly associated with more metabolic demands in the system.
4149370	4151020	B	0.5447868704795837	Arthur yeah.
4152830	4154330	C	0.5790625214576721	No, that's fascinating.
4155550	4162810	C	0.6396932005882263	I'd love to kind of hear a little bit more about this comment you made about the salt as a magnet that's applying these constraints.
4164930	4165678	A	0.5585340261459351	Oh, yeah.
4165764	4184020	A	0.8332423567771912	So there's the, like, psychedelics the the effects are not or sort of the you sort of get pulled back into position after after some time.
4185030	4208970	A	0.8542590737342834	And I can't say that this is a full theory at this point, but in the neuroscience notation 2018, I talked about the self as kind of the god of the gaps in terms of aligning different scales.
4211390	4221502	A	0.8632238507270813	You have circuits which kind of pull in different ways and you have the mesoscale systems which pull in different ways and you have the overall brain wide systems that pull in different ways.
4221556	4225940	A	0.7274254560470581	And kind of the self is sort of the thing that tries to make everything work together.
4229190	4239910	A	0.8754425644874573	And an alternate frame would be sort of this alpha is just kind of this slow gravity toward disalignment.
4241850	4247720	A	0.5148841738700867	Yeah, I don't have anything particularly more to share.
4250030	4251114	C	0.5315870642662048	Yeah, that makes sense.
4251152	4251980	C	0.854081392288208	It's interesting.
4252830	4267470	B	0.9058206081390381	Well to combine the heating up and the magnetism, different metals and connections there to alchemy and everything different metals when heated up and cooled down in specific ways change their magnetic profile.
4267810	4271518	B	0.9278530478477478	So of course this is all just concordances but they're very interesting.
4271684	4294054	B	0.9150094389915466	And then also to the metabolic angle that reminded me of the trilogy by Dale Pendel with Pharmaconosis and the other two books where treated alongside traditional psychoactives we could say like caffeine and nicotine and some of the other substances that were mentioned here.
4294172	4323360	B	0.8676419854164124	Also there's tea, sugar and these are treated as psychedelic or at least as in the same pantheon of neurocognitive modifying in the sense that the destinies of individuals and of empires ride on the sense making and decision making influence of sugar, for example.
4324370	4333550	B	0.6051986217498779	So it definitely broadens our perspective to include the so called classical molecules like LSD.
4333710	4344230	B	0.7887902855873108	But also maybe we could think more broadly about antioxidants or about different lipids or about different metabolic connections.
4345050	4360886	D	0.8466032147407532	Michael Pollan's recent book this is Your Mind on plants I think it kind of has that what you're saying in mind because it includes caffeine, not introduces a psychedelic but just discussed among also psychedelics.
4360918	4375760	D	0.6946530342102051	I think I remember he focuses on masculine but it is a different way of being in the world, potentially radically different like if caffeine is in your life or it is not, it's a different life world.
4377670	4379890	B	0.7904005646705627	And different extended niche.
4381110	4385906	B	0.8539278507232666	I'll go to a question in the live chat so anyone can give a thought.
4386008	4400222	B	0.9014561772346497	So Matt asks is there any way how to approach the individual reactions to psychedelics in terms of positive or negative results of treatment using the ideas of deep canals?
4400386	4409420	B	0.9164952635765076	So how can we approach predictions and explanations at the individual scale with what you're sharing today?
4416120	4446632	D	0.83278489112854	One thing for this is kind of like a meta comment, but if we're actually going to do computational psychiatry and we actually are going to and precision medicine so the goal being to create models of sufficient detail that they could actually guide our practice and guide our practice in a way where we know for an individual what they might need in any given context.
4446696	4465200	D	0.762956976890564	So precision medicine with respect to standard antidepressants people, sometimes they'll go for a long time before they find ones that work, and sometimes things are made worse, and then they might deal with antidepressant withdrawal if they're looking for the right one, and if they're in a state of acute distress, that could be a hard lot.
4465350	4476320	D	0.5430030226707458	And so if you can help to speed up that process of finding what works and what might hurt also to avoid that, the ability to help people is immense.
4476480	4485444	D	0.5464944243431091	And so for that so the meta comment is I have to just say I'm not convinced that an act of inference.
4485572	4486810	D	0.5375961661338806	We're doing the job.
4487420	4502780	D	0.527765154838562	I think we're not acknowledging our uncertainty and I think the models are under specified with respect to the complexity of the effects we would expect on different scales and in characterizing the systems and we need to be more patient and modest.
4503120	4514844	D	0.7496300339698792	But what we don't know before we go on rushing in headlong into telling the rest of psychiatry how they should comport themselves and what models they should use based on psychedelic science.
4514892	4520380	D	0.6961131691932678	And plausible models, hopeful models, but very early days.
4520550	4528470	D	0.7221656441688538	And with the reality being complex in the ways we're seeing here, this was not an easy set of lectures or a set of talks like what we were going through.
4529400	4535560	D	0.5658353567123413	And, yeah, if we're actually going to be able to handle these powerful medicines responsibly, we got to go into the weeds.
4536220	4540970	D	0.757747232913971	The one more meta comment was like I think I saw someone say how can something like help everything?
4542460	4545804	D	0.874442458152771	I don't know if this is right but it's almost like a violation of no free lunch theorems or something.
4545842	4550924	D	0.6471569538116455	It's like how could something just be good across the board without something is off?
4550962	4557280	D	0.8725947737693787	You've calculated wrong somewhere you had to pay the price either in some trade off that wasn't acknowledged.
4558180	4564480	D	0.8780065178871155	But that being said there are some things which are generally good for a lot of things like being more flexible.
4566920	4577632	D	0.5022076964378357	If you can get something like metastability I think I'm a church member of the I'm a faithful member of the church of criticality.
4577776	4592632	D	0.737677812576294	I think Mark Miller might have indoctrinated me with optimal grips but basically like the ability to have an optimal grip on existence in your soul, not too tight, not too loose and being able to move around and be flexible in itinerants.
4592776	4596952	D	0.7559168934822083	Something kind of like mindfulness is just like sriracha for the soul.
4597016	4601950	D	0.9359579086303711	It's good for everything almost you just put on this, put it on, that makes it better.
4602800	4614208	D	0.5833550691604614	I buy that there might be some things that are good across the board but I wouldn't call though psychedelics necessarily putting you in this state of optimal criticality or anything in general.
4614294	4618164	D	0.7677305340766907	The rhetoric I'm uncomfortable with of saying psychedelics do X.
4618282	4621248	D	0.7552046775817871	I would prefer to say which psychedelic.
4621344	4637624	D	0.8294995427131653	Psychedelics tend to do x but just a little more qualifier like not weasel words but just like a little bit more like this psychedelic might do x in this context with this dose in this sentence setting but that being said there do also though seem to be across.
4637662	4647068	D	0.7016770839691162	The board, broad, sweeping, not super, but overarching statements that we can make that express a lot with a little.
4647234	4659984	D	0.6311762928962708	And so I don't want to be so much of a splitter and a prickly person finding all the details that these powerful things we can basically give to people to guide our research.
4660102	4662176	D	0.6781978011131287	I don't want to leave that on table either.
4662358	4667330	D	0.8156192302703857	I guess that's a bunch of meta level commentary that did not address the thing.
4669540	4670572	C	0.8164113759994507	I think that's useful.
4670636	4671424	C	0.9525895118713379	That's very helpful.
4671472	4673140	C	0.8466299772262573	I think to have all that context.
4674360	4686104	C	0.5396310091018677	With respect to the question itself, I would maybe offer this, which might be helpful, which know, I think you mentioned it, Adam, and it's very frequently mentioned this idea of set and setting, right.
4686142	4695150	C	0.8588816523551941	As being heavily predictive of the quality of the acute psychedelic experience, and often also, to some extent, the quality of the post acute experience.
4696160	4701580	C	0.6018730401992798	And I think we can understand this in the deep canals model, quite straightforwardly.
4703540	4708290	C	0.8293533325195312	So I'll just quickly pull back up one of these slides here.
4710260	4710720	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
4710790	4711024	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
4711062	4714220	C	0.8403252363204956	So what is set and setting?
4714300	4725696	C	0.8893378376960754	So set is mindset, which would basically be some combination of your current position in the synaptic weight landscape and the current state of your neural activation landscape.
4725728	4725876	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
4725898	4735444	C	0.8656417727470398	So your place in both landscapes is your mindset, and the setting is what is generating this input.
4735492	4735704	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
4735742	4737972	C	0.845224916934967	What is generating the x into the network.
4738116	4741880	C	0.6342132687568665	And that's some complicated function of the environment.
4743440	4755280	C	0.8833123445510864	And then we can understand the evolution of movement through the inference landscape during the acute effects of the drug as then kind of like very directly and straightforwardly being a function of these two things.
4755350	4755970	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
4756340	4764480	C	0.8827077150344849	Because both of these things are basically what's affecting how this landscape evolves over time and how you move through the landscape.
4766180	4791292	C	0.8526403307914734	And so with this in mind, I guess we can then start to characterize and think about, okay, well, what kinds of we can maybe be a little bit more mechanistic about how does input from the environment, the setting, actually, given that we relatively fix the actual synaptic weight landscape, how is that changing the dynamics over time or the other way around?
4791346	4791564	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
4791602	4807440	C	0.7966912984848022	Like, how is fixing the input, the environmental context relatively stable and looking at individuals who are at different fixed points, at different points of time, going to change the dynamics of the event?
4807510	4807744	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
4807782	4815872	C	0.8397262096405029	And I think given that this is a highly stochastic process, given that these dynamics of albus are at play right.
4815926	4826532	C	0.5090557932853699	Where certain beliefs are being strengthened, other beliefs are being relaxed, I think at least having this hold on, okay, well, set and setting is really important.
4826586	4842140	C	0.8321986198425293	And it's important because these are explicitly conditioning the way in which both the landscape, the inference landscape is shaped and how you move around it and how it's being dynamically perturbed.
4844800	4848270	C	0.6032516956329346	Yeah, hopefully that answers a little bit the question.
4849840	4850590	A	0.7344964146614075	Nice.
4852160	4875412	A	0.8610169291496277	I just want to jump in there, just thinking about biomarkers if we're looking for something that's of high clinical specificity, we want to sort of be able to measure what's going on in a very careful way.
4875466	4881560	A	0.8348930478096008	So first of all, what is temperature parameter?
4882620	4885844	A	0.7960490584373474	We talk about, okay, psychedelics increase the temperature parameter.
4885892	4888344	A	0.7479865550994873	But how high?
4888462	4895470	A	0.8676062226295471	And do different substances and dosages sort of differ in interesting ways?
4895840	4896910	A	0.647256076335907	Probably, yes.
4897760	4904240	A	0.8830985426902771	And then also sort of measuring temperature parameter, measuring the temperature parameter in different parts of the body.
4904390	4924404	A	0.8697938919067383	So you might have a different temperature, like not literal temperature, but computational entropic integration in different parts of your body and also the plasticity status in different networks throughout your body.
4924602	4950830	A	0.6726365089416504	So I guess I see a big frontier here as thinking some doing some careful thinking around biomarkers and proxies and inferring these sort of things that we are talking about as core and I think they are core and we should be able to find good marks for them.
4952240	4954908	C	0.7678140997886658	Yeah, that's totally correct.
4954994	4958556	C	0.6278868317604065	And yeah, I just want to repeat it for my own sake even.
4958658	4965948	C	0.8127646446228027	Right, which is that these two things which I think were maybe one is I think already a core part of the deep canals work right.
4965974	4969888	C	0.8697003126144409	Which is that I was showing these single images of these toy optimization landscapes.
4969984	4979370	C	0.8101885318756104	But of course, the human being, the nervous system has multiple many of these landscapes hierarchically organized, right?
4979900	4983770	C	0.6954416036605835	And they influence each other in a complicated way.
4985500	4999276	C	0.8204144239425659	And the project forward is to understand where these landscapes are, what they look like and how we can find biomarkers to them and begin.
4999378	5017328	C	0.5931437015533447	If these two kinds of characterizations are true, this overfitting underfitting plasticity loss and catastrophic forgetting, then it's a very meaningful project to be able to quantify that objectively somehow an individual.
5017494	5028080	C	0.7143551707267761	And that's when you can start to get to this point that Ada was talking about of precision medicine and understanding like okay, well, actually it turns out like these networks are catalyzed in this kind of way.
5028170	5037080	C	0.891612708568573	And because of that we can say with much more certainty that this kind of psychedelic intervention is going to likely be helpful.
5040720	5052030	D	0.7647559642791748	I don't know if this potentially brings in some of the work with vascular and neurovascular and visceral integration that you're doing.
5052640	5076096	D	0.7988023161888123	So there's like a sense in the free energy principle where the overall phenotype and extended phenotype in terms of its constructing and coupling within constructing its Econiche, its success in manifesting this phenotype there is one free energy functional for this overall effort as a kind of prediction that's enacted through the dynamics.
5076208	5093052	D	0.7341440320014954	But you could also break it down in terms of subsystems with local gradients and local autopoietic processes that are in like they're brought together into an overall system, hopefully with synergies and they have to be to be an organism and an agent.
5093106	5098216	D	0.7329538464546204	And we call this like a thing to the extent it has thingness.
5098408	5099630	D	0.7935842871665955	It's coming together.
5100480	5110636	D	0.8995037078857422	I guess think of maybe like energy landscape, something like let's just say right now, in this moment, my explicitly felt beliefs.
5110668	5124548	D	0.823064923286438	But my body also though might have a different opinion, different parts of it, in terms of what it's implicitly optimizing its revealed preference from its inaction that may or may not correspond to how I feel about it.
5124714	5126240	D	0.7958489060401917	It might be difference of opinion.
5126320	5127556	D	0.7781558036804199	I might not even be tuning in.
5127578	5129496	D	0.5339769721031189	I might be ignoring it maybe because I don't want to.
5129598	5148380	D	0.8858947157859802	And so it's kind of like the score kept by the body might have its own be describable as its own information geometry which is being tracked to degrees and is in different degrees of alignment with different ones at different levels of a control hierarchy.
5148720	5150460	D	0.7808279991149902	So plausible?
5151920	5156030	A	0.6267756223678589	Absolutely, I think so, yeah.
5158020	5164380	A	0.841568112373352	I think of the body as sort of a parliament of different networks.
5164460	5167904	A	0.6819565296173096	And alignment is the scarce resource.
5167952	5169888	A	0.5774078369140625	Coordination is always the scarce resource.
5169984	5175220	A	0.5254889726638794	And how does the body keep alignment and when does it go wrong too?
5175370	5181316	A	0.6394157409667969	And I guess I see this as sort of harmonically mediated.
5181428	5186650	A	0.8388941884040833	Each part of the body has some choice of what else in the body to listen to.
5187020	5200430	A	0.855243444442749	And depending on the particular sort of location in the information topology, different parts of the body have different carrots and sticks by which to try to control other parts of the body.
5201200	5215090	A	0.7168936133384705	So if your stomach is very unhappy, it's going to start grumbling and then it'll let the body know, okay, I need some food, I really seriously need some food.
5215940	5225216	A	0.6371564269065857	And then the rest of the body, they can sort of turn away from it and then it'll just get louder and then you have to turn it away from it more and it'll get louder.
5225248	5227808	A	0.8132710456848145	And that's of course a negative dynamic.
5227904	5244350	A	0.5954011678695679	If it gets what it wants, maybe it sort of gives a very harmonious uh and sort of tries to give carriage the rest of the I just uh there's an ecosystem there.
5248120	5250592	B	0.8829865455627441	I'll go to another question in the live chat.
5250736	5263000	B	0.8846622705459595	So Bert asks what do you think of the average of solving within a generative hierarchy and the impact of temporary openness moving it upwards?
5263900	5267200	B	0.8209840655326843	And then I asked to clarify what do you mean the average of solving?
5267380	5277144	B	0.7892457842826843	And Bert wrote where predictions meet incoming signals like discussed in Rebus, where top down predictions are softened in precision and thus solved.
5277192	5277790	B	0.5803324580192566	For.
5282420	5287584	D	0.541521430015564	I think Arthur will be able to get into the details of that better than I would.
5287622	5312568	D	0.6427875757217407	But one thing I'm wondering there is sometimes I love the entropic brain, but sometimes I wonder in terms of the connections, whether I don't how we're having more or less entropy and whether that matters the how.
5312654	5330616	D	0.6551729440689087	So for instance, you can think of a free energy landscape that's been flattened or you can think of one where you're better able and you have more energy for the manifold activity is better of climbing up or down the peaks that are there for the more enduring belief landscape.
5330648	5341644	D	0.844990611076355	So it's like, in the moment, it could be that my previous way of thinking is unavailable to me and I no longer believe those things at any level.
5341842	5349216	D	0.6866841316223145	Or I can support more novel inferences that I wouldn't.
5349248	5361640	D	0.6612734198570251	Otherwise I can kind of move into an area of mind space that would otherwise be difficult, potentially because of a greater energy into the system, greater thoroughput noise.
5364940	5365304	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
5365342	5379644	C	0.8744184970855713	So as I think I understand the question, right, it's basically asking about trying to optimize for this free energy variable and in the context of deep canals, right?
5379682	5385916	C	0.7864885926246643	Like this is the loss function that's driving the optimization of the learning landscape, the synaptic weight landscape.
5385948	5386530	C	0.5664746165275574	Right.
5386900	5393524	C	0.650127112865448	The entire connectivity structure of the nervous system is trying to get to this point of low free energy.
5393642	5402196	C	0.5010653734207153	And I think there's lots of for any given individual in a given environment, assuming the environment is relatively fixed, right?
5402218	5405468	C	0.7344868779182434	There's like an optimal, there's a global optimal.
5405584	5422880	C	0.7992338538169861	And it's very likely that the individual is in some local optima that is maybe close to it, maybe far from it, but that's just inherently what within the context of the active inputs.
5422900	5439024	C	0.812965989112854	That's what we're assuming that the nervous system is doing, is doing this gradientism in the space and openness then is going to correspond to this plasticity MetaTrade or be one of the components of it.
5439142	5449392	C	0.49789780378341675	And it is in the deep canals model then going to correspond to an ability to move around this optimization landscape more easily.
5449456	5449780	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
5449850	5464200	C	0.6957024931907654	It's going to be a flattening of the landscape, or more precisely, I guess, a smoothing of the landscape such that it's less likely that the individual, the nervous system will get stuck in these local optima.
5464540	5468596	C	0.7623714208602905	So maybe it won't mean that the individual will arrive at the global optima.
5468708	5475292	C	0.5525617003440857	I think it's difficult to say what that even might be or how individuals might get to such a place at all.
5475346	5489490	C	0.6472422480583191	But I think it is likely that the individual will be more likely to find a more global optima and more easily move from one optimal to another.
5489860	5493510	C	0.817681074142456	And I think that's kind of what this openness is corresponding to.
5496040	5496790	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
5497720	5498470	C	0.584351658821106	Okay.
5501400	5514692	A	0.868384838104248	In neural kneeling, I mentioned the idea of psychedelic extrapolated volition, kind of a play on a coherent extrapolated volition from the AI safety crowd.
5514836	5544704	A	0.6369382739067078	And it's this sort of sense that if temporarily you have more control over sort of low level shaping of your cognition, your emotion, and maybe sort of based on this attractor that we call the self, or I guess based on what is a good question, then what are good signs?
5544752	5549908	A	0.8181406259536743	That you should be trusted with that power or you should trust yourself with that power rather.
5550074	5555620	A	0.5468718409538269	And what are telltale signs that you shouldn't trust yourself with that power?
5555770	5560090	A	0.6720404624938965	And I don't have an answer, but I think it's an interesting question.
5560700	5565160	B	0.6862483620643616	Yes, I am normal and can be trusted with the key to the doors of perception.
5565580	5566970	A	0.7408814430236816	Let me in exactly.
5568720	5570750	B	0.76583331823349	I have a short question.
5571520	5574030	B	0.7893023490905762	Where is action in this model?
5578400	5584416	D	0.8269221186637878	So imagine many places Arthur will get into that.
5584438	5592450	D	0.8893250823020935	But for what I was thinking with Albus is that actually the five HD two A system.
5594440	5596980	D	0.8281962275505066	I talk about two regimes, potentially.
5597960	5608628	D	0.7948970794677734	One is more towards overt inaction and modifying the world and strengthened beliefs potentially of that variety.
5608724	5612330	D	0.8049532771110535	And the other might be more of adapting to the world.
5614460	5623416	D	0.9630508422851562	Robin has a really excellent paper called A Tale of Two Receptors where he talks about five H T, one A receptors.
5623528	5631048	D	0.7299895882606506	The ones that antidepressants tend to act on because they tend to reduce this excitatory signaling, talking about them as a kind of passive coping.
5631144	5639548	D	0.8069575428962708	And so this would correspond in there's some machine learning models of this by Diane and colleagues where they talk about opponency between dopamine and serotonin.
5639644	5646212	D	0.6886036396026611	And they're focusing on the one A as a kind of like patients promoting parameter, keeping you from confidently charging into your policy.
5646266	5657990	D	0.6112293601036072	So that would tend to inhibit, I guess, patterns of either overt inaction or potentially even some kinds of mental stimulation too.
5658540	5679692	D	0.7099373936653137	You could maybe even think of like even if you're not overtly inactive enacting something externally, there might be more or less brave type styles of thoughts that you might be willing to entertain, going places you might not otherwise be willing to go, and being able to handle the swings in expected free energy.
5679826	5684080	D	0.9043169617652893	That might happen as you try to pursue a given path of policies.
5685300	5701536	D	0.9113745093345642	But the idea would be that there might be something more like a micro dosing mesodosing regime which might be more of what initially sculpted the five H two A system which evolved with a gene duplication event around the time of the Cambrian Explosion with the advent of jawed fishes.
5701648	5707844	D	0.8377230763435364	I'm personally interpreting this as having the significance of evolving in the context of predator prey arms races.
5707892	5719156	D	0.8377669453620911	I suspect I could be wrong, but that basically it's locally trying to strengthen patterns of policy pursuit to pursue particular goals in a given context.
5719268	5724008	D	0.9201595783233643	And to come back to what I was mentioning earlier with that work by Robin of like a kind of act of coping.
5724184	5742928	D	0.6718868613243103	But it seems with rebus there's almost like not that kind of story, and that it's more you're adjusting to the world and actually, if under a very alter state, you are overtly enacting, that's actually kind of a dangerous thing.
5743014	5749344	D	0.5626846551895142	I don't know how much to make of this that the five Http receptors are less expressed on, like, motor cortex.
5749392	5751940	D	0.5932906866073608	I don't think we know enough to make too much of it.
5752010	5758056	D	0.6897450089454651	But it's like some dreams you might not want to act out as they're happening, but they still might powerfully impact you.
5758238	5772828	D	0.8356830477714539	So I'm currently actually wondering whether this other rebus like regime might have been specifically sculpted in the context of bonding and actually opening the self to include others.
5772994	5775608	D	0.5916323661804199	And that might have been some of the primary selective pressures.
5775704	5778220	D	0.6793316006660461	I don't know how to think of that in terms of inaction.
5780720	5804116	D	0.8129476308822632	And one more detail that might kind of like not sure what to make of it that kind of goes through both of those excuse the phone would be anthropologically, I believe like psychedelics are oftentimes used in ways that would be both like creating a kind of group solidarity and might be used in the context of pursuing goals together in the world.
5804138	5811832	D	0.8500428795814514	So for instance, like a hunting party, they might all do psychedelics together or something that looks a lot like breath work before going out, maybe going to war.
5811966	5827580	D	0.7794814705848694	So that's a very different type that kind of includes both a relaxation of the normal boundaries of the self and a kind of gearing you up for pursuing goals in the you know, there's got to be another story of like, so Arthur's expertise is machine learning.
5827650	5833072	D	0.5000097751617432	And so it's like you want these systems to act intelligently and not act in other times.
5833206	5840880	D	0.5297720432281494	And so basically now we're in the language of policies, and when you deploy them and how and so complicated.
5843220	5843584	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
5843622	5846752	C	0.8920655250549316	I would say that action manifests itself at a few different places.
5846816	5848132	C	0.7446590065956116	It's true, I didn't mention it here.
5848186	5850196	C	0.6700480580329895	Yeah, I think it's very important, obviously.
5850378	5861380	C	0.8438020348548889	I think what the kind of most implicit place where it exists right, is that these belief landscapes are being instantiated ultimately for the sake of adaptive behavior.
5861460	5865572	C	0.8139410018920898	Adaptive behavior, adaptive action right, in some sort of environmental context.
5865716	5873404	C	0.8661527633666992	And that's the kind of like framework, the deep learning framework that we're using or like the artificial agent framework, right.
5873442	5887468	C	0.840609610080719	Is that the assumption is that the system is supporting some sort of agent that's embodied in some sort of environment which is changing over time such that it can either be adaptive or not adaptive.
5887644	5905344	C	0.7955052852630615	I think then the question of how action actually plays into the evolution of these belief landscapes during psychedelics or not acting in the world is a very clear way to modify one's setting, right?
5905482	5926380	C	0.8280145525932312	So acting is a way of modifying the function that's providing the sensory input into the system which is going to change how the activity patterns are evolving over time, right, which are going to affect the acute quality of the trip, affect how beliefs are either being strengthened or relaxed.
5926800	5945300	C	0.49346134066581726	And I think it's already clear that there's a kind of whole set of folk psychology that's been built around what is or isn't a good way to cultivate a helpful setting and that of course all is a function of action in the world.
5945450	5956376	C	0.874040961265564	I think then there's also this kind of more subtler form of action which is how one thinks, how one deploys attention essentially during this experience.
5956558	5965300	C	0.7887960076332092	And I think this deployment of attention has a huge effect on whether there end up being rebus or CBIS like effects.
5965460	5965832	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
5965886	5975260	C	0.6514118313789368	So whether one allows oneself to go down certain thought rabbit holes, whether one allows oneself to get kind of stuck in certain kinds of thought patterns.
5977520	5991504	C	0.7616788148880005	I think this form of mental action has a very big downstream effect and I think a lot of I'd love to see much more work on this.
5991542	6011672	C	0.8868440389633179	I think it's very important, I think it's kind of essential and I think this is kind of one of the most interesting things about these psychedelic experiences is that in some sense, like the most extreme rebus model and the most extreme thebis model could be true for two different individuals, right?
6011806	6027724	C	0.44504278898239136	Someone could say I went to hell and I was there for 8 hours straight, or say I had a completely selfless experience, I let go of all beliefs and experienced nothing for 8 hours straight and it was great.
6027762	6028108	C	0.7360090017318726	Right?
6028194	6047190	C	0.6761313676834106	And clearly those involve two very different neural regimes and I think the nature of that and obviously, given that they involve the same drug and they involve not such a different setting, it's obvious that they have something very important to do with how attention is deployed during this experience.
6050360	6058648	A	0.7330505847930908	Yeah, I do think that this frame of attention, I mean, attention is so important for everything.
6058734	6071310	A	0.9435393214225769	And I do think that there's something interesting kind of digging into the Attention and Albus framework that yeah, I'm really curious to see how that'll develop.
6072160	6087730	A	0.8678407669067383	I would also say that in terms of active inference and action, there is a cost to holding an intention and then once you discharge your intention, you can release that cost.
6089540	6095380	A	0.8804560303688049	So I guess I would have to think about how to apply that to the Canals framework.
6098680	6115876	D	0.8677310943603516	Fred Barrett, I don't know if he's published it yet, but this is kind of like a follow up to a Klaus truly central model that Arthur alluded to is emphasizing basically a lack of executive control and placing that as central to the psychedelic spirits.
6115908	6135920	D	0.8097675442695618	Like not controlling your mental action in directed ways as much and then trying to counter more of the types of cognition and phenomenology sort of psychedelics based on just releasing of the normal more agentic modes of policy selection around attention as mental action, although not using active inference.
6140260	6141696	B	0.8810970783233643	Yeah, very interesting.
6141798	6165224	B	0.8441632986068726	Adam, your introduction there of course, attention as covert action, which was echoed by Arthur and Michael, both of you said it really introduces a case where we can use active inference to find continuity between what's happening inside the agent and outside the agent.
6165342	6176524	B	0.8282954096794128	Because on one hand we could kind of take a belief oriented frame and we could say, well, what's happening inside the agent are beliefs about things, beliefs about hidden states, beliefs about observations, beliefs about policy.
6176722	6182232	B	0.7556970715522766	So that's kind of a belief oriented view where everything is framed basically cognitively.
6182376	6201360	B	0.7599768042564392	Or we could take a very action oriented view and then we could think about the interface in a more inactive way and then also even the realm of where many active entities dare not tread in mental action with attention as covert action.
6201440	6210584	B	0.8619089126586914	And so then we have, like, a total active account that is mathematically isomorphic with the total belief based account.
6210702	6211684	B	0.49035969376564026	They're both just maps.
6211732	6212708	B	0.4884621202945709	They're not the territory.
6212804	6215480	B	0.7040167450904846	The territory is the person in the room.
6215630	6225500	B	0.871468722820282	So all of this is just talking about the formalism and how we choose to interpret the formalism in terms of it being more inferential or it being more active.
6226720	6244150	B	0.7737987041473389	And so there's a lot of ways to go, I guess, in our closing minutes, I would love to hear what are the next moves or what are some areas that you would hope that people look into?
6246440	6248230	B	0.803272545337677	Michael and then the.
6252280	6261412	A	0.5789934992790222	Know is, I think my favorite mental move is to try to drop down on my level of abstraction.
6261556	6263880	A	0.8133097290992737	Okay, how is this implemented?
6264460	6265512	A	0.7387892007827759	What's going on here?
6265566	6286130	A	0.6900331377983093	And then I do think that details of implementation are really generative to look into and, like, the biomarkers and the proxies for figuring out how to parameterize okay, exactly how hot are we talking about with this temperature parameter and so on in different parts of the body.
6287940	6296816	A	0.8067137598991394	I have kind of my niche that I'm working on in the Vasomuscular system, which is a rabbit hole.
6296848	6317472	A	0.8004150986671448	But, yeah, I do think that the deep canals framework specifically and the canalization paradigm in general, it's good enough that we should be able to dig into mechanism.
6317556	6319790	A	0.9613205194473267	So I'm looking forward to that.
6323810	6324560	C	0.7671424746513367	Great.
6325970	6330670	B	0.8001323342323303	Adam or Arthur.
6333490	6334638	D	0.7895423769950867	You can go first.
6334804	6335780	D	0.6405050158500671	Doesn't matter.
6336310	6336722	C	0.584351658821106	Okay.
6336776	6337362	C	0.6067711114883423	Yeah, I'll go.
6337416	6338020	C	0.4753468334674835	Sure.
6338470	6338882	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
6338936	6340980	C	0.668875515460968	I mean, first I want to echo this idea.
6341350	6343058	C	0.7641712427139282	I think Mexicans is very important.
6343144	6348062	C	0.7911282181739807	This is one of the people we've talked to about talked with about deep canals.
6348206	6350354	C	0.9717456698417664	This idea of, like, well, this is great.
6350392	6351586	C	0.8207308650016785	We have these two axes.
6351698	6355974	C	0.7074207663536072	It'd be wonderful if there were some biological correlates you could look for.
6356172	6358060	C	0.9012675285339355	I think that's incredibly important.
6359070	6363610	C	0.5305116772651672	My background is also in machine learning, in deep learning.
6363680	6368090	C	0.8946837186813354	So I'm currently doing some work around simulating some of these things.
6368240	6383250	C	0.6754136681556702	I think especially for these albus dynamics, being able to kind of study under what circumstances you get these different kinds of effects, even in kind of, like, simple Tory models, is kind of important to see how they unfold.
6385110	6387986	C	0.6953557729721069	And then we brought it up at the end.
6388008	6390450	C	0.8371676206588745	I think it's really important.
6390520	6395330	C	0.8957992196083069	It's very interesting to me is the role of the deployment of attention in this.
6395480	6404070	C	0.7321298718452454	And there's lines of work where people are trying various researchers are trying to connect, for example, meditation to psychedelic research.
6404220	6416410	C	0.7931225299835205	And kind of certain people are trying to tell unified stories about what's going on in the brain when people meditate, what's going on under psychedelics, some of them using these active inference models.
6416910	6425774	C	0.8520559668540955	But I think in all of these cases, the deployment of attention and how the deployment of tension changes over time is kind of a key aspect of this.
6425972	6430766	C	0.49188894033432007	And it's not as present in the deep canals model right now.
6430948	6440260	C	0.7344225645065308	But I think any really robust future kind of like model of these things is going to have to talk about attention quite a bit.
6446190	6460542	D	0.7919871807098389	Well, I guess next steps would be seeing how the review process goes, but also I guess helping Arthur to establish a field of psychedelic machine learning.
6460676	6468226	D	0.798002302646637	Psychedelic inspired machine learning where we try to make systems more flexible and capable, better.
6468328	6481858	D	0.7460073828697205	They can handle edge cases better, imagine better in terms of real time policy selection, learn in ways that not too much, not too little, and then maybe so that's useful, potentially earlier.
6481874	6485510	D	0.7520506978034973	Like you have a driverless vehicle, do I change lanes or don't I?
6485580	6489900	D	0.7402393817901611	You send it back to the Tesla, dojo what do you want it to learn, what do you not want it to learn?
6490990	6507566	D	0.5590595602989197	But then down the line well before we even get there, as you're going into this you could see the capacity for a rich bi directional flow between machine learning and psychedelic inspired machine learning.
6507668	6514910	D	0.6465150117874146	So it's like you get a bunch of machine learners together and a bunch of people who know a lot about the cognitive science and biology and maybe phenomenology of psychedelics.
6515330	6520546	D	0.5841358304023743	And in addition to designing better machine learning systems, they could probably tell you more about how psychedelics act.
6520568	6530294	D	0.8372040390968323	And so you can have this kind of virtuous cycle between the biology and the field, but you keep going with that before we get there.
6530332	6532200	D	0.5341700911521912	We'll keep going, but before we get there.
6533290	6536818	D	0.8058050870895386	Very interested in the implications for best practices.
6536994	6544074	D	0.8512805700302124	So for instance, oftentimes you might want semantically neutral energy to kind of get them.
6544112	6550214	D	0.6860194802284241	You're just turning up the heat, you're just maybe at first breaking up, I call them defenses, but the usual structure.
6550342	6555150	D	0.8445047736167908	But then the question is at what point do you try to direct the canalization process?
6555300	6561760	D	0.7197282910346985	Do you wait till after or maybe when the metal is hot, is that a really good time to do it?
6562610	6564354	D	0.7042344212532043	And maybe there's no one single question.
6564392	6568626	D	0.8036115169525146	This might depend on the substance, the set, the setting, the dose, the person.
6568728	6575126	D	0.8129803538322449	So getting clarity on that could be fateful for many people in terms of the outcomes they have.
6575148	6587874	D	0.6704950928688049	And specifically what I'm gunning for is I'm on a mission to make compassion meditation treatment as usual for all psychedelic psychotherapy and preferably all therapy.
6588002	6604446	D	0.5920703411102295	And so the question is if you're in a state of enhanced imaginative capacity, maybe you're having more ability to tune into your interceptive system, whether you've just increased the channels or maybe you're better capable of because maybe your inflammation went down a bit and you can tune in better because it feels better to do so.
6604548	6616046	D	0.8172028064727783	Some combination that might be a really good opportunity to do certain meditations that might update you in particular ways like try to direct the re Annealing process, maybe not just like afterwards integration, but during the session.
6616158	6624122	D	0.8014050722122192	And so if we could get clarity on something like how to canalize and recanalyze, like Annealing schedules.
6624206	6627462	D	0.6451548337936401	It's going to be complicated, but that's, I think, where we need to head.
6627596	6633062	D	0.5515028238296509	And then finally for all this, that would be enough.
6633196	6639818	D	0.7567475438117981	But recentering the conversation on psychedelics, on basically meaning and connection would be enough.
6639984	6649930	D	0.8875068426132202	But I'm wondering down the line, when we talk of alignment, we're talking about our alignment with our values and maybe the alignments of machines with our values.
6650270	6659838	D	0.8882344961166382	And so does this actually end up going to some of the conversations that are happening now about increasingly advanced AI and our relationships to it?
6659924	6663550	D	0.7474449276924133	Could there be a story of cannibalization and recalyzation?
6663970	6668014	D	0.7774542570114136	You want some things to hold fast and you want some things to be more fluid.
6668142	6670414	D	0.795798122882843	This might be it's always been a timely conversation.
6670462	6680070	D	0.5104241371154785	We've always been dealing with this with us, the alignment problem of us, which we often fail, but the alignment problem with these technologies we're developing.
6681610	6684326	B	0.7368370890617371	Okay, wow.
6684428	6688338	B	0.9468482732772827	Well, so many great topics.
6688514	6689640	B	0.9195932745933533	Thank you all.
6690010	6694710	B	0.8479697704315186	All I have in closing, turn on, tune in, act in, first serve.
6695610	6696600	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
6697130	6698646	B	0.5591036081314087	See you all next time.
6698828	6699090	A	0.5137447118759155	Bye.
