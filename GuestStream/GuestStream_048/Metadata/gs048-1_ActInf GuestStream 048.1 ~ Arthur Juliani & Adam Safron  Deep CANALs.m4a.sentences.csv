6720	8476	2	B	0.85143	Hello and welcome everyone.
8658	15244	3	B	0.98834	It's Active Inference guest stream number 48.1 on July 19, 2023.
15442	22472	4	B	0.63513	We're here with Arthur Giuliani and Adam Safron, also joined by Michael Edward Johnson in discussion.
22616	31888	5	B	0.99963	We're going to have a presentation and then a conversation about deep canals, a deep learning approach to refining the cannilization theory of psychopathology.
32064	37620	6	B	0.99543	So thank you all for joining and looking forward to this presentation and discussion.
40780	41764	7	C	0.76314	Thanks Daniel.
41812	68400	8	C	0.79071	I'm very happy to be here with Admin Mike to talk about this work and to discuss more broadly this general direction that's emerged over the past few years to try to utilize some of the concepts from the active inference world and computational modeling more generally to understand what's going on both in psychopathology and in psychedelic therapy.
68920	76630	9	C	0.7316	Yeah, so I'll give a brief presentation and we'll move into a kind of more general discussion of this work.
79800	89930	10	C	0.65596	It'll start with some kind of general considerations around psychedelic therapy, some of the neuroscience of psychedelics, and then move kind of more specifically into the model.
92220	100636	11	C	0.71886	So there is this class of drugs, these serotonergic psychedelic drugs, which include psilocybin, DMT, LSD and others.
100818	117280	12	C	1	And the past decade has seen a resurgence of interest in psychedelic therapy, psychedelic assisted psychotherapy, where one or multiple of these drugs is used in conjunction with a kind of psychotherapeutic protocol.
118180	131030	13	C	0.87	And there's been a lot of investment of money and time and clinical resources into utilizing these drugs for treatments depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and others.
132460	144360	14	C	0.75	And there seems to be quite a lot of positive signals suggesting that these kinds of therapeutic interventions can actually be quite effective.
144720	155230	15	C	0.99457	So there's a number of studies suggesting that psilocybin assisted psychotherapy can be helpful for depression, anxiety, substance use disorder and others.
155920	181670	16	C	1	And as this work advances, there are more and more larger clinical trials comparing it for example, to the standard treatments with SSRIs, with multiple studies suggesting that pilocybin assisted psychotherapy is at least as effective as the Lexapro kind of standard of care.
187170	205460	17	C	0.99316	All of this seems to suggest, and the timelines are kind of pointing at this idea, that psilocybin treatment for major depressive disorder may be only a couple of years away from becoming approved as an actual treatment in the United States.
206150	233740	18	C	0.99178	Which means that it's quite important for us to understand what's going on mechanistically in the brain so that these kinds of treatments can be best optimized, best determined how to be used for which kinds of mental issues people might be having, and under what kinds of treatment protocols we might expect the most success.
234510	248480	19	C	1	I think this will also ultimately, hopefully lead to the development of even better drugs, even better treatment protocols and much more personalized care.
251940	261724	20	C	0.99988	So some of the basics of how these drugs work on the brain for those who are unfamiliar, so these are the serotonergic psychedelics.
261852	269572	21	C	0.99992	They are serotonergic because they act as agonists for a number of serotonin receptors in the brain and the central nervous system.
269626	283160	22	C	0.93903	More broadly, it's thought that most specifically these drugs like psilocybin work through agonizing, the serotonin five H T two A receptor.
284860	303120	23	C	1	And this has been demonstrated multiple times by using blockers antagonists of the five H T two A receptor which seem to largely remove the effect of psilocybin or other psychedelic drugs.
304100	311440	24	C	1	And what this two A receptor does when it's agonized is it excites the neuron, making it more likely to fire.
311510	315780	25	C	1	And this is kind of essential to some of the downstream effects.
317800	329060	26	C	0.99989	So given that it seems that this two way receptor that psychedelics are mainly targeting, the question then becomes well, where in the brain are these two A receptors?
329140	331480	27	C	0.99994	Most widely expressed?
332300	338984	28	C	1	And research has focused on, I would say, three kind of key areas over the past decade or so.
339102	345340	29	C	1	The first being the thalamus, which is a region involved in the gating of sensory information into the cortex.
345680	358336	30	C	0.99962	There's a lot of expression in the cortex itself, expression for example, in the visual system, which is perhaps not surprising given the prevalence of visual hallucinations and psychedelic use.
358518	367408	31	C	0.99997	But therapeutically a lot of focus has been on the prefrontal cortex where there is also a dense expression of these receptors.
367584	380360	32	C	0.91	And then also more recent work has looked at the claustrom which is a small brain region responsible for coordinating the transition dynamics of cortical activation.
381260	386170	33	C	1	And this too is likely of central importance to the psychedelic effect.
390080	404790	34	C	0.99494	So kind of moving up one level of abstraction to fMRI studies, there are a few kind of like key takeaways which have been identified from a few different fMRI studies looking at psychedelic use.
405960	418360	35	C	0.99979	Kind of the main theme has largely been this idea of increased entropy or increased complexity of the cortical activation in the brain.
419420	421690	36	C	0.99988	So there are various measures of this.
423180	438300	37	C	1	On the right here there's a figure of one of the common measures of complexity and looking at various different kinds of states that an individual might be in and how that relates to complexity.
438820	460340	38	C	0.99379	So you have individuals in vegetative states or anesthesized states having relatively low brain activity complexity, you have individuals in awake states having higher complexity and then individuals who have ingested either psilocybin or LSD showing the highest brain complexity.
462680	474840	39	C	0.99997	Now, along with this, rather than just this kind of like single unified score, there's work looking particularly at the changes in functional connectivity between different brain regions or different brain networks.
475580	491808	40	C	1	And the general trend seems to be that you have decreased within network functional connectivity and increase between network functional connectivity, which this kind of can be interpreted as different brain networks which typically don't communicate as much with each.
491814	503860	41	C	0.99994	Other, more likely to communicate with each other undo the effects of psychedelics and the kind of like internal coherence of networks is reduced under psychedelics.
505400	521400	42	C	0.99994	People have maybe heard of this default mode network right, which is responsible for a lot of self referential processing which is responsible, which is typically activated, for example, when individuals are off task, mind wandering, not actively engaged.
522940	533180	43	C	1	The default mode network has been kind of consistently implicated in being having less of this kind of like within network connectivity, less of this functional integration.
533840	541760	44	C	1	And this has been hypothesized to be one of the kind of key mechanisms of the therapeutic effect of psychedelics.
545860	561030	45	C	0.99999	In addition to looking at kind of like brain network activity on a high level, you can then also zoom in much more deeply and look at what's actually going on at the neuron by neuron level or the neuron connectivity level.
562680	577760	46	C	0.99999	Here we see kind of very certain, very consistent story around this psychoplastogenic effect or this neuroplastogenic effect, where there are a number of different markers of increased plasticity in the brain.
577940	594668	47	C	0.94491	So one that's very common is this increased brain derived neurotropic factor which we see hours after psychedelic use for a variety of different psychedelic drugs.
594844	607568	48	C	1	And this is then accompanied a few hours later by visible increases in the dendritic spine growth in cortical parameter neurons.
607744	614016	49	C	0.99464	So this is both the number of dendritic spines and the complexity of the spines.
614128	627080	50	C	0.95664	You can see a very clear example of this here on the right, where you have on the top the vehicle and then the bottom the DMT treated pyramidal neuron.
627580	630136	51	C	0.99	And the difference is very stark.
630168	639980	52	C	0.99994	You don't even have to do any sort of actual computational analysis for it to be clear that there's quite significant dendritic growth from a single dosing.
642180	655940	53	C	0.69	And the changes to functional connectivity, which I mentioned in the previous slide, tend to persist, though in a less extreme form than what we see during the acute effects.
658440	676120	54	C	0.62977	So the question then becomes, given all of this, how can we attempt to tell a consistent computational story, what's actually going on during both the acute effects, the post acute effects, and in terms of the actual downstream therapeutic outcomes?
678480	693760	55	C	0.97754	So what's kind of been proposed as one of the leading models of this is the relaxed belief under psychedelics model, the Rebus model of Carhartt, Harris and Tristan.
694260	710580	56	C	0.99	And so this builds on the kind of like active inference, hierarchical predictive processing framework where we can understand the brain as this series of predictors stacked kind of like hierarchically along brain networks.
711400	722520	57	C	1	And predictions are being made by higher level networks that are attempting to predict the errors of lower level networks.
724060	733180	58	C	0.57	And the process of basically doing this then produces this series of belief landscapes at different levels of spatiotemporal abstraction.
735040	741280	59	C	1	And these belief landscapes, of course, can encode beliefs with various levels of precision.
742660	750850	60	C	1	And it's the modulation of the precision of these beliefs which is believed to take place under psychedelic use.
754750	764222	61	C	0.99857	So here's kind of like a very high level version of this Rebus model and how belief relaxation might actually happen, right?
764276	772862	62	C	0.99927	So given that you have this series of cortical networks which are representing beliefs at different spatiotemporal scales.
773006	787014	63	C	0.99998	We can kind of think of the thalamus as being kind of like the entry point where sensory information is being gated into this hierarchical system and the prefrontal cortex as being kind of like one of the highest level.
787052	801900	64	C	0.99896	Networks, which is then responsible for both representing the most abstract kinds of beliefs as well as being kind of the primary inhibiting force for all of the downstream beliefs in the network, in the system.
803070	810080	65	C	0.9916	So what is this heavy agonism of the five h T two A receptor supposed to be doing in this case?
810530	827410	66	C	0.87284	Well, it's going to be decreasing the prefrontal cortex's ability to make coherent predictions and coherent representations of belief, which will then disrupt its ability to inhibit lower levels of the cortical hierarchy.
827830	842302	67	C	1	At the same time, by disrupt this activation of the Salamic or this disruption of the thalamic gating is going to result in additional sensory information entering the cortex that wouldn't underwise enter the cortex.
842466	857338	68	C	0.97779	You have these kind of disruptions at these two levels which then result in beliefs being spontaneously represented in ways that they wouldn't normally be represented.
857434	867070	69	C	0.99	And the Rebus model at least is suggesting that this mainly is going to manifest itself as a kind of relaxation of these beliefs.
870470	876740	70	C	0.71698	So here is a kind of like very simple diagram of what this might look like.
877270	901094	71	C	0.99743	So you have some landscape of beliefs here and you can kind of interpret the position along the X and Y or, I guess, the X and Z belief in A as being corresponding to some particular belief that might be represented by the network at this layer or at this level of representation.
901222	906314	72	C	1	And then the Y axis, the height as being the actual precision of that belief.
906362	906958	73	C	0.99925	Right?
907124	917594	74	C	0.99999	So here we have this kind of very deep part on the right part of this network or on this landscape and this would be a very strongly represented belief.
917642	934034	75	C	0.83641	Let's say what the acute effects of psychedelics are then understood to be doing right is to be flattening this landscape to be less strongly representing these strongly represented beliefs to maybe making it easier for the reversal of this landscape.
934082	958430	76	C	0.99997	So to move from one attractor state to another tractor state, which is meant to be understood to be kind of therapeutic in various ways, and then the post acute effect being some kind of return to normalcy, but one that is not totally complete, one that still incorporates some of these newly relaxed beliefs, these newly explored beliefs.
963560	983880	77	C	0.99997	Building on this rebus model, karin Harris and colleagues last year proposed this canal model of psychopathology, which basically kind of takes the intuition that the relaxation, if the Reevis model is correct, if the relaxation of beliefs has a therapeutic outcome.
984220	1005170	78	C	0.99969	If you kind of take that way of thinking to its logical conclusion, you might then propose something like this, which would say if relaxing overly strong beliefs therapeutic, then having overly strong beliefs in the first place is pathological in some kind of way.
1006580	1023140	79	C	1	And they refer to this development of these overly strongly represented beliefs as canalized beliefs and this problem generally as canalization or this process of developing them as canalization.
1023800	1026268	80	C	1	And this is the canal model of psych pathology.
1026304	1039260	81	C	0.99993	So they kind of build on this idea, this set of previous work in the literature suggesting that there may be some primary factor of psychopathology and they suggest that this primary factor is canalization.
1040080	1051020	82	C	1	And in this work they discuss a number of different psychopathologies which seem to quite clearly fit this canalization type characterization.
1051180	1059696	83	C	0.99862	So it's very relatively straightforward I think, to understand things like addiction, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders.
1059808	1085180	84	C	0.80897	All of these involve in one way or another having some strongly held beliefs, typically negative, negative beliefs in the case of like, depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive, body image disorder, or in the case of substance use disorder, some very strong beliefs about what kind of behaviors should be taken at any given time in any given context.
1087440	1102480	85	C	1	And then of course, the effect of psychedelics is to undo canalization and the better able any sort of therapeutic intervention is to undo canalization, the more likely for a positive therapeutic outcome.
1104660	1110230	86	C	0.99448	So I think this work has a lot of strengths and there's a kind of elegance to it.
1111800	1139020	87	C	0.99776	In our deep Pinal's work that we've worked on, we kind of identify a couple of limitations of this canal model and attempt to extend and refine the model in ways that I think ultimately make it more powerful, while kind of keeping the essential elegant insight that cannibalization is kind of like intimately tied to pathology.
1140720	1155250	88	C	0.99973	So the first kind of limitation I think that we identify is that in the canal model it's very heavily implied that all forms of canalization are pathological in one way or another.
1155620	1162980	89	C	1	And as I mentioned just now, this is clearly the case for a large class of very common psychopathologies.
1164120	1172410	90	C	0.51289	It's when we start to look more towards edge cases, I think that these exceptions start to problematize this understanding, right?
1173340	1190540	91	C	0.99995	So if we consider psychopathologies such as bipolar, borderline schizophrenia, depersonalization disorder, it becomes much more difficult to kind of easily classify these as simply problems of overly strong priors.
1190880	1205250	92	C	0.97827	In many cases here we have problems of priors that are not so strong or priors that seem to drift over time in ways that are problematic for both the individual and the people that the individual are close to.
1206580	1229016	93	C	1	And if we think about psychedelics then as being this kind of panacea to undo cannibalization and undo psychopathology, we also run into this other issue which is that there are certain kinds of psychopathologies which are typically issues for use with psychedelics, right?
1229038	1240380	94	C	0.99998	So schizophrenia being a very clear one, where there's evidence of psychedelic use being a trigger for the onset of psychosis in individuals who are predisposed to schizophrenia.
1241920	1248130	95	C	0.99991	There's also evidence of the development of depersonalization disorders with strong psychedelic use.
1248900	1259620	96	C	0.99	And this is not what we would expect if psychedelics were simply universally undoing or getting rid of psychopathologies.
1260760	1273672	97	C	0.99946	There's also this idea, which I think Adam is going to develop quite a bit later, that the stability of beliefs is typically correlated with positive mental health outcomes, not negative ones.
1273806	1281210	98	C	0.88	And what is a stable belief if not one that is highly analyzed in some kind of meaningful sense within the system?
1286240	1313830	99	C	0.73	And a second limitation is that if you think about an actual dynamical system, one that is parameterized in some kind of meaningful way, like a brain, which is parameterized by synaptic connections and then instantiates neural activity patterns over time, and we think about what kinds of optimization landscapes are actually being induced by such a system.
1315800	1322280	100	C	0.99999	We find that there's not just one kind of canalization, there's actually two kinds of canalization.
1324060	1336460	101	C	1	And in our deep canals work, we attempt to kind of take inspiration from deep learning literature to tease apart these two kinds of canalization and understand them a bit more clearly.
1338000	1345100	102	C	1	And they are just to kind of give a preview these two different things, overfitting and plasticity loss.
1345600	1361984	103	C	0.99994	So overfitting is the problem of your canalized in a particular kind of way and whatever sort of policy you've learned, whatever sort of set of beliefs you have, these don't generalize to some other context.
1362112	1374744	104	C	0.8984	You're in context A, you may be very well adapted, you move to context B and whatever you've learned doesn't apply there, then plasticity loss is a little bit different.
1374942	1382808	105	C	0.69316	Plasticity loss has to do with not one's ability to generalize, but rather one's ability to adapt or to learn.
1382894	1388508	106	C	0.99998	So imagine you're in context A, you may or may not be well adapted to context A.
1388594	1395200	107	C	0.99995	If you move to context B, the question becomes are you able to adapt to context B or not?
1395350	1395664	108	C	0.80331	Not.
1395702	1399504	109	C	0.99993	Are you immediately already ready to deal with context B?
1399622	1403410	110	C	0.99995	But given time in context B, can you learn and change?
1405700	1411510	111	C	1	And we use a very simple recurrent neural network model to kind of make sense of this.
1412360	1427080	112	C	1	And I think this is important because there can be different kinds of canalization on these different kinds of optimization landscapes and these have unique implications for the treatment of psychopathology.
1427500	1433980	113	C	1	And I think even more importantly, psychedelics work on these different landscapes in different ways.
1434130	1445020	114	C	1	And so understanding how they work is essential to developing better drugs, better treatment protocols and more personalized treatment.
1447700	1451436	115	C	0.6954	Okay, so what are these two optimization landscapes?
1451468	1453010	116	C	0.99997	How can we make sense of them?
1454740	1459490	117	C	0.99993	This is kind of like the big overview figure of the deep canal's work.
1461060	1464436	118	C	0.99463	So we kind of start with this intuition of a recurrent neural network, right?
1464458	1469716	119	C	1	And in a recurrent neural network there are these two sets of parameters that you have at any given time.
1469818	1476856	120	C	0.99982	You have the actual weights of the network and then you have the hidden activation of the network, right?
1476878	1484910	121	C	1	And so the weights of the network are theta and the hidden activation is h and there's some input into the network at any given time step.
1485840	1491628	122	C	1	And then the output of the network is a function of both the input and the hidden state.
1491794	1495900	123	C	1	And the hidden state is updated at every time the hidden activation pattern.
1497440	1501040	124	C	1	And this gives us essentially these two different landscapes.
1501620	1505356	125	C	1	One, what we refer to as the inference landscape or the type A landscape.
1505388	1509108	126	C	1	And this is equivalent to the neural activation pattern of a brain at any time.
1509194	1529690	127	C	0.99299	So what gets read off from an fMRI, what gets read off from the EEG is going to correspond to this activity landscape, but kind of like underlying or supporting this activity landscape is this other more fundamental landscape which is the actual optimization landscape that is induced by the synaptic weights themselves.
1531340	1540344	128	C	0.83	And this is what is the result of right click synaptic connectivity in the brain between all the sets of neurons in the brain.
1540392	1545390	129	C	1	This is what is changing when we have various forms of heavy and plasticity heavy in learning.
1547840	1555792	130	C	1	And this is what kind of instantiates the possible sets of neural activity patterns, right?
1555846	1566020	131	C	0.9999	So this is kind of like a way we can start to understand this, which is when we think about belief landscapes, right?
1566090	1571764	132	C	0.99819	As I mentioned before, here's a very simple diagram where we have a two dimensional belief landscape.
1571892	1580772	133	C	1	And let's say there's someone who's depressed or potentially depressed and they might have a negative self image.
1580836	1584152	134	C	0.99962	I'm a terrible person, I can't do anything right.
1584206	1585112	135	C	1	Something like this.
1585246	1590360	136	C	0.99994	This would be encoded as a particular position in this belief landscape.
1590940	1596610	137	C	0.51681	When the neural activity pattern looks like this, this belief is what gets expressed, right?
1598340	1610070	138	C	1	And there's another set of neural activity patterns which would correspond to a positive self image, a positive self belief, I'm great, I'm wonderful, or even just, I'm okay, I'm totally acceptable as a person.
1610520	1613060	139	C	1	And this would be a different set of patterns.
1614200	1623940	140	C	0.99431	So based on the synaptic, the actual connectivity structure of the brain, these two patterns may be more or less likely.
1624020	1636830	141	C	0.65902	So here these are being represented by these two different sets of neural activation landscapes which are the result of two different positions in this synaptic weight landscape space.
1637200	1662660	142	C	1	And in this top space, the one that's in the middle of here that then is represented here at the top of part C of the figure, we see that there's very high precision assigned to or very high likelihood assigned to the negative self image and very low likelihood here assigned to the positive self image.
1663240	1672612	143	C	0.99995	But in some other part of the synaptic weight landscape, a very different kind of neural activity landscape might be instantiated.
1672756	1681640	144	C	0.75	And this one kind of has the inverse properties where negative self image is unlikely and positive self image is much more likely.
1682080	1694636	145	C	0.95033	So we can kind of then understand positions in the neural activity landscape as kind of corresponding to specific phenomenological experiential instantiations of certain kinds of beliefs, right?
1694658	1701520	146	C	0.833	So like the actual experience of holding a negative self image or holding a positive self image.
1702660	1708500	147	C	0.99	And we can understand positions in the synaptic weight landscape as being something more general.
1708570	1729450	148	C	0.99993	So in the case of depression, there might be a specific set of synaptic weight connectivity which would correspond to what you might call a depressed individual, someone who might qualify as having major depressive disorder and another set of synaptic weights connectivity pattern that wouldn't qualify as that.
1734390	1745960	149	C	0.74262	Okay, so before I get into the psychedelic, how psychedelics relate to this, I think Adam is going to talk a little bit about some work he's done extending the.
1761410	1762160	150	D	0.79934	Hello.
1763570	1776258	151	D	0.96018	So, yeah, I've been thinking about this a while and then along the way I met Arthur, who also has been thinking about this a while, but in different ways.
1776344	1796166	152	D	0.79	And so like Arthur's background is in basically consciousness science and a very peculiar field of computational consciousness science in terms of actual models of what it would be to have a conscious system, even potentially an artificially conscious system.
1796348	1805530	153	D	0.92	And so I'm coming from more free energy principle and active inference, my background and Arthur's coming from more mainstream machine learning.
1805680	1817150	154	D	0.98	And so we were coming together to explore this beast from different perspectives and been finding a lot of, I think, very interesting overlap.
1817650	1824660	155	D	0.95	And so in terms of Albus, the basic idea is to take Rebus and expand on it.
1825590	1826930	156	D	0.99	I love rebus.
1827270	1836014	157	D	0.99973	It's a great framework and I've been trying to make it, I guess, more flexible in terms of being able to handle a wider range of assumptions.
1836062	1841990	158	D	0.92986	So not just talking about relaxed beliefs, but also potentially strengthened beliefs and in different combinations.
1842570	1845058	159	D	0.99993	This was always part of the rebus framework.
1845154	1848754	160	D	0.98	And that you can have all sorts of both direct and indirect effects.
1848802	1856694	161	D	0.99999	When you're dealing with a large predictive hierarchy or any complex system, you change something in one way, but then you'll get an effect elsewhere.
1856742	1867098	162	D	0.99987	So if you have this hierarchy of predictions, for instance, you can potentially relax beliefs at higher levels and that can indirectly cause strengthened beliefs at lower levels.
1867194	1872110	163	D	0.99417	So you can both get relaxed and strengthened beliefs and psychedelics and all sorts of different combinations.
1872630	1880862	164	D	0.91	And so with Albus the idea is so I've been calling as opposed to a belief relaxation.
1881006	1887046	165	D	0.99951	When you get this sort of basically bottom right here, you might see it.
1887068	1909370	166	D	0.99253	So this red would be basically something like a synchronized complex of neural activity, often involving the thalamus, which would be thought to encode your predictions, or your top down stream of priors, which then are suppressing the ascending stream of prediction errors.
1909790	1919066	167	D	0.98	And so under revis, you're seeing here relaxed predictions, a smaller complex of synchronized activity.
1919178	1920398	168	D	0.82	And the gates are down.
1920484	1922954	169	D	0.99984	Just like Arthur described, more things are coming in.
1923092	1931406	170	D	0.85206	Rebus will sometimes be described in terms of so when we're talking about rebus this idea of relaxing beliefs.
1931438	1940962	171	D	0.88056	We're thinking at the functional or computational level, like with David Mars and analyzing the mind, you have these three, I suppose, Supervenient levels.
1941026	1942914	172	D	0.80124	They're compatible and synergistic.
1942962	1948360	173	D	0.97101	So computational functional, like abstractly, what is the system doing?
1948890	1958374	174	D	0.99996	Something like the pseudocode of the system and then implementational mechanistically how it's realized and then in the middle, some sort of algorithmic intermediate abstraction layer.
1958502	1961206	175	D	0.99996	How are these computations realized via these mechanisms?
1961238	1962246	176	D	0.99724	Some bridging.
1962278	1963682	177	D	0.96309	Principle description.
1963846	1968986	178	D	0.98	And so when it comes to rebus, you can adopt it in different ways and relate to it differently.
1969018	1978482	179	D	0.97331	So you can relate to it at the functional level or you can relate to it at the algorithmic or implementational levels in terms of where you're taking the account.
1978536	1986958	180	D	0.98812	So, for instance, you might think something like rebus effects is a very valuable model of something like what they call quantum change of psychedelics.
1987054	1992818	181	D	0.9999	But you don't necessarily believe in predictive processing, but you still might be, you could say like a rebus type theorist.
1992994	2008460	182	D	0.99942	Or you might be thinking in terms of rebus in a more narrow sense of thinking, of predictive processing information flows, but then when you get to the overall person and integrated organism and the agent, you might have different interpretations there.
2009070	2025258	183	D	0.91616	So with the work with Albus, basically the idea would be to take predictive processing and models of psychedelic action and suggest that sometimes not only do we have these relaxation of belief landscapes, but we might have the opposite of strengthening.
2025434	2044550	184	D	1	And so specifically, if you're activating these five HD two A neurons, which would be at the deeper levels of the cortical sheet and also the deeper levels of the cortical hierarchy, more inwards and higher up, and these would be the units that would loop to the thalamus and thereby be able to form large synchronous integrated complexes.
2045210	2051974	185	D	0.99998	But that when you excite them too much, they don't wait for each other to sync up, they fire whenever they can out of sync.
2052022	2054102	186	D	1	And this relaxes the belief landscape.
2054246	2061670	187	D	0.99999	However, it's not clear this should happen the whole way through for any amount of increasing the gain on these neurons.
2061750	2078130	188	D	0.99998	So in theory, just increasing the gain a little bit, unless that might help them to sync up, that might strengthen the belief, whether it's a situationally specific suggestion of you in this context or maybe something old coming to the surface and if you will manifesting.
2078950	2095270	189	D	0.98599	So Albus basically, in a nutshell, would be saying to take rebus and keep going with it and look for different combinations of both strengthened, both directly and indirectly strengthened and relaxed beliefs.
2095850	2097046	190	D	0.61627	That's basically it.
2097148	2099510	191	D	0.98	And so I'm not going to go into too many more details.
2099590	2102278	192	D	0.63588	Arthur and I just submitted this for publication.
2102374	2103414	193	D	0.99952	Wish us luck.
2103542	2113834	194	D	0.99984	Hopefully the reviewers will be useful, maybe even kind, but preferably useful, and kick it back to Arthur.
2113882	2121982	195	D	0.9998	But before work, I think it's immensely important that we get these details, right?
2122116	2142754	196	D	0.99355	These are extremely powerful medicines that could revolutionize things or we could have a backlash if we do it wrong, if we're careless, if we don't see the risks, but also if we're overly beholden to a single way of viewing things prematurely, we might also miss opportunities to help, potentially enormous opportunities.
2142882	2149794	197	D	0.99476	For instance, you might not think of helping people, for instance, micro dosing for cognitive decline.
2149922	2154938	198	D	0.99963	You might not have thought of that and that might be a really big deal that you do think of that.
2155104	2163690	199	D	0.97595	So I guess for going back to Arthur, one more thing would be just in terms of, at least for me, experientially.
2163770	2178286	200	D	0.98	The way I sometimes think of it is with relation to well being and suffering, both things matter, like the strength of your positive beliefs and the strength of your negative beliefs.
2178318	2180974	201	D	0.99	And sometimes the negative beliefs have positive aspects and vice versa.
2181022	2200060	202	D	0.97128	So it's both like you might relax your beliefs and to use like a Harry Potter metaphor be somewhat so much out of the grip of the dementors that usually that under some circumstances might be pursuing you that you have room to be different, to become different, to think different things under this different state.
2200830	2214240	203	D	0.99861	But additionally, and not mutually exclusively, not necessarily incompatibly maybe synergistically the strength of what beliefs you're able to have in that moment and maybe draw upon from the past could be deeply important.
2215090	2220400	204	D	0.99998	Your values, the kinds of beliefs that you call upon in times of need and they give you hope.
2220770	2223850	205	D	0.99999	Maybe those are just originally suggested to you right there in the session.
2223930	2229314	206	D	1	But maybe there's something else, another belief, and that strengthening it could be a good thing.
2229352	2240120	207	D	0.98	And even without a clinical context, like microdosers, for instance, it's not clear exactly they're trying to relax their beliefs, like the range of use cases, the way we want to relate them and how we want to be in the world.
2241290	2243158	208	D	0.60582	It seems complicated to me.
2243324	2247670	209	D	0.98965	So I will take it back to Arthur.
2258000	2258412	210	C	0.71096	Great.
2258466	2258684	211	C	0.99912	Yeah.
2258722	2259980	212	C	0.99957	Thanks so much, Adam.
2261040	2274420	213	C	0.41454	OK, so with that context of Alice, I want to talk a little bit about how we might understand at a very high level what psychedelics are doing to these two belief landscapes.
2275080	2278710	214	C	0.99636	So before I showed you very quickly, I guess I can go back to it.
2279240	2296430	215	C	0.99986	In the Rebus model there's only one type of optimization landscape and so there's only one type of canalization and what is supposed to be happening is a relaxation of leaves which is strong during the acute effect and persists in the post acute effect.
2298000	2303020	216	C	0.98674	So with albus though, we might be able to think about all of this a little bit differently.
2304160	2319936	217	C	0.99503	We can, enduring the acute effects of psychedelics, interpret what's happening to the type A landscape as being less of a kind of universal relaxation and more of a kind of destabilization where under certain circumstances beliefs are being strengthened, other beliefs.
2319968	2321472	218	C	0.99992	Are being relaxed.
2321616	2326692	219	C	1	This is changing quite rapidly over the course of time.
2326826	2335800	220	C	0.91948	So a certain belief might be transiently strengthened a few minutes later, it may no longer be supported or supportable.
2337900	2349180	221	C	1	And this actually functionally enables a kind of exploration of a wide space of belief instantiations during the acute effects of the drug.
2352320	2364844	222	C	0.99996	As far as the inference landscape is concerned, post acute effects, as Adam was saying, it could be the fact that certain positive beliefs are explored and can be strengthened, other negative beliefs might be weakened.
2364972	2368080	223	C	0.99907	This is kind of like the ideal psychotherapeutic outcome.
2369860	2376692	224	C	0.9981	It may be on average that something like a relaxation, a general relaxation of beliefs is what you might see.
2376826	2384616	225	C	0.99783	But the way that you get there is likely going to be through a kind of much more complicated process, I think.
2384638	2404024	226	C	0.99956	What's then interesting and related also to what Adam said about thinking much more broadly about how psychedelics might be used in terms of neurocognitive disorders, in addition to kind of like traditional psychopathologies is to think about what's happening to the learning landscape, the kind of like underlying synaptic weight landscape.
2404152	2414988	227	C	1	And what do we understand is happening here kind of quite clearly is there is neurogenesis psychoplastogenic effects, there's dendritic growth.
2415084	2416284	228	C	1	And what is this enabling?
2416332	2421860	229	C	0.99996	Well, this is enabling greater connectivity between, within and between networks.
2423240	2435852	230	C	0.89	And so kind of from a functional learning perspective, learning theory perspective, what this means is that gradient information can flow more easily through these networks.
2436016	2440708	231	C	1	And what this means is that it's easier to get from one part of the network to the other part of the network.
2440804	2449950	232	C	0.99999	There are fewer of these kind of optimization local minima, there are fewer of these kind of tricky saddle points.
2451360	2457970	233	C	1	And what this means kind of like functionally is that this plasticity loss that I discussed earlier is going to be less of an issue.
2459220	2472832	234	C	1	And here it seems to be kind of like regardless of the acute, the actual phenomenological effects, there are very strong downstream effects on this structural connectivity.
2472976	2482436	235	C	1	And I think there's some interesting work suggesting that there may actually be independent mechanisms that are affecting these two landscapes.
2482468	2507612	236	C	0.99977	So there's recent work suggesting for example that psychedelics as well as ketamine is able to kind of particularly bind to receptors in the brain that produce that result in the kind of release of the brain derived neurotrophic factor and then the downstream changes in synaptic weighting and that this may be potentially totally independent of the five H C two a agonism.
2507676	2508290	237	C	0.99446	Right?
2510420	2514720	238	C	1	And this has very interesting implications for future drug design and development.
2516500	2528310	239	C	0.98637	Okay, so I'm going to, before my next slide, turn it over to Adam once more to briefly talk a bit about personality theory and the relationship between psychedelics and.
2532090	2533160	240	D	0.67957	Hello again.
2537290	2558890	241	D	0.97	So for the past few years I've been doing some work with a personality researcher, Colin de Jung, on intersections between the way agency is modeled in the free energy principle and active inference framework and the way that persons are considered in different situations in personality science and looking for points of intersection.
2562770	2565066	242	D	0.99882	Personality is actually an extremely deep concept.
2565098	2581266	243	D	1	And if you think of it, I guess we call it like the normal form of a system in terms of what is the way you can describe the most of the system with like the minimal message length, the account for the most of the least.
2581448	2591826	244	D	1	And what we're trying to account for is the states that people tend to occupy, people aren't always happy, people aren't always sad, people aren't always friendly, they're not always angry.
2591858	2598266	245	D	0.99997	It's all sorts of things that there's a range that people are encountering but they tend to occupy some states more than others.
2598368	2610320	246	D	0.94	And you might call that their personality and you might call it many systems would have their own personalities in terms of trying to describe something like their essence and so they're attracting states.
2610850	2633106	247	D	0.98	And so with Colin de Jung's work, he interprets personality and these major domains of personality that people have discovered a reliable factor structure ways you can chunk the variance, the big five as a trait hierarchy but where these different traits are interpreted as cybernetic control parameters.
2633298	2654394	248	D	0.7523	Specifically cybernetics in terms of the study of goal seeking systems governed by various forms of feedback that different stages of the process of pursuing goals, evaluating outcomes updating understanding that basically the personality as different modes of being in the world.
2654432	2662800	249	D	1	For cybernetic systems, interpreting them as parameters for goal pursuit because we are goal seeking systems trying to pursue the goals we value.
2664370	2675570	250	D	1	And so I guess moving to this with relation to what we're talking about now, both in terms of personality formation, reformation and the structure of personality.
2679750	2680066	251	C	1	To.
2680088	2696710	252	D	1	Get to the P factor within personality theory, this big five traits, the set of big five traits, there's a richer or more detailed factor structure, a hierarchical structure for personality that's been discovered.
2696870	2706090	253	D	0.98357	So above the Big Five, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, you'll have a metatrate of their shared various that's observed called stability.
2706430	2708830	254	D	0.36437	It's also been called alpha by, I think, Digman.
2709490	2722900	255	D	0.93	And then above the traits of extroversion and openness intellect, you have this MetaTrade of plasticity and are called beta and the shared variants of these two.
2723270	2737714	256	D	0.99637	So what's interesting is that within this field of within high top, which is this effort to try to characterize psychopathology using the same kind of data driven methods in personality science.
2737842	2754710	257	D	0.63	A principled account of the structure of psychopathology, the way that personality has a structure and trying to account for this, there seems to be a common factor across many forms of psychopathology that's referred to as the P factor and it tends to be the inverse of stability.
2754790	2760634	258	D	0.81279	It's high neuroticism, low agreeableness and low conscientiousness.
2760762	2774290	259	D	1	And this is actually what's referred to in the article as this P factor, thinking of it as a lack of flexibility.
2774710	2776066	260	D	0.99998	You could make a case for it.
2776088	2779422	261	D	1	But more straightforwardly it seems to be a lack of stability.
2779566	2787554	262	D	0.99975	For something to be a lack of flexibility you would maybe be thinking of something more like plasticity, like someone having low plasticity.
2787602	2789938	263	D	0.99976	But empirically that's not what's observed.
2790034	2796186	264	D	0.89	And so if empirically that's not what's observed, that's a very important detail we should stop and take note of.
2796288	2807550	265	D	0.98902	So you might say that rather than emphasizing the first principal component of psychopathology, it's possible that this Canal model is actually focusing on the second factor.
2808610	2810030	266	D	0.85595	It's not a contest.
2810530	2818202	267	D	0.98411	It's still enormously a big factor like the work of Stephen Hayes and others showing that a lack of flexibility is transdiagnostic.
2818346	2831330	268	D	0.97471	But just empirically speaking, the first principal component of psychopathology might be more closely related to a lack of stability rather than insufficient plasticity.
2833210	2845634	269	D	1	I guess one more thing to think of in terms of stability and like as it's not exactly a contest, they're both important, both need to be considered and they're deeply interrelated.
2845682	2849654	270	D	0.98468	So Colin describes them as being in a state of something like dynamic tension.
2849782	2864542	271	D	0.64975	Like if you're insufficiently plastic and inflexible, you're not going to stay stable for long in a changing world, but if you don't have a stable base to move from, it's going to be hard to be plastic and reconfigure yourself in a sustainable way either.
2864676	2875630	272	D	0.99921	However, you could also see someone being overly rigid and excessive stability in a way that undermines their plasticity or overly flexible in a way that basically is destabilizing.
2875710	2879698	273	D	0.99995	So a dynamic tension but involving synergies also.
2879864	2888626	274	D	0.67	And I think in terms of the structure of personality and well being, this is what we need to keep in mind that both are needed, stability and plasticity.
2888658	2906060	275	D	0.92	And this is also just within it's actually what this was inspired, I think in Colin's thinking to consider these metatrades this way from machine learning, I think actually reading Grossberg and Stability plasticity trade offs and that's why he interpreted these metatrades in those terms.
2906990	2924210	276	D	0.98824	So I guess one more thing is there is a Petersonian backstory here that I don't know if I want to get into, but we can discuss it later if there's yeah, back to Arthur.
2926630	2927314	277	C	0.99572	That was great.
2927352	2927602	278	C	0.94015	Thanks.
2927656	2937470	279	C	0.34484	Adams yeah, very, very helpful context which should hopefully make this slide here much more clear to everyone.
2940000	2963540	280	C	0.98289	So given these kind of, like, two meta traits, stability and plasticity, which, as Adam beautifully described you're in this kind of dynamic tension with one another, we can kind of go back to these two optimization landscapes and these machine learning concepts that I discussed earlier and couldn't try to understand how these things might all relate and ultimately relate to psychopathology.
2964040	2970288	281	C	0.9999	So I had hinted before that there were these kind of two types of cannibalization.
2970384	2975780	282	C	0.99997	We might say one being overfitting and another being plasticity loss.
2975860	2985128	283	C	1	And we can interpret these as kind of like being extremes, the kind of like canalized end of how these two optimization landscapes might manifest.
2985224	2995148	284	C	0.98509	So in the type A inference landscape, this looks like overfitting on one end, heavy canalization and underfitting on the other end in the machine learning context, right?
2995234	3016820	285	C	0.99983	So overfitting being having very strong rigid beliefs that are in a particular environmental context, adaptive, but are very unlikely to be adapted in any other context, underfitting being having a set of beliefs which are not adapted to the current context and also unlikely to be adapted to any other context.
3018280	3027016	286	C	0.99997	As far as stability is concerned, I think we can understand stability, this MetaTrade, as kind of representing the balance of these two things, right?
3027118	3034520	287	C	0.98456	You have high stability when you are either overfit to a particular context or underfit.
3034860	3042060	288	C	0.99763	So this means you're well fit to this context that you're in now and you're also likely to be well fit to other future contacts.
3042480	3047228	289	C	1	I think this is also in complexity science, sometimes described as metastability, right?
3047394	3052770	290	C	0.87057	So you're at a stable point that will also likely be able to take you to other stable points in the future.
3053300	3059680	291	C	1	And this kind of like ability to stay stable over time is then stability MetaTrade.
3061140	3071060	292	C	0.99971	We can then look at the type B, the learning landscape, where the kind of extreme version of canalization is this plasticity loss where it's very difficult to adapt to new contexts.
3072940	3085020	293	C	1	The inverse of this is then catastrophic forgetting, where the problem is not one of adapting to new contexts, the problem is one of meaningfully retaining adaptive strategies and beliefs from previous contexts.
3086880	3090220	294	C	1	And so obviously neither of these are desirable.
3092480	3104530	295	C	1	What is desirable is some kind of balance between these two or one is able to adapt just enough to new context without forgetting previously learned things.
3104980	3110192	296	C	0.53648	But here the relationship to the Mediterranean plasticity is a bit different than stability, right?
3110246	3118820	297	C	0.99974	So as is being represented on this graph, the more plastic you are, basically the less canalized you are in the space, the more easy it is to move around.
3118970	3125480	298	C	0.90651	But actually extreme versions of this end up manifesting as catastrophic forgetting, at least in the machine learning context.
3125820	3147840	299	C	0.99	And I think this in particular has relevance for psychopathology and relevance for this idea, maybe complicates this idea, right, that psychedelic therapy is in and of itself likely to always lead to positive outcomes.
3153360	3153724	300	C	0.99885	Okay?
3153762	3166000	301	C	0.77	And we can attempt to understand this by making an effort at trying to map or understand various forms of psychology in the context of these two different learning landscapes.
3166340	3176310	302	C	1	And so before I get into this too much, I think it's important to say that this is very much a kind of like preliminary and provisional attempt at making sense of these things.
3177080	3187396	303	C	1	I hope that this is kind of the start of a much more fleshed out dialogue looking at how we can kind of understand psychopathology with respect to machine learning concepts.
3187588	3209480	304	C	0.99999	But I think this at least gives a good starting point for maybe trying to understand where and why psychedelic therapy is useful, isn't useful, which is a bit more nuanced than this simple idea of like psychopathology means cannibalization and psychedelic therapy means reducing cannibalization.
3209560	3210190	305	C	0.9953	Right?
3211280	3214770	306	C	0.91843	Okay, so let's try to make sense of this a little bit.
3215140	3225590	307	C	0.53961	So for the kind of classic set of psychopathologies for which there has been a lot of great research done with psychedelic therapy and a lot of clear benefit has been seen.
3226040	3238132	308	C	1	I think we can kind of class these within this upper left hand corner here, where these are disorders of both overfitting, which means in the moment overly strong beliefs get represented.
3238276	3249552	309	C	0.93574	These are strong attractor points in the neural activation landscape and plasticity loss in the type B landscape.
3249636	3266480	310	C	0.99999	Which means that not only is a certain kind of dynamics instantiated, which make, for example, in the case of major depressive disorder, extremely negative self evaluations very common, but it's the case that even given the correct changes in environmental context.
3267700	3276868	311	C	0.93743	Even given in the case of psychedelic cystotherapy, a lot of the work with major depressive disorder is being done with treatment resistant depression, right?
3276954	3294090	312	C	1	And what is treatment resistant depression but a kind of a set of beliefs, a set of neural activity patterns which are resistant to adaptation, to new environmental contexts being whatever sort of psychotherapy or previous drug was used.
3295100	3311176	313	C	0.62306	So this is high plasticity loss, high overhead and rate and these are kind of fortunately for psychedelic therapy and I think maybe for psychiatry in general, these are all very common and very, very costly psychopathologies.
3311208	3311500	314	C	0.99928	Right?
3311570	3316160	315	C	0.99996	So if it is the case that psychedelic therapy can treat these effectively, that's fantastic.
3317540	3325504	316	C	0.99999	But I think we can maybe look at a more complicated if we start to expand to other psychopathologies, the story becomes a little bit more complicated.
3325552	3326244	317	C	0.9937	Right?
3326442	3349564	318	C	0.99945	So we can look at the bottom left hand corner here where we have cases of in the inference landscape still overfitting, but in the learning landscape something else happening, form of kind of catastrophic forgetting or a form of kind of drift of the belief landscape that's being instantiated here.
3349602	3349804	319	C	0.99018	Right?
3349842	3360712	320	C	0.99994	So I think two kind of representative pathologies here typically referred to as some form of bipolar disorder or some form of borderline personality disorder.
3360856	3371552	321	C	0.83888	So in both of these cases, in the moment to moment neural activity as it unfolds, there are very strong sets of beliefs being instantiated at any given time and these are very difficult to change.
3371606	3372210	322	C	0.9884	Right?
3373300	3384244	323	C	0.99965	But the key differentiating point here being that over longer timescales, over the timescales of days or weeks, the kinds of beliefs that are instantiated change quite a lot.
3384282	3384484	324	C	0.99969	Right?
3384522	3405180	325	C	0.99999	So someone who's bipolar, if they're in a manic episode or in a depressive episode, the nature of the belief landscape being instantiated is very different for borderline individuals from a daily or weekly basis, the nature of one's beliefs about the people that are close to them can change very rapidly, very extremely in certain cases.
3406480	3427840	326	C	1	And so here the benefit of psychedelic therapy is a bit more mixed where there is likely the case that to the extent to which the kind of overt type A beliefs can be updated and changed to be more positive, be hopefully more relaxed, that's positive.
3427920	3439572	327	C	0.99994	But to the extent to which plasticity may be being increased when it's not actually needed, when there's not actually meaningful therapeutic benefits of that, it's a bit questionable.
3439636	3458776	328	C	1	I think there's clear borderline, or rather bipolar for example, is often individuals with bipolar are often excluded from psychedelic trials under the assumption for example, that psychedelics may trigger a manic episode or may trigger psychosis.
3458968	3462400	329	C	1	And I think that is a valid concern.
3464420	3475670	330	C	0.99981	So on kind of that topic then, this bottom right hand corner would be cases of both underfooting and catastrophic forgetting with I think schizophrenia being kind of like the most clear manifestation of this.
3477560	3486356	331	C	1	And here there's very little work currently looking at trying to treat schizophrenia with psychedelic therapy.
3486388	3508300	332	C	1	I think for pretty good reasons though I would say to the extent to which there are secondary manifestations, secondary issues like depression, anxiety that people with schizophrenia might have, these actually may be treatable with some form of psychedelic therapy.
3509520	3518604	333	C	1	And then lastly, this upper right hand corner here would correspond to underfitting in the type A landscape along with plasticity loss.
3518652	3534096	334	C	0.99955	So I think a good example of this is something like ADHD, where there are not very particularly strong beliefs that are being instantiated at any given time, but it's difficult to change these set of beliefs.
3534128	3546676	335	C	0.55825	Nonetheless, I think here there's a case where it's not totally clear how the benefit will actually play out in both of these cases.
3546788	3551310	336	C	0.98226	I've heard interesting work around like microdosing may be of interest.
3554880	3557740	337	C	0.99	I think yeah, more research has to be done to be seen.
3557810	3559756	338	C	0.68717	Right, and then what would microdosing be doing?
3559778	3573830	339	C	0.7707	Right, microdosing would be very slowly kind of like decreasing plasticity loss just a little bit, potentially also decreasing underfitting, as Adam has kind of suggested in the Albus model.
3579030	3585700	340	C	1	And here we have just kind of like a brief overview of more or less everything I've described about how these two landscapes are different.
3586950	3596674	341	C	1	I think most of these things I've said before pretty clearly right so the type A landscape corresponds to the neural activity pattern.
3596722	3598562	342	C	0.99944	This is the hidden state of the RNN.
3598706	3603686	343	C	0.05519	Overcannilization is going to be stereotyped mental circuits, very strongly held beliefs.
3603798	3608170	344	C	0.99606	Under canalization is going to be these inconsistently deployed circuits.
3609950	3618350	345	C	0.99988	It looks like overfitting in the canalized case, underfitting in the non canalized case going to correspond to stability, the metatrate.
3618850	3632820	346	C	1	I hadn't discussed this before, but I think there's a relationship between cognitive flexibility and this inference landscape psychedelics are mainly going to affect the work at the acute level care.
3633190	3644982	347	C	1	And this is by directly exciting the neurons or inducing forms of hadavian plasticity and the outcome is going to be a mixture of relaxation and strengthening of the kind that Adam described in the Albus case.
3645116	3651980	348	C	1	The type B landscape then is working on the synaptic weights and these are the actual network parameters in our RNN model.
3652590	3657500	349	C	0.97689	Over canalization is this inability to learn or adapt over time.
3658030	3662414	350	C	0.98714	Under canalization is the inability to retain information right?
3662452	3665870	351	C	1	And those correspond to plasticity loss and catastrophic forgetting.
3666930	3679250	352	C	0.99999	This also is kind of the traditional plasticity metatrate, which I think corresponds to this longer term constructed psychological flexibility.
3680390	3689990	353	C	0.68	The effects are going to mainly be mediated post acutely with psychedelics and these are the more downstream metaplastic effects, the psychoplastogenic effects.
3691130	3696150	354	C	0.98	And I think on the whole the effect here is a relaxation of canalization.
3698890	3701638	355	C	0.63	And yeah, these are just the references.
3701734	3708362	356	C	0.60492	So those are the slides I have that's kind of the overview of the Deep canals model, I think.
3708416	3721230	357	C	0.99984	Now I'll turn it over to Mike who's going to share some thoughts both about this work and some of his own work and kind of this approach to understanding psychedelics more broadly.
3726210	3727906	358	A	0.60922	Ah, great.
3728088	3730094	359	A	0.99989	Yeah, thank you for that overview.
3730142	3731060	360	A	0.9999	That was great.
3733030	3757370	361	A	0.99841	So I guess I'm just in general very optimistic about this corner of neuroscience, that there are these very intuitive models that are very sort of clinically significant and I also think there is a lot of responsibility to sort of get things right here as well.
3757520	3758890	362	A	0.73752	As Adam noted.
3761470	3775330	363	A	0.9	I have just a few comments and for the viewers, I'm not speaking for Arthur and Adam, I'm just grateful for the invitation to join the discussion.
3777110	3788440	364	A	0.98576	So I wanted to note quickly three research themes dealing with the implementation of this class of model.
3789130	3797750	365	A	0.99995	So just broadly kind of pointing at both Deep Canals and Andrebus and Albus.
3799550	3813920	366	A	0.99904	So in 2019 I wrote Neural Annealing and that was sort of developing the canalization frame within the context of energy buildup in the eigen modes of a system.
3815410	3823710	367	A	0.99429	So you have the nice annealing metaphor, you have a temperature parameter and entropic disintegration.
3825670	3852426	368	A	0.63736	Robin Carter said a beautiful paper on that dantropic brain and then you sort of have a post heating result where the microstructure of your system is sort of a result of how hot and how long the heating was.
3852528	3857210	369	A	0.9891	So it's an alternative take on belief relaxation.
3857790	3864590	370	A	1	And I do think that there are some pluses in terms of sort of explicitly making the annealing metaphor.
3866530	3872846	371	A	0.97	And I think that two things that I'd point out.
3872948	3885410	372	A	1	One, top down models or top down predictive models as energy sinks and eigen modes as the places where energy can build up or almost sort of hide from top down models.
3886550	3904840	373	A	0.99825	So you get this phenomenon of semantically neutral energy or semantically illegible energy we can say, which is sort of kind of how perhaps psychedelics music and meditation all sort of allow energy building.
3905630	3910010	374	A	1	The energy that they contribute to the system can evade the top tone models.
3911710	3918810	375	A	0.99	And yeah, just to note, one item that I'm looking at now is what is Deep Canals?
3918890	3922590	376	A	0.99116	Has the inference landscape versus learning landscape distinction?
3923010	3929102	377	A	1	And how would one sort of build that distinction within the neural Annealing framework?
3929246	3946710	378	A	1	And guess one metaphor that I'm considering is the self as sort of a magnet to sort of apply a constraint, a uniform focusing constraint on the system as it's cooling.
3948570	3956090	379	A	1	The second item that I wanted to mention, so I have this piece, autism as a disorder of dimensionality.
3956910	3969802	380	A	0.99	And this brings in the concept of network density that it may very well be that people on the spectrum have literally more neurons and or more synapses.
3969946	3977460	381	A	0.66	And there's this great Michelangelo quote, I saw the angel in the stone, and I set him free.
3977990	3985860	382	A	1	And sort of the thicker networks you have, the more stone you have to work with, but you actually have to do the work.
3986470	4002090	383	A	0.99554	So you sort of have to do sort of well, normally you sort of inherit these highly pretrained optimized circuits, almost like asics application specific integrated circuit.
4003470	4010060	384	A	1	And then this is kind of more an untrained network, and you have to train it yourself.
4011390	4019710	385	A	1	And within the Deep Canals framework, this would show up as both underfitting and higher capacity for plasticity.
4022130	4027620	386	A	0.9968	So I think that's going to be an interesting thread to pull.
4030310	4031010	387	A	0.89184	Finally.
4031160	4041030	388	A	0.9961	So I just posted that last week, principles of Vaso Computation and as an implementation level account of active inference.
4041530	4043990	389	A	0.99	And this is a big rabbit hole.
4044330	4048550	390	A	1	I don't think we have time to go down it today.
4048700	4063120	391	A	0.99985	But I just comment that I really like the way Deep Canals explicitly splits out the learning landscape and the inference landscape, that I think that making this distinction is increasingly going to make sense.
4070100	4071280	392	A	0.99527	Back to Arthur.
4072020	4073680	393	B	0.98615	Yeah, awesome.
4073750	4075900	394	B	0.99731	Well, thank you all for the presentations.
4075980	4083350	395	B	0.83922	Arthur and Adam, feel free to pick up where Michael left off, or I can bring in some questions from the chat or from what I've written down.
4102020	4103580	396	A	0.9997	Just a quick comment.
4103740	4124744	397	A	1	I do think that in the Deep Canals framework, it's going to be interesting to sort of look into metabolic demands, and sort of different metabolic disorders are pretty hot in brain science right now.
4124862	4145710	398	A	0.99	And I do think that it'll be interesting to look at sort of what the metabolic profile is in terms of each of the four items in the quadrant, if one quadrant or another quadrant is particularly associated with more metabolic demands in the system.
4149370	4151020	399	B	0.975	Arthur yeah.
4152830	4154330	400	C	0.8245	No, that's fascinating.
4155550	4162810	401	C	0.99976	I'd love to kind of hear a little bit more about this comment you made about the salt as a magnet that's applying these constraints.
4164930	4165678	402	A	1	Oh, yeah.
4165764	4184020	403	A	0.99663	So there's the, like, psychedelics the the effects are not or sort of the you sort of get pulled back into position after after some time.
4185030	4208970	404	A	0.99	And I can't say that this is a full theory at this point, but in the neuroscience notation 2018, I talked about the self as kind of the god of the gaps in terms of aligning different scales.
4211390	4221502	405	A	0.99989	You have circuits which kind of pull in different ways and you have the mesoscale systems which pull in different ways and you have the overall brain wide systems that pull in different ways.
4221556	4225940	406	A	1	And kind of the self is sort of the thing that tries to make everything work together.
4229190	4239910	407	A	0.82	And an alternate frame would be sort of this alpha is just kind of this slow gravity toward disalignment.
4241850	4247720	408	A	0.92327	Yeah, I don't have anything particularly more to share.
4250030	4251114	409	C	0.97568	Yeah, that makes sense.
4251152	4251980	410	C	0.95409	It's interesting.
4252830	4267470	411	B	0.94611	Well to combine the heating up and the magnetism, different metals and connections there to alchemy and everything different metals when heated up and cooled down in specific ways change their magnetic profile.
4267810	4271518	412	B	0.9732	So of course this is all just concordances but they're very interesting.
4271684	4294054	413	B	1	And then also to the metabolic angle that reminded me of the trilogy by Dale Pendel with Pharmaconosis and the other two books where treated alongside traditional psychoactives we could say like caffeine and nicotine and some of the other substances that were mentioned here.
4294172	4323360	414	B	0.99997	Also there's tea, sugar and these are treated as psychedelic or at least as in the same pantheon of neurocognitive modifying in the sense that the destinies of individuals and of empires ride on the sense making and decision making influence of sugar, for example.
4324370	4333550	415	B	0.99945	So it definitely broadens our perspective to include the so called classical molecules like LSD.
4333710	4344230	416	B	0.99977	But also maybe we could think more broadly about antioxidants or about different lipids or about different metabolic connections.
4345050	4360886	417	D	0.99791	Michael Pollan's recent book this is Your Mind on plants I think it kind of has that what you're saying in mind because it includes caffeine, not introduces a psychedelic but just discussed among also psychedelics.
4360918	4375760	418	D	0.9	I think I remember he focuses on masculine but it is a different way of being in the world, potentially radically different like if caffeine is in your life or it is not, it's a different life world.
4377670	4379890	419	B	0.61	And different extended niche.
4381110	4385906	420	B	0.91168	I'll go to a question in the live chat so anyone can give a thought.
4386008	4400222	421	B	0.99313	So Matt asks is there any way how to approach the individual reactions to psychedelics in terms of positive or negative results of treatment using the ideas of deep canals?
4400386	4409420	422	B	0.99709	So how can we approach predictions and explanations at the individual scale with what you're sharing today?
4416120	4446632	423	D	0.99	One thing for this is kind of like a meta comment, but if we're actually going to do computational psychiatry and we actually are going to and precision medicine so the goal being to create models of sufficient detail that they could actually guide our practice and guide our practice in a way where we know for an individual what they might need in any given context.
4446696	4465200	424	D	0.99929	So precision medicine with respect to standard antidepressants people, sometimes they'll go for a long time before they find ones that work, and sometimes things are made worse, and then they might deal with antidepressant withdrawal if they're looking for the right one, and if they're in a state of acute distress, that could be a hard lot.
4465350	4476320	425	D	1	And so if you can help to speed up that process of finding what works and what might hurt also to avoid that, the ability to help people is immense.
4476480	4485444	426	D	1	And so for that so the meta comment is I have to just say I'm not convinced that an act of inference.
4485572	4486810	427	D	0.81164	We're doing the job.
4487420	4502780	428	D	1	I think we're not acknowledging our uncertainty and I think the models are under specified with respect to the complexity of the effects we would expect on different scales and in characterizing the systems and we need to be more patient and modest.
4503120	4514844	429	D	0.67853	But what we don't know before we go on rushing in headlong into telling the rest of psychiatry how they should comport themselves and what models they should use based on psychedelic science.
4514892	4520380	430	D	1	And plausible models, hopeful models, but very early days.
4520550	4528470	431	D	0.64	And with the reality being complex in the ways we're seeing here, this was not an easy set of lectures or a set of talks like what we were going through.
4529400	4535560	432	D	0.89	And, yeah, if we're actually going to be able to handle these powerful medicines responsibly, we got to go into the weeds.
4536220	4540970	433	D	0.74	The one more meta comment was like I think I saw someone say how can something like help everything?
4542460	4545804	434	D	1	I don't know if this is right but it's almost like a violation of no free lunch theorems or something.
4545842	4550924	435	D	0.98125	It's like how could something just be good across the board without something is off?
4550962	4557280	436	D	0.99616	You've calculated wrong somewhere you had to pay the price either in some trade off that wasn't acknowledged.
4558180	4564480	437	D	0.99928	But that being said there are some things which are generally good for a lot of things like being more flexible.
4566920	4577632	438	D	0.91307	If you can get something like metastability I think I'm a church member of the I'm a faithful member of the church of criticality.
4577776	4592632	439	D	1	I think Mark Miller might have indoctrinated me with optimal grips but basically like the ability to have an optimal grip on existence in your soul, not too tight, not too loose and being able to move around and be flexible in itinerants.
4592776	4596952	440	D	0.99985	Something kind of like mindfulness is just like sriracha for the soul.
4597016	4601950	441	D	0.99936	It's good for everything almost you just put on this, put it on, that makes it better.
4602800	4614208	442	D	1	I buy that there might be some things that are good across the board but I wouldn't call though psychedelics necessarily putting you in this state of optimal criticality or anything in general.
4614294	4618164	443	D	1	The rhetoric I'm uncomfortable with of saying psychedelics do X.
4618282	4621248	444	D	1	I would prefer to say which psychedelic.
4621344	4637624	445	D	0.99917	Psychedelics tend to do x but just a little more qualifier like not weasel words but just like a little bit more like this psychedelic might do x in this context with this dose in this sentence setting but that being said there do also though seem to be across.
4637662	4647068	446	D	0.68	The board, broad, sweeping, not super, but overarching statements that we can make that express a lot with a little.
4647234	4659984	447	D	0.94	And so I don't want to be so much of a splitter and a prickly person finding all the details that these powerful things we can basically give to people to guide our research.
4660102	4662176	448	D	1	I don't want to leave that on table either.
4662358	4667330	449	D	0.82	I guess that's a bunch of meta level commentary that did not address the thing.
4669540	4670572	450	C	1	I think that's useful.
4670636	4671424	451	C	0.40344	That's very helpful.
4671472	4673140	452	C	1	I think to have all that context.
4674360	4686104	453	C	0.99997	With respect to the question itself, I would maybe offer this, which might be helpful, which know, I think you mentioned it, Adam, and it's very frequently mentioned this idea of set and setting, right.
4686142	4695150	454	C	0.53563	As being heavily predictive of the quality of the acute psychedelic experience, and often also, to some extent, the quality of the post acute experience.
4696160	4701580	455	C	1	And I think we can understand this in the deep canals model, quite straightforwardly.
4703540	4708290	456	C	0.99122	So I'll just quickly pull back up one of these slides here.
4710260	4710720	457	C	0.98471	Yeah.
4710790	4711024	458	C	0.88753	Right.
4711062	4714220	459	C	0.91556	So what is set and setting?
4714300	4725696	460	C	0.97802	So set is mindset, which would basically be some combination of your current position in the synaptic weight landscape and the current state of your neural activation landscape.
4725728	4725876	461	C	0.89056	Right.
4725898	4735444	462	C	0.99694	So your place in both landscapes is your mindset, and the setting is what is generating this input.
4735492	4735704	463	C	0.61237	Right.
4735742	4737972	464	C	1	What is generating the x into the network.
4738116	4741880	465	C	1	And that's some complicated function of the environment.
4743440	4755280	466	C	1	And then we can understand the evolution of movement through the inference landscape during the acute effects of the drug as then kind of like very directly and straightforwardly being a function of these two things.
4755350	4755970	467	C	0.99602	Right.
4756340	4764480	468	C	1	Because both of these things are basically what's affecting how this landscape evolves over time and how you move through the landscape.
4766180	4791292	469	C	1	And so with this in mind, I guess we can then start to characterize and think about, okay, well, what kinds of we can maybe be a little bit more mechanistic about how does input from the environment, the setting, actually, given that we relatively fix the actual synaptic weight landscape, how is that changing the dynamics over time or the other way around?
4791346	4791564	470	C	0.7629	Right?
4791602	4807440	471	C	0.97274	Like, how is fixing the input, the environmental context relatively stable and looking at individuals who are at different fixed points, at different points of time, going to change the dynamics of the event?
4807510	4807744	472	C	0.86054	Right.
4807782	4815872	473	C	0.97	And I think given that this is a highly stochastic process, given that these dynamics of albus are at play right.
4815926	4826532	474	C	0.99039	Where certain beliefs are being strengthened, other beliefs are being relaxed, I think at least having this hold on, okay, well, set and setting is really important.
4826586	4842140	475	C	1	And it's important because these are explicitly conditioning the way in which both the landscape, the inference landscape is shaped and how you move around it and how it's being dynamically perturbed.
4844800	4848270	476	C	0.99766	Yeah, hopefully that answers a little bit the question.
4849840	4850590	477	A	0.99926	Nice.
4852160	4875412	478	A	0.98	I just want to jump in there, just thinking about biomarkers if we're looking for something that's of high clinical specificity, we want to sort of be able to measure what's going on in a very careful way.
4875466	4881560	479	A	0.87792	So first of all, what is temperature parameter?
4882620	4885844	480	A	0.99992	We talk about, okay, psychedelics increase the temperature parameter.
4885892	4888344	481	A	0.99988	But how high?
4888462	4895470	482	A	1	And do different substances and dosages sort of differ in interesting ways?
4895840	4896910	483	A	0.99994	Probably, yes.
4897760	4904240	484	A	1	And then also sort of measuring temperature parameter, measuring the temperature parameter in different parts of the body.
4904390	4924404	485	A	0.99998	So you might have a different temperature, like not literal temperature, but computational entropic integration in different parts of your body and also the plasticity status in different networks throughout your body.
4924602	4950830	486	A	0.98202	So I guess I see a big frontier here as thinking some doing some careful thinking around biomarkers and proxies and inferring these sort of things that we are talking about as core and I think they are core and we should be able to find good marks for them.
4952240	4954908	487	C	0.96604	Yeah, that's totally correct.
4954994	4958556	488	C	0.73	And yeah, I just want to repeat it for my own sake even.
4958658	4965948	489	C	0.85663	Right, which is that these two things which I think were maybe one is I think already a core part of the deep canals work right.
4965974	4969888	490	C	0.99998	Which is that I was showing these single images of these toy optimization landscapes.
4969984	4979370	491	C	0.99999	But of course, the human being, the nervous system has multiple many of these landscapes hierarchically organized, right?
4979900	4983770	492	C	1	And they influence each other in a complicated way.
4985500	4999276	493	C	1	And the project forward is to understand where these landscapes are, what they look like and how we can find biomarkers to them and begin.
4999378	5017328	494	C	0.97799	If these two kinds of characterizations are true, this overfitting underfitting plasticity loss and catastrophic forgetting, then it's a very meaningful project to be able to quantify that objectively somehow an individual.
5017494	5028080	495	C	0.99	And that's when you can start to get to this point that Ada was talking about of precision medicine and understanding like okay, well, actually it turns out like these networks are catalyzed in this kind of way.
5028170	5037080	496	C	0.96	And because of that we can say with much more certainty that this kind of psychedelic intervention is going to likely be helpful.
5040720	5052030	497	D	0.51	I don't know if this potentially brings in some of the work with vascular and neurovascular and visceral integration that you're doing.
5052640	5076096	498	D	0.99262	So there's like a sense in the free energy principle where the overall phenotype and extended phenotype in terms of its constructing and coupling within constructing its Econiche, its success in manifesting this phenotype there is one free energy functional for this overall effort as a kind of prediction that's enacted through the dynamics.
5076208	5093052	499	D	0.99988	But you could also break it down in terms of subsystems with local gradients and local autopoietic processes that are in like they're brought together into an overall system, hopefully with synergies and they have to be to be an organism and an agent.
5093106	5098216	500	D	0.77	And we call this like a thing to the extent it has thingness.
5098408	5099630	501	D	0.91571	It's coming together.
5100480	5110636	502	D	1	I guess think of maybe like energy landscape, something like let's just say right now, in this moment, my explicitly felt beliefs.
5110668	5124548	503	D	0.99997	But my body also though might have a different opinion, different parts of it, in terms of what it's implicitly optimizing its revealed preference from its inaction that may or may not correspond to how I feel about it.
5124714	5126240	504	D	0.70588	It might be difference of opinion.
5126320	5127556	505	D	1	I might not even be tuning in.
5127578	5129496	506	D	1	I might be ignoring it maybe because I don't want to.
5129598	5148380	507	D	1	And so it's kind of like the score kept by the body might have its own be describable as its own information geometry which is being tracked to degrees and is in different degrees of alignment with different ones at different levels of a control hierarchy.
5148720	5150460	508	D	0.51452	So plausible?
5151920	5156030	509	A	0.99957	Absolutely, I think so, yeah.
5158020	5164380	510	A	1	I think of the body as sort of a parliament of different networks.
5164460	5167904	511	A	1	And alignment is the scarce resource.
5167952	5169888	512	A	0.975	Coordination is always the scarce resource.
5169984	5175220	513	A	1	And how does the body keep alignment and when does it go wrong too?
5175370	5181316	514	A	1	And I guess I see this as sort of harmonically mediated.
5181428	5186650	515	A	1	Each part of the body has some choice of what else in the body to listen to.
5187020	5200430	516	A	0.78	And depending on the particular sort of location in the information topology, different parts of the body have different carrots and sticks by which to try to control other parts of the body.
5201200	5215090	517	A	0.99989	So if your stomach is very unhappy, it's going to start grumbling and then it'll let the body know, okay, I need some food, I really seriously need some food.
5215940	5225216	518	A	1	And then the rest of the body, they can sort of turn away from it and then it'll just get louder and then you have to turn it away from it more and it'll get louder.
5225248	5227808	519	A	1	And that's of course a negative dynamic.
5227904	5244350	520	A	0.99999	If it gets what it wants, maybe it sort of gives a very harmonious uh and sort of tries to give carriage the rest of the I just uh there's an ecosystem there.
5248120	5250592	521	B	0.88296	I'll go to another question in the live chat.
5250736	5263000	522	B	0.98651	So Bert asks what do you think of the average of solving within a generative hierarchy and the impact of temporary openness moving it upwards?
5263900	5267200	523	B	0.63	And then I asked to clarify what do you mean the average of solving?
5267380	5277144	524	B	0.67	And Bert wrote where predictions meet incoming signals like discussed in Rebus, where top down predictions are softened in precision and thus solved.
5277192	5277790	525	B	0.87885	For.
5282420	5287584	526	D	0.63	I think Arthur will be able to get into the details of that better than I would.
5287622	5312568	527	D	0.9832	But one thing I'm wondering there is sometimes I love the entropic brain, but sometimes I wonder in terms of the connections, whether I don't how we're having more or less entropy and whether that matters the how.
5312654	5330616	528	D	0.99981	So for instance, you can think of a free energy landscape that's been flattened or you can think of one where you're better able and you have more energy for the manifold activity is better of climbing up or down the peaks that are there for the more enduring belief landscape.
5330648	5341644	529	D	0.99989	So it's like, in the moment, it could be that my previous way of thinking is unavailable to me and I no longer believe those things at any level.
5341842	5349216	530	D	0.99998	Or I can support more novel inferences that I wouldn't.
5349248	5361640	531	D	0.96755	Otherwise I can kind of move into an area of mind space that would otherwise be difficult, potentially because of a greater energy into the system, greater thoroughput noise.
5364940	5365304	532	C	0.99988	Yeah.
5365342	5379644	533	C	0.60727	So as I think I understand the question, right, it's basically asking about trying to optimize for this free energy variable and in the context of deep canals, right?
5379682	5385916	534	C	0.76023	Like this is the loss function that's driving the optimization of the learning landscape, the synaptic weight landscape.
5385948	5386530	535	C	0.94824	Right.
5386900	5393524	536	C	1	The entire connectivity structure of the nervous system is trying to get to this point of low free energy.
5393642	5402196	537	C	1	And I think there's lots of for any given individual in a given environment, assuming the environment is relatively fixed, right?
5402218	5405468	538	C	0.89042	There's like an optimal, there's a global optimal.
5405584	5422880	539	C	1	And it's very likely that the individual is in some local optima that is maybe close to it, maybe far from it, but that's just inherently what within the context of the active inputs.
5422900	5439024	540	C	0.99856	That's what we're assuming that the nervous system is doing, is doing this gradientism in the space and openness then is going to correspond to this plasticity MetaTrade or be one of the components of it.
5439142	5449392	541	C	0.99	And it is in the deep canals model then going to correspond to an ability to move around this optimization landscape more easily.
5449456	5449780	542	C	0.99891	Right?
5449850	5464200	543	C	0.99763	It's going to be a flattening of the landscape, or more precisely, I guess, a smoothing of the landscape such that it's less likely that the individual, the nervous system will get stuck in these local optima.
5464540	5468596	544	C	0.99801	So maybe it won't mean that the individual will arrive at the global optima.
5468708	5475292	545	C	1	I think it's difficult to say what that even might be or how individuals might get to such a place at all.
5475346	5489490	546	C	0.75444	But I think it is likely that the individual will be more likely to find a more global optima and more easily move from one optimal to another.
5489860	5493510	547	C	1	And I think that's kind of what this openness is corresponding to.
5496040	5496790	548	C	0.83209	Yeah.
5497720	5498470	549	C	0.8735	Okay.
5501400	5514692	550	A	0.5538	In neural kneeling, I mentioned the idea of psychedelic extrapolated volition, kind of a play on a coherent extrapolated volition from the AI safety crowd.
5514836	5544704	551	A	0.99	And it's this sort of sense that if temporarily you have more control over sort of low level shaping of your cognition, your emotion, and maybe sort of based on this attractor that we call the self, or I guess based on what is a good question, then what are good signs?
5544752	5549908	552	A	0.99998	That you should be trusted with that power or you should trust yourself with that power rather.
5550074	5555620	553	A	1	And what are telltale signs that you shouldn't trust yourself with that power?
5555770	5560090	554	A	0.93	And I don't have an answer, but I think it's an interesting question.
5560700	5565160	555	B	0.99994	Yes, I am normal and can be trusted with the key to the doors of perception.
5565580	5566970	556	A	0.99999	Let me in exactly.
5568720	5570750	557	B	1	I have a short question.
5571520	5574030	558	B	0.99989	Where is action in this model?
5578400	5584416	559	D	0.99636	So imagine many places Arthur will get into that.
5584438	5592450	560	D	0.99984	But for what I was thinking with Albus is that actually the five HD two A system.
5594440	5596980	561	D	0.9	I talk about two regimes, potentially.
5597960	5608628	562	D	1	One is more towards overt inaction and modifying the world and strengthened beliefs potentially of that variety.
5608724	5612330	563	D	1	And the other might be more of adapting to the world.
5614460	5623416	564	D	0.99305	Robin has a really excellent paper called A Tale of Two Receptors where he talks about five H T, one A receptors.
5623528	5631048	565	D	1	The ones that antidepressants tend to act on because they tend to reduce this excitatory signaling, talking about them as a kind of passive coping.
5631144	5639548	566	D	1	And so this would correspond in there's some machine learning models of this by Diane and colleagues where they talk about opponency between dopamine and serotonin.
5639644	5646212	567	D	0.99	And they're focusing on the one A as a kind of like patients promoting parameter, keeping you from confidently charging into your policy.
5646266	5657990	568	D	0.99998	So that would tend to inhibit, I guess, patterns of either overt inaction or potentially even some kinds of mental stimulation too.
5658540	5679692	569	D	0.99983	You could maybe even think of like even if you're not overtly inactive enacting something externally, there might be more or less brave type styles of thoughts that you might be willing to entertain, going places you might not otherwise be willing to go, and being able to handle the swings in expected free energy.
5679826	5684080	570	D	0.99998	That might happen as you try to pursue a given path of policies.
5685300	5701536	571	D	0.99988	But the idea would be that there might be something more like a micro dosing mesodosing regime which might be more of what initially sculpted the five H two A system which evolved with a gene duplication event around the time of the Cambrian Explosion with the advent of jawed fishes.
5701648	5707844	572	D	0.86874	I'm personally interpreting this as having the significance of evolving in the context of predator prey arms races.
5707892	5719156	573	D	1	I suspect I could be wrong, but that basically it's locally trying to strengthen patterns of policy pursuit to pursue particular goals in a given context.
5719268	5724008	574	D	0.97	And to come back to what I was mentioning earlier with that work by Robin of like a kind of act of coping.
5724184	5742928	575	D	0.98124	But it seems with rebus there's almost like not that kind of story, and that it's more you're adjusting to the world and actually, if under a very alter state, you are overtly enacting, that's actually kind of a dangerous thing.
5743014	5749344	576	D	1	I don't know how much to make of this that the five Http receptors are less expressed on, like, motor cortex.
5749392	5751940	577	D	1	I don't think we know enough to make too much of it.
5752010	5758056	578	D	0.99993	But it's like some dreams you might not want to act out as they're happening, but they still might powerfully impact you.
5758238	5772828	579	D	0.99624	So I'm currently actually wondering whether this other rebus like regime might have been specifically sculpted in the context of bonding and actually opening the self to include others.
5772994	5775608	580	D	1	And that might have been some of the primary selective pressures.
5775704	5778220	581	D	0.96	I don't know how to think of that in terms of inaction.
5780720	5804116	582	D	0.82	And one more detail that might kind of like not sure what to make of it that kind of goes through both of those excuse the phone would be anthropologically, I believe like psychedelics are oftentimes used in ways that would be both like creating a kind of group solidarity and might be used in the context of pursuing goals together in the world.
5804138	5811832	583	D	0.99995	So for instance, like a hunting party, they might all do psychedelics together or something that looks a lot like breath work before going out, maybe going to war.
5811966	5827580	584	D	0.99282	So that's a very different type that kind of includes both a relaxation of the normal boundaries of the self and a kind of gearing you up for pursuing goals in the you know, there's got to be another story of like, so Arthur's expertise is machine learning.
5827650	5833072	585	D	0.99	And so it's like you want these systems to act intelligently and not act in other times.
5833206	5840880	586	D	1	And so basically now we're in the language of policies, and when you deploy them and how and so complicated.
5843220	5843584	587	C	0.99997	Yeah.
5843622	5846752	588	C	1	I would say that action manifests itself at a few different places.
5846816	5848132	589	C	0.99984	It's true, I didn't mention it here.
5848186	5850196	590	C	0.99984	Yeah, I think it's very important, obviously.
5850378	5861380	591	C	1	I think what the kind of most implicit place where it exists right, is that these belief landscapes are being instantiated ultimately for the sake of adaptive behavior.
5861460	5865572	592	C	0.88227	Adaptive behavior, adaptive action right, in some sort of environmental context.
5865716	5873404	593	C	1	And that's the kind of like framework, the deep learning framework that we're using or like the artificial agent framework, right.
5873442	5887468	594	C	0.99212	Is that the assumption is that the system is supporting some sort of agent that's embodied in some sort of environment which is changing over time such that it can either be adaptive or not adaptive.
5887644	5905344	595	C	1	I think then the question of how action actually plays into the evolution of these belief landscapes during psychedelics or not acting in the world is a very clear way to modify one's setting, right?
5905482	5926380	596	C	0.99777	So acting is a way of modifying the function that's providing the sensory input into the system which is going to change how the activity patterns are evolving over time, right, which are going to affect the acute quality of the trip, affect how beliefs are either being strengthened or relaxed.
5926800	5945300	597	C	1	And I think it's already clear that there's a kind of whole set of folk psychology that's been built around what is or isn't a good way to cultivate a helpful setting and that of course all is a function of action in the world.
5945450	5956376	598	C	1	I think then there's also this kind of more subtler form of action which is how one thinks, how one deploys attention essentially during this experience.
5956558	5965300	599	C	1	And I think this deployment of attention has a huge effect on whether there end up being rebus or CBIS like effects.
5965460	5965832	600	C	0.65112	Right?
5965886	5975260	601	C	0.99981	So whether one allows oneself to go down certain thought rabbit holes, whether one allows oneself to get kind of stuck in certain kinds of thought patterns.
5977520	5991504	602	C	1	I think this form of mental action has a very big downstream effect and I think a lot of I'd love to see much more work on this.
5991542	6011672	603	C	1	I think it's very important, I think it's kind of essential and I think this is kind of one of the most interesting things about these psychedelic experiences is that in some sense, like the most extreme rebus model and the most extreme thebis model could be true for two different individuals, right?
6011806	6027724	604	C	0.99983	Someone could say I went to hell and I was there for 8 hours straight, or say I had a completely selfless experience, I let go of all beliefs and experienced nothing for 8 hours straight and it was great.
6027762	6028108	605	C	0.99766	Right?
6028194	6047190	606	C	0.72	And clearly those involve two very different neural regimes and I think the nature of that and obviously, given that they involve the same drug and they involve not such a different setting, it's obvious that they have something very important to do with how attention is deployed during this experience.
6050360	6058648	607	A	0.614	Yeah, I do think that this frame of attention, I mean, attention is so important for everything.
6058734	6071310	608	A	0.99	And I do think that there's something interesting kind of digging into the Attention and Albus framework that yeah, I'm really curious to see how that'll develop.
6072160	6087730	609	A	1	I would also say that in terms of active inference and action, there is a cost to holding an intention and then once you discharge your intention, you can release that cost.
6089540	6095380	610	A	0.96322	So I guess I would have to think about how to apply that to the Canals framework.
6098680	6115876	611	D	0.99753	Fred Barrett, I don't know if he's published it yet, but this is kind of like a follow up to a Klaus truly central model that Arthur alluded to is emphasizing basically a lack of executive control and placing that as central to the psychedelic spirits.
6115908	6135920	612	D	0.59606	Like not controlling your mental action in directed ways as much and then trying to counter more of the types of cognition and phenomenology sort of psychedelics based on just releasing of the normal more agentic modes of policy selection around attention as mental action, although not using active inference.
6140260	6141696	613	B	0.65367	Yeah, very interesting.
6141798	6165224	614	B	0.96387	Adam, your introduction there of course, attention as covert action, which was echoed by Arthur and Michael, both of you said it really introduces a case where we can use active inference to find continuity between what's happening inside the agent and outside the agent.
6165342	6176524	615	B	0.99999	Because on one hand we could kind of take a belief oriented frame and we could say, well, what's happening inside the agent are beliefs about things, beliefs about hidden states, beliefs about observations, beliefs about policy.
6176722	6182232	616	B	0.99515	So that's kind of a belief oriented view where everything is framed basically cognitively.
6182376	6201360	617	B	0.99926	Or we could take a very action oriented view and then we could think about the interface in a more inactive way and then also even the realm of where many active entities dare not tread in mental action with attention as covert action.
6201440	6210584	618	B	0.82	And so then we have, like, a total active account that is mathematically isomorphic with the total belief based account.
6210702	6211684	619	B	0.99998	They're both just maps.
6211732	6212708	620	B	0.99996	They're not the territory.
6212804	6215480	621	B	0.98	The territory is the person in the room.
6215630	6225500	622	B	0.99998	So all of this is just talking about the formalism and how we choose to interpret the formalism in terms of it being more inferential or it being more active.
6226720	6244150	623	B	1	And so there's a lot of ways to go, I guess, in our closing minutes, I would love to hear what are the next moves or what are some areas that you would hope that people look into?
6246440	6248230	624	B	0.99961	Michael and then the.
6252280	6261412	625	A	0.44605	Know is, I think my favorite mental move is to try to drop down on my level of abstraction.
6261556	6263880	626	A	0.8802	Okay, how is this implemented?
6264460	6265512	627	A	0.99988	What's going on here?
6265566	6286130	628	A	0.98	And then I do think that details of implementation are really generative to look into and, like, the biomarkers and the proxies for figuring out how to parameterize okay, exactly how hot are we talking about with this temperature parameter and so on in different parts of the body.
6287940	6296816	629	A	1	I have kind of my niche that I'm working on in the Vasomuscular system, which is a rabbit hole.
6296848	6317472	630	A	0.99822	But, yeah, I do think that the deep canals framework specifically and the canalization paradigm in general, it's good enough that we should be able to dig into mechanism.
6317556	6319790	631	A	0.81447	So I'm looking forward to that.
6323810	6324560	632	C	0.98601	Great.
6325970	6330670	633	B	0.98637	Adam or Arthur.
6333490	6334638	634	D	0.89049	You can go first.
6334804	6335780	635	D	0.41842	Doesn't matter.
6336310	6336722	636	C	0.83055	Okay.
6336776	6337362	637	C	0.99802	Yeah, I'll go.
6337416	6338020	638	C	0.99499	Sure.
6338470	6338882	639	C	0.57849	Yeah.
6338936	6340980	640	C	0.84	I mean, first I want to echo this idea.
6341350	6343058	641	C	1	I think Mexicans is very important.
6343144	6348062	642	C	0.99969	This is one of the people we've talked to about talked with about deep canals.
6348206	6350354	643	C	0.78479	This idea of, like, well, this is great.
6350392	6351586	644	C	0.50723	We have these two axes.
6351698	6355974	645	C	0.9831	It'd be wonderful if there were some biological correlates you could look for.
6356172	6358060	646	C	1	I think that's incredibly important.
6359070	6363610	647	C	0.99985	My background is also in machine learning, in deep learning.
6363680	6368090	648	C	0.97012	So I'm currently doing some work around simulating some of these things.
6368240	6383250	649	C	0.99	I think especially for these albus dynamics, being able to kind of study under what circumstances you get these different kinds of effects, even in kind of, like, simple Tory models, is kind of important to see how they unfold.
6385110	6387986	650	C	1	And then we brought it up at the end.
6388008	6390450	651	C	1	I think it's really important.
6390520	6395330	652	C	0.99968	It's very interesting to me is the role of the deployment of attention in this.
6395480	6404070	653	C	1	And there's lines of work where people are trying various researchers are trying to connect, for example, meditation to psychedelic research.
6404220	6416410	654	C	1	And kind of certain people are trying to tell unified stories about what's going on in the brain when people meditate, what's going on under psychedelics, some of them using these active inference models.
6416910	6425774	655	C	0.99939	But I think in all of these cases, the deployment of attention and how the deployment of tension changes over time is kind of a key aspect of this.
6425972	6430766	656	C	1	And it's not as present in the deep canals model right now.
6430948	6440260	657	C	0.99943	But I think any really robust future kind of like model of these things is going to have to talk about attention quite a bit.
6446190	6460542	658	D	0.69576	Well, I guess next steps would be seeing how the review process goes, but also I guess helping Arthur to establish a field of psychedelic machine learning.
6460676	6468226	659	D	0.98631	Psychedelic inspired machine learning where we try to make systems more flexible and capable, better.
6468328	6481858	660	D	0.54558	They can handle edge cases better, imagine better in terms of real time policy selection, learn in ways that not too much, not too little, and then maybe so that's useful, potentially earlier.
6481874	6485510	661	D	0.936	Like you have a driverless vehicle, do I change lanes or don't I?
6485580	6489900	662	D	0.63256	You send it back to the Tesla, dojo what do you want it to learn, what do you not want it to learn?
6490990	6507566	663	D	0.99734	But then down the line well before we even get there, as you're going into this you could see the capacity for a rich bi directional flow between machine learning and psychedelic inspired machine learning.
6507668	6514910	664	D	0.99914	So it's like you get a bunch of machine learners together and a bunch of people who know a lot about the cognitive science and biology and maybe phenomenology of psychedelics.
6515330	6520546	665	D	1	And in addition to designing better machine learning systems, they could probably tell you more about how psychedelics act.
6520568	6530294	666	D	1	And so you can have this kind of virtuous cycle between the biology and the field, but you keep going with that before we get there.
6530332	6532200	667	D	0.99998	We'll keep going, but before we get there.
6533290	6536818	668	D	0.99999	Very interested in the implications for best practices.
6536994	6544074	669	D	0.9996	So for instance, oftentimes you might want semantically neutral energy to kind of get them.
6544112	6550214	670	D	0.9985	You're just turning up the heat, you're just maybe at first breaking up, I call them defenses, but the usual structure.
6550342	6555150	671	D	0.99999	But then the question is at what point do you try to direct the canalization process?
6555300	6561760	672	D	0.95733	Do you wait till after or maybe when the metal is hot, is that a really good time to do it?
6562610	6564354	673	D	0.84	And maybe there's no one single question.
6564392	6568626	674	D	0.99985	This might depend on the substance, the set, the setting, the dose, the person.
6568728	6575126	675	D	0.99913	So getting clarity on that could be fateful for many people in terms of the outcomes they have.
6575148	6587874	676	D	1	And specifically what I'm gunning for is I'm on a mission to make compassion meditation treatment as usual for all psychedelic psychotherapy and preferably all therapy.
6588002	6604446	677	D	1	And so the question is if you're in a state of enhanced imaginative capacity, maybe you're having more ability to tune into your interceptive system, whether you've just increased the channels or maybe you're better capable of because maybe your inflammation went down a bit and you can tune in better because it feels better to do so.
6604548	6616046	678	D	0.99978	Some combination that might be a really good opportunity to do certain meditations that might update you in particular ways like try to direct the re Annealing process, maybe not just like afterwards integration, but during the session.
6616158	6624122	679	D	1	And so if we could get clarity on something like how to canalize and recanalyze, like Annealing schedules.
6624206	6627462	680	D	0.56763	It's going to be complicated, but that's, I think, where we need to head.
6627596	6633062	681	D	1	And then finally for all this, that would be enough.
6633196	6639818	682	D	0.99986	But recentering the conversation on psychedelics, on basically meaning and connection would be enough.
6639984	6649930	683	D	0.77338	But I'm wondering down the line, when we talk of alignment, we're talking about our alignment with our values and maybe the alignments of machines with our values.
6650270	6659838	684	D	0.99	And so does this actually end up going to some of the conversations that are happening now about increasingly advanced AI and our relationships to it?
6659924	6663550	685	D	0.99999	Could there be a story of cannibalization and recalyzation?
6663970	6668014	686	D	0.75824	You want some things to hold fast and you want some things to be more fluid.
6668142	6670414	687	D	0.78091	This might be it's always been a timely conversation.
6670462	6680070	688	D	0.99998	We've always been dealing with this with us, the alignment problem of us, which we often fail, but the alignment problem with these technologies we're developing.
6681610	6684326	689	B	0.76732	Okay, wow.
6684428	6688338	690	B	0.98896	Well, so many great topics.
6688514	6689640	691	B	0.99979	Thank you all.
6690010	6694710	692	B	0.94674	All I have in closing, turn on, tune in, act in, first serve.
6695610	6696600	693	B	0.99996	Thank you.
6697130	6698646	694	B	0.99996	See you all next time.
6698828	6699090	695	A	0.58199	Bye.
