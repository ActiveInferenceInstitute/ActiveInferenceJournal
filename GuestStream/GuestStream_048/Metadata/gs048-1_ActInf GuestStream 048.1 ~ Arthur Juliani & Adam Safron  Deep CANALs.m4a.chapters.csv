4200	89930	00:04	Active Inference guest stream number 48.1 on July 19, 2023. Presentation and then a conversation about deep canals, a deep learning approach to refining the cannilization theory of psychopathology. Also joined by Michael Edward Johnson in discussion.	Arthur Giuliani and Adam Safron discuss a deep learning approach to psychopathology	Deep Learning in Psychedelic Therapy
92220	248480	01:32	The past decade has seen a resurgence of interest in psychedelic therapy. Studies suggest that psilocybin assisted psychotherapy can be helpful for depression, anxiety, substance use disorder and others. It may be only a couple of years away from becoming approved as an actual treatment in the United States.	The past decade has seen a resurgence of interest in psychedelic therapy	Psilocybin for depression is gaining popularity
251940	386170	04:11	Serotonergic psychedelics act as agonists for a number of serotonin receptors in the brain and the central nervous system. Research has focused on, I would say, three key areas over the past decade or so. And this too is likely of central importance to the psychedelic effect.	Serotonergic psychedelics act as agonists for serotonin receptors in brain	How do psychedelics work in the brain?
390080	1445020	06:30	FMRI studies show increased entropy or increased complexity of the cortical activation in the brain. Changes in functional connectivity between different brain regions or different brain networks. This has been hypothesized to be one of the key mechanisms of the therapeutic effect of psychedelics.	There are several key takeaways from fMRI studies looking at psychedelic use	Structural and functional plasticity of the brain under psychedelics
1447700	1729450	24:07	In a recurrent neural network there are two sets of parameters that you have at any given time. These are the actual weights of the network and then the hidden activation. This is what is changing when we have various forms of heavy and plasticity heavy in learning. And this is what instantiates the possible sets of neural activity patterns.	What are these two optimization landscapes and how do we understand them	Optimal landscapes in the brain
1734390	2259980	28:54	In terms of Albus, the basic idea is to take Rebus and expand on it. Not just talking about relaxed beliefs, but also potentially strengthened beliefs and in different combinations. The idea would be to take predictive processing and models of psychedelic action and suggest that sometimes not only do we have these relaxation of belief landscapes.	Adam: Albus is a framework for relaxing and strengthening belief landscapes	Albus and the psychedelic mind
2261040	2384616	37:41	In the Rebus model there's only one type of optimization landscape. What is supposed to be happening is a relaxation of leaves which is strong during the acute effect and persists in the post acute effect. We can interpret what's happening to the type A landscape as less of a universal relaxation and more of a kind of destabilization.	Alice alters two belief landscapes during the acute effects of psychedelics	Understanding the psychotherapeutic effects of psychedelics
2384638	2514720	39:44	There is neurogenesis psychoplastogenic effects, there's dendritic growth. This is enabling greater connectivity between, within and between networks. This has very interesting implications for future drug design and development.	Psychedelics are enabling greater connectivity between, within and between networks	Psychedelics and their neurocognitive effects
2516500	2675570	41:56	Adam Greene talks a bit about personality theory and the relationship between psychedelics and. personality. Personality is actually an extremely deep concept. For cybernetic systems, interpreting personality as parameters for goal pursuit.	Adam Miller talks about personality theory and the relationship between psychedelics and personality	Phenethylaminetics and Personality Theory
2679750	2831330	44:39	There seems to be a common factor across many forms of psychopathology that's referred to as the P factor. It tends to be the inverse of stability. It's high neuroticism, low agreeableness and low conscientiousness. Could be more closely related to a lack of stability rather than insufficient plasticity.	There is a common factor across many forms of psychopathology that's called P factor	The P factor in psychopathology
2833210	2937470	47:13	Both are important, both need to be considered and they're deeply interrelated. Colin describes them as being in a state of something like dynamic tension. You could also see someone being overly rigid and excessive stability in a way that undermines their plasticity.	Both stability and plasticity are important, both need to be considered	Stability and Plasticity
2940000	3326244	49:00	Adam Wheeler: How do these two optimization landscapes and machine learning concepts relate to psychopathology? He says there are two types of cannibalization, one being overfitting and another being plasticity loss. Wheeler: This at least gives a good starting point for trying to understand where and why psychedelic therapy is useful, isn't useful.	Adam: Two meta traits, stability and plasticity, influence machine learning	Machine Learning and Psychopathology
3326442	3462400	55:26	Some form of bipolar disorder or some form of borderline personality disorder. There are very strong sets of beliefs being instantiated at any given time. Over longer timescales the kinds of beliefs that are instantiated change a lot. The benefit of psychedelic therapy is a bit more mixed.	Bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder have very hard-to-change beliefs	Bipolar and borderline personality disorder
3464420	3775330	57:44	There's very little work currently looking at trying to treat schizophrenia with psychedelic therapy. The effects are going to mainly be mediated post acutely with psychedelics. Now I'll turn it over to Mike who's going to share some thoughts about this work and some of his own work and this approach to understanding psychedelics more broadly.	There's very little work currently looking at trying to treat schizophrenia with psychedelic therapy	Interpretation of schizophrenia and cognitive flexibility
3777110	3946710	1:02:57	In 2019 I wrote Neural Annealing and that was sort of developing the canalization frame within the context of energy buildup in the eigen modes of a system. One metaphor that I'm considering is the self as sort of a magnet to apply a constraint on the system as it's cooling.	In 2019 I wrote Neural Annealing and that was developing the canalization frame	Neuroannealing and Deep Canals
3948570	4063120	1:05:48	The second item that I wanted to mention, so I have this piece, autism as a disorder of dimensionality. It may very well be that people on the spectrum have literally more neurons and or more synapses. I like the way Deep Canals explicitly splits out the learning landscape and the inference landscape.	Deep Canals explicitly splits out the learning landscape and the inference landscape	Autism and Deep Canals
4070100	4271518	1:07:50	Arthur: In the Deep Canals framework, it's going to be interesting to look into metabolic demands. Different metabolic disorders are pretty hot in brain science right now. Adam: I'd love to hear a little bit more about this comment you made about the salt as a magnet.	Arthur and Adam discuss metabolic demands in Deep Canals framework	The Deep Canals of the Brain
4271684	4385906	1:11:11	And then also to the metabolic angle that reminded me of the trilogy by Dale Pendel with Pharmaconosis. Also there's tea, sugar and these are treated as psychedelic. But also maybe we could think more broadly about antioxidants or about different lipids. I'll go to a question in the live chat so anyone can give a thought.	Metabolism is treated alongside traditional psychoactives such as LSD	Potential of psychedelics in the metabolic world
4386008	4673140	1:13:06	How can we approach predictions and explanations at the individual scale with what you're sharing today? One thing for this is kind of like a meta comment, but if we're actually going to and precision medicine. We need to be more patient and modest.	Matt asks how to approach individual reactions to psychedelics using deep canals	The meta-comment on psychedelics
4674360	4850590	1:17:54	The idea of set and setting is heavily predictive of the quality of the acute psychedelic experience. Your place in both landscapes is your mindset, and the setting is what is generating this input. And then we can understand the evolution of movement through the inference landscape during the acute effects of the drug.	Adam: Set and setting are very important factors in psychedelic experience	Psychedelic Experience, Set and Setting
4852160	5244350	1:20:52	The body is a parliament of different networks. Each part of the body has some choice of what else in the body to listen to. The project forward is to understand where these landscapes are and how we can find biomarkers to them.	I just want to jump in there, just thinking about biomarkers for precision medicine	Potential biomarkers of psychedelics in the body
5248120	5565160	1:27:28	The entire connectivity structure of the nervous system is trying to get to this point of low free energy. Temporary openness then is going to correspond to this plasticity MetaTrade. What are telltale signs that you shouldn't trust yourself with that power?	Bert asks about the average of solving within a generative hierarchy	Optimalization of the Mind with Temporary Openness
5565580	6225500	1:32:45	Albus: I talk about two regimes, potentially. One is more towards overt inaction and modifying the world and strengthened beliefs potentially of that variety. The other might be more of adapting to the world. Action manifests itself at a few different places.	Robin: Where is action in this model? Arthur's expertise is machine learning	Prozac and the 5H2A receptor
6226720	6383250	1:43:46	Michael: My favorite mental move is to try to drop down on my level of abstraction. Details of implementation are really generative to look into. My background is also in machine learning, in deep learning. I'm currently doing some work around simulating some of these things.	Michael: I think details of implementation are really generative to look into	Deep Learning and the body
6385110	6532200	1:46:25	Next steps would be helping Arthur to establish a field of psychedelic machine learning. Psychedelic inspired machine learning where we try to make systems more flexible and capable, better. Any robust future model of these things is going to have to talk about attention quite a bit.	Arthur wants to help establish a field of psychedelic machine learning	No More Psychedelic Machine Learning
6533290	6699090	1:48:53	Very interested in the implications for best practices. I'm on a mission to make compassion meditation treatment as usual for all psychedelic psychotherapy and preferably all therapy. Does this actually end up going to some of the conversations that are happening now about increasingly advanced AI?	Very interested in the implications for best practices. And so if we could get clarity on how to canalize	Psychedelic psychotherapy: The alignment problem
