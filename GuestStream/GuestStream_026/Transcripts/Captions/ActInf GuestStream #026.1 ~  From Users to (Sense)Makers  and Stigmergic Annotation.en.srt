1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,480
all right hello everyone

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,519
it's august 12 2022

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,440
and we are in

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
guest stream number 26.1

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,119
from users to sensemakers on the pivotal

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,320
role of stigma social annotation in the

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,519
quest for collective sense making

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,599
this should be a great presentation and

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,800
discussion and so i'll pass it to ronin

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,440
to introduce the context and take it

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,880
away with the presentation so thanks

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,760
everyone for joining and ronan and will

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,399
thanks for coming on

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,879
awesome yeah thanks daniel for for

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,039
putting this on and uh yeah excited to

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,079
be here and have this uh discussion

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,280
i think it's our first time discussing

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
this paper like long form so looking

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,960
forward to it

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,360
um but yeah this paper actually code

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,079
yeah for some context

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,160
this presentation will be related to the

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,120
paper

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,040
that we wrote together as a group um

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
and yeah it was also represented in the

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
conference on hypertext and social media

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
in june

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,439
of this year in barcelona uh so today

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,720
we'll go over kind of the key points of

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,159
the paper and

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,360
uh try to dive into more details uh kind

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
of explore directions that we didn't

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
have time to address with this sort of

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,159
short kind of presentation of the paper

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,119
of the conference um and then we'll

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,159
later sort of open a wider discussion uh

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,439
talk about how this

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,720
is sort of

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
informing the work of our

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
collective and discussion of some

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
initial projects that we're

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,720
working on in the context of this of

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
this research including active inference

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,759
and some other

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,079
projects like vo and a few more so yeah

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,079
looking forward to a lot to talk about

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,000
so yeah probably we should start with

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,119
the definitions or some of the terms

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
we're going to be using in

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,399
this because we introduced a lot of a

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,920
lot of words that can mean a lot of

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
things to a lot of people so

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,759
i think

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,079
yeah sense making is something that has

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,520
a lot of different missions the one

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,160
worst of working working definition

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,440
we're looking at processes by which

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,040
individuals and groups make sense of

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,120
their environment by organizing and send

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
data to the environment is understood

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
well enough to enable reasonable

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,760
decisions so we do science making all

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,360
the time in physical environments and

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
online environments as we'll see

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
so there's this kind of incoming stream

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,959
of sense data

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
coming from the environment and

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,040
we have to sort of uh adapt and

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
handle this this kind of stream of data

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,760
to inform our decisions uh incorporate

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,518
it into our decision making process

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,640
um

73
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,000
but yeah so

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
scent making is is a kind of broad

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,480
subject in terms of like where where

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,480
collectively

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,080
descent making some kind of

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,340
uh

79
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,080
[Music]

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,400
a kind of typical sort of uh thing you

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,239
might hear from you know media you'll

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,319
hear things like like this what we

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,080
brought here so yeah the quality of our

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,159
democratic life depends the public

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,519
having the fact that being able to make

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,560
sense of them

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
uh and there's this feeling that this

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
isn't really happening anymore so

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
that's why a lot of people are worried

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
about the future of democracy

91
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
this is just kind of an interesting uh

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,400
research here on the right that's

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,080
showing

94
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,159
how polarized and how like how much we

95
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,720
don't have a shared sense uh

96
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,760
what's going

97
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
so you can look at things like

98
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
uh you know the topics people are

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
looking at and seeing on

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,920
cnn or fox news uh and see like how

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
different the coverage is of each of

102
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,000
those uh networks for for the same topic

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,239
so yeah so things like trump's failures

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,599
will get a lot of

105
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,000
uh a lot of uh

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
being addressed like very heavily in cnn

107
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,040
but uh

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,640
not seeing much on fox and then vice

109
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
versa

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,120
democrats

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
so yeah people are living in a really

112
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,480
different world because of our

113
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
information environments so this is kind

114
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
of a motivating background for why we're

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,599
why are we getting interested in this

116
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,360
because really our democracies are at

117
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
stake as a lot of people have already

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,200
noticed

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,040
and yeah just kind of another word of

120
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,200
sort of disclaiming

121
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
that

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,199
stem making is a wicked problem um

123
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,918
and

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,680
yeah we definitely aren't going to claim

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,840
to have like the solution to making our

126
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
collective sense making

127
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
it will require many different solutions

128
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,560
and it's kind of an ongoing problem so

129
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
we'll kind of make progress on it and

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,840
then we'll have new problems

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,040
progress

132
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,639
it's very interdisciplinary so there's a

133
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
lot of stakeholders of different sort of

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,919
schools of thought that and practice

135
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,799
that will need to be involved

136
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
so we're looking at kind of we're trying

137
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,919
to look at one angle

138
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,720
and

139
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,360
that is how platforms shape our

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,919
information landscapes

141
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,440
online

142
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,160
and and we kind of

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
noticed two things two uh sort of

144
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,440
important

145
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,280
things about platforms that make them

146
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
what we call it perilous

147
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,080
so for one there's a notion of

148
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,600
centralization where a few giant

149
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
platforms

150
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,120
facebook people youtube

151
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
etc have gained unprecedented control

152
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,199
over attention by controlling the needs

153
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,720
to create search and distributed

154
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
information

155
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,360
and two

156
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,880
opacities where

157
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,440
platforms network data and algorithms

158
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
are hidden away from the public

159
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,199
so there's like

160
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,720
all the sort of oversight that could

161
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,560
help us

162
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,919
you know issues with our information

163
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,120
landscape or

164
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
really not we don't really have

165
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,120
uh we don't really have any way to to

166
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
handle this currently because of this

167
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
opacity

168
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
um

169
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,560
yeah

170
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
the kind of dual scrolling has become

171
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,120
the

172
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,039
icon of our times and we don't know

173
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,639
what's

174
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,840
behind

175
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,280
our screens like why isn't something

176
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,080
being shown to us we kind of have to

177
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,758
at times you know vague or like the

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,120
different

179
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,039
motivations for why that might be but

180
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,360
yeah we really are kind of

181
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,479
yeah they're controlling your screens

182
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,759
and we're on those screens for most of

183
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,960
the day so

184
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,800
definitely a lot of power over what

185
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,639
we're our information types

186
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,400
yeah

187
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,360
so

188
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,039
you know it's clear how we got here

189
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,800
right it's kind of convenient you know

190
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,160
we have these platforms that we have tik

191
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,759
tok and twitter they offer us they do

192
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,479
offer us like very

193
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,280
high quality in some regards like they

194
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,240
give us information that we're

195
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,600
interested in we like seeing you know

196
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,960
what we're looking at on instagram like

197
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,000
seeing the videos we're watching on

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
kickback they give us like this

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
short-term dopamine kick but of course

200
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,880
uh

201
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
then when we look into the

202
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,240
global picture

203
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,919
we can

204
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,600
start seeing the cost of this the

205
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
platforms are involved in a host of

206
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,599
deeply problematic social phenomena like

207
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,440
polarization information epistemic

208
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,000
extraction

209
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and yeah it's interesting to sort of go

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,599
into the literature scientific

211
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,720
literature on this because uh you know

212
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,360
scientists yeah this is just just one uh

213
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,440
uh tweet that i am very particular you

214
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,800
know the most important paper of my

215
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
career talking about

216
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,319
this kind of

217
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,120
uh

218
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
dramatic restructuring of the human

219
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,800
communication

220
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,039
not by these platforms with no aim other

221
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,440
than selling ads uh yeah the paper is

222
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,880
called stewardship of global collective

223
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
behavior it's a very inspiring call to

224
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
action

225
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,800
this is a crisis businessman just like

226
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
ecology and sustainability or crisis

227
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,639
disciplines we need to understand how

228
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,520
we're going to help save the planet from

229
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
ruining nature so we have a similar kind

230
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,280
of crisis that's what they're sort of

231
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,160
claiming

232
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,280
on the front of uh

233
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,560
yeah on the front of like the

234
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,800
information online online environments

235
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,599
uh that people are looking at

236
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,759
so

237
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,160
yeah so there's a lot of work on this so

238
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,440
this is you know the scientific side

239
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,479
this

240
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,199
book is another kind of interesting

241
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,759
uh very inspiring book uh that also kind

242
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,240
of puts the fingers squarely on this

243
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
kind of challenging attention economy

244
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,280
you know that says

245
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
that if we're going to surround the

246
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,680
minimal challenges we face today

247
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
uh we'll need to be giving the right

248
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
field of attention right things

249
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,000
the book is called stand out over light

250
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
talks about freedom and resistance for

251
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,520
the attention

252
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,120
and these are all very inspiring sort of

253
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,639
uh works and

254
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,839
the question is

255
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,599
where do we go from here so we're really

256
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,120
inspired and we understand that the

257
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,958
information environments are very sort

258
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,039
of putting us in this parallel

259
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,719
what can we do so

260
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,959
this is also from the same book uh we're

261
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,720
kind of working toward

262
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,519
where we can start to actually be doing

263
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,959
work on helping rethink these

264
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,279
information so

265
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
our quest kind of begins and with this

266
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
kind of realization and again this is

267
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,600
from the

268
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,279
book we presented earlier if we're at

269
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
all serious about promoting freedom and

270
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
autonomy in the digital age what that

271
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,760
would entail starting to assert and

272
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,080
defend our freedom of attention this is

273
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,279
also a very evocative kind of uh passage

274
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,880
freedom of attention yeah what does that

275
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
look like on online spaces there's a lot

276
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,959
of ways you can think about freedom of

277
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,399
attention

278
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,640
uh

279
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
yeah so

280
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
a lot of this work is is sort of i think

281
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,560
attempt to sort of articulate one vision

282
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,399
of what freedom of attention looks like

283
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
uh online

284
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,800
uh yeah so you know we have this quest

285
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,959
we we we're trying to sort of put this

286
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,480
then more into more time people it's

287
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,880
what it means

288
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,560
as a spoiler you know what we talked

289
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,360
about in this in

290
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,720
in this presentation what we talked

291
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
about in the paper uh we look at we take

292
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,959
signature to be some kind of unifying

293
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,440
concept that's underlying attention and

294
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,680
scientific so if we need some place to

295
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,519
start sort of a concrete solid place to

296
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
put our feet and start working uh we

297
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,120
think stigma energy is a really useful

298
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
concept many of you probably haven't

299
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,800
even heard of stigmatizing i surely

300
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,440
haven't until i met daniel here

301
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,640
i learned about you know collective

302
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
intelligence and

303
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
insects

304
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
so yeah we'll start from ground zero

305
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,839
stigma g is

306
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,760
collective behavioral behavioral

307
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
coordination among entities via

308
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
perception and modification of shared

309
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
environment and this i think really did

310
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
originated in studies

311
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,200
of uh coordination in ants

312
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
so you know the classic sort of example

313
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,079
is trail pheromones and sleeves and

314
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,160
we'll go into more detail on that

315
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
so you know an ant leaves some kind of

316
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,079
environment modification in the form of

317
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,440
a trail pheromone and then it's

318
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,959
attracted to it and there's some this

319
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,360
collective intelligent behavior emerging

320
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,920
as a result

321
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
another important thing to say about

322
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
sigmar g is is

323
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,600
this on the next slide yeah so

324
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,399
it's really kind of profound when you

325
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,640
go into it because you know we shape the

326
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
environment and it shapes us in a very

327
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
profound way um

328
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,279
some even go as far to say that

329
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,519
environments act as a distributed memory

330
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,519
system for a collective organism

331
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,360
so if any of you are familiar with the

332
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,600
extended mind hypothesis in cognitive

333
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,760
science how our tools are sort of

334
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,800
extensions of our cognition so stigmaty

335
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
is a sort of extended mind for

336
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,320
collectives

337
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,200
um

338
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,720
and then we have these diverging

339
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,120
feedback loops where you can go back

340
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,279
here you know we have agents and they're

341
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,279
producing some kind of

342
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,440
mark that's where stigma in greek you

343
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
know mark

344
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
is coming from so agents are producing

345
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,399
these results of action and that's

346
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,480
stimulating you know the same agent or

347
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
other agent and uh so there's a kind of

348
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
coupling between the environment the

349
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
agent acting on the environment

350
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
stimulating other agents for action

351
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,519
uh and then this kind of emerging global

352
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,959
sense

353
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,120
uh

354
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,600
yeah also important

355
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,279
no large scale coordination is possible

356
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,720
without the energy so if you go like

357
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,959
above n equals 25

358
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,560
then

359
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,399
then you need emerging communication

360
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,600
it's not like you know we can do zoom

361
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,040
calls with a thousand people right we

362
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
need other methods of coordination

363
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,720
synergies there's this like main method

364
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,200
of doing it and internet modifying

365
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,399
environments that other people are

366
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,000
participating in we'll go through a lot

367
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
of examples but the point is that we

368
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
really need to create healthy stigmargic

369
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
infrastructure

370
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
for a large scale coordination

371
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,399
and then

372
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,560
yeah we can ask is stigmatic

373
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000
infrastructure

374
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,399
that is provided to us today in online

375
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,480
environments how healthy is it uh so

376
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
we'll talk about that in a minute

377
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,079
um

378
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,920
yeah if you have anything you wanted to

379
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
say about uh like

380
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
other aspects of synergy that we

381
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
may or may not be touching here

382
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,600
maybe later on the uh types of stigma

383
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,279
yes

384
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,600
cool yeah so that's our next slide

385
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,880
yeah um

386
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,720
yeah we took a lot of integration from

387
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,839
this work

388
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,800
uh i'm leslie marsh on

389
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,160
uh stigmatic epistemology and

390
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,079
and they give this kind of useful

391
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,480
distinction between

392
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
two kinds of stigma g and you have

393
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,320
content creating stigma g

394
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,399
they call it semitectonic i think that's

395
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,079
they're drawn from some other uh

396
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,279
literature i think

397
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,560
um

398
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,480
oh cool yeah acts as a sign of book

399
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
because i wasn't sure that actually

400
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
nice so yeah content creating energy

401
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,040
versus signaling signature which is

402
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,600
marker based so the examples are helpful

403
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,680
here to understand what h mean in a

404
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,000
physical environment uh content creating

405
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,839
is like actually carving out a trail

406
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,600
which other agents are going to see and

407
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
you know use that uh they take out a

408
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
different kind of sign and you should go

409
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,399
over this trail and not just like

410
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,320
randomly off into the woods

411
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
um

412
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,079
and in a digital environment you might

413
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,839
think of things like writing a document

414
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,160
so you're actually modifying the digital

415
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,560
environment by writing words so that's

416
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,839
kind of the content creating sigmarching

417
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,440
and on the other side you have signaling

418
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,639
stigma gene the marker base where

419
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,160
looking at things like pheromone trails

420
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,839
and physical environments so ads aren't

421
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,360
actually modifying the environment in

422
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
any sort of meaningful way i mean

423
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,920
they're just doing it as sort of

424
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,360
communication experience they're not

425
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,199
changing the environment by like moving

426
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,360
some debris out of the path or creating

427
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,800
a path just like marking some kind of uh

428
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
trail for other ants

429
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,839
in the digital environment you can think

430
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,959
of a sort of

431
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,199
uh

432
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
highlighting or tagging is you know the

433
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,519
counterpart to that in the physical

434
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,519
environment so we'll definitely go into

435
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,519
this also in detail

436
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,639
now

437
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,959
we are focusing here on this big

438
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,040
building based stigma g we kind of

439
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
highlight that this is what we want to

440
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,560
focus on um

441
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,000
because actually

442
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
yeah this doesn't get as much attention

443
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,120
thinking about online environments as

444
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,040
we'll see

445
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,160
a lot of people are talking about this

446
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,279
kind of

447
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
content creating stigma g and sort of

448
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,639
people don't mention it

449
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,839
but people talk about how we create

450
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,399
content how we share it online uh not as

451
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,839
many people are talking about it's kind

452
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,639
of how we're sharing markers online so

453
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
this is why we decided uh this is kind

454
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,000
of an important focus not going to bring

455
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
to attention

456
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,040
yeah and did you want to say anything

457
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
else about texas

458
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,839
yeah

459
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,680
in the physical case

460
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
the left side the

461
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,360
actions that modify the niche

462
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,160
and clear out the trail or move pebbles

463
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
and do the nest architecture and so on

464
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,040
the analogy to content creation is very

465
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
clear like there's some arrangement of

466
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,120
mass

467
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,519
that isn't where it was previously and

468
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,959
then on the right side where in the

469
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,399
physical case it's more like the

470
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,360
pheromone trails which are transient or

471
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
longer lasting accumulations

472
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,720
and uh

473
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,480
as i hope we can

474
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
draw out on the next slide and going

475
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,000
forward

476
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
there is this kind of accumulation

477
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,920
across both types like somebody might

478
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
make an initial

479
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
post on a social media

480
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,839
but then somebody else might annotate it

481
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:08,560
and

482
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,360
it blurs the line between what is a

483
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,079
reaction what's a pheromone and what is

484
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,240
like building another piece of content

485
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,440
like if somebody responds with a image

486
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,920
is that like building or is that like

487
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,000
annotating and marking and i think that

488
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,839
points to the need to have a a design

489
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,000
language and a way of framing this

490
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
question that is able to encompass like

491
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,680
the pure classical content delivery like

492
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,440
a paper publication

493
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,600
and pure classical

494
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,240
transient marking on some digital

495
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
context and everything in between so

496
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,279
that we don't have to categorize

497
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,399
different communication acts along the

498
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,800
lines that they've been defined by

499
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,199
essentially the platforms that got us

500
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,360
into this position

501
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
yeah yeah yeah no that's that's that's

502
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
really great and i think here this maybe

503
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,079
creates a misleading impression there's

504
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,240
some kind of uh pattern categorization

505
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,839
it's like taxonomy but yeah there's

506
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,439
really a spectrum between

507
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,720
marker base and content creating uh so

508
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,559
it's kind of a yeah it's there's all the

509
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,640
grayers in between and some things some

510
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,799
markers are almost content in their own

511
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,760
right

512
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,199
yeah if i add a highlight with some

513
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,559
words on it is that really content

514
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
creating or is that annotation or like

515
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,919
signaling so yeah definitely a lot of

516
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,839
a lot of spectrum here and this is just

517
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,080
to say that we're focused more on this

518
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,360
side of the spectrum and then really we

519
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
can talk about this spectrum uh give a

520
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,600
better idea of what we're looking at

521
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,679
so we're looking at the merging markers

522
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,520
on the web um and the reason we're

523
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
focused on them is because in a lot of

524
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,840
respects they function as sort of the

525
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,280
digital traces of human attention um and

526
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,760
you're looking at things like reactions

527
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,640
um

528
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,240
associations that people might make you

529
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,520
know hyperlinks like oh i think this

530
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,200
content relates to smaller content we do

531
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
it all the time

532
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,360
in our tools like notion you're you know

533
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,880
you're linking to some other page you

534
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,760
think this reminds me

535
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
yeah tags some tagging content saying oh

536
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
this is the on the topic of i don't know

537
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,559
this decentralized distance or something

538
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,520
like that

539
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,360
uh and click through data is interesting

540
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,600
this is an implicitly yeah an explicit

541
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,039
and implicit marker so some of these

542
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
markers people are kind of doing this

543
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,520
they're

544
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,679
you know leaving consciously the digital

545
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,960
pheromone trail

546
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
by liking some posts and other times

547
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,039
it's actually like you can think of it

548
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,640
as an implicit marker where it's just

549
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
like the trail that we're traveling on

550
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,160
the web uh we're leaving this marker and

551
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,520
it is definitely being harvested right

552
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,799
like click through data is very valuable

553
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,799
as we can we'll see also later the

554
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,919
platforms

555
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,640
are selling and importing um

556
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,000
but yeah there's the difference in like

557
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,280
what people people might not think

558
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
they're even creating any kind of data

559
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
here people today are more sort of aware

560
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,559
of it but uh

561
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,160
yeah i think there's a lot of

562
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,600
interesting these are some interesting

563
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,360
future directions

564
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,280
if we're talking about like

565
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
implicit versus explicit so

566
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
there might be things that are more

567
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,799
implicit you know

568
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
in the future for example pupil

569
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,440
measurements or gaze tracking brain

570
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,679
computer interfaces

571
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,039
so this is just you know where you're

572
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,000
looking on a screen could also be a

573
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,960
magic

574
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,039
marker given that someone is recording

575
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,320
it you know it's getting recorded in

576
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
some kind of medium

577
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,000
and being used to sort of guide someone

578
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,760
else's attention yes then that is a

579
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
stigmatic marker if no one is recording

580
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,440
it then it's you could say yeah it's not

581
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,000
actually a suggestion

582
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,919
there are definitely yeah there's a few

583
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,080
things to say about this one is that the

584
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
reason these markers are so important is

585
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,640
because they're very cheap to create

586
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,160
but they have a very high information

587
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,720
content so this is why you know machine

588
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,600
learning

589
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,760
um research researchers and

590
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
practitioners will pay a lot of money

591
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,039
for human annotated data annotations

592
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,320
like very

593
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,760
it can be you know a few bits of

594
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,720
information what label is some category

595
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,919
uh but it's very high information

596
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,120
content because the human looked at this

597
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,679
picture and decided okay this is a dog

598
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,799
so these things are very high

599
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,400
information content and that makes them

600
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
very valuable

601
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,880
and they're also cheap to create and

602
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,280
interpret so yeah this makes markers

603
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,039
very uh valuable

604
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,120
but it also creates kind of challenges

605
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,400
with uh

606
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,679
ethics

607
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,960
user consent

608
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,880
uh how the data is being used privacy

609
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,840
because

610
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,039
this thing is very valuable but on the

611
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,400
other hand we're also creating a lot of

612
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,640
it without even thinking so

613
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,159
should this be ours

614
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,240
uh or should they help you guys

615
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,200
so a lot of questions there

616
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,559
cool so

617
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,918
we're getting closer now to certain

618
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,559
understanding where our questions going

619
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,159
so yeah the emerging workers could be

620
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,360
harnessed for healthy collective sense

621
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,200
making but centralized platforms are

622
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,559
regarding them you know now we kind of

623
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,840
can see that

624
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,280
if we look now everywhere we look at

625
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,640
what platforms are doing we can see that

626
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,679
they're actually these dragons that are

627
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,360
hoarding worship workers like everything

628
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
we're doing is getting really recorded

629
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
uh

630
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,960
without us having much access to it so

631
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
the click-through data

632
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,000
likes all this kind of stuff is is very

633
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,120
precious and it's getting

634
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,440
collected by these platforms so

635
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
okay we kind of

636
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
know where we're going now a little

637
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,000
better i want to say one thing this is

638
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,200
just a little

639
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,760
um yeah go into a little bit of

640
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,039
what we mean when we say healthier

641
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,640
collective symptoms like why do why do

642
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
we think that symmetric markers could be

643
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,039
harnessed for health or collective

644
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,360
sentiment so let's try to give a little

645
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
more uh insight on like what is

646
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,159
healthier unhealthier uh

647
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,080
you know information comments so yeah we

648
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,840
can look at a few examples just like a

649
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,679
toy example of ants i think maybe can be

650
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:32,960
illustrative this is kind of the mental

651
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,440
model i had in my mind uh as i was

652
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
thinking about this paper so

653
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,720
you know if you're looking at healthy

654
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
thicker green ants so an ad you know

655
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,440
find some food source um and they start

656
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,720
bringing back the nest they lay the

657
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,880
pheromone trail that line there sorry

658
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,960
for the poor graphics and other ants are

659
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,200
going to see that trail be attracted to

660
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,039
it and follow it

661
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,520
the food sources consumes and meanwhile

662
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,600
the the pheromone trail is decaying

663
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
as the food source is consumed

664
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
um eventually you know just the case and

665
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,159
then you know it's going to go there

666
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,360
they need to waste the time because

667
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,960
there's no more food there

668
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,320
that's kind of how the healthy sort of

669
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,960
pheromone for pheromone decay the

670
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
the ground you know holds it for some

671
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,039
time and then there's you know the sort

672
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,559
of predictable uh operating

673
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,039
characteristics of it now imagine a

674
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,400
different kind of

675
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,360
uh

676
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,919
a different kind of setup where

677
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,200
you know you have a different kind of

678
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,559
ground right like here i'm using

679
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,559
platform just to be suggestive but you

680
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,080
have a platform which is actually like

681
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,799
swallowing pheromone okay so now ants

682
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,240
are trying to lay the pheromone but it's

683
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,080
kind of decay right so this is already

684
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,720
one way in which the stigmargic

685
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,799
infrastructure is not healthy because

686
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,039
uh in a sense like the answer can find a

687
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,200
food because it's just not gonna be able

688
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,640
they're not gonna be able to lay that

689
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,600
parallel there uh to attract other ants

690
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,440
another thing that could happen

691
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,120
is you know if platforms are over

692
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,080
amplifying so if this kind of ground

693
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,400
instead of uh decaying predictably it

694
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,360
was kind of

695
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,880
for some reason reacting and over

696
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
amplifying pheromones so even when the

697
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,120
food source was consumed ants would

698
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
still be kind of traversing and

699
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,679
wasting their time uh even when there's

700
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,039
no food there

701
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,240
so another thing you know you can kind

702
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,760
of see the

703
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,320
parallels you know in light spaces

704
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,159
uh yeah the third third thing you might

705
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,320
think of is a case where you have kind

706
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,360
of

707
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
um

708
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,679
areas where you can't lay uh

709
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,360
uh you know pheromones you can't leave

710
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,600
the feral trail so uh if there's food

711
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,280
it's outside the area where you can

712
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720
leave pheromone then ants won't be

713
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
finding it because

714
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
you know just the properties of the

715
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,960
ground so

716
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,240
these are all kinds of ways in which

717
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,159
there's just trying to give you to sort

718
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,280
of

719
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
yeah convey the intuition that there are

720
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,960
it's a very

721
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,559
sort of delicately tuned system and

722
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,840
there are many ways it can be out of

723
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,600
tune and which would you know lead to

724
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,080
very disastrous consequences for the

725
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,600
sort of organism the collective

726
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,159
organisms as a whole

727
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,520
yeah yeah well do you want us to think

728
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,720
about that

729
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,520
uh yeah i was just going to observe that

730
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,039
um

731
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,360
looking back on the concept of sort of

732
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,279
information silos that you discussed

733
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,240
with

734
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,559
uh fox news and cnn um maybe one more

735
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,320
aspect of unhealthy sigmoidy is

736
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,559
some of these stigmargic markers or

737
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,360
trails are visible to one group and

738
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,919
invisible to another group so you you

739
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,960
also have um this failure to create a

740
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,480
shared reality um

741
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,640
i wonder if that's another aspect of

742
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,559
unhealthy big energy yeah definitely i

743
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,600
think that one yeah that would

744
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
definitely be another another a great

745
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
example where yeah you might have

746
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,120
you know that only a certain part of the

747
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,200
hive is going to be

748
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
sensing and then another type that the

749
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,919
other part of the hype is going to be

750
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,799
something they're really going to be

751
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,480
just living in shared

752
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,039
shared uh not shared realities

753
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,480
yeah for sure so i think that's a that's

754
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,840
a great example also

755
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,559
yeah so

756
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,000
yeah those are the few kind of hand

757
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,480
maybe intuitive examples try to get the

758
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,159
uh point across that

759
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,039
if we're looking at healthier

760
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,480
information environments uh they're

761
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,840
going to be highly complex because if

762
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,360
you consider a lot of parameters here

763
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,640
you know just imagine what what's going

764
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,279
on

765
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,200
this is ants so it's relatively simple

766
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,679
and even that when it was complex but um

767
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,919
you have all these different kinds of

768
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,520
markers people are leaving and the

769
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,720
different parameters to reach the

770
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,320
markers and how they're getting spread

771
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
and

772
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,840
used to recommend content so a lot of

773
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,279
parameters here

774
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,720
the point is that as designers and

775
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
participants in these information

776
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,000
environments uh will need to be able to

777
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,039
assume

778
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,000
more control more decentralized right

779
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,679
because we don't want a central designer

780
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,919
but uh we'll need to be able to play

781
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,480
with these parameters for uh currently

782
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,640
as we discussed there's the opacity and

783
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,279
centralization so very few people

784
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,440
um are able even to make the kind of you

785
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
know

786
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
to tweak these parameters and they can

787
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,600
do experiments you know like global

788
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,960
scale and they're the only people that

789
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,799
can do them

790
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
so yeah that was the point of these

791
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,640
examples so

792
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
um

793
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,440
our proposals so finally we can kind of

794
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,480
talk about where where we think uh

795
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,679
fruitful direction would be to go um

796
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,000
yeah we call it open source retention

797
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and we try to draw the parallel to open

798
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,240
source software and decentralization

799
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,640
movement and

800
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,440
the sort of as i was alluding to earlier

801
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,720
they're all about

802
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,039
freeing most of the work

803
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,039
and about creating content creation

804
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,000
sharing

805
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,159
so you have things like github and you

806
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,400
know decentralized currencies like

807
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,720
bitcoin um

808
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,919
all those are examples of you know the

809
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,279
kind of

810
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,480
technology the content creating

811
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,919
stigmatization so we can create code we

812
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,600
can create documents we can you know

813
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,760
publish social media posts

814
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,559
uh all that kind of thing that's content

815
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,640
we're talking about open source tension

816
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,840
we're looking at sort of the complement

817
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,240
of that it's the emerging markers

818
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,760
is anyone looking at this idea of

819
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,039
freeing

820
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,919
the

821
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,840
reactions to count so we're doing a lot

822
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,000
of this kind of work on decentralizing

823
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,679
contemplation but we're actually what

824
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,440
we're kind of the moment is like we're

825
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,600
not actually doing much work on

826
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,480
freeing these kind of reactions to count

827
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
so on the technical level we think

828
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
that just as we have sort of systems and

829
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,679
platforms

830
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,039
that will help us with protocols that

831
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,200
help us

832
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,880
share our content

833
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
we

834
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,640
that's on the technical level like at a

835
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,360
high level and then we have here sort of

836
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
just like

837
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,559
the social aspect of the open source

838
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,480
software movement with these kind of

839
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,320
hacker heroes that were building code in

840
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,799
public and uh sharing it without sort of

841
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:35,760
any

842
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,080
monetary compensation uh then we'll have

843
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,159
a similar kind of

844
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,559
uh we envision kind of a similar kind of

845
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,320
scent maker hero they're sort of the

846
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,600
counterpart and they're and they're

847
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,000
doing kind of curation in public and

848
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,279
they're mindful of their digital

849
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,039
attention traces

850
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,120
so doing kind of open source attention

851
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,760
open source thinking

852
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,200
sort of following these lines of open

853
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,600
source coding

854
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,000
um yeah so

855
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,520
let's look at what open source attention

856
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,840
means for like uh information ecosystems

857
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,360
like how we translate that to the

858
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,200
information ecosystem actually we're

859
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,480
zooming in now we're getting into the

860
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,279
sort of

861
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,679
more in the direction like concrete uh

862
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,279
implementation so

863
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,799
first let's understand like the

864
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,559
platform-centric information because

865
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,080
there's all the new terms we have the

866
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,919
new terminology so

867
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,200
what we can see like okay so these are

868
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,720
the dragons that are hurting our

869
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,159
attention data and how it happens is we

870
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,279
have these kind of

871
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,720
now we can sort of see what's happening

872
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,320
here the the do controlling we're doing

873
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,640
here is kind of a low agency annotation

874
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,320
interface

875
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,080
uh that's collecting our submerging

876
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,120
markers

877
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,360
uh platforms are storing this data

878
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
they sell it to advertisers

879
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,760
they use it to drive content discovery

880
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,679
in a way that serves optimizing for

881
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,840
platform groups by serving us new

882
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,080
content that will keep us on our screens

883
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,000
as well as ads that will keep the

884
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,679
advertisers happy

885
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,000
so they can sort of this is the feedback

886
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,760
right they have this they they have the

887
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,880
the control

888
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,480
closed on us because they have the data

889
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,679
and they have the algorithms

890
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,480
now

891
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,039
how might you like do something

892
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,640
alternative that doesn't involve those

893
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,360
uh

894
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,480
dragon platforms uh so what we propose

895
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,200
is a decentralized maker centric

896
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,279
ecosystem so instead of users we have

897
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,440
makers and makers are these kind of

898
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,559
uh

899
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,640
high agency annotators so we can think

900
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,760
of all these personal knowledge

901
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,200
management tools uh notion and rome and

902
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,559
you know we'll look at

903
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,540
vio hopefully later

904
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,080
[Music]

905
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
next all these different kinds of

906
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,880
annotation interfaces people are

907
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,080
building these knowledge management

908
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,480
tools you can actually think of them as

909
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,240
annotation interfaces that are

910
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,559
collecting emerging markers

911
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,320
uh but the crucial sort of point is that

912
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,919
we're talking about a

913
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:50,960
case where

914
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,799
makers are owning these markers this is

915
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,320
all this is this is you know the point

916
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,640
of sort of stealth sovereign storage uh

917
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,559
cell power and data uh you have things

918
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,320
like solid protocol

919
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
that allow people to actually control

920
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,080
and own their own data and we're saying

921
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,399
if we apply this testing markers we

922
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,520
actually get this

923
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,399
separation uh decoupling of the content

924
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,399
discovery algorithms and the

925
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,159
mystic merchant markers then you kind of

926
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,399
break up this platform loop and then

927
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,000
content discovery services will need to

928
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,279
be sort of

929
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,279
uh focused and they'll need to be

930
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,480
aligned with

931
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,080
the

932
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,000
take into account the

933
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,919
sort of human-centered

934
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,399
uh incentives so

935
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,840
makers will be able to share data with

936
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,120
these content discovery services and

937
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,799
there'll be a lot of diverse patent

938
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,640
assembly services but they won't have

939
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,480
control over our data and then that's

940
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,159
kind of a way to break up that vicious

941
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,279
cycle

942
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,880
so you can imagine you know

943
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,399
different kinds of feed algorithms that

944
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,399
you'll have like a competing market free

945
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,840
algorithms or you'll have matchmaking

946
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,960
services uh

947
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,880
ai recommendation all kinds of um

948
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,279
diverse new discovery services and and

949
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,320
you can use

950
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,240
all of them or any of them and you know

951
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,399
kind of it incentivizes open source

952
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,120
yeah open source and more human-centered

953
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,720
environment than what we're looking at

954
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,120
previously

955
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,640
right

956
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,399
one of the main challenges this is

957
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,559
like one of the first challenges that

958
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,679
this kind of

959
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,000
proposal is running into is how to scale

960
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
up because

961
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,519
um

962
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,840
you know we have this kind of

963
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,360
network effect where we need to compete

964
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,880
essentially with

965
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,799
facebook and twitter and all these huge

966
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,399
established networks because they have

967
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,320
the data to you know provide the high

968
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,679
quality recommendation and we don't have

969
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
anything right now so

970
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,159
the idea here is to bootstrap growth and

971
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,840
personal knowledge management tools for

972
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,200
collective knowledge management this is

973
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,240
an idea that's kind of been floating

974
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,679
around

975
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,799
uh

976
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,360
in a lot of different spaces but yeah

977
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,039
this kind of feeling that user curator

978
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,320
knowledge is really stuck in

979
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,080
single-player tools and

980
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,240
and all the while search engines really

981
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,440
aren't doing as well as they could be

982
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,559
doing

983
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,159
how do we build more collectively

984
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,000
curated knowledge that works

985
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,919
not just like these silos

986
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,360
second grade so

987
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,120
um i think one way to look at it is that

988
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,919
yeah

989
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,360
from going

990
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,720
sort of this is swing depending on the

991
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,320
other direction where

992
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,159
if previously there's data silos in the

993
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,600
platform levels so each platform is like

994
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,720
a data style

995
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,679
using that for harmful sort of

996
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,039
purposes

997
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,880
uh this kind of problem is here what's

998
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,080
currently happening is like each of

999
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,799
these

1000
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,080
small

1001
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,320
relatively small

1002
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
knowledge management tools is going to

1003
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,559
be a data style and they won't be large

1004
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,320
enough to sort of reach

1005
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,600
yeah critical map they will be large

1006
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
enough to provide high quality content

1007
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,000
discovery so they have some data but

1008
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,360
it's not enough so all of them are

1009
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,960
competing versus each other

1010
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,559
um either none of them are going to be

1011
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,640
able to provide like this kind of

1012
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,399
uh high enough quality service and they

1013
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,919
won't be able to beat the

1014
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,399
platforms the big platforms so

1015
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,480
what we kind of

1016
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,640
proposed here is is a

1017
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,200
protocols not platforms uh approach and

1018
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,480
this is something that's very sort of

1019
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,440
widely

1020
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,360
advocated for web three

1021
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,360
so you see protocols for all kinds of

1022
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,679
all kinds of sort of interoperable

1023
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,200
uh online

1024
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,799
objects and what we're talking about

1025
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,200
here are protocols for

1026
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
uh merging primitives so you might

1027
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,760
imagine a protocol for light or backlink

1028
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,080
or other kinds of things we talked about

1029
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,360
earlier

1030
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
uh and that what this effectively would

1031
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,919
enable

1032
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,919
is having markers

1033
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,919
uh being able to you could share markers

1034
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,919
essentially so instead of having these

1035
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,360
dialogue markers you can actually pool

1036
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,960
them so if i'm collecting my reading

1037
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,799
list in notions or also doing it in rome

1038
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,640
and someone else is doing it in another

1039
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,320
app they could also be shared in a

1040
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,480
common format and use

1041
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,679
uh

1042
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:46,880
for

1043
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,039
driving this kind of discovery

1044
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,760
so

1045
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,679
that is kind of where we're envisioning

1046
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,519
it going we took a lot of inspiration

1047
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,960
from this uh

1048
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,320
very good

1049
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,240
uh essay on

1050
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,919
protocol stock platforms highly

1051
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,399
recommended

1052
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,760
so yeah i think kind of the meme firm

1053
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,480
meme version of that is

1054
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,399
we have these kind of current situations

1055
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,679
where these

1056
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,159
small independent platforms are are

1057
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,839
going to be eaten by the big fish to doc

1058
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,239
and twitter and facebook and all those

1059
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,159
and the way for these

1060
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,839
independent platforms to

1061
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,000
coordinate is through

1062
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,159
interoperability using protocols for

1063
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,159
stigmatic markers

1064
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,918
that's kind of our vision

1065
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,599
but yeah there's a lot of work to do to

1066
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,679
get there um

1067
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,918
so some next steps

1068
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,399
we are thinking about are

1069
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,000
definitely kind of

1070
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,520
going deeper into the weeds and a lot of

1071
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,119
questions remaining about social

1072
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,320
incentives

1073
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,560
uh the tech stack

1074
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
uh malicious use of these kind of

1075
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,199
technologies

1076
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,719
uh cultural transitions like how do we

1077
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,760
do the transition from users to makers

1078
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,879
um

1079
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,480
this kind of

1080
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
work that the first this kind of paper

1081
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,400
was more like a blue guy idea paper and

1082
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,560
it was more like functioning as a call

1083
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,839
to action

1084
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,400
um to the sort of challenges

1085
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,839
we're saying we need to start building

1086
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,760
tech for governing our attention

1087
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,920
which is sort of something that we

1088
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,760
haven't heard much talked about so we

1089
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,520
wanted to sort of bring that uh

1090
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,119
emphasize that

1091
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,160
in this paper uh yeah we

1092
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,680
are really

1093
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,800
looking for

1094
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,560
all kinds of collaborators so check out

1095
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
our website and connect with us if any

1096
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,359
of us interested um

1097
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,359
i think we can

1098
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,480
yeah maybe

1099
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,119
pause there open for discussion

1100
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,119
um

1101
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,520
awesome questions

1102
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,320
thanks for the presentation ronan so for

1103
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
those who are watching live feel free to

1104
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,800
write a comment in the live chat

1105
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,119
otherwise we'll if you have any

1106
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,960
reflections or thoughts and then we have

1107
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,480
a few more

1108
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,760
slides to go through in this next steps

1109
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,000
phase and that'll include looking a

1110
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,920
little bit more at some platform

1111
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,359
affordances

1112
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,640
and also

1113
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
talking about how this connects to

1114
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,720
active inference

1115
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,400
no immediate thoughts here um plenty to

1116
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,240
talk about when we get to the

1117
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,320
discussion and the questions

1118
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,119
yeah

1119
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,280
let's go to uh the

1120
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,760
uh promising directions

1121
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,839
and talk about that and then we'll go

1122
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,160
after that to vo and then active

1123
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,240
inference

1124
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,880
yeah great um

1125
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,560
so yeah some promising directions we

1126
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,640
kind of became aware of this is actually

1127
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,839
even after

1128
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,079
after we wrote the paper

1129
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,720
um this is an interesting word from a

1130
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,560
few years back

1131
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,599
on opportunities and challenges around

1132
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,960
public web activity tracking so

1133
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,320
essentially getting people to look at

1134
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,320
experiments human subjects and

1135
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,560
explored the kind of affordances for

1136
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,240
allowing people to share browsing

1137
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,480
activity traces for example like urls i

1138
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,839
visited

1139
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,920
and time spent on each webpage

1140
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,440
information like that so

1141
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,800
they gave people a tool that would allow

1142
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,320
them to do that inside the browser and

1143
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
they checked like small

1144
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,400
small groups of people

1145
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,800
um different kind of friend groups or

1146
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,000
research groups

1147
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,599
and they kind of lot of interesting

1148
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,040
things i think

1149
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,960
uh some of the highlights were that they

1150
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,560
found that like while people had privacy

1151
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,800
concerns they definitely can and will

1152
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,240
tailor their sharing

1153
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,160
depending on the concept context and

1154
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,280
incentives

1155
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,320
um

1156
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,760
people felt that this made them a lot

1157
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,520
more mindful of their browsing behavior

1158
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,920
in a lot of times in a good way

1159
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,880
which kind of speaks to the

1160
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,599
user-to-maker transition uh if people

1161
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,880
are sort of being open so it's just like

1162
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,240
you write open source code you kind of

1163
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,760
make sure it's like high quality because

1164
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,599
we know people are looking at it so they

1165
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,240
may lose like attention and browsing

1166
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,440
um

1167
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,880
and people also could kind of feel how

1168
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,240
this would help them better sort of

1169
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,400
navigate the information landscape

1170
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
because they were saying like you can

1171
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,119
better assess the legitimacy of some

1172
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,280
website by knowing how many people

1173
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,520
visited it and who visited

1174
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,599
this kind of uh

1175
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,000
shared you know public information

1176
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,839
um yeah this was this book kind of

1177
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:12,960
caught my eye

1178
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,760
uh yeah if you ask me i would rather

1179
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,880
a thousand a billion times that

1180
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,640
researchers for an academic and

1181
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,240
humanistic knowledge purposes are the

1182
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,320
ones that can map information stored for

1183
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,599
humanity rather than private companies

1184
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,880
so this is really speaking kind of

1185
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,880
people feeling that sort of human traded

1186
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,359
church humans or humans

1187
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,720
can be healthier information departments

1188
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,160
definitely this work also pointed to

1189
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,920
sort of the limitations you know it's

1190
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
like how do we scale up to something

1191
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
something larger than just a group of

1192
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,240
friends so yeah but definitely this is

1193
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
like a cool intro in

1194
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,200
preliminary study um yeah vo uh we have

1195
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,800
also definitely a very interesting kind

1196
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,960
of preliminary work that will tell us

1197
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,119
more about

1198
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,280
yeah thanks ronan um

1199
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,240
so

1200
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,839
vo is it's a prototype stage software

1201
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,880
project

1202
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,760
um that was actually originally designed

1203
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,400
to be a platform that is a kind of

1204
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,000
knowledge garden

1205
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,160
um a way for people to visually build

1206
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,680
their

1207
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,119
network of references and make

1208
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,760
connections and trace their paths back

1209
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,800
um and it was in a sense a way of

1210
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,520
creating trails for people between

1211
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,440
uh pieces of content in different

1212
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,599
platforms or silos and of course the

1213
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,440
problem with that as

1214
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,560
uh as ronan has discussed is it itself

1215
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,800
is in a cycle and is in a platform so

1216
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,040
it's a little bit self-defeating it's in

1217
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,400
its original conceptualization um so

1218
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,920
right now we're actually in a stage

1219
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,440
where we're sort of going back to the

1220
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,920
drawing board taking this this new

1221
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,960
research

1222
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,839
and

1223
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,680
this new approach

1224
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,560
of building a tool that works on an

1225
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,440
interoperable protocol using distributed

1226
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,800
data instead of a centralized uh data

1227
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,880
store with proprietary

1228
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,440
mechanisms of interaction and hopefully

1229
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,200
we can take vo and make it a a test case

1230
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,880
where we can

1231
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,520
practically apply the concept of this

1232
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,680
common sense protocol to build out a

1233
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,599
piece of software where the data can

1234
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,280
then be used in other pieces of software

1235
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,680
other front ends other search engines

1236
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,920
and so on and

1237
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,319
in that way start to actually break free

1238
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,359
of this um platforms dominate our

1239
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,319
attention paradigm and see kind of what

1240
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,280
the possibilities and limitations are

1241
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,640
we have a short demo that is kind of the

1242
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,359
original concept of vo um so we'll go

1243
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,160
through that real quick

1244
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,240
i don't think the sound will play but

1245
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,720
just full screen the video and just play

1246
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,280
it and will describe us um yeah okay i

1247
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,640
got it yeah yeah if you want to describe

1248
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,000
well you can kind of say what we're

1249
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,040
seeing here

1250
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,200
all right so this is an example of how

1251
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,960
vo might work so

1252
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,680
it

1253
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,359
takes you through a process

1254
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,640
of

1255
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,040
discovery you can essentially keep track

1256
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,480
of what you're interested in learning um

1257
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,960
go through the entire search process

1258
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,680
look for sources that seem interesting

1259
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,520
or relevant to you

1260
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,680
and then as you go you can go through

1261
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,880
and annotate different pieces um

1262
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,079
take detailed notes take excerpts

1263
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,880
etc and then as you have new questions

1264
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,440
as there are new uh areas that you would

1265
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,800
like to search you can essentially

1266
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,880
capture those as you go without breaking

1267
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,640
your uh train of thought without

1268
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,280
breaking your research process

1269
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,839
and then from

1270
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,480
there vo automatically builds a visual

1271
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,400
map of what you've explored and what you

1272
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,480
have yet to explore so that you can

1273
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,680
continue to build an ongoing

1274
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,040
research

1275
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,160
map

1276
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,240
and then when you come back to this many

1277
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,480
months later you have the entire context

1278
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,319
of your whole research process visually

1279
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,160
laid out for you everything you looked

1280
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,079
for everything you found everything you

1281
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,599
were interested in but never got around

1282
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,040
to so

1283
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,960
you kind of take a lot of the burden of

1284
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,280
manually managing your recent process

1285
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,400
off of

1286
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,119
the researcher and allow the technology

1287
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,280
to do what the technology does best

1288
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
um so

1289
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,560
largely the way for you to

1290
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,760
take

1291
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,560
kind of a walk at your own face through

1292
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,480
the information you're interested in or

1293
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,560
is valuable to you at the level that you

1294
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,079
can understand it

1295
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,720
so it allows you to sort of self-select

1296
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
the best learning path

1297
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,599
um without really getting lost in

1298
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,720
the

1299
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,119
platforms and algorithms and

1300
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,560
um

1301
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,880
i guess content suggestions or even

1302
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,200
curated content or courses that might

1303
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,680
not be at the proper level of depth for

1304
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,240
where you are at the moment um

1305
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,119
so

1306
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,079
go ahead

1307
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,400
yeah oh did you ask the thing

1308
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,359
well

1309
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,640
go first run and then i'll add a few

1310
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,680
notes

1311
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,520
um i just wanted to say

1312
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,680
like this this is um

1313
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,960
i mean that was one of the things that

1314
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,560
sort of i think triggered the whole

1315
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,000
collaboration and like

1316
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,599
got us started on this on this direction

1317
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,839
of research um

1318
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,400
like seeing what vo can

1319
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,680
like you know just playing a few

1320
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,319
intriguing things like one is that many

1321
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,520
annotation

1322
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,160
tools don't provide

1323
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,520
uh this kind of

1324
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,920
temporal relation between annotations so

1325
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,800
they're just like you're annotating

1326
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,400
everything and you don't really know the

1327
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,839
structure of like how you got there and

1328
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,599
where you went from there and things

1329
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,599
like laid out in the trail forum

1330
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,839
was really evocative and and sort of

1331
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,200
thinking about like how would this look

1332
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,160
like we could share this kind of

1333
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,240
information and like imagining the sort

1334
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,800
of multiplayer video where you might be

1335
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,319
standing on a node and then you're like

1336
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,240
seeing the trails of other people and

1337
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,560
maybe it's like even using ai to sort of

1338
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,800
highlight the people that are maybe you

1339
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,079
know recommended that you should follow

1340
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,400
their trails based on stigma g and crowd

1341
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,760
signals and ai or whatever um so like

1342
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,960
that was very like a

1343
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,920
and

1344
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,880
yeah one of the thought there about

1345
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,040
yeah that you know just yeah i think

1346
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,079
there's another thing i want to say like

1347
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,319
social vio and the sort of linking

1348
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,319
annotations or like two seemed like

1349
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,640
really really intriguing directions to

1350
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,040
take this

1351
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,730
yeah i also um

1352
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,160
[Music]

1353
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,680
saw that transition between the first

1354
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,200
person knowledge management and the

1355
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,440
second person that ronan had brought up

1356
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,480
earlier

1357
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,200
and it hinges on shared landmarks

1358
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,440
and so being able to think of these in a

1359
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,280
spatial context which maybe we can

1360
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,000
return to with active inference and then

1361
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,200
being able to go down to just one's own

1362
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,079
path

1363
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,599
like just like we'd have a trace on

1364
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,520
google maps or something like that but

1365
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,359
then see multiple paths together and

1366
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,680
have curation approaches there and then

1367
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,560
i think it's really uh it's a

1368
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,040
fascinating tension with this

1369
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,480
functionality

1370
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,040
the single or the multiplayer case

1371
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,440
it could be done in a centralized

1372
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,880
platform web 2 strategy and there's even

1373
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,480
arguments for why that would be

1374
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,880
streamlined more efficient more secure

1375
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,200
all these different aspects

1376
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,160
yet

1377
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,480
in a different way or at a higher level

1378
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,400
there are challenges and failure modes

1379
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,839
and so on that would be like

1380
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,200
dismantling the function potentially for

1381
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,160
example

1382
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,680
allowing for a centralized point of

1383
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,240
control over those path recommendation

1384
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,760
algorithms so as long as the

1385
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,000
architecture is bundled

1386
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,440
then there are certain failure modes

1387
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,200
that this is actually like escalating to

1388
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,960
the next level people say oh we used to

1389
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,040
have the news feed it was linear

1390
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,440
and now we have the branching news feed

1391
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,760
and it's so much more fun and engaging

1392
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,000
but then it's just representing the next

1393
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,319
escalation in attention capture

1394
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,240
yeah that's a really good observation

1395
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
oh yeah go ahead

1396
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,480
uh yeah that's that's kind of why we're

1397
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,119
we're motivated to pull out of this

1398
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,040
platform paradigm um and kind of follow

1399
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,880
this uh this new approach it's

1400
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,400
fundamentally like

1401
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,200
all

1402
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,839
all we're trying to do is enhance

1403
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,280
people's ability to make sense of the

1404
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,599
world and if we make a tool

1405
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,040
that undermines it

1406
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,160
no matter how

1407
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,400
cool or fun it is

1408
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,520
we failed

1409
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,480
so

1410
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,280
um bringing it into a context where this

1411
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,480
data

1412
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,440
is

1413
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,520
you can take the same data and use it in

1414
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,599
different apps or you can take data from

1415
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,760
different apps and use it in here and

1416
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,640
you can kind of break free of certain

1417
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,960
mechanisms where the fact that the data

1418
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,680
is siloed could be used against the end

1419
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,720
user

1420
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,079
um

1421
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,119
and instead create a paradigm

1422
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,000
where

1423
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,520
this information

1424
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,640
can be

1425
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,720
acted on and interpreted in a lot of

1426
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,599
different ways where there's room for

1427
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,760
innovation and insight and creativity

1428
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,160
and competition and disruption where

1429
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,800
this model can be

1430
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,680
evolved outside of just this app by one

1431
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,760
team of developers

1432
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,000
and can be integrated into different

1433
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,440
ways of interacting with information um

1434
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,319
and

1435
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,960
by freeing it from that

1436
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,400
then then the concept isn't only serving

1437
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,119
a business or a group a small group of

1438
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,119
people it's serving

1439
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,359
everybody who stands to benefit from the

1440
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,440
concept being available um so that's

1441
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,559
kind of what we're trying to do we don't

1442
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,119
want to shoot ourselves in the foot

1443
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,880
and in the collective violate our

1444
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,880
purpose yeah yeah

1445
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,599
yeah yeah i was just thinking i just

1446
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,640
thought i was thinking of like

1447
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,599
like you were talking about the

1448
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,359
different kinds of apps like i mean by

1449
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,440
letting this beta be free

1450
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,280
it opens up like the space of like you

1451
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,040
don't really know how to use i mean you

1452
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,559
know it's incredibly valuable you can't

1453
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,440
even

1454
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,960
envision like how

1455
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,160
it could be used in different ways i'm

1456
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,760
just thinking of for example you know

1457
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,400
like learning learning uh apps i think

1458
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,680
there's like a lot of intriguing space

1459
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,760
there to explore like you know the trail

1460
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,520
that someone is making in the beginning

1461
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,520
of their steps and some topic is very

1462
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,559
different to the trail that someone was

1463
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,240
making like an advanced trail and you

1464
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,920
could if you could learn these different

1465
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,359
kinds of trails you could build like

1466
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,559
really cool

1467
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,240
online curriculum

1468
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,960
um services that's one thing i was

1469
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,240
thinking of but there's just like so

1470
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,000
many others uh

1471
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,760
and i think there's just a lot of

1472
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,119
questions you know people are maybe

1473
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,880
thinking themselves like

1474
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,319
yeah i mean obviously there's technical

1475
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,440
questions because what we're saying here

1476
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,640
just to kind of drive the point home

1477
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,680
we're saying

1478
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,680
we don't think veto should be the only

1479
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,200
tool that will let you map these rabbit

1480
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,559
holes we want a lot of different tools

1481
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,559
to be able to do this and interoperate

1482
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,240
with each other that's one thing that's

1483
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,920
kind of okay

1484
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,200
because it raises a lot of confusing

1485
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,200
questions about you know okay how do you

1486
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,800
guys monetize this stuff like where are

1487
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,920
where you know where is the data getting

1488
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,440
stored and how

1489
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,599
people not feeling your data or

1490
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,839
yeah how are you maybe getting uh

1491
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,520
compensated for people using your data

1492
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,040
in different kinds of services

1493
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,000
um so we're aware that there are a lot

1494
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,880
of

1495
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,160
challenging questions there like we're

1496
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,760
not naive about that but we do think

1497
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,680
that these kind of questions are joining

1498
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,839
you know broader questions in web three

1499
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,960
space of data sovereignty and

1500
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,200
decentralized identity and

1501
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,880
yeah all the bigger questions that a lot

1502
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,160
of people are working on and we see

1503
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,839
ourselves sort of interfacing with them

1504
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,599
and you know people might in a modular

1505
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,880
way like if someone has a good solution

1506
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,760
for

1507
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,359
you know renumerating people on their

1508
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,680
data stations

1509
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,599
[Music]

1510
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,440
yep bring it to active inference and

1511
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,359
maybe go to the second of the active

1512
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,960
inference slides

1513
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,319
uh first and break it off

1514
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,118
awesome

1515
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,839
let's get back here

1516
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:06,880
awesome

1517
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,559
and the next slide

1518
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,839
we'll come back to the general questions

1519
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,240
but i just wanted to start with this one

1520
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,800
um highlight some awesome recent work

1521
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,119
and provide like an example based entry

1522
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,000
point

1523
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,119
to the intersection of attention

1524
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,520
which is often used very abstractly or

1525
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,760
in a single entity case in active

1526
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,960
inference or in a non-stigmatic setting

1527
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,119
how attention is being used and bring it

1528
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,839
to like a very clear applied case

1529
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,200
so this is the recent work of albarasan

1530
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,680
at all from this year

1531
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,760
and they are

1532
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,880
making a model of kind of like a toy

1533
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,000
twitter

1534
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,119
where individuals are involved in just

1535
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,200
like in any active inference model

1536
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,599
they're involved in perception cognition

1537
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,880
and action and then impact in the niche

1538
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,559
and in this case

1539
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,280
what is being perceived from the niche

1540
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,119
what the generative process is handing

1541
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,480
those entities is information that in

1542
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,960
this case is being proxied by different

1543
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,839
hashtags so you know yes on x no on x

1544
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,839
of course hashtags have much more

1545
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,880
complex usage simply tagging content or

1546
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,200
using or not using one can see many ways

1547
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,319
that the hashtag is not the whole

1548
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,960
semantic picture but again it serves as

1549
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,160
a proxy

1550
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,920
and as an expansible platform

1551
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,440
to make models that could include

1552
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,599
different kinds of communication

1553
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,880
and

1554
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,160
on the left is a a graphical

1555
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,760
representation of how this simulation

1556
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,000
plays out and so a simulation like this

1557
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,200
can be used prospectively given a set of

1558
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,160
parameters to evaluate different futures

1559
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,280
it can also be used given empirical data

1560
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,440
to tune those parameters and in fact

1561
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,680
there can be kind of a bi-directionality

1562
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,599
or a tale of two cities tale of two

1563
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,160
densities where empirical data are

1564
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,280
coming in

1565
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,599
and updating parameters and then those

1566
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,520
updated parameters are used in a

1567
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,359
generative capacity

1568
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,920
again to look at counterfactuals or to

1569
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,440
simulate futures

1570
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,000
and it's called a graphical model

1571
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,480
because it's based upon a bayesian

1572
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,280
graphical network model

1573
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,160
the nodes whether they're a circle or

1574
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,200
square

1575
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,240
there's some

1576
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,480
details to go into but the nodes are

1577
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,920
variables so that would be like x equals

1578
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,359
those are the nodes

1579
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,280
and that would be equivalent to like a

1580
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,520
variable in a script

1581
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,880
so whether you think about this more

1582
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,359
mathematically or more from a

1583
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,520
programming an implementation

1584
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,400
angle

1585
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,800
the nodes are like the variables and the

1586
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,200
edges represent relationships amongst

1587
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,559
the variables

1588
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,640
and for those who have more familiarity

1589
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,119
with this type of representation of an

1590
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,440
active inference model they'll

1591
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,119
see what some of these letters mean and

1592
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,119
what roles they might be playing here

1593
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,000
but suffice to say that this graphical

1594
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,680
network here

1595
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,280
is representing

1596
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,559
the cognitive context of multiple

1597
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,119
entities that are receiving information

1598
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,960
in the form of hashtag

1599
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,760
doing some cognitive process on it

1600
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,359
updating their beliefs as well as

1601
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,040
choosing how to act

1602
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,440
and then implementing that action and

1603
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,599
then that is like one time step in the

1604
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,680
simulation so i wanted to provide this

1605
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,599
example because it's a great

1606
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,880
case study

1607
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,520
of bringing active inference into a

1608
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,599
social and digital

1609
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:40,720
setting

1610
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,480
and it's a great direction that uses

1611
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,040
also the pi mdp package

1612
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,200
developed by some of the authors and

1613
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,280
others so it's a great

1614
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,040
case on multiple sides to understand how

1615
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,720
research developments

1616
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,599
and open source software development

1617
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,960
can meet up with socially relevant cases

1618
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,000
so wanted to just describe that case

1619
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,520
if either of you have any thoughts or

1620
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,119
questions and then the next case that

1621
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,680
we'll look into will be more of an ant

1622
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,400
case

1623
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,319
and that will help bring us to some of

1624
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,839
these bigger questions about attention

1625
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,280
and stigma chi

1626
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,160
yeah i was just going to say um

1627
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,280
this kind of circles back i think to the

1628
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,880
one of the first lines we were talking

1629
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,119
about is this kind of stewardship of

1630
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,040
global collective behavior

1631
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,280
paper which was kind of uh

1632
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,319
you know

1633
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,319
pulling out the fact that there's no

1634
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,640
ethical or scientific oversight over the

1635
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,960
large platforms and then saying this is

1636
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,119
something like how

1637
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,200
you know how how an oversight might look

1638
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,559
and actually it's more than over there

1639
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,319
right because actually it's even deeper

1640
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,359
than oversight because it's actually

1641
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,599
like you might imagine

1642
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:48,799
this being involved in sort of

1643
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,720
intervention in platforms just being

1644
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,280
able to uh if you have recommendation

1645
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,839
services this could like inform

1646
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,160
uh you know how to update parameters the

1647
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,960
recommendation service based on observed

1648
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,839
behavior of the network uh so yeah

1649
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,520
beyond oversight even sort of like this

1650
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,520
kind of collective decentralized control

1651
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,720
we were alluding to so i think this is

1652
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,720
like a more concrete instance of how

1653
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,720
that might look a very fascinating kind

1654
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,319
of direction a modeling direction that

1655
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,200
people can maybe find interested

1656
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,040
and it also really highlights the

1657
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,520
relevance of a bottom-up agentic

1658
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,160
perspective not just because we then can

1659
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,559
talk about pluralism and diversity of

1660
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,280
perspectives much more easily but even

1661
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,839
the kinds of design

1662
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,440
interventions and suggestions are going

1663
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,960
to be different if we think about this

1664
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,119
from like the top-down

1665
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,440
content depositing

1666
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,520
or the bottom-up approach like imagine

1667
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,599
if we wanted the ants in the colony to

1668
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,280
be in a different location

1669
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,119
and we're putting all these articles in

1670
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,400
one location

1671
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,640
we're making so much amazing content

1672
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,640
promoting this

1673
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,680
idea

1674
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,920
but of course if the entities are not

1675
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,000
navigating to it and reinforcing that

1676
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,079
trail you could spend all the money on

1677
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,920
advertising and it would just dissipate

1678
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,240
as soon as that like life support for

1679
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,480
the trail were gone

1680
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,720
and so when we take that bottom up

1681
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,359
attention-based perspective it really

1682
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,680
puts us like in the view from the inside

1683
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,359
from the participant

1684
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,680
what are they perceiving which is always

1685
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,559
going to be extremely limited

1686
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,720
and then what are they updating their

1687
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,160
beliefs in terms of and then how are

1688
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,440
they choosing to act given the

1689
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,079
affordances they have so the bottom-up

1690
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,880
perspective brings in all these very

1691
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,079
important

1692
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,160
discussions around like accessibility in

1693
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,520
discourse and

1694
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,359
perspective integration

1695
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,200
and then treats it as like something

1696
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,960
that might be addressed

1697
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,520
at the level where it's occurring which

1698
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,400
is at the entity or the actor level

1699
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,599
rather than being like well there's 500

1700
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,240
petabytes of data and this is how much

1701
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,440
the system does on this high level

1702
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,000
those are abstract metrics again with a

1703
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,200
with an economic analogy it'd be like

1704
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,799
macroeconomics and then behavioral and

1705
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,839
like neuro and micro economics

1706
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,079
one can just put piles of product in

1707
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,640
different locations but unless there's

1708
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,720
individuals who are interested in it and

1709
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,000
prefer it and

1710
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,240
allocate their attention to it

1711
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,119
nothing will occur

1712
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,440
maybe another just like to try a

1713
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,799
concrete

1714
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,720
example for that could be

1715
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,280
you know a will brought up this uh

1716
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,799
then the dashboard of the fox news

1717
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,040
versus cnn so you might imagine like you

1718
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,359
know stewards of some futuristic uh

1719
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,839
social network or you know social i look

1720
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,359
at the kind of attention data we're

1721
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,280
talking about collecting here and they

1722
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,799
might be able to through these kind of

1723
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,319
modeling approaches because okay you

1724
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,319
know we what if we want to optimize this

1725
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,920
network uh

1726
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,440
for you know

1727
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,839
rent coverage and like get people to see

1728
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,280
diverse viewpoints and stuff like that

1729
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,359
like how are the which recommendation

1730
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,280
services we use and how should we tune

1731
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,000
them

1732
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
uh yeah and then sort of seeing the

1733
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,760
effect of that and be able to learn how

1734
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,160
to collectively steward

1735
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,000
attention and you know again this open

1736
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,400
source people can participate in it

1737
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,839
yeah in directions that are more healthy

1738
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,799
for society

1739
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,040
one last thought before going to the

1740
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,280
next slide is um

1741
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,160
in the vo traces

1742
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,240
we saw about how what was being

1743
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,440
presented or provided or curated wasn't

1744
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,799
necessarily the granular content so not

1745
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,559
the newsletter that says here's the five

1746
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,640
things you want to look at or hear

1747
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,680
ranked by whatever metric novelty or by

1748
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,680
importance or popularity

1749
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,240
here are the granular atomic pieces of

1750
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,160
content for you to look at

1751
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,680
when we can

1752
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,720
curate

1753
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,760
and in in a consensual way

1754
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,799
determine

1755
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,359
how transitions amongst content

1756
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,960
are coming into play that's like the

1757
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,559
true value okay so you're on the

1758
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,960
wikipedia page for active inference or

1759
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,400
you're on the wikipedia page for some

1760
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,319
historical entity

1761
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,400
maybe that content is just so amazing it

1762
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,640
stands alone but the reality is it's

1763
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,880
part of our epistemic forging our

1764
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,520
learning journeys and so being able to

1765
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,839
connect dots is quite literally

1766
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,839
understanding okay for somebody who is

1767
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,680
in a given context and language

1768
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,960
experience

1769
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,839
this intro to python should link to this

1770
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,839
next resource but then of course there's

1771
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,359
many links so there's no reason to

1772
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,359
collapse that pathway

1773
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,920
to like a hallway

1774
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,920
it kind of respects the actual dynamics

1775
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,160
of the information environment

1776
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,079
in a few interesting ways um let's go to

1777
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,079
the next slide because it it connects

1778
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,000
some more points yeah

1779
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,240
the back ones are backwards or uh

1780
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,799
the forwards

1781
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,200
okay so um in 2021

1782
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,319
with some colleagues i worked on a ant

1783
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,280
colony simulation where the individual

1784
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,400
nest mates were utilizing an active

1785
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,359
inference model of perception cognition

1786
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:58,400
action

1787
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,119
and those actions were spatial movement

1788
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,720
in a tea maze so in a foraging space

1789
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,559
and then one other action that they had

1790
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,040
the opportunity to do upon finding food

1791
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,760
was to deposit pheromone so no pheromone

1792
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,559
was being deposited until the food was

1793
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,119
detected and then upon kind of turning

1794
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,599
around a pheromone deposition occurred

1795
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,839
and it was decaying in the environment

1796
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:22,720
now

1797
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,520
it's a kind of fun link

1798
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,760
to look at the

1799
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,760
place where that

1800
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,799
core

1801
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,520
model of epistemic foraging

1802
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,680
being foraging in a space

1803
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,839
and looking for something seeking for

1804
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,839
something having a preference to find

1805
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,119
something

1806
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,680
that we used in the ant

1807
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,319
spatial foraging case

1808
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,079
for finding the food resource in the

1809
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,119
teammates

1810
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,200
it was adapted from

1811
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,000
a

1812
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,319
earlier slash different paper

1813
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,880
by axel constant at all

1814
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,720
and the paper was acquisition of

1815
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,960
culturally patterned attention styles

1816
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,040
under active inference

1817
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,400
and so the setting is very

1818
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,119
creative and subtle which is that

1819
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,160
there's a tic-tac-toe grid so a three by

1820
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,520
three grid

1821
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,640
that is representing like the visual

1822
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,599
scope

1823
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,319
of someone who's looking at something so

1824
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:21,119
they're

1825
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:21,920
s

1826
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,480
um staring or they're foveating on the

1827
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,400
central point and then they have like a

1828
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,480
limited range of peripheral vision and

1829
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,319
then outside of that there's much less

1830
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,200
visual acuity

1831
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,200
they were involved in an epistemic

1832
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,440
foraging task so

1833
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,079
unlike where in reward learning the

1834
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,640
decisions of where to move and how to

1835
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,400
move might be dictated by what is

1836
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,240
perceived as the most pragmatically

1837
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,319
rewarding state or paths towards

1838
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,079
pragmatic reward

1839
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,480
in this information foraging case

1840
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,359
which has been also um explored a lot of

1841
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,359
other eye movements active inference

1842
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,799
simulations

1843
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,440
it's driven by epistemic foraging

1844
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,559
reducing uncertainty about what kind of

1845
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,880
pattern one is existing in

1846
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,920
and so it's almost like reading braille

1847
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,079
except it's with our eyes because we of

1848
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,359
course don't

1849
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,359
see at the same resolution the whole

1850
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:16,240
page

1851
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,160
at the same time in fact the clarity

1852
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,559
outside of your main visual region and

1853
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,880
the clarity even in your blind spot is

1854
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,119
part of our generative model of vision

1855
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,960
but putting that aside what the entities

1856
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,280
are doing in this

1857
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,240
pottery scanning task

1858
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,280
is actually scanning locally and using

1859
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,440
the local patterns that they're seeing

1860
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,280
with a relationship of like okay is it

1861
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,599
like a line going across or line going

1862
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,760
up or is there a diagonal

1863
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,240
understanding the motifs that they're

1864
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,440
perceiving

1865
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,520
to reduce their uncertainty about what

1866
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,680
kind of pottery they're looking at

1867
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,119
and this

1868
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,720
the only tweak

1869
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,039
main tweak that we had to make

1870
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,039
to bring it into a spatial foraging

1871
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,960
context was thinking okay instead of the

1872
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,920
point

1873
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,400
at the center of the visual gaze

1874
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,720
instead of that just being like the x y

1875
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,400
coordinate of where one is looking at

1876
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,559
we're going to make that the body

1877
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,960
position of the nest mate

1878
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,760
and so visual foraging you can scan and

1879
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,079
you can you can like teleport or move

1880
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,760
very rapidly

1881
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,799
but it doesn't leave a trace

1882
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,559
you could look over something many times

1883
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,039
and it's not going to modify the object

1884
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,200
in the ink case because it's this

1885
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,079
embodied spatial foraging

1886
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,079
they are

1887
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,559
only able to move locally

1888
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,520
and they do under all slash sum

1889
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,039
situations

1890
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,280
physically modify the niche and i think

1891
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,920
it really closes the loop with what

1892
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,480
ronin brought up earlier with like eye

1893
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,599
gaze

1894
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,000
and other brain computer interfaces are

1895
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,200
taking

1896
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,720
invisible

1897
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,720
stigmergic markers

1898
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,079
of attention

1899
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,880
and making them into visible markers

1900
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,640
like heat gaze

1901
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,960
analysis or heat maps of gaze not sure

1902
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,960
what they call it it is often used like

1903
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,400
in advertising

1904
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,640
um where people might present two

1905
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,280
versions of a page or a product and see

1906
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,280
where people are looking in terms of the

1907
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,480
label and other features

1908
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,200
do we have or use that kind of approach

1909
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
for education

1910
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,480
do we proactively use it do people field

1911
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,079
test different layouts of papers

1912
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,240
so that's an interesting thought and um

1913
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,440
oh yeah

1914
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,440
i just want to

1915
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,680
yeah i definitely feel like uh the whole

1916
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,440
i was thinking just like um

1917
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,240
yeah i feel like a whole new sort of

1918
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,359
yeah field of epistemic engineering for

1919
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,280
like there's so many

1920
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,119
both like them you know fury engineering

1921
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,720
yeah practice they're all at all

1922
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,319
different levels there's just like

1923
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,599
yeah it's like

1924
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,640
pretty wide blue motion space

1925
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,319
for different kind of techniques

1926
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:05,839
modeling this is really cool i like how

1927
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:06,839
you bridge

1928
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,039
between sites like the site where we

1929
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,960
have here like the affiliation and the

1930
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,400
ant movement like it's really

1931
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,000
interesting like how and each hand is

1932
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,760
sort of like a sensor of the collective

1933
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,680
organism

1934
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,640
so

1935
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,839
yeah it almost felt like what we're

1936
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,680
trying to build and for social networks

1937
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,640
kind of like

1938
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,359
we're trying to build like a seismograph

1939
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,520
or something like that like uh

1940
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,750
epidemic seismograph

1941
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:31,440
[Music]

1942
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,039
yeah by using making this kind of what

1943
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,079
you're saying the individuals

1944
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,799
or another kind of visual mixed metaphor

1945
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,640
if there's a top-down

1946
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,799
attention determiner

1947
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,200
it's like the eye of mordor in lord of

1948
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,839
the rings it's like a laser that's like

1949
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,079
leaving like a a

1950
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,200
a scar

1951
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,640
where it's scanning so it could be

1952
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,880
modifying the environment or not but

1953
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,520
it's like one strong laser

1954
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,680
versus like seeing as like many

1955
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,520
distributed eyes

1956
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,760
that are in local feedback loops so

1957
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,960
their

1958
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,880
cognitive burden if we think about the

1959
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,400
actual biology of it or their

1960
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,160
computational burden

1961
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,240
if we think about simulating this system

1962
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,280
would be lower and more paralyzable

1963
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,359
and wouldn't require any entity to have

1964
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,039
access to information that we know it

1965
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:23,599
can't have like how do people interact

1966
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,760
with markets well they don't have the

1967
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,160
time series data from the last 10 years

1968
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,359
loaded into memory but the analyst might

1969
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,599
but the individual is actually on this

1970
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,520
journey seeing random things from

1971
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,319
different times and so if we wanted to

1972
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:39,839
understand decision making in that

1973
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,240
setting we would want to be taking or at

1974
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,480
least complementing the top down with a

1975
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,760
bottom-up view and so it's the case in

1976
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,960
economics

1977
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,799
and it's also the case in our epistemic

1978
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,880
environments

1979
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,250
though those are um

1980
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,680
[Music]

1981
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,000
corralled in a way that keeps the

1982
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,240
discourse

1983
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,520
on certain

1984
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,760
areas

1985
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,799
yeah i

1986
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,000
well we kind of talked about a little

1987
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,359
before i feel like this there's another

1988
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,079
whole wrap hole to talk about how

1989
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,760
this kind of uh

1990
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,039
how much you want to bring in this sort

1991
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,119
of machine aided decision making because

1992
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,039
we understand that like humans like on

1993
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,400
one side i really i can see where you're

1994
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,680
going with like the sort of how local

1995
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,200
agents are making sense of local

1996
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,640
environments that's sort of creating

1997
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,079
this global more global trends making uh

1998
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:29,839
but then i know we also know that humans

1999
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:30,880
like when

2000
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,640
when we choose for example you know what

2001
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,079
path from this like social view we're

2002
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:36,000
eventually we're going to use ai to sort

2003
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,839
of integrate histories of people that

2004
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,839
have traversed those paths besides you

2005
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,319
know here suggest like a few to go on so

2006
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,079
i think that's just the delicate uh

2007
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:45,359
balance between

2008
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,040
maintaining human agency and

2009
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,319
[Music]

2010
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,760
interpretability that like know what

2011
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:50,720
they're doing they're not just like

2012
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,400
following blind visa instructions from

2013
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,599
algorithms

2014
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,160
versus really needing algorithms to make

2015
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,839
sense to crunch the data

2016
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,680
but doing it in a way it doesn't sort of

2017
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,640
uh

2018
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,480
i think that i've heard it's called like

2019
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,640
yeah algorithms that disintermediate

2020
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,319
humans i think it's kind of like the

2021
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:07,839
human is like a peripheral part of the

2022
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:10,880
sense the sense making good

2023
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,880
yeah there's definitely like a delicate

2024
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,079
block to

2025
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,039
walk there

2026
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:15,839
uh

2027
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:17,120
yeah

2028
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,479
let's go

2029
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,319
let's go to the first um active

2030
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,839
inference slide and then so we have kind

2031
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:24,319
of two slides of general questions to

2032
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:25,198
raise

2033
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:26,399
some of them

2034
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,479
to to

2035
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,640
bring us out from those more specific

2036
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,679
examples

2037
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,759
some general active inference questions

2038
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,600
and then we can um

2039
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,799
close with the open challenges

2040
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,120
so just the first one was what is

2041
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,520
attention in active inference and how is

2042
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,439
it being used because there's a

2043
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,000
technical usage of attention that's

2044
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,439
common in bayesian statistics like you

2045
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:52,960
could hear about a neural network with

2046
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,279
an attention module or even a simpler

2047
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,040
kind of model with attention as a

2048
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,080
parameter and it relates to how much new

2049
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,960
observations are updating your priors so

2050
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,479
if you have no attention on an

2051
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,399
observation it's not updating your

2052
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:07,439
priors

2053
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:08,880
so that is equivalent to not paying

2054
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,920
attention it's like there's things

2055
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,279
you're not seeing behind you you're not

2056
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,479
paying any attention they're not being

2057
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,279
used up to your priors whereas if you're

2058
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,080
super paying attention to something

2059
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,920
then you're going to be updating your

2060
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,640
priors to its location or what it's um

2061
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,960
telling you so where have we seen that

2062
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,560
kind of motif

2063
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,238
in active inference

2064
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:29,759
and how did it play a role in the

2065
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,080
alberosen at all paper and how does it

2066
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:32,960
play a role in these kinds of

2067
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,880
simulations

2068
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,198
second questions like a very

2069
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,679
general question that we ask all the

2070
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,600
time which is just where and how is

2071
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,080
active inference being applied are those

2072
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,759
conceptual or schematic simulations or

2073
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,238
are these real-time data processing

2074
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,960
systems which almost inevitably are

2075
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,120
going to require

2076
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,640
technical solutions that aren't like

2077
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,679
just

2078
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,960
the active inference entity loop that's

2079
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,400
kind of like the kernel

2080
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,400
but then there's a technological system

2081
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,920
that uses the kernel just like the

2082
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,199
linear model kernel like y equals mx

2083
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,719
plus b

2084
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,960
that is so simple can be written down

2085
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,360
yet in practice there needs to be a lot

2086
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,679
of architecture and multilinear

2087
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,440
aggressions and so on so this is a

2088
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,760
different kernel for modeling this kind

2089
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,159
of an active situation

2090
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,000
and also the systems need to have more

2091
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,080
than just an insightful kernel

2092
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,280
to be of any utility let alone function

2093
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,320
um

2094
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,880
the third point we recently had a

2095
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,280
symposium on active inference and

2096
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,840
robotics where we had about uh nine

2097
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,040
presenters who share different work

2098
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,679
that is involving

2099
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,080
the realization of robotic systems

2100
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,719
implementing active inference and

2101
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,040
to see the kinds of uh topics that they

2102
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,880
were bringing to the front like

2103
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,040
affective robotics robots that are

2104
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,159
dealing with us as affective entities

2105
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,159
but also robots that even have

2106
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,320
computational

2107
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,840
emulations of affect like what if a

2108
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,239
robot could have a frustration parameter

2109
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,360
but it used that to not go down a road

2110
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,000
that it wasn't really finding value in

2111
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,760
for example or boredom if the

2112
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,600
information wasn't good or excitement if

2113
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,400
it were good so those kinds of affects

2114
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,120
have a technical and computational usage

2115
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,960
in active inference models

2116
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,440
and then i think the the last question

2117
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,920
that brings us to

2118
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,000
the more open questions and a lot of the

2119
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,640
other threads that our co-authors have

2120
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,480
been bringing in

2121
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,239
is like where is design in this and

2122
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,080
humor human-centered

2123
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,559
design

2124
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,159
graphical design and the user interface

2125
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:53,040
but

2126
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,400
taking that as like the tip of the

2127
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,679
iceberg

2128
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,280
and how do we bring in

2129
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,199
proactive

2130
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:04,640
thinking around what kinds of systems

2131
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,679
and experiences that are to be curated

2132
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,040
how does that design thinking

2133
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,600
[Music]

2134
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,239
meld with cognitive science

2135
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:17,678
in a positive way

2136
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,080
cool yeah i

2137
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,600
one thing you mentioned i think this was

2138
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,640
in the beginning when we started working

2139
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,560
on this research

2140
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,840
you asked this question it kind of stuck

2141
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,080
with me you said something about like

2142
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,840
yeah we have

2143
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,040
like what are we doing with all the

2144
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,239
cognitive science theories if we're not

2145
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:33,840
using them like

2146
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,360
like you're saying that effect it's like

2147
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,800
yeah they're not

2148
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,920
we're not

2149
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,520
implementing the theories in practice

2150
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,960
like often when they're building

2151
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,000
products

2152
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,800
so

2153
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,520
it seems yeah this seems like a really

2154
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,159
interesting kind of theory

2155
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,120
integrating with practice to build yeah

2156
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,960
information landscapes uh yeah very very

2157
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,360
i think cognizant has a lot to say

2158
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,480
here

2159
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,560
i'm excited to see how this gets kind of

2160
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,760
integrated

2161
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,920
i like how it kind of gets gets a little

2162
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,679
uh meta too so

2163
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:06,800
you have

2164
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,640
i i like what you said earlier you said

2165
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,199
epistemic engineering i would

2166
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,120
i'm i'm kind of inclined to reframe it

2167
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,840
as like epistemic design epistemic

2168
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,280
environment design in which

2169
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,320
agents are using their understanding of

2170
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,440
active inference to develop systems

2171
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,880
that allow individuals to

2172
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,800
interact with the world in a way that's

2173
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,880
used as active inference so it's sort of

2174
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,719
like and i mean that's kind of what um

2175
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,880
i believe that i've heard it phrased as

2176
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,560
active open-mindedness that's a sort of

2177
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,120
like self reflection it's this this

2178
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,199
ability to evaluate your own cognitive

2179
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,800
processes update your models and your

2180
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,880
own cognitive processes in ways that

2181
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,960
allow you to interact with other

2182
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,360
external information so that you can

2183
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,719
continue to update your models where

2184
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,320
they might otherwise become entrenched

2185
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,280
in overconfidence and confirmation bias

2186
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,960
and whatnot and this is kind of taking

2187
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,600
it out of that individualistic paradigm

2188
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,520
and applying it in a collective paradigm

2189
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,280
where you're you're by designing uh

2190
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,239
ecosystems epistemic ecosystems that

2191
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,560
allow people to best leverage those

2192
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,000
innate qualities without even thinking

2193
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,040
about it

2194
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,840
um we're kind of

2195
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,840
reaping the same benefit

2196
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,159
to some extent that people would gain

2197
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:28,080
from like deep um somewhat critical or

2198
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,199
at least

2199
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,519
um

2200
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,560
humble and skeptical introspection

2201
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,320
um

2202
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,320
which is active inference applied to

2203
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,719
itself in a sense

2204
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:44,640
yeah i yeah maybe maybe

2205
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,840
it is pretty meta which i think is

2206
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,800
really cool and i just maybe maybe

2207
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,960
uh try to connect it to some things

2208
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,840
people might be familiar with i think

2209
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:55,600
tristan harris often speaks about like

2210
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,239
the sort of current technology which is

2211
01:14:58,239 --> 01:14:59,840
sort of race to the bottom that it keeps

2212
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,640
like if it it sort of thrives on

2213
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,760
exploiting

2214
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,520
our different vulnerabilities cognitive

2215
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,679
vulnerabilities um

2216
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,440
and profiting off those but at this sort

2217
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,040
of the externality is that you know

2218
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,920
we're degrading human cognition

2219
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,159
here this really i feel like we're in

2220
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,840
this sort of trying to be in the space

2221
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,560
of

2222
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,880
race to the top which is another

2223
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,480
kind of thing that tristan harris i've

2224
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,799
heard him

2225
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,880
yeah trying to think about technology

2226
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,400
the way that yeah it's actually making

2227
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,960
us more open-minded more attuned to sort

2228
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,120
of our space and the collective like

2229
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,960
where we're repeating like collective

2230
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,719
stance making and yeah i feel like it's

2231
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,040
really racing how do we get people

2232
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,400
how do we build technology to make

2233
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,960
people more yeah critically reflective

2234
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,600
and open-minded all those things

2235
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,120
and we have to apply those principles to

2236
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,719
do it we have to understand those things

2237
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,840
we have to know what

2238
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:50,960
means help bring it about yeah that's

2239
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,920
build technology open-mindedness

2240
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,320
the meta

2241
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,640
maybe a last active comment which will

2242
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,040
go to our last slide is like will what

2243
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,880
you mentioned with uh active

2244
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,719
open-mindedness which is surely a term

2245
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:07,360
that preceded active inference

2246
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,640
but

2247
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,960
it it force ages

2248
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,080
that

2249
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,239
active engagement

2250
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:17,199
and then the dilemma or tension or

2251
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,679
dialectic between like what we bring to

2252
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:20,960
the table

2253
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,760
and then what the table

2254
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,199
is providing to us and so if it were um

2255
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:28,960
some other kind of product design we're

2256
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,360
making a soft drink

2257
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,239
are we gonna barge in with assumptions

2258
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:35,760
and then what are the danger modes of

2259
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,520
that but also what is the danger of just

2260
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,360
what every single person tells you

2261
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,040
putting too much attention

2262
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,920
on the specifics overfitting to those 20

2263
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,760
people and making some kind of like

2264
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,159
chimera that only appeals to them and

2265
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:49,600
that would be one thing

2266
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,840
in the food engineering and food design

2267
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,719
case

2268
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,040
but this is the leverage point

2269
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,520
on digital communication

2270
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,840
and so it becomes even more

2271
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,440
of

2272
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,880
immediacy

2273
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,560
because this is like the coefficient on

2274
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,800
how we communicate and share and learn

2275
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,239
nowadays

2276
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:11,040
and also like puts in these higher order

2277
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,719
questions like we were talking about

2278
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,159
earlier which is there's always going to

2279
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:17,440
be an argument for centralization and

2280
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,040
that's not to say that one extreme is

2281
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,560
better than other it's always contextual

2282
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,040
but there always is an argument to just

2283
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,360
do it faster internally

2284
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,840
rather than potentially avert

2285
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,360
a deeper

2286
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,120
failure mode

2287
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,040
but there are other challenges arising

2288
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,440
with decentralized systems so

2289
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,360
there's no

2290
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,920
generalized free lunch

2291
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,360
but then the question could be like but

2292
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,320
could there be information environments

2293
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,400
and regimes of action and regimes of

2294
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,440
attention

2295
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,159
that are consensual and also productive

2296
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,320
and so on so i agree it's been an

2297
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,600
awesome um

2298
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,920
and and to bring in will with yours and

2299
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,040
lauren's

2300
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,120
experience on design

2301
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,000
and seeing design

2302
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,120
as like

2303
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,719
almost

2304
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,480
the art and science and practice of

2305
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,640
bringing the counter factual and the

2306
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,120
adjacent possible

2307
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,239
via

2308
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,480
inference into

2309
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,760
something that

2310
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,159
is implemented so i i think there's a

2311
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,000
lot to connect there

2312
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,320
so maybe let's go to our last um slide

2313
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,560
and then if anybody in the live chat has

2314
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,800
any thoughts or questions

2315
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,120
otherwise um ronan looking forward to

2316
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,679
hearing these

2317
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,440
yeah just stamps yeah episodic design

2318
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,719
you feel like there's the whole like

2319
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,480
full stack episodes like there's design

2320
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,239
engineering all the

2321
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:47,360
and in between um but yeah so we were

2322
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,719
talking about you know some of the sort

2323
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,120
of trade-offs between the things

2324
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,040
yeah where we are now and you know

2325
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,400
centralized systems and decentralized

2326
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,520
systems

2327
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,199
there are a lot of open challenges here

2328
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,560
uh some of them we kind of already

2329
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,480
talked about so i'll go through them but

2330
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,760
uh

2331
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,199
yeah and just kind of finish on some of

2332
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,600
these things that we're looking at i was

2333
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,880
trying to make progress with our

2334
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,719
research proposal and development and

2335
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:09,600
all that

2336
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,960
um

2337
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,960
so yeah i think

2338
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,679
you know one thing is definitely that

2339
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:16,400
we're

2340
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,040
in sort of what can we do right now to

2341
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,360
help uh clean up our information systems

2342
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,800
given that you know many of these tools

2343
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,880
don't exist yet and they're sort of

2344
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,159
i guess a lot of people would say these

2345
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:27,840
are like

2346
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,600
it could be a decade-long project to

2347
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,800
build these kind of interoperable

2348
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,199
protocols um

2349
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:35,280
so yeah where what do we do right now i

2350
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,719
think yeah if anyone has thoughts on

2351
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:38,400
that

2352
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,000
if we're going to raise those otherwise

2353
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,040
you can just i'll run through them all

2354
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,480
if you have thoughts you can go back to

2355
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,560
it um

2356
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,360
yeah i think there's this kind of

2357
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,800
you know we talked about

2358
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,040
a few times during the conversation you

2359
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,480
have this kind of user which is the

2360
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,800
local minima of convenience so users are

2361
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,080
just like they're getting used and

2362
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,600
they're using software but but it's

2363
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,199
really like this kind of very convenient

2364
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,280
local minima and get stuck in it how do

2365
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,040
you transition towards more active

2366
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,600
sensitive role uh there's a lot of sort

2367
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,600
of culture and norms and

2368
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,440
social aspects here that we can

2369
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,639
definitely also

2370
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,760
dive deeper into but yeah

2371
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,360
probably have future conversations with

2372
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,040
that um

2373
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,880
and yeah there's no the protocol problem

2374
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,080
which we're uh mindful of where this is

2375
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,800
i think best express but it's xkcd comic

2376
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,960
you know you have some kind of

2377
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,639
uh situation where you want to introduce

2378
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,040
the new standard but they're

2379
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:31,840
then you already standard

2380
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,199
try to generalize everyone else's

2381
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:34,800
protocols and now they're like shifting

2382
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,880
protocols and you're stuck in the same

2383
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,000
situation

2384
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,679
um

2385
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,600
yeah this is a problem i don't know any

2386
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,600
of you like really great results i mean

2387
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,000
i'm not aware of so many success stories

2388
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,719
here so it is clear we have like

2389
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,080
a challenge uh facing us but um

2390
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,000
on the other hand web 3 seems to be all

2391
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,400
about tackling this protocol so we feel

2392
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,320
like we're

2393
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,719
yeah in good company at least

2394
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,440
thinking about this

2395
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,840
yeah

2396
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,960
will you want to add something or

2397
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,679
uh yeah one of the things i love the

2398
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,199
um

2399
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,679
second one um and i think one of the

2400
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,040
things that

2401
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,120
resonates with me is i think it speaks

2402
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,639
to one of the original explicit goals of

2403
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,320
vo which is

2404
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,400
like obviously this is a huge problem

2405
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,600
and one of the things we were trying to

2406
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,679
do in designing that interface is to

2407
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,840
make it as convenient as possible to be

2408
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,239
an active sensemaker

2409
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,440
and

2410
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,440
largely this is driven by by my own

2411
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,360
research process i have

2412
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,760
adhd i have a very hard time getting

2413
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,600
through uh research paper so i was

2414
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,400
actually

2415
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,080
like we were trying to find a way to

2416
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:46,960
make

2417
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,040
going through this process that seems

2418
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,440
really overwhelming to some people

2419
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,880
including myself

2420
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,480
um a lot more convenient but a lot more

2421
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,960
simple and taking a lot of that like the

2422
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,639
labor burden off so that um like the

2423
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:04,000
person's mind is free to think and

2424
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,760
record and doesn't have to actually

2425
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,159
manage like really what is a fairly

2426
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,639
sophisticated process

2427
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,760
for people who i mean both of you are

2428
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,199
you know

2429
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,600
seasoned academics you you know that

2430
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,760
it's not a trivial skill to be able to

2431
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,320
to go through loads of information and

2432
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,080
extract what's meaningful and figure out

2433
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,239
where you need to delve into new um

2434
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,000
arenas and

2435
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,199
if you can make

2436
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,840
that process that requires a lot of

2437
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,400
discipline and planning and structures

2438
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,199
and

2439
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,199
um whatnot if you can make that very

2440
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,040
convenient then all of a sudden you can

2441
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,840
just think about the thing think about

2442
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,360
the information and the ideas that are

2443
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,880
in the information so

2444
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,400
um

2445
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,280
of course

2446
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,960
we don't have that tool yet so what can

2447
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,600
we do right now

2448
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,560
nice thanks will just a few other um

2449
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,040
comments the interoperability

2450
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,159
we brought up earlier um the content is

2451
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,880
often highly interoperable today

2452
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,239
like whether you can download it

2453
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:09,040
directly or right click save or use obs

2454
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,840
to screencap pretty much any content can

2455
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,320
be delivered on another platform you can

2456
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,320
share text or an image you found on one

2457
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,520
location to another so in many ways

2458
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,120
amidst the platforms jumping from

2459
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,360
platform to platform we have

2460
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,440
interoperable content because we have

2461
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,480
like file types for content jpeg

2462
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,280
um

2463
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,560
and

2464
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,760
running you highlighted the

2465
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,280
interoperability

2466
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,000
of these attention markers the ones that

2467
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,560
we have today the the likes and so on

2468
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,480
but then the ones that we could have

2469
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,639
tomorrow with all these other kinds of

2470
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:43,760
interfaces

2471
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,880
and then i um wondered well where are we

2472
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,840
at with financial interoperability

2473
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,960
is there

2474
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,159
a way for even this one special kind of

2475
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:55,120
data

2476
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,040
like a ledger

2477
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,440
or some kind of bookkeeping

2478
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,800
what are the interoperability mechanisms

2479
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,800
that exist for financial data and then

2480
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,880
would the knowledge case

2481
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,480
be easier or harder

2482
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,719
and then what happened this um 14 and

2483
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:15,679
then going to 15

2484
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:18,800
so how does the financial

2485
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,080
information stay coherent with markets

2486
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,239
there isn't an interoperability layer

2487
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,400
necessarily directly

2488
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,760
between

2489
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,679
two currencies

2490
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,400
but then there are different kinds of

2491
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,719
intermediators

2492
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:37,840
who can be clear or obscure

2493
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,239
with why they're providing some kind of

2494
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,000
exchange and so i think that points to

2495
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,480
like information exchanges

2496
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,880
before some kind of sweeping

2497
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,840
knowledge generalization synthesis

2498
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,320
like a future knowledge protocol

2499
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,639
there would be many options

2500
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:57,040
for just like the apis

2501
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,239
and the kind of web scraping and

2502
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,880
re-parsing techniques exist today to to

2503
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,880
act as markets

2504
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,880
that help swap

2505
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,719
different information

2506
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,760
um and then one other point to make was

2507
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,400
we

2508
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,239
talked also about like what is opaque

2509
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,239
and what is transparent

2510
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:18,000
and in some earlier

2511
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,880
uh

2512
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,639
active streams actually on like

2513
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,080
consciousness and attention and

2514
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,920
awareness we had an interesting

2515
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,080
discussion around transparency and

2516
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,600
opaque

2517
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,600
a transparent

2518
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,400
thing is something that you can't see

2519
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,400
you see through it because you can't see

2520
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,120
it

2521
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,040
something that's opaque

2522
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,320
you do see

2523
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:41,120
because you can't see through it

2524
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,840
so what aspects of the system

2525
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,719
should be transparent

2526
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,080
which isn't to say

2527
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,760
we could investigate the source code

2528
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,239
because that would actually be opacity

2529
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:53,440
and one could say well it's fully

2530
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,400
documented totally comprehensive opacity

2531
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,840
well that's great

2532
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,440
but what are the parts of the system

2533
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,360
that are transparent like the water we

2534
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,040
swim in

2535
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,159
that would be

2536
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,080
not visible

2537
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,920
and then what are the parts of the

2538
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,320
system where people would see them and

2539
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,080
know them

2540
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,280
and those would be opaque

2541
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,600
yeah that's been awesome but like that's

2542
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,239
a

2543
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,360
kind of mind-blowing thought um i

2544
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,800
yeah that kind of brings to mind you

2545
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,960
know little distinction

2546
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,080
on

2547
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,840
making like convenience isn't always i

2548
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,960
was treating it here as sort of

2549
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,800
something that's kind of cursed but he

2550
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,320
was saying it can also be

2551
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,600
a

2552
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,239
doom or benefit uh the right thing is

2553
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:37,840
made convenient and it kind of seems

2554
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,840
like what you're saying also is

2555
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,600
we need to make the right things like

2556
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,440
just like you know the interface like a

2557
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,639
cell phone you know the right things

2558
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:45,679
that are opaque and the right things are

2559
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,360
transparent where the importance is for

2560
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,880
controlling it the relevant affordances

2561
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,080
for controlling it are the ones that you

2562
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:50,960
see

2563
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,239
the ones you don't need to see you don't

2564
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:53,360
see so

2565
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,040
yeah probably something like that it

2566
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,560
seems like like again

2567
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,800
design how to make uh information

2568
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,880
landscapes that sort of show you the

2569
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,440
right levers and

2570
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,199
obscure the things you don't need to see

2571
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:07,600
so you can not get overwhelmed

2572
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,199
and probably being able to end this kind

2573
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:10,719
of openness you know the open source

2574
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:12,159
quality of them means that different

2575
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:13,760
people will want different levels so

2576
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,000
some people really want to play with the

2577
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,199
nuts and bolts and other people just

2578
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:18,960
want to like have like simple interfaces

2579
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,440
but allowing all that span of

2580
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,400
uh

2581
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,480
of interfaces i think is part of the

2582
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,320
yeah yeah it's just not like this kind

2583
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,080
of plurality aspect you were talking

2584
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,600
about i think it's really important that

2585
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,560
different people will see different

2586
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,800
interfaces based on liquids what's best

2587
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,120
for them

2588
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,400
that's one of the biggest advantages of

2589
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,800
having this interoperability is now we

2590
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,280
have an opportunity to take what is

2591
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,880
ultimately the same data set and

2592
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,320
make

2593
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,320
interfaces make

2594
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,560
end user applications

2595
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,840
that are tailored to particular needs or

2596
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:00,000
people or use cases or accessibility um

2597
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,679
needs and whatnot

2598
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:02,800
so that

2599
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,280
really niche groups of people can

2600
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,400
interact on this broad scale in a way

2601
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,360
that specifically suits them that can't

2602
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,760
be accommodated with a platform or with

2603
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,080
like kind of a one-size-fits-all

2604
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,560
approach to um

2605
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,560
manipulating with engaging with

2606
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,400
interacting with this data this

2607
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,599
information information

2608
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,040
yeah one quick comment on the

2609
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,719
accessibility because i think it it

2610
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,000
really

2611
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,520
distinguishes

2612
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,880
the uh semi tectonic the building like

2613
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,280
stigma g from the attention like stigma

2614
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,639
g so

2615
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,719
content accessibility

2616
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,880
is the prerequisite

2617
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,400
for there to be

2618
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,000
the trail

2619
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,880
content accessibility could include like

2620
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,600
screen reader affordances changing the

2621
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,280
font size changing the colors um making

2622
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,280
sure that just like the open science

2623
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,040
movement has been highlighting like that

2624
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,719
the content quite literally is

2625
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,760
accessible in any form let alone one

2626
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,199
that accounts for like sensory

2627
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,120
differences but just making the content

2628
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
available

2629
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,800
has to be a first step

2630
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,840
and then

2631
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:14,960
what does

2632
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,000
attention accessibility look like

2633
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,080
so like if previously it was like we

2634
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,679
need that pdf

2635
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:23,280
accessible

2636
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,920
not behind a paywall okay

2637
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,760
content accessibility with preprint

2638
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,760
servers

2639
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,840
to a large extent in the scientific

2640
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,880
domain just speaking narrowly like that

2641
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,120
content is accessible

2642
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:40,480
and then what are all the trails

2643
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,520
that go from this one pre-print

2644
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,840
website and pdf

2645
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,320
and the way that these 700 people had

2646
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,159
these thoughts and these 300 people had

2647
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,480
these thoughts

2648
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,440
that's

2649
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,679
that transition amongst different

2650
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,040
content

2651
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,000
and giving visibility

2652
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,679
to that content

2653
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:04,960
because that content is being recorded

2654
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,760
and it is being used to shape attention

2655
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,719
but through this covert

2656
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:11,760
platform-owned loop

2657
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,440
rather than

2658
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,920
us being able to like be like

2659
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,760
i want to publicly add this comment on

2660
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,040
the paper

2661
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,960
and then this is just i want this to be

2662
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,800
only in my private information or

2663
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,120
something like that um but i think that

2664
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,960
really like highlights that

2665
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,280
accessibility isn't just the font size

2666
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,560
genre

2667
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,920
there's another

2668
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,280
connecting the dots kind of

2669
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,960
accessibility

2670
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,040
that doesn't exist

2671
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,199
even like on the radar

2672
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,560
because it feels like well what do you

2673
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,239
need to understand the scientific paper

2674
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:44,159
beyond having access to the pdf it's

2675
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,639
like you need like everything

2676
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,120
and now that can be a a clearer

2677
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,880
conversation

2678
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,760
yeah yeah i love that acceptability is

2679
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,960
broader than just the content

2680
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,040
acceptability to the reactions

2681
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,760
of people the content

2682
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,960
yeah

2683
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,920
well any other like thoughts or

2684
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,159
directions or information you want to

2685
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:09,759
share feel free to go for it

2686
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,600
yeah this was great i mean just

2687
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,600
really it's fun to dive into all these

2688
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:16,560
things

2689
