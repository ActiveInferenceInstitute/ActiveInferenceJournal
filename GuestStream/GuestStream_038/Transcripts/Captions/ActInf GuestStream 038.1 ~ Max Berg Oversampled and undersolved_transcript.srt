1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,703
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:10,197
It's March 9, 2023.

3
00:00:08,152 --> 00:00:16,736
We're in ActInf GuestStream number 38.1

4
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:16,736
here with Max Berg.

5
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:18,939
Thank you, Max, for joining.

6
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:19,076
This is going to be great.

7
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:23,432
Really looking forward to your

8
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:23,432
presentation and discussion.

9
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:28,940
So appreciation again for joining and

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:28,940
looking forward to what you'll share with

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:28,940
us today.

12
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:34,594
Max: Yes, thank you, Daniel, for having

13
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:34,594
me. As I was introduced,

14
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:36,706
my name is Max Berg.

15
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:41,259
I come from the University of Marburg and

16
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:41,259
I'm a clinical psychologist.

17
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:44,548
I want to do a little bit of impression

18
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:44,548
management first.

19
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:49,006
So Marburg is next to Frankfurt, in case

20
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:49,006
you don't know.

21
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:52,392
It's a small or medium city in Germany.

22
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:59,092
And regarding me, I'm interested in the

23
00:00:59,092 --> 00:00:59,092
intersection of clinical psychology,

24
00:00:59,092 --> 00:00:59,092
neuroscience and philosophy.

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:02,785
That doesn't mean that I'm an expert in

26
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:02,785
all of these fields.

27
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:10,562
Of course, I have a lot of knowledge in

28
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:10,562
clinical psychology, I would say, and the

29
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:10,562
rest is more of my hobbies.

30
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:15,071
And so it's important that you keep in

31
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:15,071
mind to expect a clinical perspective

32
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:15,071
today.

33
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm not an expert on Bayesian mathematics

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:21,600
or anything like that.

35
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:26,172
I know a little bit about it and I've

36
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:26,172
read books about it and try to keep

37
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:26,172
myself updated.

38
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:27,287
But it's not my expertise.

39
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:29,483
My expertise is clinical psychology.

40
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:36,156
And what I want to present today is like

41
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:36,156
a paper about depressive rumination.

42
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:41,661
But we will see that it's not important

43
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:41,661
that it's depressive rumination.

44
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:56,117
And rumination is a much broader

45
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:56,117
construct here and we want to rephrase,

46
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:56,117
like depressive rumination from active

47
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:56,117
inference lab perspective.

48
00:01:41,675 --> 00:02:00,091
And this is what we want to talk about

49
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:00,091
today.

50
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:06,153
I want to start with a little quote.

51
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:09,182
And it's romantic is the coin of my

52
00:02:09,182 --> 00:02:09,182
realm.

53
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:12,211
Interiority breeds interiority.

54
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:16,256
And we will see that this might be

55
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:16,256
literary true.

56
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:19,283
And this is why I think it's a good quote

57
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:19,283
to start with.

58
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:21,303
So what is rumination?

59
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:33,422
It is defined by the APA as obsessional

60
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:33,422
thinking involving excessive repetitive

61
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:33,422
thoughts or themes that interfere with

62
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:33,422
other forms of mental activity.

63
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:38,475
It is a common feature of OCD and

64
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:38,475
generalized anxiety disorder.

65
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:43,527
I actually don't know why these two

66
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:43,527
disorders were chosen first, but well,

67
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:43,527
here we go.

68
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:45,545
I just quoted them here.

69
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:55,641
I would add a major depression to the

70
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:55,641
list, and at least in my mind, major

71
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:55,641
depression is the prototype disorder for

72
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:55,641
rumination.

73
00:02:45,546 --> 00:03:01,648
But sure, OCD and generalized anxiety

74
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:01,648
disorder also has a lot of rumination

75
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:01,648
going on.

76
00:02:55,641 --> 00:03:08,714
And here you can see a first really

77
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:08,714
important point, namely that Rumination

78
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:08,714
is a transdiagnostic marker.

79
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,720
Right.

80
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:14,770
It's important for multiple psychiatric

81
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:14,770
conditions.

82
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:28,918
And yeah, as such, it's an important

83
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:28,918
transdiagnostic risk factor and it can

84
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:28,918
predict, actually depression scores and

85
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:28,918
subsequent measurement time points.

86
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:31,940
And this is what makes it interesting.

87
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:46,092
There was like a grant, a small grant

88
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:46,092
proposal by, I believe, the Wellcome

89
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:46,092
Trust in the UK where they gave grants

90
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:46,092
for writing systematic reviews about

91
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:46,092
transdiagnostic topics in mental health.

92
00:03:31,942 --> 00:04:08,254
And unsurprisingly rumination is one of

93
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:08,254
the topics where they gave or where they

94
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:08,254
wanted to have systematic reviews for

95
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:08,254
which they can see that it's an important

96
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:08,254
topic where people really believe that it

97
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:08,254
has some utility, clinical utility.

98
00:03:46,093 --> 00:04:19,360
And unfortunately it is also the case

99
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,360
that it's associated with worse treatment

100
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,360
response for psychotherapy and also for

101
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,360
medication treatment.

102
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:25,424
Yeah, and let's make it more complicated,

103
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:25,424
shall we?

104
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:33,508
The rumination is sometimes used

105
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:33,508
interchangeably with the concept of

106
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:33,508
repetitive negative thinking.

107
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:39,562
And sometimes repetitive negative

108
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:39,562
thinking means rumination and various

109
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:39,562
varying.

110
00:04:34,512 --> 00:04:45,622
But we will use the definition of

111
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:45,622
rumination in its broader sense today.

112
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:50,670
So when I talk about rumination I also

113
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:50,670
mean varying some of the time.

114
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:56,737
I just wanted to make this clear at the

115
00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:56,737
beginning so I use it in the older

116
00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:56,737
broader sense.

117
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:59,769
So to say yes.

118
00:04:56,737 --> 00:05:06,770
So why would we need a new concept for

119
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:06,770
rumination?

120
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:14,857
Well, reinforcement learning, I would say

121
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:14,857
reinforce struggles to explain the

122
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:14,857
constant continuation of ruminative

123
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:14,857
thinking.

124
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:27,983
To make it short, why should you continue

125
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:27,983
with doing something that is not giving

126
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:27,983
you like pleasure or any good feelings in

127
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:27,983
the short or the long run?

128
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:37,079
Why is something continued despite not

129
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,079
promoting action and also leading to

130
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,079
depressed mood?

131
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:38,092
This is a question at hand.

132
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,123
It's not an easy question to answer, I

133
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:41,123
would say.

134
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:58,290
And this is why we would say that we have

135
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,290
to not only take exploitation learning

136
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,290
into account but also take exploration

137
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,290
learning or surprise reducing learning or

138
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,290
free energy minimization into account,

139
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,290
however you want to call it.

140
00:05:41,126 --> 00:06:14,399
The important part is you have to take

141
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:14,399
into account that not all learning is

142
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:14,399
done in the sense of like reinforcement

143
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:14,399
learning but there's also learning that

144
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:14,399
we do to know more about the world.

145
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:20,458
And if this goes wrong, rumination can

146
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:20,458
occur and this is how we want to rephrase

147
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:20,458
it today.

148
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,473
Yes.

149
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,492
So this is the roadmap for today.

150
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:30,558
We want to reconceptualize Rumination as

151
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:30,558
an extreme case of failed mental problem

152
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:30,558
solving.

153
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:35,605
We want to present a model of Rumination

154
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:35,605
using active inference terminology.

155
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,628
So this will be a conceptual model.

156
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:41,662
We don't have the mathematics to back it

157
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:41,662
up at the moment.

158
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:56,810
I will talk about this limitation at the

159
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:56,810
end again and we will also discuss

160
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:56,810
neurobiological correlates shortly to

161
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:56,810
then continue to point towards treatment

162
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:56,810
implications of the model.

163
00:06:41,663 --> 00:07:04,838
So the next part is like I want to talk a

164
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:04,838
little bit about problem solving and

165
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:04,838
mental problem solving.

166
00:06:57,825 --> 00:07:10,890
And I've had a classic quote by Richard

167
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:10,890
Dawkins that I really find interesting in

168
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:10,890
this context.

169
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:20,992
It says survival machines that can

170
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:20,992
simulate the future are one step ahead of

171
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:20,992
survival machines who can only learn on

172
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:20,992
the basis of overt trial and error.

173
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:23,024
The trouble with over trial is that it

174
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:23,024
takes time and energy.

175
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:26,058
The trouble with overt error is that it's

176
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:26,058
often fatal.

177
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:29,087
Simulation is both safer and faster.

178
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:40,194
And I think this is really interesting

179
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:40,194
and we can talk about also like this

180
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:40,194
evolutionary perspective later.

181
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:50,292
I have really broke it down into simple

182
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:50,292
terms first, okay, so when I want to

183
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:50,292
solve problems using my mind, what do I

184
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:50,292
need to do?

185
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:56,352
Well, at first, I need to think about

186
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:56,352
what to do next, what do I want to think

187
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:56,352
about, so to say.

188
00:07:50,293 --> 00:08:01,341
And we have called this step candidate

189
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:01,341
sampling.

190
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:03,368
So it's meter policy, basically.

191
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:10,439
So what do I even want to think about

192
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:10,439
before thinking about what are important

193
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:10,439
tasks of today, for example?

194
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:15,480
And then the next step is policy

195
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:15,480
evaluation.

196
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:19,521
Or if I think about that, what are the

197
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:19,521
expected results?

198
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:24,577
If I tell them about this concept, will

199
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:24,577
they understand my talk today, for

200
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:24,577
example?

201
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:28,616
And then let's say, yes, I hope that this

202
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:28,616
is the case.

203
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:34,673
Then we have to do another step and do

204
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:34,673
the actual problem solving.

205
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:44,771
Okay, now I'm convinced that this might

206
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:44,771
be the right way, but how to do it, how

207
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:44,771
to actually solve the problems, which are

208
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:44,771
the steps necessary?

209
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:51,848
And these three steps we will consider

210
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:51,848
over and over again today.

211
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:57,901
And whereas in the paper, neat little

212
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:57,901
example that happens to me a lot.

213
00:08:52,855 --> 00:09:01,884
That's one of the reasons I recharge it

214
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:01,884
today.

215
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:03,908
Imagine you lost your key.

216
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:11,984
And now what we typically do is at first

217
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:11,984
we check the usual places, oh, have I put

218
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:11,984
it there?

219
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:13,009
No, have maybe put it there.

220
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:19,061
And after a while, if this doesn't work,

221
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:19,061
my policy changes typically.

222
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:26,134
And I think, okay, where did I see my key

223
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:26,134
the last time that I saw it?

224
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:30,179
And trace it back, and maybe this works

225
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:30,179
and I find my key back.

226
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:37,240
And a few days after, I have the same

227
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,240
problem again because I already lost my

228
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,240
key again.

229
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:48,353
And what I may do after a few instances

230
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:48,353
of this behavior is like, okay, I need to

231
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:48,353
change something fundamentally in order

232
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:48,353
to get my key back faster.

233
00:09:37,241 --> 00:10:00,418
And so in Beijing, learning terms at the

234
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:00,418
beginning, my expected prediction error

235
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:00,418
minimization is just search the usual

236
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:00,418
places.

237
00:09:48,354 --> 00:10:01,429
It might work.

238
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:09,509
Okay, after a while, the mental policy,

239
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,509
okay, why do I keep losing the key?

240
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:11,529
And how do I solve this problem?

241
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:19,601
Might lead to a higher expected free

242
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:19,601
energy minimization or prediction error

243
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:19,601
reducing properties.

244
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:22,636
And this is why I switched the policy,

245
00:10:22,636 --> 00:10:22,636
right after a while.

246
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:32,735
So this meter policy step decides how to

247
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:32,735
go or how to go about a given problem, in

248
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:32,735
this case, how to find my key.

249
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:34,754
Good.

250
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:37,782
This is really important.

251
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:42,839
We cannot search the intractably large

252
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:42,839
probability distribution for this step.

253
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:52,937
It's not possible to remember all

254
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:52,937
instances where I lost my key and to

255
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:52,937
compare, like, promising strategies based

256
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:52,937
on the whole distribution.

257
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:54,957
I'm not able to do this.

258
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:59,002
No machine, no living being.

259
00:10:56,979 --> 00:11:02,978
We have to find fitting samples, so to

260
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:02,978
say.

261
00:10:59,002 --> 00:11:07,029
And fitting means it's usually based on

262
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:07,029
heuristics.

263
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:10,059
What did I do the last time when the key

264
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:10,059
was gone?

265
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,072
How can I find it?

266
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,127
This will become important later, because

267
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:17,127
these Heuristics can run into problems.

268
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:25,209
They help us, like, make computationally

269
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:25,209
intractable problems solvable.

270
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:30,252
But these heuristics have also their

271
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:30,252
downsides as we want to discuss.

272
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:34,297
Okay, then, step two.

273
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:49,445
Now, policies are then selected if they

274
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:49,445
provide a trade off between pragmatic and

275
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:49,445
epistemic value and pragmatic is okay, I

276
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:49,445
have a good chance of finding my key back

277
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:49,445
to stay on the example.

278
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:56,517
And epistemic is I learn also something

279
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:56,517
about finding keys or understand the

280
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:56,517
world better.

281
00:11:49,446 --> 00:12:00,497
And this is also important.

282
00:11:57,524 --> 00:12:06,557
Whenever I choose a specific policy, high

283
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:06,557
opportunity costs may arise.

284
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:18,670
What I mean with that is when I pursue a

285
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:18,670
searching process, for example, for

286
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:18,670
finding my key, I cannot continue

287
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:18,670
preparing my talk or something like

288
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:18,670
that.

289
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:31,808
So every decision I make has necessary

290
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:31,808
costs because I cannot pursue other goals

291
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:31,808
at the same time and this is also

292
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:31,808
becoming going to become important.

293
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:41,904
So in order to be chosen by an organism,

294
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:41,904
each chosen policy has to outweigh the

295
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:41,904
resulting opportunity cost.

296
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:46,949
Otherwise it's not adaptive, right?

297
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,956
Okay.

298
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:51,006
And now the last step, the mental problem

299
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:51,006
solving.

300
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:52,011
Good.

301
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:59,087
I now decided for one strategy of finding

302
00:12:59,087 --> 00:12:59,087
my key and now I have to actually pull it

303
00:12:59,087 --> 00:12:59,087
off.

304
00:12:52,011 --> 00:13:15,180
So where to search, what to do next,

305
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,180
which sequences of movements do I have to

306
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,180
perform and how to go about it best and

307
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,180
typically in different strands of

308
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,180
literature, not just an active

309
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,180
inference.

310
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:17,207
I need to perform something that is

311
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:17,207
called research.

312
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:21,249
You know this from chess playing

313
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:21,249
typically or from chess computers.

314
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:27,302
They do it a lot better than we do, but

315
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:27,302
they look okay.

316
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:35,385
If I do this move and he does this move,

317
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:35,385
then I can do this move and in all moves

318
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:35,385
that follow it, I have a good position.

319
00:13:27,303 --> 00:13:52,553
And it's again not possible to search the

320
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:52,553
whole tree because the more branches, the

321
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:52,553
more branches are daughter branches of

322
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:52,553
these branches again.

323
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:55,588
So the tree grows exponentially.

324
00:13:52,554 --> 00:14:01,587
So I need to have a strategy of not

325
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:01,587
searching through all the branches.

326
00:13:56,591 --> 00:14:03,606
It's called a pruning strategy.

327
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:17,741
In the case of Bayesian learning, it's

328
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:17,741
often occam's window, meaning that

329
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:17,741
branches are not searched through if they

330
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:17,741
don't promise a prediction error

331
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:17,741
minimization that is sufficient to pursue

332
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:17,741
searching them.

333
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:36,930
This can also lead into problems because

334
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:36,930
if a branch at first doesn't provide

335
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:36,930
enough prediction error and minimization,

336
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:36,930
it will not be searched through despite

337
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:36,930
the fact that it could have some

338
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:36,930
prediction error minimization further

339
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:36,930
down the road, so to say.

340
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:42,991
But we have to prune again because it's

341
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:42,991
not possible to search the whole

342
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:42,991
distribution.

343
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:50,074
Okay, so with these three steps in mind,

344
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:50,074
we can have the following model.

345
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:57,143
So we have the candidate sampling how to

346
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:57,143
go about the loss key, so to say, policy

347
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:57,143
evaluation.

348
00:14:50,075 --> 00:15:10,214
If I do the strategy, do I have a good

349
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:10,214
chance of finding the key and learning

350
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:10,214
something about the world and mental

351
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:10,214
problem, how to actually pull this

352
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:10,214
strategy off.

353
00:14:57,144 --> 00:15:19,305
And I want to say one really important

354
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:19,305
thing and this is an increase in mental

355
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:19,305
problem solving is a normal process in a

356
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:19,305
lot of situations, right?

357
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:27,384
So for example, if I lose a person, that

358
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:27,384
is really important for me, it's normal

359
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:27,384
that my general model decreases.

360
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:34,457
Like a lot of my strategies for getting

361
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:34,457
social supports don't work anymore

362
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:34,457
because the person is gone.

363
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:44,557
And so in invasion terminology,

364
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:44,557
prediction errors increase after such an

365
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:44,557
event and this is a normal process.

366
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:58,691
And if, like, my general model declines,

367
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:58,691
this was linked in the active inference

368
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:58,691
literature to bad mood or to feelings of

369
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:58,691
sadness, for example.

370
00:15:46,576 --> 00:16:09,749
And in such cases, typically you think

371
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,749
more about fundamental things in your

372
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,749
life, everybody knows it and has

373
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,749
experienced it.

374
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:21,867
If you don't feel well, you tend to think

375
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:21,867
more and to try to get into a better

376
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:21,867
situation again and hopefully what

377
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:21,867
happens then is okay.

378
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:33,983
For example, I lost someone, my social

379
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:33,983
support system is breaking together or

380
00:16:33,983 --> 00:16:33,983
breaking apart, falling apart.

381
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:41,066
So after a while, I search for people

382
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:41,066
that I like and that can form a new bond

383
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:41,066
with.

384
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:48,130
And hopefully, after a while, my

385
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,130
prediction errors become smaller again.

386
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:50,156
But therefore, I need to take action.

387
00:16:48,131 --> 00:17:05,244
I need to think about what to do with my

388
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:05,244
lies, how to get to know new people in

389
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:05,244
this example, to reduce my prediction

390
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:05,244
errors in this case, regarding social

391
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:05,244
support.

392
00:16:50,156 --> 00:17:20,394
And then I have to pull it up, I have to

393
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:20,394
go to certain places to meet people and

394
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:20,394
hopefully after a while of sadness and

395
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:20,394
difficult times, my general model fit

396
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:20,394
increases again.

397
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:27,461
But this is not always the case, as we

398
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:27,461
now want to discuss next.

399
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:30,492
So I have yet another quote.

400
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:34,532
You will get to use two quotes today,

401
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:34,532
sorry.

402
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:53,724
The next quote is about rumination and it

403
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:53,724
says shut up, she tells her monkey mind

404
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:53,724
please shut up, you picker of knits,

405
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:53,724
presser of bruises, counter of losses,

406
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:53,724
fear of failures, collector of

407
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:53,724
grievances, future and past and now we

408
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:53,724
want to discuss what happens when this

409
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:53,724
doesn't work.

410
00:17:34,538 --> 00:18:03,765
So it can happen that despite trying,

411
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:03,765
agents and organisms don't find good

412
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:03,765
approximations for important problems in

413
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:03,765
their life, right?

414
00:17:53,725 --> 00:18:12,855
And if this is the case, the prediction

415
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:12,855
errors regarding these problems stay high

416
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:12,855
because surprising doesn't get resolved.

417
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:18,915
And despite trying, the organism tries

418
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:18,915
over and over again.

419
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:28,001
Prediction errors say hi, surprising

420
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:28,001
doesn't get resolved and the prediction

421
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:28,001
error doesn't reduce again and the

422
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:28,001
problem stays.

423
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:34,007
And what we now want to do is discuss

424
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:34,007
reasons for why this happens in

425
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:34,007
depressive rumination.

426
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:45,018
And at first we have to say okay, typical

427
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
rumination problems have high complexity

428
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
with uncertainties at many hierarchical

429
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
levels.

430
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:51,024
If you think about problems, for example,

431
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:51,024
like why is the world such a cruel

432
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:51,024
place?

433
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:55,028
For example, this could be a nice

434
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
rumination problem.

435
00:18:51,024 --> 00:19:02,029
You would have to gather a lot of

436
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,029
evidence from different strains.

437
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:08,035
It's really hard to actually disprove

438
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
such a claim or to prove such a claim or

439
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:08,035
even to say what it means.

440
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:15,042
And this is why there might be no

441
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:15,042
efficient solution for such a question.

442
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:21,048
It's not like navigating a maze or

443
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:21,048
something like that, but it's much more

444
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:21,048
complicated.

445
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:31,058
And in addition, sometimes like we human

446
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:31,058
beings have very high precision demands

447
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:31,058
for solutions.

448
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:42,069
For example, after I may have survived a

449
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
traumatic event, I might be really

450
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
reluctant to go to similar looking places

451
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
again.

452
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:54,081
And I have to be really sure that the new

453
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:54,081
place where I don't want to go is really

454
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:54,081
different from the place where something

455
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:54,081
bad happened to me.

456
00:19:42,069 --> 00:20:00,081
And if I'm not sure and sure means really

457
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:00,081
sure, high precision, I won't go there.

458
00:19:54,081 --> 00:20:11,092
And these complexity demands can also

459
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:11,092
make an efficient approximation to a

460
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:11,092
problem improbable.

461
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:21,102
And this might be one reason why problem

462
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:21,102
solving isn't functioning in the case of

463
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:21,102
Depressive Rumination.

464
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:28,109
Another reason might be over pruning and

465
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:28,109
missing action policies.

466
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:48,129
So as I said beforehand, like pruning in

467
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:48,129
order to action properly, or let's say

468
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:48,129
this way, pruning is a good strategy when

469
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:48,129
the parts of the surge tree that I

470
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:48,129
remove, so to say, don't yield.

471
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:53,134
Like at the beginning, small losses and

472
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
at the end large gains.

473
00:20:48,129 --> 00:21:01,136
Because if it's like that, the tree

474
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,136
branch might be pruned away despite

475
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,136
actually helping the organism to reduce

476
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,136
surprisal.

477
00:20:53,134 --> 00:21:05,140
But the organism will never find out

478
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,140
because it gets pruned away.

479
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:13,148
And the next thing is also, action

480
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:13,148
policies can only be thought through if

481
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:13,148
an agent knows about them.

482
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:26,161
We know about a lot of depression

483
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:26,161
patients with a lot of childhood

484
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:26,161
adversities that actually don't know a

485
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:26,161
lot of strategies for navigating social

486
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:26,161
environments.

487
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:31,166
It's not their fault, it's a consequence

488
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:31,166
of childhood adversities.

489
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:33,168
But nevertheless, this is a problem.

490
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:41,176
If I don't know the solution for a social

491
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:41,176
problem, I cannot approximate a solution

492
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:41,176
because action policies are missing.

493
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:59,194
And the next problem might be that after

494
00:21:59,194 --> 00:21:59,194
many failed attempts of problem solving,

495
00:21:59,194 --> 00:21:59,194
I might not even have a reason to engage

496
00:21:59,194 --> 00:21:59,194
in deeper instrumental learning.

497
00:21:44,178 --> 00:22:00,189
What I mean with that?

498
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,191
I go back one slide.

499
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:05,194
After a while I have an idea.

500
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:09,198
Okay, why is my life becoming so shitty?

501
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:15,204
It is because I don't engage with other

502
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,204
people anymore.

503
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:18,207
I just lie in my bed and feel sad.

504
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:19,208
Okay?

505
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:27,216
And now normally there would be a step

506
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:27,216
where I think about how to engage with

507
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:27,216
other people again.

508
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:39,228
But if I have, for example, missing

509
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:39,228
action policies, really bad mood and not

510
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:39,228
a lot of strategies, I might think this

511
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:39,228
through shortly and think, well, I can

512
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:39,228
try, but they won't like me anyway.

513
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:49,238
So instead of deep mental problem

514
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
solving, I jump back to step one, which

515
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
is why do I have so many problems with

516
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
other people?

517
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:57,245
And there you can see illuminated circle

518
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:57,245
is forming and no deeper engagement is

519
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:57,245
possible anymore.

520
00:22:49,238 --> 00:23:07,250
And if this happens, my prediction errors

521
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,250
stay large and more candidate sampling

522
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,250
occurs.

523
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:13,256
Okay, I cannot solve this by meeting

524
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:13,256
other people, but maybe I can do it on my

525
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:13,256
own.

526
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:16,259
No I feel so sad and lonely.

527
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:18,261
You see where this is going.

528
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:31,274
I do not engage anymore in deeper problem

529
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
solving, but instead thinking through a

530
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
lot of policy candidates and none of them

531
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
is like giving me confidence that I can

532
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
solve my problems.

533
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:38,281
So I stay at the same meter policy

534
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:38,281
selection step, so to say.

535
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:44,287
And in consequence I have less

536
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:44,287
instrumental thinking and less

537
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:44,287
instrumental learning.

538
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:48,291
And this also has consequences.

539
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:56,299
For example, the pragmatic value of

540
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,299
policies are estimated to be low due to

541
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,299
low model fit.

542
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:59,302
And this even becomes worse over time.

543
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:03,300
So if I think I cannot do it, I will not

544
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,300
train it.

545
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:09,306
If I do not train it, I become even worse

546
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:09,306
at doing it.

547
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:21,318
And so it becomes more and more

548
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:21,318
improbable that I try because my action

549
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:21,318
policies become more and more under

550
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:21,318
trained.

551
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:26,323
And this is another really important

552
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:26,323
problem.

553
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:36,333
And the next problem is the opportunity

554
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:36,333
cost because I ruminate a lot.

555
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:46,343
So now we are at a meter level, I don't

556
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:46,343
do much else and because I don't do much

557
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:46,343
else, my model fit further declines.

558
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:50,347
And yes, the rest we talked about on the

559
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
last slide.

560
00:24:46,343 --> 00:25:00,351
So Ruminated states may be learned as the

561
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,351
agent's default response for,

562
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,351
quoteunquote, dealing with problems after

563
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,351
a while.

564
00:24:50,347 --> 00:25:03,354
And now we have a wishes cycle here.

565
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:15,366
And the next thing that I want to discuss

566
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
is how neurobiology might play a role

567
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
here.

568
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:28,379
And I have had a little joke of Phil

569
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:28,379
Colette ripped off for my slides here and

570
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:28,379
quotation by Karl Friston that says an

571
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:28,379
agent does not have a model of its world,

572
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:28,379
it is a model.

573
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:34,385
In other words, the form, structure and

574
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:34,385
states of our embodied brains do not

575
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:34,385
contain a model of the sensoriums.

576
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:35,386
They are that model.

577
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:47,398
And on the right you can see like a Yale

578
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:47,398
School of Management guy that actually

579
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:47,398
really embodies this principle as he's

580
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:47,398
clearly showing on his backpack.

581
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:55,406
Okay, jokes aside, what was supposed to

582
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:55,406
be said?

583
00:25:49,400 --> 00:26:00,405
The Default Mode network is going to be

584
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:00,405
important for our discussion here.

585
00:25:56,406 --> 00:26:06,411
The Default Mode network is a largescale

586
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:06,411
network with mediofrontal, temporal and

587
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:06,411
pariatal regions in the brain.

588
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:12,417
It's important for introspection,

589
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:12,417
selfreferential thinking and

590
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:12,417
autobiographical recall.

591
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:18,423
So in short, it's important for

592
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:18,423
everything mental, problem solving and

593
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:18,423
Rumination related or a lot of these

594
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:18,423
things.

595
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:23,428
And this is why it's unsurprisingly going

596
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:23,428
to play a role here.

597
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:37,442
And to be more precise, the frontal

598
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:37,442
courtesies seem to be the main driver of

599
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:37,442
memory recall in the Default Mode

600
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:37,442
network.

601
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:44,449
So if the Default Mode network tries now

602
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
I'm intermorphalizing it to recall a

603
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
memory.

604
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:47,452
So where do I find the key?

605
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:53,458
For example, it uses the frontal regions

606
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:53,458
to be the main driver of this process.

607
00:26:47,452 --> 00:27:08,467
And it is the case that meter studies

608
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
found a stronger coupling and a

609
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
hyperactivation in Default Mode network

610
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
structures to be correlated with

611
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:08,467
Ruminations.

612
00:26:54,459 --> 00:27:21,480
And there are actually two meter analysis

613
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
that found this and it is also suggested

614
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
that a coupling with sub Lagrangian

615
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
cortex might contribute to the negatively

616
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
agent nature of rumination MdD.

617
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:36,495
So we know, okay, Dmn is important for

618
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:36,495
problem solving and for rumination and

619
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:36,495
it's also found meta analytically that it

620
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:36,495
indeed plays a role for rumination or at

621
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:36,495
least it's correlated.

622
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:49,508
And in addition, meter studies also found

623
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:49,508
evidence for a reduced frontier periodic

624
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:49,508
control network within network

625
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:49,508
connectivity in major depression.

626
00:27:38,497 --> 00:28:06,519
And this is also interesting because as

627
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
we discussed, our idea is basically that

628
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
rumination means I get stuck in abstract

629
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
thinking and don't use my instrumental

630
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
learning capabilities as much.

631
00:27:50,508 --> 00:28:15,528
And so it makes sense that in MdD we find

632
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:15,528
reduced control network or front of

633
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:15,528
periodical control network activity.

634
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:24,537
Note by the way that this part of the

635
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:24,537
evidence line is more indirect than the

636
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:24,537
part before, right, I don't want to gloss

637
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:24,537
over this.

638
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:33,546
So while we have here a direct

639
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:33,546
correlation with Rumination, in the case

640
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:33,546
of the default mode network here it's

641
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:33,546
more Mvd in general.

642
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:42,555
This is why we also wrote it much more

643
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:42,555
careful in the paper because it's a more

644
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:42,555
indirect line and I don't want to gloss

645
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:42,555
over that.

646
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:51,564
And it is further more known that a

647
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:51,564
connection between control networks and

648
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:51,564
default mode networks seem to be

649
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:51,564
reduced.

650
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:57,570
And interestingly these two networks have

651
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:57,570
to connect in order to solve complicated

652
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:57,570
problems.

653
00:28:51,564 --> 00:29:17,584
They actually study about that and these

654
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:17,584
studies suggest that if the problem gets

655
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:17,584
harder for an individual, it uses more of

656
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:17,584
the default mode network to do the meter

657
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:17,584
thinking and then the control networks to

658
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:17,584
do the problem solving and the interplay

659
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:17,584
between the two is really important.

660
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:30,597
Okay, so in conclusion, what we think

661
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:30,597
could be the case is that the default

662
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:30,597
network is hyperactive and hyper

663
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:30,597
connected.

664
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:39,606
Because it does policy candidate over

665
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:39,606
sampling that we talked about before and

666
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:39,606
the reduced mental problem solving.

667
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:57,624
Or instrumental learning due to the

668
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:57,624
policy over sampling is reflected by the

669
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:57,624
reduced resting state activation and the

670
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:57,624
hyperconnectivity of the control networks

671
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:57,624
and also of integration hubs like the

672
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:57,624
insula.

673
00:29:39,606 --> 00:30:08,629
Okay, then a short citation, it will be

674
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:08,629
the last one and it's existentialist

675
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:08,629
model and it says simply existence

676
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:08,629
precedes essence.

677
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:27,648
And it wants us to say okay, in the first

678
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
instance we are beings that get thrown

679
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
into the world, but we have to do

680
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
something with our lives in order to

681
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
flourish and give ourselves reasons to

682
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
live and to succeed.

683
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:38,659
And I want to talk a little bit about how

684
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:38,659
can we get out of ruminative loops and

685
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:38,659
what might be old idea and new dean.

686
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:50,671
At first I want to say there's good

687
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
evidence for the effectiveness of

688
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
existing psychotherapeutic treatment

689
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
regarding depression in general and it's

690
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
also regarding rumination.

691
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:56,677
So we also have like meta analysis

692
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:56,677
specifically analyzing rumination.

693
00:30:50,671 --> 00:31:05,679
However, we have substantial non

694
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:05,679
responder rates for psychotherapy and

695
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:05,679
also for current medication approaches.

696
00:30:56,677 --> 00:31:14,689
We have a high chance for relapse after

697
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:14,689
depression is gone, it will oftentimes

698
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:14,689
reoccur in the life of patients,

699
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:14,689
unfortunately.

700
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:20,695
And we also have substantial therapy

701
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:20,695
dropouts so patients actually leaving

702
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:20,695
therapy.

703
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:29,704
So it's really easy to say that

704
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:29,704
psychological and pharmacological

705
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:29,704
treatment needs improvement.

706
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:35,710
So they are effective but they don't help

707
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,710
everyone and there's a lot of room for

708
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,710
improvement here.

709
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:50,725
And there are multiple ideas that we

710
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:50,725
briefly discussed in the paper and the

711
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:50,725
first is like a simple idea but could be

712
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:50,725
quite effective and has also meta

713
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:50,725
analytical evidence that it helps.

714
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:56,731
And this is like reduce memory

715
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:56,731
interference and rumination by physical

716
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:56,731
exercise in the everyday lives of

717
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:56,731
patients.

718
00:31:50,725 --> 00:32:06,735
So doing more like especially endurance

719
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:06,735
exercises actually helps reducing

720
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:06,735
rumination even when compared to active

721
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:06,735
treatment like CBT.

722
00:31:56,731 --> 00:32:15,744
So maybe depressing patients don't only

723
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:15,744
need therapy to be paid for but also to

724
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:15,744
have a personal trainer that might be

725
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:15,744
paid for.

726
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:20,749
And I only say this half jokingly, this

727
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
could improve the life of a lot of

728
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
people.

729
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:42,770
And another idea is more medical

730
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:42,770
stylocybin or ketomine was shown in

731
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:42,770
studies to increase the sampling entropy

732
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:42,770
of the brain and this could also be an

733
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:42,770
interesting prospect because we've

734
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:42,770
learned that the samples are getting

735
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:42,770
repeated over and over again.

736
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:56,785
But if we could have an idea for how to

737
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
increase the variance of samples drawn

738
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
then probability that one sample is

739
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
actually a good idea for thinking through

740
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
increases.

741
00:32:42,771 --> 00:33:13,796
However, I have to say cautionary notes,

742
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:13,796
especially with psychedelic drugs because

743
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:13,796
it is a promising pharmacological avenue

744
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:13,796
probably, but at the moment we have

745
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:13,796
really small sample sizes.

746
00:32:56,785 --> 00:33:16,799
It's hard to blind for these drugs

747
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:16,799
between groups.

748
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:20,803
I mean, you know, when you are tripping

749
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:20,803
it's quite easy to know.

750
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:30,813
So this makes RCTs difficult and we know

751
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
from a lot of questionable research

752
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
practices from this line of research,

753
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
unfortunately.

754
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:45,828
I don't want to say that everybody in

755
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:45,828
these fields are doing bad science, it's

756
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:45,828
not what I want to say but I know from a

757
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:45,828
few cases where preregistered protocols

758
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:45,828
don't fit the results that were presented

759
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:45,828
and stuff like this.

760
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:53,836
And if you combine all this it's actually

761
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:53,836
quite hard to say whether these work

762
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:53,836
really well.

763
00:33:46,828 --> 00:34:16,853
So what we would need is really larger

764
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
study, not these small brain imaging

765
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
studies with 20 subjects, more like 200

766
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
subjects would be a beginning and we need

767
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
the researchers to actually stick to

768
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
predefined interpretations of their

769
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
results so we can learn about more about

770
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
this problem promising avenue.

771
00:33:53,836 --> 00:34:33,870
Okay, and more ideas would be to change

772
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:33,870
therapy a little bit and concrete idea is

773
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:33,870
we could actually add problem complexity

774
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:33,870
estimations into therapy.

775
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:49,886
What I mean with this is like ask

776
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:49,886
patients, okay, how much time you spend

777
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:49,886
ruminating, what typically are the

778
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:49,886
results of these processes, what are the

779
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:49,886
costs of these processes.

780
00:34:33,870 --> 00:35:03,894
So we could try to make the costs of the

781
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
process more explicit to the patient and

782
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
to give them a grasp on how much

783
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
opportunity cost they invoke on

784
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
themselves by the process.

785
00:34:49,886 --> 00:35:16,907
It's not typically done at the moment but

786
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
it could be an idea for improving CBT and

787
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
what is also important this is done in

788
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
CBT, what I now tell by the way, but it's

789
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
really important to keep it in mind.

790
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:24,915
We learned that a good problem solving

791
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:24,915
requires an intricate interplay between

792
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:24,915
the false mode network and brains control

793
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:24,915
networks.

794
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:30,921
So it's actually important to have

795
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
optimal difficulties for behavioral tasks

796
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
given to patients.

797
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:39,930
If it's too difficult, they will not do

798
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,930
it and if it's too easy, they will not

799
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,930
learn anything from that nor epistemic

800
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:39,930
value is mindful to say.

801
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:44,935
And both options are not good for

802
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:44,935
reducing rumination.

803
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:51,942
And there's actually another experimental

804
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:51,942
treatment that shows some success, and

805
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:51,942
it's called emotional flanker tasks.

806
00:35:45,936 --> 00:36:00,945
And in these tasks, like, patients learn

807
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
how to shift their attention away from

808
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
bad emotions.

809
00:35:51,942 --> 00:36:12,957
And this could also help stop the

810
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:12,957
ruminative process, because we learn

811
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:12,957
that, depending on your mood, you will

812
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:12,957
have different heuristics in your brain

813
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:12,957
about what you think about next.

814
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:16,961
And in the case of bad moods, you don't

815
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:16,961
have the best heuristics.

816
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:19,964
So this is another idea for better

817
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:19,964
treatment.

818
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:21,966
Yes.

819
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:26,971
Now I want to talk about a few

820
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
limitations and then we can enter the

821
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
discussion.

822
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:33,978
So one limitation is clearly that the

823
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:33,978
model only discusses typical depression

824
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:33,978
where behavior breaks down.

825
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:49,994
However, there are cases of agitated

826
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
depression where behavioral output

827
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
actually increases or to make it more

828
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
abstract, depression is a really

829
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
heterogeneous subject and also Rumination

830
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
is really heterogeneous.

831
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:56,001
So we don't have a model actually at the

832
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:56,001
moment that considers all individual

833
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:56,001
trajectories.

834
00:36:50,995 --> 00:37:02,001
So this is only a general scheme, so to

835
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
say, but it will not fit every

836
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:02,001
individual.

837
00:36:57,002 --> 00:37:14,013
And the next thing is we describe

838
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
plausible ways for Rumination development

839
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
but we do not know whether these pathways

840
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
play a cause or role in MdD development.

841
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:23,022
I said briefly that when I have

842
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
Rumination at time point T, I will have

843
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
more depression at time point T plus

844
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
one.

845
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:29,028
But we do not know whether this is a

846
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
causal factor but or only a coincidence

847
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
in time, you know what I mean?

848
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:50,049
So this is also an unsolved problem at

849
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:50,049
the moment and the last problem which is

850
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:50,049
also important for active inference lab

851
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:50,049
nursing in the community is it's not a

852
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:50,049
mathematical model, it's a conceptual

853
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:50,049
model that we did and so the next step

854
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:50,049
would be to make a mathematical model out

855
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:50,049
of it.

856
00:37:30,029 --> 00:38:05,058
For example, like partially observable

857
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
Markov decision process or something like

858
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
this in order to be able to simulate it

859
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
and to check whether the behavior that we

860
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
set it would come out, actually come

861
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
out.

862
00:37:50,049 --> 00:38:08,061
So this is another major limitation of

863
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:08,061
the paper.

864
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:11,064
Yes, I will skip over that.

865
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:16,069
I guess we talked about this enough.

866
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:31,084
So what I want to talk about shortly

867
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:31,084
before entering the discussion with other

868
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:31,084
projects that we want to do next with

869
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:31,084
respect to active inference and what we

870
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:31,084
actually have done and now under review

871
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:31,084
at.

872
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:39,092
Psychological medicine is applying the

873
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,092
active inference framework to

874
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,092
heterogeneous social experiences and

875
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,092
behavior.

876
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:43,096
And this is actually done in a

877
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:43,096
mathematical precise way.

878
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:56,109
So there we have a hierarchical pond or

879
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:56,109
partially observable Markov decision

880
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:56,109
process model, and we use it for trying

881
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:56,109
to explain, like, social withdrawal or

882
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:56,109
other social problems in depression.

883
00:38:43,096 --> 00:39:01,108
So it's a little bit rumination adjacent

884
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
and it's more mathematicized.

885
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:06,113
A preprint is available, but it's not yet

886
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:06,113
through the revision process.

887
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:25,132
And what we also want to do is like,

888
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
simulate distorted social functioning and

889
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
mental disorders and also to compare

890
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
these simulations, or computer

891
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
simulations based on active inference to

892
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
empirical data, because this is also what

893
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
we found in the literature to be

894
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
missing.

895
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:40,147
We have the simulation studies, right,

896
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
where we have like these simple games

897
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
where active inference computer agents

898
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
play like a trust game or something like

899
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
that, or where you simulate

900
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
hallucinations and psychosis.

901
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:43,150
And these are really good studies, don't

902
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,150
get me wrong.

903
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:56,163
But what is missing, in our view, is a

904
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:56,163
little bit combining these computer

905
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:56,163
simulations with the behavior of human

906
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:56,163
being to compare them within one and the

907
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:56,163
same design.

908
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:58,164
And this is what we aim to do.

909
00:39:56,163 --> 00:40:02,163
But it's an ambitious project and we are

910
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
not finished, so this will take more

911
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
work.

912
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:19,180
And another project that we actually will

913
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,180
finish this year and we have done the

914
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,180
literature screening is we have prepared

915
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,180
like a systematic review of all active

916
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,180
inference literature that is of interest

917
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,180
for psychological treatment.

918
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:24,185
And this will hopefully at least be a

919
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,185
preprint this year.

920
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:26,187
So thank you.

921
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:31,192
These are my coworkers in different

922
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:31,192
projects to drop a few names.

923
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:35,196
On the left is Matthias Feldman, then

924
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:35,196
Lucas Kirchner and Tobias Coupon.

925
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:38,199
These are the guys that I wrote the

926
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:38,199
rumination paper with.

927
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:40,201
Then there's an Elena Ecker.

928
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:48,209
She's from theoretical cognitive science

929
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
groups, and she does a lot of the

930
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:48,209
computer models for our new projects.

931
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:53,214
So we need actually scientists that are

932
00:40:53,214 --> 00:40:53,214
better at programming than I am.

933
00:40:48,209 --> 00:40:57,218
And she is doing a lot of the work here.

934
00:40:54,215 --> 00:41:00,215
And then there's Philip Hatzok and Burgut

935
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
Kleim.

936
00:40:57,218 --> 00:41:17,232
And with those two people, I also

937
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:17,232
collaborated on a predictive processing

938
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:17,232
model of PTSD, which was also published

939
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:17,232
in Neuroscience and Behavior Reviews at

940
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:17,232
2020.

941
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:17,232
Yeah.

942
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:26,241
So with that, I would like to thank you

943
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:26,241
for listening and yeah, we can discuss a

944
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:26,241
few questions if you want now.

945
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:29,244
Daniel: Awesome.

946
00:41:28,243 --> 00:41:34,249
Max: Thank you.

947
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:36,251
Daniel: Okay.

948
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:42,257
All right, well, thanks for the great

949
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:42,257
presentation.

950
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:45,260
Looking forward to the discussion.

951
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:55,270
So, just to sort of begin, how did

952
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,270
predictive processing and active become

953
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,270
integrated with your and your colleagues

954
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,270
research direction?

955
00:41:45,260 --> 00:42:05,274
Were you looking for integrative

956
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:05,274
frameworks and came across this area, or

957
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:05,274
did this motivate you to study and enter

958
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:05,274
into the clinical space?

959
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:10,279
Max: It's a mixture of two things, I

960
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:10,279
would say.

961
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:13,282
One is like observations in patients.

962
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:15,284
Maybe start with that.

963
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:20,289
So my friend Tobias Cooper got me

964
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:20,289
interested in this stuff.

965
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:30,299
And he had a patient and this patient

966
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
really had to struggle with social

967
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
phobia.

968
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:40,309
And what was interesting about him that

969
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
he was discarding information that would

970
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
challenge his worldview to say right.

971
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:45,314
So whenever somebody said that he

972
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:45,314
actually liked him, this one said, oh,

973
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:45,314
no.

974
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:49,318
He just pretends to say this because he

975
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:49,318
wants to be a nice guy.

976
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:52,321
But in reality, nobody likes me.

977
00:42:49,318 --> 00:43:00,323
And this is what got us interesting,

978
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:00,323
interested in this line of thinking about

979
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:00,323
information seeking.

980
00:42:52,321 --> 00:43:08,331
For example, how do organisms seek

981
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:08,331
information to run their lives?

982
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:16,339
But also how do organisms discard

983
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,339
information and stay in a depressed or in

984
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:16,339
an anxious state?

985
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:22,345
And this is, I guess, one of the reasons

986
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:22,345
why we started to get interested in

987
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:22,345
active inference.

988
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:33,356
And another reason comes from my love or

989
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:33,356
love from a lot of my colleagues for

990
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:33,356
simple explanations.

991
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:40,363
And I don't dean simple as mathematically

992
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:40,363
simple because I don't get most of the

993
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:40,363
math, to be honest, fully.

994
00:43:34,356 --> 00:43:55,378
But simple in the sense of we can have

995
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
only a few axioms and explain sentient

996
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
behavior with it, we can computer

997
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
simulate behavior in it and it actually

998
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
produces interesting behavior patterns

999
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
that we know from the literature.

1000
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:58,381
And this is the other reason why we got

1001
00:43:58,381 --> 00:43:58,381
into it.

1002
00:43:55,378 --> 00:44:00,377
Daniel: Awesome.

1003
00:43:59,382 --> 00:44:04,381
So many directions and ways to go.

1004
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:17,394
But one excerpt from the paper that

1005
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
jumped out at me was the line between

1006
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
adaptive problem solving and self

1007
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
perpetuating maladaptive ruminating.

1008
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:26,403
So how do we know that line and how does

1009
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
that play out when you're in the clinical

1010
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,403
context?

1011
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:31,408
Like what is the appropriate amount of

1012
00:44:31,408 --> 00:44:31,408
thinking or overthinking?

1013
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:36,413
How do we really find that line and come

1014
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:36,413
to know it?

1015
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:40,417
Max: Well, there's a short answer that is

1016
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:40,417
we don't know.

1017
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:51,428
So it's hard to say, to be honest, where

1018
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:51,428
the line is because in principle, maybe

1019
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:51,428
you find a good solution if you ruminate

1020
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:51,428
just 2 hours more, right?

1021
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:52,429
You never know.

1022
00:44:51,428 --> 00:45:08,439
But we have an answer in the clinical

1023
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
field in practice and it's like a

1024
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
pragmaticist answer and it only goes

1025
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
okay, if you suffer a lot and don't get

1026
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
your everyday life sorted out, then it

1027
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
becomes a problem and we have like

1028
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
measures for that.

1029
00:44:53,430 --> 00:45:24,455
So you can assess the global functioning

1030
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
level of a person and say can he continue

1031
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
to work, has he friends, has he or she

1032
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
free time activity that actually fulfill

1033
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
her?

1034
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:33,464
And this way you can at least say, okay,

1035
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
has this person a good level of

1036
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
functioning?

1037
00:45:25,455 --> 00:45:38,469
And if not, does rumination impair this

1038
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:38,469
level of functioning?

1039
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:45,476
And yeah, this is a really pragmatic

1040
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
answer, sorry for that, but this is how

1041
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
we do it in clinical practice.

1042
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:51,482
Daniel: Totally makes sense also in that

1043
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:51,482
kind of clinical area.

1044
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:58,489
So I was curious, other than rumination,

1045
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
what other trans diagnostic risk

1046
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
factors?

1047
00:45:51,482 --> 00:46:09,494
What are some examples of those risk

1048
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:09,494
factors and how might they be linked

1049
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:09,494
together in a kind of holistic

1050
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:09,494
understanding?

1051
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:18,503
Or what is the active and non active way

1052
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:18,503
of thinking about the causes and

1053
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:18,503
consequences of these trans diagnostic

1054
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:18,503
risk factors.

1055
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:25,510
Max: One that jumps to mind is emotion

1056
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,510
regulation that comes up over and over

1057
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,510
again.

1058
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:28,513
So this is a risk factor also for

1059
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:28,513
depression.

1060
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:34,519
It's a risk factor for borderline

1061
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
personality disorder but it's also a risk

1062
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
factor for violence.

1063
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:48,533
So a lot of things are connected to poor

1064
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:48,533
emotion regulation and I have to think

1065
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:48,533
shortly to get an active inference answer

1066
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:48,533
out of that.

1067
00:46:35,520 --> 00:47:00,539
There's actually a paper, a new one by my

1068
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:00,539
colleague Philip Hatzok about like a

1069
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:00,539
predictive processing model of borderline

1070
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:00,539
personality disorder where he describes

1071
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:00,539
in more detail.

1072
00:46:49,534 --> 00:47:10,548
So he is the expert there but maybe we

1073
00:47:10,548 --> 00:47:10,548
can just look it up before I make stuff

1074
00:47:10,548 --> 00:47:10,548
up that it's not.

1075
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:13,552
Can I just search it shortly and give us

1076
00:47:13,552 --> 00:47:13,552
an answer?

1077
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:14,553
Daniel: Sure.

1078
00:47:13,552 --> 00:47:22,561
This is internet extended cognitive

1079
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:22,561
rumination yes.

1080
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:28,567
Max: Because I don't feel confident

1081
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:28,567
enough to talk about stuff that was not

1082
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:28,567
my main area of research.

1083
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:43,582
Daniel: Extended rumination you could

1084
00:47:43,582 --> 00:47:43,582
make a script or a computer program.

1085
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:47,585
That just iterates.

1086
00:47:43,582 --> 00:48:03,596
And whether it experiences that in an

1087
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
anxious way kind of a second question but

1088
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
at least from that functional side it's

1089
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
as if ruminating yes.

1090
00:47:47,586 --> 00:48:06,599
Max: So I have the paper here.

1091
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:07,600
Do you see it now?

1092
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:07,600
Daniel: Yes.

1093
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,601
Thank you.

1094
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,602
Max: Yeah.

1095
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:11,604
So let's see here.

1096
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:15,608
They actually have a model of active

1097
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:15,608
inference terms.

1098
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:20,613
So let's see where it starts.

1099
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:27,620
And it's actually not so simple.

1100
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:38,631
Okay, so what they want to explain is

1101
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:38,631
basically how childhood male treatment

1102
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:38,631
leads to borderline personality

1103
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:38,631
disorder.

1104
00:48:31,624 --> 00:49:01,648
And this is important for my

1105
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:01,648
transdiagnostic marker of reduced emotion

1106
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:01,648
regulation because bad emotion regulation

1107
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:01,648
is the symptom of borderline personality

1108
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:01,648
disorder and what they say is, okay,

1109
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:01,648
let's see that.

1110
00:48:38,631 --> 00:49:06,653
We have two relevant factors here, strong

1111
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
negative belief about the self and

1112
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
others.

1113
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:11,658
It's also typically known for borderline

1114
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:11,658
personality disorder.

1115
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:29,676
So we have high precision to active

1116
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:29,676
inference lab terms here to my prior

1117
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:29,676
belief that other people are bad and I am

1118
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:29,676
also like a loser that cannot do anything

1119
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:29,676
right in his or her life.

1120
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:35,682
And this needs of course if the precision

1121
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:35,682
of the prior is really high, new

1122
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:35,682
information doesn't matter.

1123
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:46,693
And so we have a persistence of effects

1124
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:46,693
of hostility because if the others are

1125
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:46,693
all bad, well, I can be hostile towards

1126
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:46,693
them of fear and of sadness.

1127
00:49:36,683 --> 00:50:07,708
And in addition to that, also

1128
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
contributing to the temporal fluctuations

1129
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
because we know that borderline is

1130
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
characterized by sometimes like I really

1131
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
like my therapist as a borderline

1132
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
patients and after a while I really hate

1133
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
him and not a lot in between.

1134
00:49:47,694 --> 00:50:14,715
And this may come about due to like a

1135
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:14,715
high uncertainty of beliefs about

1136
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:14,715
consequences of action.

1137
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:16,717
So here about policies.

1138
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:28,729
So here my standard deviation is really

1139
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:28,729
broad and due to that belief updating

1140
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:28,729
regarding policies gets passed.

1141
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:35,736
And this is why I show instability while

1142
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:35,736
at the same time also showing

1143
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:35,736
persistence.

1144
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:41,742
And I show persistence of my worldview

1145
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:41,742
but instability of my behavior.

1146
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:47,748
And this is how they try to explain

1147
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:47,748
borderline personality disorder in active

1148
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:47,748
inference terminology.

1149
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:49,750
But this is only me giving it a try.

1150
00:50:47,748 --> 00:51:06,761
I only read the paper once, but this

1151
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
might be one way how to characterize

1152
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
like, symptoms of emotion regulation

1153
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
problems in a conceptual model using

1154
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
Bayesian terminology.

1155
00:50:49,750 --> 00:51:07,762
Daniel: Awesome.

1156
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:14,769
And also in this paper and in yours, it's

1157
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:14,769
on the roadmap towards formalization.

1158
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:32,787
Not like that's the only endpoint, but

1159
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
going from the empirical evidence and the

1160
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
ways of thinking and knowing in the

1161
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
clinician's office through the

1162
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
integrative frameworks to the pros and to

1163
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
the graphics that connect different nodes

1164
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
and edges.

1165
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:41,796
This figure and the ones that you drew,

1166
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
they're not exactly a Bayes graph, so

1167
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
it's not exactly ready to be entered into

1168
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:41,796
a computer program.

1169
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:44,799
But it's also not far from a Bayes

1170
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:44,799
graph.

1171
00:51:41,796 --> 00:51:50,805
You have variables that could basically

1172
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:50,805
be variables in a Bayes graph.

1173
00:51:44,799 --> 00:52:03,812
And so it moves along and brings

1174
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
collaborators and so on, as in a kind of

1175
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
methodologically plural way.

1176
00:51:50,805 --> 00:52:24,833
There can be development on multiple

1177
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
fronts and integrate the neuroimaging and

1178
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
the predispositions and then the

1179
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
treatment modalities in a way that's not

1180
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
just like following the causal chain of

1181
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
the ideology, but rather approaching it

1182
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
almost like in.

1183
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:39,848
A reverse problem solving way, starting

1184
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:39,848
with the clinician's awareness and view

1185
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:39,848
and first seeking to integrate and

1186
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:39,848
improve the sense making of the clinician

1187
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:39,848
even without a formal model.

1188
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:42,851
Max: Yeah, I would totally agree with

1189
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:42,851
that.

1190
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:44,853
Not much I can say about it.

1191
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:45,854
I think it's totally right what you

1192
00:52:45,854 --> 00:52:45,854
said.

1193
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:58,866
There maybe one thing in clinical

1194
00:52:58,866 --> 00:52:58,866
experience, at least in psychology, I

1195
00:52:58,866 --> 00:52:58,866
don't dare to speak of other fields, but

1196
00:52:58,866 --> 00:52:58,866
their backward translation is really

1197
00:52:58,866 --> 00:52:58,866
important.

1198
00:52:45,854 --> 00:53:00,863
So this is what you described, right?

1199
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:16,879
So going back from the clinical

1200
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:16,879
phenomenon to more precise view, for

1201
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:16,879
example, in formal modeling and typically

1202
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:16,879
problems got tackled the other way

1203
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:16,879
around.

1204
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:38,901
And this oftentimes doesn't work as well

1205
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:38,901
as backwards translation because

1206
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:38,901
typically problems got thought through by

1207
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:38,901
basic scientists that are really good at

1208
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:38,901
doing this formal modeling but don't

1209
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:38,901
model necessarily the right parameters

1210
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:38,901
from our view at least, because they lack

1211
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:38,901
the clinical experience.

1212
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:42,905
And so both parties working together is

1213
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:42,905
really important.

1214
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:56,919
Like guys like us bring in the important

1215
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
parameters, or at least where we think

1216
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
they could be important from clinical

1217
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
practice and the more mathematically

1218
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:56,919
inclined can model them.

1219
00:53:42,905 --> 00:54:06,923
And so there could be a fruitful

1220
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
collaboration between so start with

1221
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
backward translation, then do forward

1222
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
translation, then do another loop of

1223
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
backward translation.

1224
00:53:56,919 --> 00:54:11,928
And I guess this is a fruitful way of

1225
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
advancing psychiatry and psychology.

1226
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:14,931
Daniel: Wow.

1227
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:17,934
So, a related question.

1228
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:30,947
To what extent, either today or in the

1229
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
future do you think patients would be

1230
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
clued in to some of this lexicon and

1231
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
ontology?

1232
00:54:18,935 --> 00:54:39,956
For example, is it enough to just say,

1233
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:39,956
hey, here's the new recommendation,

1234
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:39,956
here's the new exercise plan?

1235
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:51,968
Or is it explicitly oriented around

1236
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:51,968
communicating within these ways of

1237
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:51,968
talking about belief, uncertainty,

1238
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:51,968
information and so on?

1239
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:56,973
Max: I think it can be done with

1240
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:56,973
patients, and it should be done to a

1241
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:56,973
certain extent.

1242
00:54:52,969 --> 00:55:07,978
I think it's not plausible to teach them

1243
00:55:07,978 --> 00:55:07,978
all the math and stuff like this will not

1244
00:55:07,978 --> 00:55:07,978
be possible for at least a lot of them,

1245
00:55:07,978 --> 00:55:07,978
for sure.

1246
00:54:57,974 --> 00:55:14,985
If you have a mathematics professor

1247
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:14,985
patience, it would be easy for him or

1248
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:14,985
her, but in most cases, no, not that.

1249
00:55:07,978 --> 00:55:25,996
But you could talk about precision, you

1250
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:25,996
could talk about surprising, you could

1251
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:25,996
talk about hierarchical learning, and I

1252
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:25,996
guess it's important to do this.

1253
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:32,003
You could simplify models into like,

1254
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:32,003
vicious circles.

1255
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:49,020
One could easily draw a simple vicious

1256
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,020
circle with the help of our remnant model

1257
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,020
and teach them or the patients a few

1258
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,020
Bayesian adjacent words, at least, to

1259
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,020
better understand their condition.

1260
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:56,027
And I think this is important because

1261
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:56,027
psycho education actually is proven to

1262
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:56,027
help, right?

1263
00:55:49,020 --> 00:56:05,030
The more you know about the condition,

1264
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,030
the higher your chances of getting better

1265
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,030
are in a lot of cases.

1266
00:55:56,027 --> 00:56:30,054
And so I guess, yes, you could teach them

1267
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:30,054
at least base rules and a few simple

1268
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:30,054
things, not doing a lot of math, but

1269
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:30,054
like, drawing a few graphs and try to

1270
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:30,054
teach them the basics would be a good

1271
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:30,054
idea because I guess everybody can get

1272
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:30,054
what precise information is and what

1273
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:30,054
belief updating, how it functions.

1274
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:33,058
In principle, this is teachable to most

1275
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:33,058
of us.

1276
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:48,073
Daniel: Yeah, one example that from the

1277
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:48,073
talk you mentioned, like, with the loss

1278
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:48,073
of an important person in our life, our

1279
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:48,073
social or our emotional support policies

1280
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:48,073
are going to have to be updated.

1281
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:57,082
If there was some source we went to for

1282
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:57,082
information and that source no longer

1283
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:57,082
became available, we would have to change

1284
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:57,082
our epistemic foraging.

1285
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:59,084
And of course, this exists in the social

1286
00:56:59,084 --> 00:56:59,084
space.

1287
00:56:57,082 --> 00:57:11,090
And so when life changes, when our

1288
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:11,090
generative model or when our generative

1289
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:11,090
process, our niche changes, we should

1290
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:11,090
expect the unexpected.

1291
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:31,110
It's a totally normal, surprising, but

1292
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,110
expected surprise event that opens up the

1293
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,110
discussion to like, there will be beliefs

1294
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,110
that will be changing, there will be new

1295
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,110
policies or policies that you didn't

1296
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,110
previously take.

1297
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:33,112
Maybe now is the time to try them out.

1298
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:37,116
And there's going to be volatility as

1299
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:37,116
you're learning the consequences of

1300
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:37,116
action.

1301
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:42,121
So stick with it and try something three

1302
00:57:42,121 --> 00:57:42,121
times before saying that it doesn't

1303
00:57:42,121 --> 00:57:42,121
work.

1304
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:49,128
Even without appeal to mathematics,

1305
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:49,128
that's very powerful.

1306
00:57:43,122 --> 00:58:03,136
And I think the way that somebody might

1307
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
say, well, in this double blind study,

1308
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
these two groups, this treatment that

1309
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
we're going to go with, it's been shown

1310
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
that in this context, these two groups,

1311
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
this group did better.

1312
00:57:49,128 --> 00:58:05,138
And no one says, well, slow down.

1313
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:08,141
The Ttest used a lot of mathematics.

1314
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:09,142
I'm not a statistics professor.

1315
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:28,161
So people accept the epistemology of the

1316
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:28,161
group differential statistics and of

1317
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:28,161
diagnostic statistics, even though one

1318
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:28,161
could do 100 PhDs in theoretical

1319
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:28,161
statistics and in computational

1320
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:28,161
statistics.

1321
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:39,172
And so it just speaks, I think, to the

1322
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
early stage when the field is even

1323
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
perceived as being math heavy because

1324
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
we're in such a methodological

1325
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
developmental stage.

1326
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:53,186
But there will be layers and ways of

1327
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:53,186
working that will not mention any more

1328
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:53,186
technical detail than someone just saying

1329
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:53,186
the double blind study has provided

1330
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:53,186
evidence for X.

1331
00:58:40,173 --> 00:58:58,190
Max: Yes, I can say two things about it.

1332
00:58:54,187 --> 00:59:05,192
The one thing is a philosophical thing

1333
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:05,192
Daniel Dennett talked about free floating

1334
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:05,192
rationales, right?

1335
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:11,198
So a free floating rationale, in case you

1336
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:11,198
don't know, is like when lions go for

1337
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:11,198
givels.

1338
00:59:05,192 --> 00:59:13,200
It's an example that he likes to give.

1339
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:26,212
The gazelles do these showboating types

1340
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:26,212
of jumps and the lions typically don't go

1341
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:26,212
after the gazelle that can show this

1342
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:26,212
behavior, but go after the injured ones

1343
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:26,212
that cannot do this anymore.

1344
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:26,213
Right.

1345
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:36,223
But we can be quite certain that neither

1346
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:36,223
the lion nor the gazelle knows what they

1347
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:36,223
are doing, but it works without

1348
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:36,223
knowledge.

1349
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:39,226
And this is what he calls a free floating

1350
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:39,226
rationale.

1351
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:49,236
There is a rationale behind the behavior

1352
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:49,236
of the lion, but he doesn't need to know

1353
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:49,236
it in order to take advantage of it.

1354
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:54,241
And this is the case for science and this

1355
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:54,241
is also the case for patients.

1356
00:59:49,236 --> 01:00:10,143
You don't need to know every detail of a

1357
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:10,143
mathematical formalism in order to grasp

1358
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:10,143
some of the concepts and to advance your

1359
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:10,143
understanding of the world using these

1360
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:10,143
concepts.

1361
00:59:54,241 --> 01:00:17,853
But of course it helps, but for patients

1362
01:00:17,853 --> 01:00:17,853
it's the same, and for us it's the same.

1363
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:23,479
And I think free floating rationales are

1364
01:00:23,479 --> 01:00:23,479
a really important concept to describe.

1365
01:00:17,869 --> 01:00:28,961
Why a lot of the times you don't need to

1366
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:28,961
know the exact formalisms.

1367
01:00:23,487 --> 01:00:41,201
And another idea that I want to give is

1368
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:41,201
more like science, of making niche

1369
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:41,201
constructions more applicable to the

1370
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:41,201
mainstream.

1371
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:48,945
And this is well, at the beginning it's

1372
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:48,945
hard because you need to program every

1373
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:48,945
little bit yourself.

1374
01:00:41,243 --> 01:00:51,294
There are no toolboxes, nothing to help

1375
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:51,294
you.

1376
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,547
Not really books, just a few experts.

1377
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:57,805
But after a while books come out.

1378
01:00:54,554 --> 01:01:01,652
After a while you get toolboxes that

1379
01:01:01,652 --> 01:01:01,652
actually simplify a lot of the process.

1380
01:00:57,818 --> 01:01:04,990
You don't need to write the helper

1381
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:04,990
functions yourself.

1382
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:25,050
You can use the toolbox in a lot of cases

1383
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:25,050
and so after a while it becomes more

1384
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:25,050
widely applicable in science and maybe at

1385
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:25,050
someday, I don't know, Spss or something,

1386
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:25,050
one of these statistics software, maybe

1387
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:25,050
not SPF, has like a way to click through

1388
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:25,050
active inference algorithms.

1389
01:01:05,035 --> 01:01:26,140
That's it.

1390
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:29,428
But then in principle everybody can use

1391
01:01:29,428 --> 01:01:29,428
it.

1392
01:01:26,154 --> 01:01:33,853
Then you have new problems because people

1393
01:01:33,853 --> 01:01:33,853
will use it without actually

1394
01:01:33,853 --> 01:01:33,853
understanding it.

1395
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:39,444
But I would predict that it gets simpler

1396
01:01:39,444 --> 01:01:39,444
and simpler to use.

1397
01:01:33,859 --> 01:01:48,034
And I would say overall this is a good

1398
01:01:48,034 --> 01:01:48,034
thing because this allows a lot more

1399
01:01:48,034 --> 01:01:48,034
scientists to jump in on the endeavor.

1400
01:01:39,459 --> 01:01:50,052
Daniel: Thanks.

1401
01:01:49,048 --> 01:01:50,055
Yeah.

1402
01:01:50,053 --> 01:01:51,065
Great points.

1403
01:01:50,055 --> 01:01:58,130
One of your quotes, the short one, was

1404
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:58,130
Existence precedes essence.

1405
01:01:52,072 --> 01:02:07,162
And it reminded me of a 2015 paper of

1406
01:02:07,162 --> 01:02:07,162
Friston and mathis which is entitled I Am

1407
01:02:07,162 --> 01:02:07,162
Therefore I Think.

1408
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:18,269
And that of course is a little bit of an

1409
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:18,269
inversion on I think therefore I am,

1410
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:18,269
which puts rumination before the horse or

1411
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:18,269
the cart before the horse.

1412
01:02:07,164 --> 01:02:21,309
I'm not exactly sure, but I think

1413
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:21,309
therefore I am.

1414
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:27,364
It actually puts thinking and ruminating

1415
01:02:27,364 --> 01:02:27,364
first.

1416
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:39,484
Whereas this existentialist quote that

1417
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:39,484
you provided concords well, with certain

1418
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:39,484
ways of thinking about reflexive systems

1419
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:39,484
in active inference.

1420
01:02:27,365 --> 01:02:44,534
So what did you mean with the

1421
01:02:44,534 --> 01:02:44,534
introduction of that quote?

1422
01:02:39,485 --> 01:02:51,602
And how does that existentialist angle

1423
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:51,602
play out in the clinical setting?

1424
01:02:44,535 --> 01:02:58,673
Max: Yeah, these are maybe two questions

1425
01:02:58,673 --> 01:02:58,673
disguised as one.

1426
01:02:54,633 --> 01:03:04,677
I start with the existentialist worldview

1427
01:03:04,677 --> 01:03:04,677
in clinical settings.

1428
01:02:59,682 --> 01:03:20,835
Well, I think it's important for clinical

1429
01:03:20,835 --> 01:03:20,835
science and more so for clinical practice

1430
01:03:20,835 --> 01:03:20,835
because we need to believe in a certain

1431
01:03:20,835 --> 01:03:20,835
type of liberty in order to help

1432
01:03:20,835 --> 01:03:20,835
patients.

1433
01:03:06,694 --> 01:03:35,986
If we believe everything is predetermined

1434
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:35,986
by, I don't know, brain chemistry, even

1435
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:35,986
if it's true, this will make changing

1436
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:35,986
your behavior hard because you can always

1437
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:35,986
say, well, I cannot change my behavior.

1438
01:03:20,837 --> 01:03:41,040
It's all in my, I don't know, genes or

1439
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,040
what type of biological reductionism you

1440
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,040
like.

1441
01:03:35,987 --> 01:03:52,151
So I guess we need these existentialist

1442
01:03:52,151 --> 01:03:52,151
idea that you yourself are in control of

1443
01:03:52,151 --> 01:03:52,151
your life in order to make therapy work.

1444
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:52,158
Right?

1445
01:03:52,151 --> 01:04:00,178
So we need to at least have a compatible

1446
01:04:00,178 --> 01:04:00,178
hard English word like this.

1447
01:03:53,160 --> 01:04:10,273
Even if determinism is true, we need to

1448
01:04:10,273 --> 01:04:10,273
have it combined with some sort of

1449
01:04:10,273 --> 01:04:10,273
liberty or belief in liberty.

1450
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:18,350
And I guess this is where active

1451
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:18,350
inference jumps in, because active

1452
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:18,350
inference allows a formal description

1453
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:18,350
about self control.

1454
01:04:10,275 --> 01:04:30,475
And then we have a definition of acting

1455
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:30,475
in the world and learning new things that

1456
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:30,475
doesn't require, like, fairy tales.

1457
01:04:18,356 --> 01:04:33,507
And it's compatible with determinism.

1458
01:04:31,481 --> 01:04:50,676
And with this worldview, you have a

1459
01:04:50,676 --> 01:04:50,676
worldview that on one hand is compatible

1460
01:04:50,676 --> 01:04:50,676
with determinism and on the other hand

1461
01:04:50,676 --> 01:04:50,676
allows for a concept like self control,

1462
01:04:50,676 --> 01:04:50,676
agency policy, learning all the things.

1463
01:04:34,517 --> 01:04:54,712
And so it can also be used for

1464
01:04:54,712 --> 01:04:54,712
psychotherapy.

1465
01:04:50,677 --> 01:05:01,723
Daniel: Interesting.

1466
01:05:00,716 --> 01:05:06,775
Max: I hope this answers the question,

1467
01:05:06,775 --> 01:05:06,775
but this is what I can say.

1468
01:05:03,742 --> 01:05:46,171
Daniel: Yeah, there's so much depth,

1469
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:46,171
obviously many threads and traditions in

1470
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:46,171
the clinical setting and that full stack

1471
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:46,171
from the manifest behavioral on through

1472
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:46,171
the cognitive and psychological, but

1473
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:46,171
verging or anchored in or descended from

1474
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:46,171
the metaphysical, that's a full spectrum

1475
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:46,171
area that seems like it must be navigated

1476
01:05:46,171 --> 01:05:46,171
in the clinician's education.

1477
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:57,285
But even in like the 1 hour that you're

1478
01:05:57,285 --> 01:05:57,285
spending with somebody, I imagine that it

1479
01:05:57,285 --> 01:05:57,285
could probably oscillate a lot in where

1480
01:05:57,285 --> 01:05:57,285
you're focusing from.

1481
01:05:46,177 --> 01:06:02,276
Here's how to tie your shoe to here's why

1482
01:06:02,276 --> 01:06:02,276
things matter.

1483
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:04,290
Abstractly.

1484
01:06:02,277 --> 01:06:16,415
Max: There's more philosophy, especially

1485
01:06:16,415 --> 01:06:16,415
practical philosophy for therapy, than

1486
01:06:16,415 --> 01:06:16,415
one would think because patients bring it

1487
01:06:16,415 --> 01:06:16,415
up all the time.

1488
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:17,423
Right?

1489
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:30,551
I mean, one of the problems of depression

1490
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:30,551
is if it's going to be really severe, is

1491
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:30,551
this, for example, nihilism kicks in so

1492
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:30,551
nothing makes sense anymore.

1493
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:34,592
And then, as you said, why should

1494
01:06:34,592 --> 01:06:34,592
anything matter at all?

1495
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:38,637
Then becomes an interesting question and

1496
01:06:38,637 --> 01:06:38,637
a pressing question for them.

1497
01:06:34,593 --> 01:06:40,656
Daniel: What's your go to response?

1498
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,671
Why does anything matter?

1499
01:06:40,657 --> 01:06:52,779
Max: It's a hard question I would try to

1500
01:06:52,779 --> 01:06:52,779
get do you always thought that nothing

1501
01:06:52,779 --> 01:06:52,779
matters?

1502
01:06:43,686 --> 01:06:56,813
What was different when something

1503
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:56,813
mattered for you?

1504
01:06:53,780 --> 01:07:10,897
How was your life then and what changed

1505
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:10,897
why you came to these conclusions now and

1506
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:10,897
how do you feel when you think about your

1507
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:10,897
old worldview versus new worldview?

1508
01:06:56,814 --> 01:07:18,970
So I would try to challenge their

1509
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:18,970
worldview by their own worldview a few

1510
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:18,970
years ago.

1511
01:07:10,898 --> 01:07:29,087
This is not always working because you

1512
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:29,087
have patients that have actually gone

1513
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:29,087
through a lot of difficult times in their

1514
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:29,087
lives but typically like their work view

1515
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:29,087
was not always depressed.

1516
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:35,147
Daniel: Yes, that seems to do multiple

1517
01:07:35,147 --> 01:07:35,147
things.

1518
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:47,260
By responding to a question with a

1519
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:47,260
question it puts an active posture back

1520
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:47,260
into the conversation.

1521
01:07:36,151 --> 01:07:55,344
So at the very least policies can be

1522
01:07:55,344 --> 01:07:55,344
selected that aren't rumination and

1523
01:07:55,344 --> 01:07:55,344
consequences could be learned.

1524
01:07:47,262 --> 01:08:05,386
Even if there's going to be a higher low

1525
01:08:05,386 --> 01:08:05,386
precision on that learning at least it

1526
01:08:05,386 --> 01:08:05,386
opens the door to movements.

1527
01:07:55,344 --> 01:08:28,617
Whereas just well person X said this or

1528
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:28,617
that, that response may land or inspire

1529
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:28,617
or not but it reifies the Pacification

1530
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:28,617
and therefore may not kind of like an

1531
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:28,617
inactive layer promote the movement.

1532
01:08:05,388 --> 01:08:45,788
Max: Yeah, I just wanted to say awesome

1533
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:45,788
things the same and if you try something

1534
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:45,788
like person XY that says this is the

1535
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:45,788
reason why your life works, this will in

1536
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:45,788
most cases not work at all.

1537
01:08:30,632 --> 01:08:54,873
They will say something like but this

1538
01:08:54,873 --> 01:08:54,873
person doesn't go through that many

1539
01:08:54,873 --> 01:08:54,873
hardships that I did what is oftentimes

1540
01:08:54,873 --> 01:08:54,873
true or something like that.

1541
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:54,876
Right?

1542
01:08:54,873 --> 01:09:05,929
So often it's better if the ideas are

1543
01:09:05,929 --> 01:09:05,929
sampled from their own generative models

1544
01:09:05,929 --> 01:09:05,929
from a lost part of the distribution, so

1545
01:09:05,929 --> 01:09:05,929
to say, and not from outside.

1546
01:08:54,877 --> 01:09:19,064
Typically you have to try to get them to

1547
01:09:19,064 --> 01:09:19,064
think out of their own worldview and not

1548
01:09:19,064 --> 01:09:19,064
of your work view or someone else's

1549
01:09:19,064 --> 01:09:19,064
worldview with the seldom functions.

1550
01:09:06,932 --> 01:09:34,211
Daniel: So another interesting area you

1551
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:34,211
mentioned the problem difficulty,

1552
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:34,211
complexity, time uncertainty

1553
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:34,211
estimations.

1554
01:09:23,101 --> 01:09:53,403
So kind of like a cognitive task analysis

1555
01:09:53,403 --> 01:09:53,403
in the CBT setting where different tasks

1556
01:09:53,403 --> 01:09:53,403
are estimated again along these axes of

1557
01:09:53,403 --> 01:09:53,403
how challenging is that for you or how

1558
01:09:53,403 --> 01:09:53,403
complex does that task seem to you, how

1559
01:09:53,403 --> 01:09:53,403
does that really play out?

1560
01:09:34,212 --> 01:10:35,768
Because it really seems like something in

1561
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
the email inbox or in writing a paper

1562
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
with some improved signposting or

1563
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
learning even around which tasks are

1564
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
hard, which tasks are clear, which tasks

1565
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
are threatening our well being, those

1566
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
kinds of metadata on policy selection and

1567
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
being able to see that could help us

1568
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
select better policy and not to change

1569
01:10:35,768 --> 01:10:35,768
our preferences.

1570
01:09:53,405 --> 01:11:04,990
Which is how sometimes behavior change is

1571
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:04,990
approached by changing what people are

1572
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:04,990
supposed to want, but by bringing this

1573
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:04,990
kind of cybernetic clarity around action

1574
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:04,990
selection to support people in different

1575
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:04,990
contexts, making the decisions that can

1576
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:04,990
then credibly be said to be more in

1577
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:04,990
alignment with what they do want.

1578
01:10:36,776 --> 01:11:16,111
Max: Yeah, what is typically already been

1579
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:16,111
done is to let patients guess how high

1580
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:16,111
they would rate the probability of

1581
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:16,111
succeeding right.

1582
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:23,182
So when we do this behavioral therapy,

1583
01:11:23,182 --> 01:11:23,182
they are typically asked, okay, what do

1584
01:11:23,182 --> 01:11:23,182
you think?

1585
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:24,199
How probable is that?

1586
01:11:23,182 --> 01:11:27,228
You're going to go there until next

1587
01:11:27,228 --> 01:11:27,228
week?

1588
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:38,333
And it's a rule of thumb by clinicians

1589
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:38,333
that has no Bayesian science, but we say

1590
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:38,333
if it's 80% or higher probability, one

1591
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:38,333
should aim for it.

1592
01:11:28,235 --> 01:11:40,350
If it's lower, it's too difficult.

1593
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:50,459
But if it's trivial, if it's 99.9%

1594
01:11:50,459 --> 01:11:50,459
probability, it's also not worth

1595
01:11:50,459 --> 01:11:50,459
typically pursuing, at least not always.

1596
01:11:41,363 --> 01:12:01,500
But I guess the problem with that is that

1597
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:01,500
I don't know a solution for this is my

1598
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:01,500
subjective probability, right.

1599
01:11:52,473 --> 01:12:16,656
How I think, how probable it is, I don't

1600
01:12:16,656 --> 01:12:16,656
have a good grasp in all cases on how

1601
01:12:16,656 --> 01:12:16,656
difficult it really is for me because

1602
01:12:16,656 --> 01:12:16,656
there are all sorts of biases that would

1603
01:12:16,656 --> 01:12:16,656
keep me from making such assumptions.

1604
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:18,675
I don't have a solution for that.

1605
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:32,816
But what would be good is to have more

1606
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:32,816
variables that we could estimate in order

1607
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:32,816
to actually have more information on how

1608
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:32,816
difficult a task is.

1609
01:12:18,675 --> 01:12:34,838
But for most cases we haven't.

1610
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:42,918
And when we have them, we know that what

1611
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:42,918
patients think, how difficult it is and

1612
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:42,918
how difficult it really is hasn't the

1613
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:42,918
best correlation.

1614
01:12:35,842 --> 01:12:52,010
Sure, it's positively correlated, but how

1615
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:52,010
good I think my short term memory, for

1616
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:52,010
example, is and how good it really is is

1617
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:52,010
not the same.

1618
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:55,048
And this is hard to solve problems for

1619
01:12:55,048 --> 01:12:55,048
clinical science.

1620
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:59,082
I have to think about it longer, but it

1621
01:12:59,082 --> 01:12:59,082
would.

1622
01:12:56,049 --> 01:13:06,098
Giving patients tool to actually improve

1623
01:13:06,098 --> 01:13:06,098
their probability estimates would be

1624
01:13:06,098 --> 01:13:06,098
great.

1625
01:13:00,033 --> 01:13:13,168
But I guess it's also hard to do due to

1626
01:13:13,168 --> 01:13:13,168
all these things that you said before.

1627
01:13:07,106 --> 01:13:14,171
Right.

1628
01:13:13,169 --> 01:13:30,335
If the problem is complex, multi layered,

1629
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:30,335
and has a lot of variation and good luck

1630
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:30,335
actually finding a way to estimating

1631
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:30,335
probabilities, but we could start for

1632
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:30,335
simple problems and maybe this helps

1633
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:30,335
patients, but I have to think about it

1634
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:30,335
more.

1635
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:34,377
To be honest, it's not easy to find

1636
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:34,377
better solutions there.

1637
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:38,411
Daniel: Yeah.

1638
01:13:37,406 --> 01:14:00,570
Even just on paper or digitally

1639
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:00,570
journaling, but then eventually

1640
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:00,570
potentially integrating with the kinds of

1641
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:00,570
formal models we've been discussing, it

1642
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:00,570
can be really nice to know, hey, there's

1643
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:00,570
a lot of stuff that you said had a below

1644
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:00,570
50 chance of happening and nine out of

1645
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:00,570
ten times you've done that.

1646
01:13:38,412 --> 01:14:05,627
So maybe next time you're in the zone of

1647
01:14:05,627 --> 01:14:05,627
uncertainty, just go for it.

1648
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:21,780
You tend to systematically overestimate

1649
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:21,780
your confidence in this or you

1650
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:21,780
overestimate how much other people will

1651
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:21,780
appreciate this kind of consequence.

1652
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:27,849
And maybe writing three thank you notes a

1653
01:14:27,849 --> 01:14:27,849
day would be a great use of 20 minutes.

1654
01:14:21,781 --> 01:14:34,914
Max: Yeah, these are all really good

1655
01:14:34,914 --> 01:14:34,914
ideas and this is also things that are

1656
01:14:34,914 --> 01:14:34,914
done right.

1657
01:14:28,852 --> 01:14:41,983
What is missing, but what is doable in

1658
01:14:41,983 --> 01:14:41,983
principle is tracking certain behavior.

1659
01:14:34,915 --> 01:14:46,030
Like an easy example would be aggressive

1660
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:46,030
behavior.

1661
01:14:41,983 --> 01:14:53,104
For example, counting how much verbal

1662
01:14:53,104 --> 01:14:53,104
aggression was shown or physical

1663
01:14:53,104 --> 01:14:53,104
aggression was shown over the days.

1664
01:14:46,031 --> 01:14:59,161
And then look what the expectation of the

1665
01:14:59,161 --> 01:14:59,161
patient was.

1666
01:14:53,109 --> 01:15:06,174
And comparing those two and there you

1667
01:15:06,174 --> 01:15:06,174
could do like patient belief updating in

1668
01:15:06,174 --> 01:15:06,174
a simplified form.

1669
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:09,208
Yeah, this would be a great idea.

1670
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:16,270
It's always then possible I would say

1671
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:16,270
when the behavior is clear enough and

1672
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:16,270
easy enough to count right.

1673
01:15:10,212 --> 01:15:34,457
As soon as if it's getting more unclear

1674
01:15:34,457 --> 01:15:34,457
this will not work but it could work for

1675
01:15:34,457 --> 01:15:34,457
a lot of problem behaviors like self

1676
01:15:34,457 --> 01:15:34,457
harm, aggression, lying in bed, like in

1677
01:15:34,457 --> 01:15:34,457
depression, something like that.

1678
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:54,651
Daniel: So it makes me think about that

1679
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:54,651
contrast that you provided between reward

1680
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:54,651
oriented frameworks which struggle to

1681
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:54,651
describe rumination as it's not in the

1682
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:54,651
short or medium or long term necessarily

1683
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:54,651
oriented with rewards.

1684
01:15:36,470 --> 01:16:02,676
So the only explanation becomes well,

1685
01:16:02,676 --> 01:16:02,676
something is off in the reward function

1686
01:16:02,676 --> 01:16:02,676
which is kind of tautological.

1687
01:15:54,651 --> 01:16:06,713
And so that's a little bit of a local and

1688
01:16:06,713 --> 01:16:06,713
a constrained explanation.

1689
01:16:02,678 --> 01:16:33,986
Whereas when we see policy selection

1690
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:33,986
external overt movement in the world as

1691
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:33,986
well as internal COVID policy selection

1692
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:33,986
like attention and mental action when we

1693
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:33,986
see those actions as being oriented

1694
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:33,986
around reduction of free energy which is

1695
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:33,986
bounding surprise and therefore, based

1696
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:33,986
upon what is likely, not what is

1697
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:33,986
necessarily the most rewarding.

1698
01:16:06,715 --> 01:16:43,087
It opens up that view to, again say, how

1699
01:16:43,087 --> 01:16:43,087
many of this behavior do you expect to

1700
01:16:43,087 --> 01:16:43,087
happen in the next week?

1701
01:16:35,002 --> 01:16:49,140
Yes, in a dream world we would aim for

1702
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:49,140
zero of event of this number.

1703
01:16:43,088 --> 01:16:51,165
We'll aim for you to be full time

1704
01:16:51,165 --> 01:16:51,165
employed by next week.

1705
01:16:49,142 --> 01:16:57,225
That sounds awesome but what do we

1706
01:16:57,225 --> 01:16:57,225
honestly expect in 12345 weeks?

1707
01:16:51,166 --> 01:17:15,349
And then we're going to actually be

1708
01:17:15,349 --> 01:17:15,349
looking back in and then instead of maybe

1709
01:17:15,349 --> 01:17:15,349
feeling like well you're going to leave

1710
01:17:15,349 --> 01:17:15,349
the port and then you're going to have to

1711
01:17:15,349 --> 01:17:15,349
sail across an ocean it can be more like

1712
01:17:15,349 --> 01:17:15,349
there are checkpoints.

1713
01:16:57,227 --> 01:17:18,373
We're looking back at the buoys that we

1714
01:17:18,373 --> 01:17:18,373
passed.

1715
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:21,405
We have the next three buoys that we're

1716
01:17:21,405 --> 01:17:21,405
looking towards.

1717
01:17:18,374 --> 01:17:28,473
We can do smaller corrections and there

1718
01:17:28,473 --> 01:17:28,473
will be volatility so there's going to

1719
01:17:28,473 --> 01:17:28,473
continue to be surprised.

1720
01:17:21,407 --> 01:17:50,698
We're not going to exactly hit every

1721
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:50,698
milestone per se but if we are on this

1722
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:50,698
trajectory we're going to be moving

1723
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:50,698
essentially as much as we possibly could

1724
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:50,698
in the right direction and spending less

1725
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:50,698
time just hypothesizing about like a

1726
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:50,698
total counterfactual world where the

1727
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:50,698
issue is already resolved.

1728
01:17:28,474 --> 01:17:56,757
Max: Yes and this is a metaphor that is

1729
01:17:56,757 --> 01:17:56,757
also used in therapy quite often, right.

1730
01:17:51,702 --> 01:17:58,778
The one of the mountain climber.

1731
01:17:56,757 --> 01:18:04,770
And the mountain climber typically needs

1732
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:04,770
a guide if he's a newbie.

1733
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:19,924
And what psychotherapy can do is provide

1734
01:18:19,924 --> 01:18:19,924
a good way over the mountain, so to say,

1735
01:18:19,924 --> 01:18:19,924
provide a good place for resting, doing

1736
01:18:19,924 --> 01:18:19,924
the next step, doing the next step, doing

1737
01:18:19,924 --> 01:18:19,924
the next step.

1738
01:18:04,772 --> 01:18:22,958
And, yeah, this is really resonating with

1739
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:22,958
what you said.

1740
01:18:19,926 --> 01:18:35,008
Namely, we have to take a big problem and

1741
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:35,008
cut it into little problems that we can

1742
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:35,008
solve one after another, so it becomes

1743
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:35,008
plausible to actually solve it.

1744
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:39,012
Yes, I would totally agree and

1745
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:39,012
emotional.

1746
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:43,016
Daniel: Flanker tasks, I'm not exactly

1747
01:18:43,016 --> 01:18:43,016
sure what those would be.

1748
01:18:39,012 --> 01:19:08,035
But it just made me think of our policy

1749
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,035
selection throughout the day and all of

1750
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,035
the fires we have to put out or all of

1751
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,035
the bubbling soups that we have to tend

1752
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,035
to with thirst and rest and breathing and

1753
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,035
physical exercise and all of these

1754
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,035
different aspects to our cognitive and

1755
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,035
emotional well being.

1756
01:18:43,016 --> 01:19:20,047
It's like there's many things to attend

1757
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:20,047
to which is why our attention is so

1758
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:20,047
variable as a feature, it's not a bug.

1759
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:46,073
So the fact that we have exactly

1760
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
pathological or not just neurodiverse

1761
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
states that involve a fixation of

1762
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
attention and also the inability to

1763
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
fixate attention, it just starts with our

1764
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
experience of the day and of our

1765
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
attention to our body and our

1766
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
surroundings and to the bigger questions

1767
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
that we know impinge on us.

1768
01:19:20,047 --> 01:20:09,090
But also we can't necessarily have the

1769
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
geopolitics and the climate change solved

1770
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
just by thinking about it but we also

1771
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
don't want to neglect what are important

1772
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
issues and then seeing strategies and

1773
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
having the discussion about strategies

1774
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
and tactics in that attentional space

1775
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,090
instead of in the reward space.

1776
01:19:46,073 --> 01:20:25,106
Not to bash or anything like that, but

1777
01:20:25,106 --> 01:20:25,106
that conversation is about well, what

1778
01:20:25,106 --> 01:20:25,106
should we value more or less and then why

1779
01:20:25,106 --> 01:20:25,106
are these values translating effectively

1780
01:20:25,106 --> 01:20:25,106
or not into behavior?

1781
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:39,120
Whereas the attention and surprise angle

1782
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,120
is like being more in the game and your

1783
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,120
local view instead of watching the game

1784
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,120
and just saying, well, I want this to be

1785
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,120
the outcome.

1786
01:20:25,106 --> 01:20:47,128
Max: Exactly, yeah, I want to say a

1787
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
little bit about this attention focus and

1788
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
attention spreading that you mentioned.

1789
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:52,132
I almost said it in the talk but I say it

1790
01:20:52,132 --> 01:20:52,132
now.

1791
01:20:48,129 --> 01:21:00,135
Like for example, ADHD is not necessarily

1792
01:21:00,135 --> 01:21:00,135
like disorder in the sense that it's a

1793
01:21:00,135 --> 01:21:00,135
dysfunction, right?

1794
01:20:52,133 --> 01:21:24,159
So it can also be described or maybe

1795
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:24,159
better described as a neurodivergent

1796
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:24,159
property of some human beings so they

1797
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:24,159
shift attention more easily and this is

1798
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:24,159
depending on the environment, a good

1799
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:24,159
thing because if you stuck your attention

1800
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:24,159
at one place too much well, you might not

1801
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:24,159
notice what is going around in your

1802
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:24,159
surroundings.

1803
01:21:00,135 --> 01:21:30,165
So you have to be able to focus away from

1804
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:30,165
certain points of attention.

1805
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:38,173
And you want to have, in a group,

1806
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:38,173
individuals that have really sticky

1807
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:38,173
attention so they can focus on a task

1808
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:38,173
really good.

1809
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:48,183
But you also want to have the other ones

1810
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:48,183
that have really floating attention spans

1811
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:48,183
in order to see new opportunities or see

1812
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:48,183
danger.

1813
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:55,190
And so I think this can be really easily

1814
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:55,190
explained by evolutionary theory, right?

1815
01:21:49,184 --> 01:22:03,192
So we have variance over the population

1816
01:22:03,192 --> 01:22:03,192
and this variance is not a bug, it's a

1817
01:22:03,192 --> 01:22:03,192
feature.

1818
01:21:55,190 --> 01:22:19,208
And on the more extreme ends of the

1819
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:19,208
variance you find phenotypes that are

1820
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:19,208
problematic from time to time but

1821
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:19,208
depending on the surroundings, always

1822
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:19,208
depending on the surroundings, right?

1823
01:22:04,193 --> 01:22:29,218
So on the one hand you might have

1824
01:22:29,218 --> 01:22:29,218
something like OCD like behavior and on

1825
01:22:29,218 --> 01:22:29,218
the other hand something like more ADHD

1826
01:22:29,218 --> 01:22:29,218
like behavior and it can even jump

1827
01:22:29,218 --> 01:22:29,218
between the two.

1828
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:36,225
Interestingly, but this is not

1829
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:36,225
necessarily always bad.

1830
01:22:29,218 --> 01:22:38,227
It really depends on your environment.

1831
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:47,236
And that humans differ with respect to

1832
01:22:47,236 --> 01:22:47,236
this parameters is also not a bug, but a

1833
01:22:47,236 --> 01:22:47,236
feature of evolution, I would say, and

1834
01:22:47,236 --> 01:22:47,236
also a feature of our learning history.

1835
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:48,237
Of course.

1836
01:22:47,236 --> 01:22:52,241
Daniel: Totally agreed.

1837
01:22:51,240 --> 01:23:09,252
For individual and collective behavioral

1838
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
strategies, they're often discussed as if

1839
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
they were context independence when there

1840
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
are ant colony foraging strategies that

1841
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
work in the desert and they work not as

1842
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
well in the jungle.

1843
01:22:52,241 --> 01:23:17,260
So just like it is with our attention,

1844
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:17,260
there's attention surroundings that

1845
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:17,260
support this kind of work, but not that

1846
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:17,260
kind of work or well being.

1847
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:33,276
So being able to talk about the

1848
01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:33,276
generative model and the generative

1849
01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:33,276
process and their engagements in a rich

1850
01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:33,276
way, I guess it's what brings us

1851
01:23:33,276 --> 01:23:33,276
together.

1852
01:23:17,260 --> 01:24:00,297
But it's also what feels like a powerful

1853
01:24:00,297 --> 01:24:00,297
place to regather and remember a lot of

1854
01:24:00,297 --> 01:24:00,297
the important qualitative threads and

1855
01:24:00,297 --> 01:24:00,297
empirical threads in this important

1856
01:24:00,297 --> 01:24:00,297
clinical area and also move forward in a

1857
01:24:00,297 --> 01:24:00,297
way that's not just adding like another

1858
01:24:00,297 --> 01:24:00,297
measurement onto the pile.

1859
01:23:34,276 --> 01:24:30,327
Because a lot of these models, as you

1860
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:30,327
continue to develop their formality and

1861
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:30,327
ambiguity to integrate data, they will

1862
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:30,327
provide a new view on previous findings

1863
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:30,327
and patterns that may have been taken in

1864
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:30,327
the Ttest reward learning world to be

1865
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:30,327
conclusive, or this or that will be shown

1866
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:30,327
to be just two darts thrown into a huge

1867
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:30,327
neurodiversity space.

1868
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:57,354
And there might be other studies or sets

1869
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:57,354
of studies where what was treated as

1870
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:57,354
being all over the place are now

1871
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:57,354
perfectly in line and tell a really

1872
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:57,354
coherent story about, for example, how

1873
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:57,354
strong negative beliefs about the self

1874
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:57,354
and others or high uncertainty of beliefs

1875
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:57,354
about the consequences of action end up

1876
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:57,354
helping us just do what we do.

1877
01:24:30,327 --> 01:25:00,351
Max: Yes, totally agree.

1878
01:24:58,355 --> 01:25:15,366
Maybe it's interesting there's even

1879
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:15,366
reconceptualization going on, like

1880
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:15,366
thinking about psychopathology in more

1881
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:15,366
like evolutionary terms, like Stefan

1882
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:15,366
Hoffman, for example, and Stephen Hayes.

1883
01:25:02,353 --> 01:25:20,371
Stephen Hayes is known as the founding

1884
01:25:20,371 --> 01:25:20,371
father of Acts.

1885
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:23,374
So acceptance and commitment based

1886
01:25:23,374 --> 01:25:23,374
therapy.

1887
01:25:20,371 --> 01:25:32,383
And those two guys have a new therapy

1888
01:25:32,383 --> 01:25:32,383
idea where we describe psychopathology on

1889
01:25:32,383 --> 01:25:32,383
a pragmatic basis.

1890
01:25:23,374 --> 01:25:39,390
So we define psychopathology as behavior

1891
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:39,390
that doesn't fit any more the current

1892
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:39,390
circumstances.

1893
01:25:32,383 --> 01:25:42,393
So there you have the context and right.

1894
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:56,407
And I think it's clever to do it more

1895
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
that way because, for example, PTSD like

1896
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
behavior, well, if you're a soldier in a

1897
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
really bad region of the world, this is

1898
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
not psychopathology.

1899
01:25:42,393 --> 01:25:59,410
This is allowing you to survive.

1900
01:25:56,407 --> 01:26:11,416
The problem is of PTSD, that the war

1901
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:11,416
comes home with you or dramatically bend

1902
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:11,416
comes home with you, and now your

1903
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:11,416
behavior doesn't fit the environment

1904
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:11,416
anymore.

1905
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:12,417
Right.

1906
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:21,426
And I think this is a neat way of

1907
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
describing a lot of psychopathology as

1908
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
maladaptive behavior in the evolutionary

1909
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
sense.

1910
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:23,428
And typically it was adaptive in the

1911
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:23,428
past.

1912
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:47,452
Like, also, what this, like, borderline

1913
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:47,452
personality disorder slide that I have on

1914
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:47,452
the screen right now is the same because

1915
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:47,452
it was adaptive in the past to behave

1916
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:47,452
like this in some circumstances, in a

1917
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:47,452
bare childhood, so to say, but it's not

1918
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:47,452
anymore, but it's continued despite being

1919
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:47,452
ineffective.

1920
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:50,455
And I guess this is a good definition for

1921
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:50,455
a lot of psychopathology.

1922
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:52,457
Not for all, I would say.

1923
01:26:50,455 --> 01:27:02,461
For example, there is really

1924
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:02,461
psychopathology where you have broken

1925
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:02,461
inference, so to say, and not just for

1926
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:02,461
example in psychosis.

1927
01:26:52,457 --> 01:27:14,473
In some cases I would say yes, you have

1928
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:14,473
more like brain pathology, you have more

1929
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:14,473
really broken inference, and the rules of

1930
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:14,473
active inference don't work anymore, so

1931
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:14,473
to say.

1932
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:15,474
But I don't think that the rules.

1933
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:18,476
Active inference lab don't work in

1934
01:27:18,476 --> 01:27:18,476
rumination.

1935
01:27:15,474 --> 01:27:33,492
They work perfectly fine, but the

1936
01:27:33,492 --> 01:27:33,492
organism has placed himself in a

1937
01:27:33,492 --> 01:27:33,492
situation where they don't learn anything

1938
01:27:33,492 --> 01:27:33,492
new by applying the same rules that

1939
01:27:33,492 --> 01:27:33,492
everybody else applies.

1940
01:27:18,477 --> 01:27:37,496
So it's broken models, not broken

1941
01:27:37,496 --> 01:27:37,496
inference.

1942
01:27:33,492 --> 01:27:39,498
And I guess this is true for a lot of

1943
01:27:39,498 --> 01:27:39,498
psychopathology.

1944
01:27:37,496 --> 01:27:50,509
Daniel: So what are your next moves with

1945
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:50,509
this line of research?

1946
01:27:45,504 --> 01:27:52,511
You mentioned some of the papers.

1947
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:56,515
What would you like those papers to

1948
01:27:56,515 --> 01:27:56,515
show?

1949
01:27:52,511 --> 01:27:58,517
Or who would you like them to speak to?

1950
01:27:56,515 --> 01:27:59,518
And show what?

1951
01:27:58,517 --> 01:28:07,520
Max: Maybe I start with the literature

1952
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:07,520
review that we are planning.

1953
01:28:02,515 --> 01:28:16,529
I would like to get to know what the

1954
01:28:16,529 --> 01:28:16,529
literature, so to say, says about active

1955
01:28:16,529 --> 01:28:16,529
inference informed treatments.

1956
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:18,531
This is what I would like to find out.

1957
01:28:16,529 --> 01:28:20,533
I don't have a lot of hypotheses.

1958
01:28:18,531 --> 01:28:30,543
I want to screen the literature and find

1959
01:28:30,543 --> 01:28:30,543
out whether we can synthesize them into

1960
01:28:30,543 --> 01:28:30,543
an active inference informed model of

1961
01:28:30,543 --> 01:28:30,543
what is psychotherapy doing.

1962
01:28:20,533 --> 01:28:35,548
And I would like to speak this model to a

1963
01:28:35,548 --> 01:28:35,548
clinical audience in the first place.

1964
01:28:31,544 --> 01:28:42,554
Again, so I want the clinical population

1965
01:28:42,554 --> 01:28:42,554
to learn more about active inference.

1966
01:28:35,548 --> 01:28:52,565
I know that psychiatrists sometimes know

1967
01:28:52,565 --> 01:28:52,565
about active inference literature, but

1968
01:28:52,565 --> 01:28:52,565
psychologists, at least not clinical

1969
01:28:52,565 --> 01:28:52,565
psychologists, typically don't know a lot

1970
01:28:52,565 --> 01:28:52,565
about it.

1971
01:28:42,555 --> 01:28:55,567
And I would like to change this a little

1972
01:28:55,567 --> 01:28:55,567
bit at least.

1973
01:28:52,565 --> 01:29:05,572
And afterwards the next logical step

1974
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:05,572
would be to implement some of the insight

1975
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:05,572
into actual therapy programs.

1976
01:28:56,569 --> 01:29:06,573
But this is something for more of the

1977
01:29:06,573 --> 01:29:06,573
future.

1978
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:15,582
But it would be interesting whether you

1979
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:15,582
can really have something like an active

1980
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:15,582
inference informed therapy, but now we

1981
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:15,582
are talking more like five to ten years.

1982
01:29:07,574 --> 01:29:17,584
Daniel: Awesome.

1983
01:29:17,584 --> 01:29:21,588
Do you have any final thoughts or

1984
01:29:21,588 --> 01:29:21,588
questions?

1985
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:25,592
And then I will close with a short quote

1986
01:29:25,592 --> 01:29:25,592
to fire back.

1987
01:29:21,588 --> 01:29:28,595
Max: Yes, you are.

1988
01:29:26,593 --> 01:29:31,598
No, I don't have any final remarks or

1989
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:31,598
questions.

1990
01:29:28,595 --> 01:29:38,605
I would like to thank you for giving me

1991
01:29:38,605 --> 01:29:38,605
the opportunity to speak and now I want

1992
01:29:38,605 --> 01:29:38,605
to resolve my uncertainty regarding the

1993
01:29:38,605 --> 01:29:38,605
quote.

1994
01:29:31,598 --> 01:29:40,607
Great.

1995
01:29:39,606 --> 01:29:54,621
Daniel: The quote is from Henry David

1996
01:29:54,621 --> 01:29:54,621
Thoreau and it's drawing a connection

1997
01:29:54,621 --> 01:29:54,621
between the paths that we ruminate on,

1998
01:29:54,621 --> 01:29:54,621
that we walk upon and travel upon, and

1999
01:29:54,621 --> 01:29:54,621
then the paths in the mind.

2000
01:29:40,607 --> 01:29:58,625
So I thought it was Africa, so throw a

2001
01:29:58,625 --> 01:29:58,625
rope.

2002
01:29:54,621 --> 01:30:00,621
I had not lived there a week before.

2003
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:06,627
My feet wore a path from my door to the

2004
01:30:06,627 --> 01:30:06,627
pond side and though it is five or six

2005
01:30:06,627 --> 01:30:06,627
years since I trot it.

2006
01:30:00,621 --> 01:30:07,628
It is still quite distinct.

2007
01:30:06,627 --> 01:30:12,633
It is true, I fear, that others may have

2008
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:12,633
fallen into it and so helped to keep it

2009
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:12,633
open.

2010
01:30:08,629 --> 01:30:16,637
The surface of the earth is soft and

2011
01:30:16,637 --> 01:30:16,637
impressive by the feet of men.

2012
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:23,644
And so with the paths which the mind

2013
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:23,644
travels how worn and dusty then must be

2014
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:23,644
the highways of the world.

2015
01:30:16,637 --> 01:30:26,647
How deep the ruts of tradition and

2016
01:30:26,647 --> 01:30:26,647
conformity.

2017
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:29,650
Max: Thank you.

2018
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:31,652
Awesome.

2019
01:30:30,651 --> 01:30:32,653
And thank you for having me.

2020
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:34,655
Daniel: Till next time.

2021
01:30:33,654 --> 01:30:35,656
Thanks a lot.

2022
01:30:34,655 --> 01:30:36,657
Max: See you.

2023
01:30:35,656 --> 01:30:36,657
Bye.
