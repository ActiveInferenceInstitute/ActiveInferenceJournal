00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,993
Daniel Friedman: Hello, it's June 23rd, 2023.

2
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:09,072
We're in ActInf GuestStream Number 46.1

3
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:11,198
with Denise Holt.

4
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:13,435
So Denise, thank you very much for

5
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:14,498
joining.

6
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:16,742
We'll have your presentation first, any

7
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:18,898
length of time you want,

8
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:20,144
and then we'll have a discussion about

9
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:23,397
some of the topics you're bringing up,

10
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:26,718
and I'll read some comments from the live

11
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:27,797
chat too.

12
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:28,990
So thanks again, Denise, looking forward

13
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,097
to your presentation.

14
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,379
Denise Holt: Hi, Daniel. Thank you so much for

15
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:34,496
having me today.

16
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:37,796
Yeah, so let's just dive right in.

17
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:40,118
Today I'm going to be talking about

18
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:44,495
Active Inference AI and the Spatial Web.

19
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:47,893
And for those who are not familiar, there

20
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:51,194
is a company called Verses AI,

21
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:56,711
and they're basically delivering the next

22
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:58,894
generation of AI.

23
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:00,561
This is beyond the current machine

24
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,799
learning, deep learning models

25
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,075
that we're all so familiar with that are

26
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:07,199
incredible tools,

27
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:09,399
but really those are tools.

28
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:11,645
They are great at creating content,

29
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:14,898
performing tasks, things like that,

30
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:19,480
but they operate in a way that is pattern

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,597
matching,

32
00:01:21,597 --> 00:01:23,853
and they're all siloed in their ability

33
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:25,997
for what they can do.

34
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:27,285
They're trained on enormous amounts of

35
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:31,596
data to increase the pattern recognition

36
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:34,929
and hopefully increase accurate outputs,

37
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,196
but that's really what they do.

38
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,444
What Verses has created is something

39
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:41,595
completely different,

40
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:44,895
and it's based on Active Inference.

41
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:47,024
And so Active Inference AI is entirely

42
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,029
new,

43
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:51,065
and this is the AI that will be able to

44
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:53,079
get us to AGI,

45
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,114
leading to synthetic self-evolving

46
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:58,129
intelligence.

47
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:02,112
So today what I'm going to be talking

48
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,112
about in this deck is Active Inference

49
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:07,159
AI

50
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,184
and the Spatial Web and how these

51
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:12,209
technologies are going to affect

52
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,229
and change the world.

53
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:16,255
We'll talk about how Active Inference

54
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:19,279
works with artificial intelligence,

55
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:22,311
how the Spatial Web protocol enables the

56
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:23,319
perception

57
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,349
and the belief updating of the AI,

58
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,370
and how these technologies together

59
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,389
enable the only AI in the world

60
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:33,423
that can run critical operations for

61
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:36,449
systems or infrastructure,

62
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:38,469
smart cities, the planet.

63
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,497
So when you're talking about airports,

64
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:43,519
hospitals, things like that.

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,559
So, yeah, so let's dive right in.

66
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,589
So the Spatial Web, what is that?

67
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:52,614
So the Spatial Web is being called the

68
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:54,629
network of everything.

69
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,653
Basically, it's the next evolution of the

70
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:57,659
internet,

71
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,630
and it's powered by AI.

72
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,662
So this is taking us from a library of

73
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,679
pages and documents

74
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:08,709
that we have in the World Wide Web.

75
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,739
And oh, my gosh, my dog is wanting out.

76
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,759
I'm so sorry.

77
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,809
I have to let him out of the park.

78
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:19,819
Sorry about that.

79
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,859
So the next evolution of the internet.

80
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,899
Now, you know, as I said, World Wide Web,

81
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:30,929
a library of pages, documents,

82
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:33,959
you know, everything is static.

83
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,988
The Spatial Web protocol, HSTP,

84
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:39,019
hyperspace transaction protocol,

85
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,050
and the programming language for the

86
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,069
protocol called HSML,

87
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,099
which is hyperspace modeling language.

88
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,123
This new protocol takes us into a library

89
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:51,139
of spaces where, you know,

90
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,182
we have spatial domains, and everything

91
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:59,219
within any space can be locatable

92
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,189
and programmable within this new network.

93
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:02,189
.

94
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:04,216
And it's just extending the protocol that

95
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:06,229
we have now, right?

96
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:11,279
So same internet, just more capabilities.

97
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:11,279
.

98
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:15,322
Now, Dr. Carl J. Friston and the Verses

99
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,339
AI white paper,

100
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,363
and I'm sure a lot of you are familiar

101
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:20,369
with him,

102
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:23,400
the father of Active Inference and the

103
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,419
Free Energy Principle.

104
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,476
Now, so Verses with Dr. Friston has

105
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:35,519
developed a new type of AI

106
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,551
that mimics the self-organized systems of

107
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:41,579
nested intelligence found in nature.

108
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,607
And it's based on his methodologies of

109
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:45,619
Active Inference

110
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,644
and the Free Energy Principle and the

111
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:49,659
Spatial Web protocols,

112
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,682
which I just mentioned, which were

113
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:53,699
developed by Verses AI.

114
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,724
In December, they put out a white paper

115
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:56,729
called

116
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,757
Designing Ecosystems of Intelligence from

117
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,710
First Principles.

118
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,744
And just to back up a second, you know,

119
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:06,769
Verses created the protocol,

120
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:09,801
the HSTP and the HSML, but donated it to

121
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:10,809
the public

122
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,829
because nobody can own the internet.

123
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,851
But they needed that in place for what

124
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,869
they wanted to do as a company.

125
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,889
So that framework needed to be there.

126
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,920
So then they also donated the protocol

127
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,939
and the IP to the IEEE,

128
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,965
which is one of the largest core

129
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:27,979
standards bodies

130
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:29,002
that develops everything with, you know,

131
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:31,019
electronics and engineering.

132
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,036
You know, they're responsible for the

133
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:34,049
core standards around things

134
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:38,093
like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and things like

135
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:39,099
that.

136
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,121
So the core standards have been being

137
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,139
developed around the protocol

138
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,169
for the last almost three years.

139
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,202
And yeah, Verses in that time has been

140
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:51,219
building, you know,

141
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:53,248
what they've been building, which I'll be

142
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:55,259
talking about.

143
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,250
So what is this white paper about?

144
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,269
It's basically about shared intelligence.

145
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:02,269
.

146
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:05,301
So in the white paper, they proposed

147
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,329
cyber-physical nested ecosystems

148
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:10,356
of distributed intelligence, joining

149
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:12,369
humans, machines,

150
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,399
and AI agents on a common network.

151
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,459
So we're talking about humans as integral

152
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:25,499
participants, adaptive behavior,

153
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:28,533
self-evidencing, self-organization,

154
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:32,569
belief updating over several scales,

155
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,609
belief sharing over ensembles of agents.

156
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:37,629
So we're talking about a network of

157
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,639
intelligent agents

158
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,659
and collective intelligence.

159
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:46,715
And then, of course, the protocols, HSTP

160
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:48,729
and HSML.

161
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:54,789
So the knowledge graph and digital twins.

162
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:54,789
.

163
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,817
Digital twins of our planet and all

164
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:00,790
nested systems and entities within them.

165
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,826
So nested ecosystems, intelligent agents,

166
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:06,849
both human and synthetic,

167
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,886
sensing and perceiving continuously

168
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:12,909
evolving environments,

169
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:15,939
making sense of changes, updating their

170
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:16,949
mental model

171
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,972
and what they know to be true, and then

172
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,989
acting on the new information

173
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:24,029
they receive.

174
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,054
And in the white paper, it's also

175
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,069
discussing a network

176
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,089
of distributed intelligence.

177
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:33,119
So this enables a cognitive architecture

178
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,139
made up of the collective

179
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,162
intelligence of multiple agents that

180
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:39,179
continuously communicate,

181
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:42,213
coordinate, and collaborate with each

182
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,219
other.

183
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,244
Individual and specialized intelligences

184
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:47,259
are all coming together

185
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,299
on a common network.

186
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:56,355
They're speaking a common language, HSML

187
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:58,369
and HSTP.

188
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,330
It's efficient, powerful cross-

189
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,349
-communication to perform tasks,

190
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,381
regulate systems, and address problems in

191
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:06,389
real time.

192
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,440
And it scales up and grows in tandem with

193
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,449
humans.

194
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:16,496
So Active Inference and the Free Energy

195
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,509
Principle.

196
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,539
So what exactly is Active Inference?

197
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,570
Active Inference is a biologically

198
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,599
inspired approach to AI systems

199
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,623
as a method for understanding behavior

200
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:31,639
incorporating the brain,

201
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,665
cognition, and behavior, modeled after

202
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:35,679
the design principles

203
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,707
from nature and from how the brain,

204
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,719
nervous system,

205
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,749
and the body act and react.

206
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:44,775
One of the questions that Dr. Fristin

207
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,789
asks in this paper

208
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,815
that is an important question in

209
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:51,839
reference to Active Inference

210
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,869
is, you know, with AI systems, you need

211
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,889
to be able to understand

212
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,911
what is it that intelligence must be,

213
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:00,870
given that intelligent systems

214
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,909
exist in a universe like ours.

215
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:06,929
So Active Inference is a theoretical

216
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,949
framework that describes how agents

217
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:10,974
like people, animals, robots, or

218
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:13,999
artificial systems can maintain

219
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,038
their internal states and behavior in

220
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:21,079
unison with their objectives or goals.

221
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:24,109
So what is the Free Energy Principle?

222
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:26,130
The Free Energy Principle is the

223
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:26,130
theoretical foundation of Active

224
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,159
Inference.

225
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,186
It proposes that organisms or agents

226
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:34,209
maintain their internal states

227
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:36,233
and behavior by acting in a way that

228
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,249
minimizes the difference

229
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,269
between their current beliefs about the

230
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,289
world and what they expect to be true.

231
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:45,321
So in other words, the agents try to make

232
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,339
things more predictable

233
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,365
by mitigating the difference between what

234
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:51,379
they expect to happen

235
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,409
and what actually ends up happening.

236
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:57,440
And they do this by way of a continuous

237
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,410
cycle of improving their perception

238
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,449
by acting on the environment.

239
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:07,481
So basically, it helps to extract the

240
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,499
signal from the noise

241
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,527
and extract the regularities from the

242
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,539
irregularities.

243
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:17,581
So extracting the prediction error,

244
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:21,619
minimizing the prediction error.

245
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:26,670
And there are two parts to this inference

246
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,679
cycle.

247
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,712
There's the perceptual inference part,

248
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:33,739
which minimizes the free energy

249
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:36,770
by improving the internal model to better

250
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,789
match the sensory input.

251
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,813
Making Bayesian inferences about the

252
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:43,839
world, the brain minimizes free energy

253
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,877
by optimizing perception, so through

254
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:50,909
hypothesizing and observation.

255
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:51,928
In other words, the brain models the

256
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,939
environment better,

257
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:55,959
improving the perception.

258
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,995
Now, the Active Inference part minimizes

259
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,950
the free energy

260
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,979
by acting on the environment.

261
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:05,008
So acting on the environment to reduce

262
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:07,019
the surprises,

263
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,059
the disorder or the unpredictability,

264
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:14,097
and action can indirectly influence the

265
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:16,109
observation.

266
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,131
So Active Inference, the Active Inference

267
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:20,149
part of free energy minimization

268
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,182
is equal to lowering the surprise in the

269
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,199
sensory observations

270
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:28,229
by acting on the environment.

271
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,256
Actions can't directly change

272
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,269
observations,

273
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:35,305
but they can indirectly change them by

274
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:39,339
acting on the environmental states.

275
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:42,369
So then we get to Active Inference AI.

276
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,397
So in the context of artificial

277
00:11:44,397 --> 00:11:46,409
intelligence,

278
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,433
Active Inference and the Free Energy

279
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,459
Principle explain how agents can learn

280
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,490
and adapt to new situations and how they

281
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,509
can generate predictions

282
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:59,540
and plan actions based on their goals or

283
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,490
objectives,

284
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,512
which leads to more accurate predictions

285
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:03,519
and results,

286
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,559
which is the real goal of AI.

287
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,586
Active Inference AI enables us to

288
00:12:09,586 --> 00:12:12,609
overcome current limitations

289
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:14,633
with machine learning and deep learning

290
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:15,639
AI models,

291
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,665
providing a realistic path towards

292
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:20,689
artificial general intelligence.

293
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,714
So, you know, the idea is that an agent

294
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:24,729
can use Active Inference

295
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:27,759
to minimize the free energy and optimize

296
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,769
its behavior

297
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,792
in a way that's consistent with its

298
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:31,799
objectives,

299
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,859
which leads to more accurate AI.

300
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:42,909
So the action perception loop,

301
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:44,936
the perceptual inference and Active

302
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,959
Inference unfold continuously

303
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,991
and simultaneously, underlying deep

304
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:50,991
continuity between perception and action.

305
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:54,029
.

306
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,049
They're both sides of the same coin,

307
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,071
performing the same free energy

308
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:00,030
minimization algorithm.

309
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,060
So the free energy can be minimized by

310
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,079
improving the perception

311
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:07,109
and then acting on the environment in

312
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:07,109
this loop that just keeps narrowing down

313
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:12,149
the focus.

314
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,175
And then also by learning the generative

315
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:15,179
model,

316
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,201
you know, how the brain codes the

317
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:18,209
environment.

318
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,243
So, you know, that's the side that the

319
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:25,279
Spatial Web protocol actually helps with

320
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,304
because it bakes context into every

321
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:30,329
person, place or thing in any space.

322
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:35,379
So that context informs the AI.

323
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,408
So then it's optimizing the expected

324
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:41,439
precision and regulating the learning.

325
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,468
So thus we update the model over and over

326
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:43,468
to improve our understanding of the world.

327
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:47,499
.

328
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:52,549
And that is what the AI does as well.

329
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,569
So how does it do this?

330
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:58,609
So self-optimization and self-evolution.

331
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,571
So Active Inference AI and the Free

332
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:00,571
Energy Principle through the Bayesian

333
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:03,599
inference

334
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,629
allows a neural network to self-optimize

335
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:07,639
through intake

336
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,677
and continuous updating of new real-time

337
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:12,689
sensory data

338
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:13,709
while simultaneously considering

339
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:13,709
previously established outputs and

340
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,739
determinations.

341
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:21,786
So past decisions plus the new input lead

342
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:24,809
to future outcomes.

343
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:29,861
And that cycle is a self-optimization and

344
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:32,889
self-evolution cycle.

345
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:38,950
So a self-evolving system evolves over

346
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,959
time.

347
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,985
Current systems, current AI systems are

348
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:43,999
more like a machine.

349
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,031
They're just neural nets that are trained

350
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:48,049
to do a specific task.

351
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,078
But a self-evolving system is learning

352
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:50,078
from moment to moment and upgrading its

353
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:55,119
world model.

354
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:58,152
And thus it mimics biology while also

355
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:01,119
enabling general intelligence.

356
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,141
So within the Free Energy Principle,

357
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:05,159
neural networks self-optimize

358
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,180
through a set of mathematical rules

359
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,180
enabling next generation artificial

360
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,209
intelligence

361
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:16,274
to efficiently learn, predict, plan, and

362
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:19,299
make decisions.

363
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:22,334
Spatial Web protocol. Let's talk about

364
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:23,339
this.

365
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,359
So what is the Spatial Web protocol?

366
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:30,409
HSTP, hyperspace transaction protocol.

367
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,434
It gives browsers the ability to link

368
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:32,434
spaces with an ID for every person, place,

369
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:36,469
, or thing,

370
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,504
both digital and physical, so virtual or

371
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:40,509
real.

372
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,531
But it's much more than a location

373
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,539
identifier.

374
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:46,569
HSTP is also a gatekeeper.

375
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:49,599
It allows various parties the ability to

376
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:49,599
agree on who, what, and where anything is

377
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:53,639
in space,

378
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,684
who owns it, has access to it, and what

379
00:15:57,684 --> 00:16:00,650
can be done with it.

380
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,684
So HSTP gives browsers the ability to

381
00:16:03,684 --> 00:16:06,709
link the spaces with an ID.

382
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:08,729
Oh, did I get this in here?

383
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:11,759
So HSTP is multidimensional query.

384
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,789
So it allows for query over multiple

385
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:17,819
dimensions, identifying, localizing,

386
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:19,848
and updating the attributes, conditions,

387
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,859
contingencies,

388
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:23,885
and interrelationships of objects in

389
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,899
space and over time.

390
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,934
So if it can be defined and calculated in

391
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:28,934
the sphere of natural or digital science,

392
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,959
,

393
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,989
it can be searchable through HSTP.

394
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:42,071
So HSML, this is the programming language

395
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:45,099
that informs the protocol.

396
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:47,125
And I like to call it the smartest

397
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:47,125
contract around because it's the

398
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:52,169
foundational contract now

399
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:54,195
for every person, place, or thing in any

400
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,209
space in any reality.

401
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,233
So the only way to create a truly

402
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:58,233
technologically augmented existence is to

403
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:03,219
be able to consider

404
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:05,248
and measure the contextual elements that

405
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:05,248
affect the expression of shared

406
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:09,279
information

407
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,309
by and between all objects in space.

408
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,359
This is known as computable context.

409
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,384
And this is what HSML, hyperspace

410
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:22,409
modeling language, was made for.

411
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,450
And what are some of the contextual

412
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,479
elements that can be programmed?

413
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:33,526
Location, the where, the when of anything

414
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:35,539
in any space.

415
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:39,585
And you're talking about reality, the

416
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:39,585
different realities, spaces, time, and

417
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:45,639
channels as well.

418
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:48,675
And then activities, so the what and the

419
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:49,679
how.

420
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,719
And this is in regards to things like

421
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:53,719
rights and credentials or claims or

422
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:57,759
activities.

423
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,781
And then when you're talking about

424
00:17:59,781 --> 00:17:59,781
identities, the who and the what of

425
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:03,759
anything in any space,

426
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,793
you're talking about authority or domains

427
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,809
or users or assets.

428
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:11,848
So all of these contextual elements can

429
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:11,848
affect the expression of the shared

430
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:19,919
information by and between anything.

431
00:18:21,939 --> 00:18:24,972
So belief updating through context and

432
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:25,979
sensors.

433
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:31,003
So HSML is a cipher for context.

434
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:34,007
The Spatial Web, which is web 3.0, the

435
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:37,009
next evolution of the internet,

436
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:39,012
is a library of spaces that contain

437
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:42,014
objects, people, places, and things.

438
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:45,018
These objects do things and change over

439
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:46,018
time.

440
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:49,022
The context or circumstances that govern

441
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:49,022
these shifts and changes is the most

442
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:54,026
important factor to consider

443
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:56,029
if we're to understand how objects relate

444
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:56,029
to each other, to people, and to their

445
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:00,027
environments.

446
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:08,034
So the Free Energy Principle and HSML.

447
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:11,038
The Free Energy Principle is perfectly

448
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:11,038
suited to the programming language of the

449
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:15,041
Spatial Web.

450
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:19,046
HSML, the hyperspace modeling language,

451
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:19,046
which enables computable context based on

452
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:27,053
defining, recording, and tracing

453
00:19:27,053 --> 00:19:30,057
the changing details in physical and

454
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:30,057
digital dimensions, social dimensions,

455
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:30,057
meanings, culture, conditions,

456
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:39,065
circumstances, situations,

457
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:41,068
whether geometrical, geopolitical, or

458
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:43,069
geosocial by nature.

459
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:49,075
Self-evidencing and belief updating.

460
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:52,079
So HSML computes context, enabling the AI'

461
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,079
's perception to understand the real-time

462
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:59,085
changing state of anything in the world,

463
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:02,083
accumulating evidence for a generative

464
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,083
model of one's sensed world, also known

465
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:07,087
as self-evidencing.

466
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:12,093
So we're talking about multiple agents,

467
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:16,096
so individual intelligences,

468
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:19,100
and based on each agent's generative

469
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,100
world model, unique perspective, frame of

470
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,104
reference,

471
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:26,107
and nested ecosystems of these

472
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:26,107
intelligences, and different levels of

473
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:31,111
self-organization.

474
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:33,114
So all of this results in a collective

475
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:35,115
shared intelligence.

476
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:41,122
So, call on architecture and markup

477
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:43,123
blankets.

478
00:20:44,124 --> 00:20:48,128
So the Spatial Web is a holonic structure.

479
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:48,128
.

480
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:51,131
So Active Inference, well, Active

481
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:51,131
Inference AI within the Spatial Web on

482
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:57,137
the versus CosmOS platform

483
00:20:57,137 --> 00:21:00,135
operates with a holonic structure of

484
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,136
nested spatial domains.

485
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,140
So if you're not familiar with what a

486
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,140
holon is, a holon is where, you know,

487
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,140
something can be a whole in and of itself,

488
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:12,146
,

489
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,149
and yet also be a part of something

490
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,149
greater.

491
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,152
So the human heart is a great example.

492
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:31,165
The human heart's made up of cells.

493
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,168
Each one of those cells, they're whole

494
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:33,168
cells in and of themselves, yet they're

495
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:38,172
also part of the heart.

496
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,176
And then the heart is a whole heart, but

497
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,177
yet it's part of the human body.

498
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,181
So you have this nested structure of

499
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:46,181
whole parts that are governed by the

500
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:51,185
outside part,

501
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,188
but still have this intrinsic governing

502
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,190
going on within itself as well.

503
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,194
So each component is a whole element,

504
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,190
part of the entire organism.

505
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,193
They're nested entities and they're

506
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:04,193
governed by the rules of the greater

507
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:08,196
influencing organism.

508
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,199
And then they have inherited, they

509
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
inherit the governing and it's passed to

510
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
the internal parts that are nested within

511
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:18,206
it.

512
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:20,209
And each part has its own governmental

513
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
considerations for its specific intrinsic

514
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:24,212
requirements as well.

515
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,215
So this is how the Spatial Web is set up

516
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,216
to work as well.

517
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,219
So when you're talking about spatial

518
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:30,219
domains, you're talking about, for

519
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:34,222
instance,

520
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:37,226
you can have a restaurant that's inside

521
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:37,226
of a skyscraper building that's inside of

522
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:42,230
a city,

523
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,235
and that city is inside of a state, these

524
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:48,236
nested domains.

525
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:52,241
And then the Active Inference AI also

526
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:52,241
includes the principle of Markov blankets

527
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:58,246
at each level of analysis.

528
00:22:58,246 --> 00:23:01,244
So the Markov blankets define boundaries

529
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:01,244
acting as partitions to mediate the

530
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:01,244
interactions between the internal and

531
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:12,254
external states of the spatial domains,

532
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:16,259
such as like a single unit or a region or

533
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:19,261
entire complex network.

534
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:22,265
And this results in a self-organizing

535
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:23,265
system.

536
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:26,269
And a Markov blanket is just a mediator

537
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:26,269
between how things are attuned to each

538
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:33,275
other through the Free Energy Principle.

539
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:39,281
So nested domains in the Spatial Web.

540
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:44,287
So one good example of how this may work

541
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:44,287
is, you know, if you take a factory,

542
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:49,291
right?

543
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:53,296
So, you know, a factory is a part of the

544
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:53,296
supply chain and has raw materials

545
00:23:53,296 --> 00:24:01,297
feeding into it from various locations.

546
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:05,301
Like mines or, you know, anywhere.

547
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:08,305
And then the factory produces finished

548
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:08,305
goods that may ship to another

549
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:14,310
destination, like a warehouse, right?

550
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,312
Like a distribution warehouse.

551
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:19,316
So just as that factory is an object

552
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:19,316
within a larger ecosystem of the supply

553
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:23,319
chain,

554
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:26,323
every object within the factory belongs

555
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:29,325
to its internal ecosystem, right?

556
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,327
So with a factory, you've got all the

557
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:31,327
internal ecosystem of what's going on in

558
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:34,330
that factory.

559
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,334
But yet it's still part of this global

560
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:37,334
supply chain with, you know, raw

561
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:42,338
materials being fed into it.

562
00:24:42,338 --> 00:24:44,341
And then when it's done with what it's

563
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:44,341
doing, it's feeding out to other like

564
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:50,346
distribution, you know, pathways.

565
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:53,350
So you have an internal and an external

566
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,351
ecosystem,

567
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:57,354
and they simultaneously operate according

568
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:57,354
to the individual internal and external

569
00:24:57,354 --> 00:25:01,351
standards.

570
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:03,354
The interdependencies, the

571
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:05,355
interrelationships.

572
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:07,358
So, you know, this is how you can see

573
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:11,361
things working within the Spatial Web.

574
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:16,366
So every object within the entire Spatial

575
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:16,366
Web network is part of an interrelated

576
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:22,372
ecosystem

577
00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:25,376
that feeds a continuous stream of real-

578
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:25,376
-time context between all points in space

579
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:29,379
and time.

580
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:31,382
This continual interaction and

581
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
communication stream takes note of all

582
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
the nuances and changes within the

583
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:37,387
relationships

584
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:39,390
between all objects and the parameters

585
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,391
that govern them,

586
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:45,396
which leads to adaptive collective

587
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:48,398
intelligence automation.

588
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:51,401
So you have programmable spaces.

589
00:25:52,402 --> 00:25:55,406
And, you know, within these spaces,

590
00:25:55,406 --> 00:25:55,406
everything within these spaces have a

591
00:25:55,406 --> 00:26:00,405
digital ID.

592
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:02,407
And the way the Spatial Web is set up is

593
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:02,407
it enables zero knowledge proofs between

594
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:07,411
all of these entities.

595
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:09,414
So anything inside of any space is

596
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:09,414
uniquely identifiable and programmable

597
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:16,420
with a digital twin of the earth,

598
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,423
producing a model for data normalization.

599
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:19,423
.

600
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:22,427
So by programming context into everything

601
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
in any space, it creates this digital

602
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:27,431
twin of the space.

603
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:30,434
So the Spatial Web becomes a digital twin

604
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:30,434
of everything from the planet to every

605
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:34,438
single system,

606
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:37,441
every single object within it that's on

607
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:38,442
the network.

608
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:40,444
So.

609
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:46,451
The contingencies and changing details,

610
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
inherent qualities, circumstances for all

611
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
objects and situations can now be

612
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:55,459
measured and computed,

613
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:57,462
providing a basis for the AI perception

614
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:57,462
affecting all entities and their

615
00:26:57,462 --> 00:27:03,461
interrelationships to each other.

616
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:05,464
So you're talking about adaptive

617
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:05,464
intelligence automation, security through

618
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:10,468
geo encoded governance,

619
00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:13,472
multi network interoperability, and it

620
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:13,472
enables all smart technologies to

621
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:19,477
function together on a unified system.

622
00:27:19,477 --> 00:27:21,480
So, you know, when you consider all of

623
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
the Web3 technologies, all of the

624
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
extended reality technologies, you know,

625
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,486
AR, VR,

626
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,490
distributed ledger technologies. So you

627
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,490
have all of these technologies that are

628
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:36,494
siloed and disparate.

629
00:27:36,494 --> 00:27:38,497
This brings all of those technologies

630
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:38,497
onto a common unified network now with a

631
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:44,502
common language between them.

632
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:46,505
So it makes all of these all of these

633
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,507
technologies then become interoperable.

634
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:51,510
And when you're talking about smart

635
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,510
technologies, when you're talking about

636
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,513
like the Internet of Things,

637
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:57,516
there's been no common language for these

638
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
Internet of Things to talk to each other

639
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:01,513
and communicate.

640
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,516
So the Spatial Web brings all of the

641
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:03,516
Internet of Things onto the common

642
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:03,516
network now where they become baked into

643
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:09,521
this?

644
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,526
this network and informing the AI, so all

645
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:13,526
of the data being gathered by all of

646
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:19,531
these sensors or cameras or, you know,

647
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,535
the context that's baked into the

648
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
protocol. This is all the data that is

649
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
now coming together that is continually

650
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
updating in real time and informing the

651
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:30,542
AI.

652
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,548
So you have ecosystems of nested

653
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
intelligence. The design of intelligent

654
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
systems must begin from the physicality

655
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:35,548
of information and its processing at

656
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:47,559
every scale or level of organization.

657
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,564
So within the Spatial Web, you have AI

658
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:51,564
that scales up the way nature does,

659
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:51,564
aggregating locally contextualized

660
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:51,564
knowledge bases and acting across

661
00:28:51,564 --> 00:29:01,567
ecosystems.

662
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:04,571
And this maximizes efficiency. So this is

663
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:04,571
the complete opposite of the way the

664
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:04,571
machine learning models work because they'

665
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:12,578
're top down.

666
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:16,583
It's just massive amounts of data. And,

667
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,583
you know, that's what's training the

668
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:21,587
machine model AI.

669
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:25,592
But there's a cutoff date. So then that

670
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:25,592
model now can only reference this

671
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:25,592
historical data that it's been trained on.

672
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:30,596
.

673
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:33,600
And, you know, again, it's just a it's it'

674
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,601
's a pattern recognition machine.

675
00:29:36,602 --> 00:29:38,605
The algorithms are just to make sense of

676
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:38,605
the data that it's been fed and how to

677
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:42,608
recognize patterns within it.

678
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,613
Every time those models have to compute

679
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:46,613
and try to perform an output, it requires

680
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:46,613
massive amounts of energy because it

681
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:46,613
still has to pull from its library, this

682
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:46,613
massive library to try to make sense of

683
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:59,625
things.

684
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:02,623
Now, the way that the Spatial Web works

685
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:02,623
with the Active Inference AI is you have

686
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:06,626
any amount of data.

687
00:30:08,628 --> 00:30:11,632
You know, small amounts of data can now

688
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:11,632
be made smart because you have context

689
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:11,632
informing the AI and you have sensors

690
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:11,632
that are giving it real time data inputs

691
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:11,632
to let it kind of look outward and see

692
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:27,647
what's happening in the world now.

693
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:29,650
Not, you know, referencing historical

694
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,650
data.

695
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:35,655
So this leads to minimizing complexity.

696
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:38,659
So when you're talking about the machine

697
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:38,659
learning versus the Active Inference for

698
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:43,663
efficiency and accuracy.

699
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:46,667
The more complex a system is, the more

700
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,668
energy it consumes.

701
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:50,671
So that's what I was just referring to

702
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:50,671
with all this big data approach on these

703
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:54,674
machine models.

704
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:57,678
Active Inference in the Free Energy

705
00:30:57,678 --> 00:30:57,678
Principle naturally minimize the

706
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:00,675
complexity.

707
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:03,678
That's the whole idea with the Free

708
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:03,678
Energy Principle is to minimize the

709
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:03,678
prediction error and use the information

710
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:11,685
that it can sense.

711
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:14,689
Right. So it's taking in the senses from

712
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:14,689
sensors, like the Internet of Things and

713
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:20,694
cameras and things like that.

714
00:31:21,695 --> 00:31:22,697
But it's also taking in what it knows

715
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:23,697
about.

716
00:31:24,698 --> 00:31:29,703
It's, you know, the data at hand. Right.

717
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:32,707
And it's informed to the call, the

718
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:32,707
Spatial Web protocol with all of the

719
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:32,707
context, all of the attributes around

720
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:42,716
everything in any space or any data set.

721
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:46,721
So, you know, sensor data is noisy and

722
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
ambiguous, but HSML provides clarity with

723
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
specific and precise contextual data to

724
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
narrow the complexity and close the gap

725
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:58,732
on the free energy.

726
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:01,730
So more certainty means less noise, and

727
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,730
that that equals free energy is reduced

728
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,734
faster and lower.

729
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:08,737
So it's a it's a faster way to operate,

730
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:10,738
more efficient.

731
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:15,744
And, you know, another point to this,

732
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:15,744
which is really interesting, too, is that,

733
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:15,744
, you know, most of the data that exists

734
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:23,751
exists behind.

735
00:32:24,752 --> 00:32:26,755
Password walls right behind gated it

736
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
within gated password areas, right,

737
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
whether it's, you know, on the Internet

738
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
and it's all the data that people have

739
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
behind a password or whether you're

740
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
talking about like an enterprise

741
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
organization that has all their

742
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:41,769
proprietary data that's in time.

743
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,774
Internal, you know, so the awesome thing

744
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:45,774
about the Spatial Web is that an Active

745
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:45,774
Inference is that you can be within this

746
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:45,774
network and still have all of your

747
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:45,774
proprietary data gated off because the

748
00:32:45,774 --> 00:33:01,783
protocol allows for that security.

749
00:33:02,784 --> 00:33:04,787
You know, it's a it's gated at every

750
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:05,787
touch point.

751
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:07,790
So you can put boundaries around your

752
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:07,790
particular data, but still be able to

753
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:07,790
access the the the power of the network

754
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:15,797
and the power of the Active Inference.

755
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:18,801
AI now for your proprietary data because

756
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:18,801
it can take that small amount of data and

757
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:21,803
make it smart.

758
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:25,808
So this is a game changer for, you know,

759
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:25,808
access to AI for any systems in any

760
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:30,812
databases.

761
00:33:33,815 --> 00:33:35,817
So embodied AI.

762
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:40,823
Active Inference is mimics biological

763
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:41,823
design.

764
00:33:42,824 --> 00:33:45,828
And it's so it's like embodied AI with

765
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:48,830
the ability to take action.

766
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,833
And this is the core engine of the

767
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:51,833
Spatial Web.

768
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,838
So what makes Active Inference so

769
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:56,838
accurate?

770
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,842
Active Inference is so accurate because

771
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
it continually looks outward into the

772
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
world, measuring the world in real time

773
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
through a global network of sensors, IoT

774
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
devices, cameras, robots, drones,

775
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
anything that's connected within the

776
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
Spatial Web, the digital twin network of

777
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:17,853
the world.

778
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:21,858
H.S.M.L. informs the AI with precise data,

779
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
, extracts the signal from the noise,

780
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:26,862
minimizing the prediction error.

781
00:34:27,863 --> 00:34:29,866
And this mimics the way humans and

782
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:31,867
animals make decisions.

783
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:34,871
So the perception of the world in the

784
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
Spatial Web, Active Inference, AI, you

785
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
know, create this creates a cybernetic

786
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
feedback loop of perception of the world

787
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
and it updates the model of the world

788
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
with the belief of what it knows to be

789
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
true, gaining the understanding of the

790
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
intricacies and inner workings of the

791
00:34:34,871 --> 00:35:00,891
world.

792
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,894
So that it can make decisions and take

793
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:04,894
action.

794
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,904
And it provides ever, ever evolving

795
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,905
intelligence.

796
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,908
So the more this feedback loop plays out,

797
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:17,908
the AI learns more about the world and

798
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:17,908
the results of the actions taken just as

799
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:17,908
a child learns about the world as it

800
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:28,918
grows and interacts with it.

801
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,921
And the more accurate this AI becomes by

802
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
further updating its understanding of the

803
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,924
world.

804
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,927
So it's been described to me that, you

805
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
know, when versus launches their COSM

806
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
operating system, and then, you know,

807
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
which is going to be later this year, it'

808
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
's going to enable everybody to be able

809
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
to build these intelligent agents on top

810
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:53,943
of the network, right?

811
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,946
They're they have a intelligent app store,

812
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:56,946
, that's going to be launching with the

813
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,945
operating system.

814
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:01,946
So then everybody can make these

815
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:03,947
intelligent agents.

816
00:36:03,947 --> 00:36:05,949
The difference is these agents.

817
00:36:05,949 --> 00:36:07,952
So when you build an app on say, like the

818
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:07,952
Apple App Store, or Google Play, you're

819
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:07,952
building a siloed piece of software,

820
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:13,957
right?

821
00:36:13,957 --> 00:36:15,960
Those apps are not aware of each other,

822
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:15,960
they just do whatever their function is

823
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,962
to do.

824
00:36:18,962 --> 00:36:19,964
The difference is these intelligent

825
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:19,964
agents that you're building on COSM are

826
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:19,964
going to be aware of each other and aware

827
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:25,969
of the network.

828
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:27,972
So they're going to be empowered with the

829
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:27,972
AI and be able to act as an agent within

830
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:31,975
the network.

831
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:34,979
Now, it's been described to me that, you

832
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:34,979
know, when people are first building

833
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:34,979
these, you know, intelligent agent apps,

834
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:34,979
it's not going to be like this stark

835
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:34,979
difference of like, the power of what it

836
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:34,979
can do versus the power of what these

837
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:34,979
machine models can do, because they're

838
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:34,979
all pretty, it's all pretty impressive

839
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:52,996
right now.

840
00:36:53,997 --> 00:36:55,000
But the difference is, is if you take

841
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
like, the comparison of like a chimpanzee

842
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and a toddler, at first they seem about

843
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
the same intellectually.

844
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,003
But the difference is that toddler is

845
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:04,003
going to grow, it's going to grow into a

846
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:04,003
full fledged adult, it's going to

847
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:04,003
continue learning, whereas that

848
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:12,010
chimpanzee has maxed out.

849
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,014
So that's going to be really interesting

850
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
to watch over the next, you know, year or

851
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
two is that we're going to see this

852
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
Active Inference AI really modeling the

853
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
same way that humans learn and it's going

854
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
to grow in intelligence with this, you

855
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
know, scores of these intelligent agents

856
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
now all working together within the

857
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:35,033
network.

858
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:38,037
So now one of the really awesome things

859
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:38,037
about this too, is that the Active

860
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:38,037
Inference AI is explainable, auditable

861
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:46,044
and governable.

862
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:49,048
So versus AI just published a

863
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:49,048
groundbreaking industry report about a

864
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:49,048
week, week and a half ago, called

865
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:49,048
designing explainable artificial

866
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:49,048
intelligence with Active Inference, a

867
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:49,048
framework for transparent introspection

868
00:37:49,048 --> 00:38:06,058
and decision making.

869
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:10,062
So Active Inference is explainable AI.

870
00:38:11,063 --> 00:38:14,067
Now, how, how can this be? Well, Active

871
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
Inference can self report. So machine

872
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
learning models, they're black boxes, you

873
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
know, and and therefore they can't

874
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:26,078
quantify their uncertainty.

875
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,082
They're unobservable, unalterable and

876
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,082
unknowable. Basically, the the way the

877
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,082
algorithm is processing the data and

878
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,082
coming up with its output, you can't see

879
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,082
what's happening, you can't know how it's

880
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:44,096
coming to its decision.

881
00:38:45,097 --> 00:38:47,100
It's just this black box that's happening.

882
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,100
. And there's no way to really know what

883
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,100
it's doing just how you know, the input

884
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,100
and the output. So you can't explain that.

885
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:56,108
.

886
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:58,111
Now, one of the interesting things, you

887
00:38:58,111 --> 00:38:58,111
know, with this call for, you know,

888
00:38:58,111 --> 00:38:58,111
putting governance around AI is that if

889
00:38:58,111 --> 00:38:58,111
you have these black boxes that are not

890
00:38:58,111 --> 00:38:58,111
controllable, and not explainable, how do

891
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:12,118
you govern that?

892
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,122
So, you know, the only options have been

893
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:15,122
to, you know, either, you know, regulate

894
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:15,122
the the companies that are developing

895
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:15,122
these, you know, these tools, or to just

896
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:15,122
let the free market reign. Now, letting

897
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:15,122
free market reign is a little bit tricky

898
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:15,122
with AI, because that can really lead to

899
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:15,122
like this AI arms race kind of a thing,

900
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:38,144
you know, for AI domination.

901
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:40,147
And that, that that has some risks to,

902
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
you know, like the human nature, right.

903
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
So, and then the other problem with

904
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
regulating the companies that are

905
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
developing these tools is that you're

906
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
asking them, you're basing those

907
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
regulations off them being able to do

908
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
things like, you know, explain how the

909
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
results are coming, you know, to fruition

910
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
through their tools, or holding them

911
00:39:40,147 --> 00:40:07,167
accountable for, you know,

912
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:11,172
for outputs that are, you know, false, or,

913
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:11,172
, you know, causing harm to anybody, or,

914
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:11,172
you know, different things like that,

915
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:11,172
which you really can't do that either.

916
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:11,172
Because what's happening within these

917
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:11,172
tools is not controllable. It's not

918
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:11,172
auditable, it's not controllable. So

919
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:11,172
there's a real issue with governance

920
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:32,192
around these machine model AIs.

921
00:40:32,192 --> 00:40:34,195
Now, with Active Inference AI, it is

922
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:34,195
completely explainable, auditable,

923
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:34,195
transparent. And when you're talking

924
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:34,195
about the the self report, you know,

925
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:34,195
Active Inference AI is capable of

926
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:46,206
introspection.

927
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:49,210
So this enables the intelligent agents to

928
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,210
access and analyze their own internal

929
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,210
states and decision making processes. So

930
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,210
we get better understanding of their

931
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,210
decision making process. And they have

932
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,210
the ability to report on themselves to

933
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:49,210
basically report on how they arrived at

934
00:40:49,210 --> 00:41:07,221
their decisions.

935
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:11,226
Beliefs and belief updating are known. So

936
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:11,226
this, this dissolves the explainability

937
00:41:11,226 --> 00:41:18,232
problem of the conventional AI.

938
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:22,237
And then you also have programmable

939
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:22,237
intelligence. So versus refers to this as

940
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:27,241
code as law.

941
00:41:28,242 --> 00:41:31,246
So the act of correcting a machine occurs

942
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:31,246
within the code within the computational

943
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:31,246
architecture of versus AI system, human

944
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:31,246
law can now be transformed into

945
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:31,246
computable law that AI can comprehend,

946
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:31,246
abide by, and then act accordingly within

947
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:50,264
its decision making process.

948
00:41:51,265 --> 00:41:54,269
This is a process which is fully

949
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:54,269
auditable, knowable, and it updates in

950
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:54,269
real time. And versus has been proving

951
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:54,269
this concept in a program called Flying

952
00:41:54,269 --> 00:42:07,275
Forward 2020.

953
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:13,281
And this is a European drone project.

954
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,286
The conducted with the European Union.

955
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:17,286
And, you know, there's eight or 12

956
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:17,286
different countries involved. I'm, I'm

957
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:17,286
not sure. But basically, what they've

958
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:17,286
proven is that they can take the the

959
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:35,303
Spatial Web protocol, the HSTP and HML.

960
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,307
And they can translate human laws, all

961
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:38,307
the laws around like the airspace laws,

962
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:38,307
and you know, laws, how how they shift

963
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:38,307
crossing country boundaries, different

964
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:47,315
things like that.

965
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,320
They can take those laws, put them in a

966
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320
programmable, you know, code through the

967
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,320
protocol that the AI within the drone can

968
00:42:51,320 --> 00:43:03,325
understand, and then abide by.

969
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:05,328
So they've, they've met with great

970
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:05,328
success through this project. And they've,

971
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:05,328
, they've proven that, you know, these

972
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:05,328
drones can deliver medical supplies, you

973
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:05,328
know, to a hospital crossing borders into

974
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:05,328
various air state airspaces, you know,

975
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:05,328
understanding no fly zones versus fly

976
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:26,348
zones, all of these things.

977
00:43:34,356 --> 00:43:37,360
So basically, human law computable that

978
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,360
the AI can understand and abide by. So

979
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,360
when you're talking about AI governance,

980
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:49,371
you know, this, the protocol

981
00:43:50,372 --> 00:43:55,378
allows you to actually program law that

982
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
the AI can understand. So then the other

983
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
aspect of this too, is, you know, humans

984
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:55,378
with AI, because, you know, there's a lot

985
00:43:55,378 --> 00:44:14,390
of

986
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,394
there's a lot of fear baked into people,

987
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
especially in regard to all these sci fi

988
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
scenarios that have played out in, you

989
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
know, fictional books and movies and

990
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
things like that. But one of the great

991
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
things about the Active Inference AI

992
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
within the Spatial Web is that the AI

993
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
grows in tandem with the humans, you know,

994
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
, because you can take programmable laws

995
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:43,419
and

996
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,423
make it to where the AI understands and

997
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:47,423
you've got this symbiotic relationship

998
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:47,423
between the AI and the human, it's a

999
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:47,423
network system that operates in tandem

1000
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:47,423
with humans. And then the AI is growing

1001
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:47,423
its intelligence in sync with the growth

1002
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:47,423
of humans and the world, right? So it

1003
00:44:47,423 --> 00:45:07,437
makes a controllable AI.

1004
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:11,442
So in versus white paper, you know, one

1005
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
of their opening statements was that the

1006
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
the purpose of the white paper, its

1007
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
denouement is a cyber-physical ecosystem

1008
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
of natural and synthetic sensemaking in

1009
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
which humans are an integral are integral

1010
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
participants, what we call shared

1011
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:31,461
intelligence.

1012
00:45:31,461 --> 00:45:33,464
So versus AI and the Spatial Web

1013
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
foundation offer us the framework in

1014
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
which we can build an ethical and

1015
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
cooperative path forward for AI and human

1016
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
civilization. And one thing I want to

1017
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
read to you from the white paper that's,

1018
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
you know, specific about this is, is this,

1019
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
, so quote, we believe that developing a

1020
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
cyber-physical network of emerging

1021
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
intelligence in the manner described by

1022
00:45:33,464 --> 00:46:00,485
the white paper is a

1023
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:03,488
necessary and appropriate process. And

1024
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
the process described above not only

1025
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
ought to, but for architectural reasons

1026
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
must be pursued in a way that positively

1027
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
values and safeguards the individuality

1028
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
of people, as well as potentially non

1029
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:20,504
human persons.

1030
00:46:20,504 --> 00:46:22,507
So, in the late 1990s, before the

1031
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:22,507
widespread adoption of the internet, as a

1032
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:22,507
communication technology, a future state

1033
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:22,507
of society had been hypothesized in which

1034
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:22,507
the intrinsic value of individuals is

1035
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:22,507
acknowledged in part because knowledge is

1036
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:22,507
valuable and knowledge and life are

1037
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:42,526
inseparable.

1038
00:46:42,526 --> 00:46:45,530
That is, each person has a distinct and

1039
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,530
unique life experience, and as such knows

1040
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:51,535
something that no one else does.

1041
00:46:52,536 --> 00:46:54,539
This resonates deeply with our idea that

1042
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:54,539
every intelligence implements a

1043
00:46:54,539 --> 00:47:00,539
generative model of its own existence.

1044
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:04,543
The form of collective intelligence that

1045
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:04,543
we envision can emerge only from a

1046
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:04,543
network of essentially unique

1047
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:04,543
epistemically and experientially diverse

1048
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:13,551
agents.

1049
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:16,555
This useful diversity of perspectives is

1050
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:16,555
a special case of functional

1051
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:16,555
specialization across the components of a

1052
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:23,561
complex system.

1053
00:47:24,562 --> 00:47:27,566
So, you know, within the versus white

1054
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:27,566
paper for this Active Inference, AI, you

1055
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:27,566
know, they're very clear about the

1056
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:27,566
importance of the human experience and

1057
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:27,566
the various human experiences in tandem

1058
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:27,566
with the growth of the AI within the

1059
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:48,586
Spatial Web.

1060
00:47:48,586 --> 00:47:50,589
So I just thought that was really

1061
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:54,592
important to to kind of let people know.

1062
00:47:56,594 --> 00:48:00,593
So then you have accurate world models.

1063
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:03,596
Collective intelligence trained on real

1064
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
time data evolves, making decisions and

1065
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
updating its interior model based on what

1066
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
is happening now, not on historical data

1067
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:13,605
sets.

1068
00:48:13,605 --> 00:48:15,608
Active Inference AI is not a language

1069
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:15,608
model generating words about the world

1070
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:15,608
based on outdated knowledge it's been fed

1071
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:23,615
regarding the world.

1072
00:48:24,616 --> 00:48:26,619
Active Inference is like a biological

1073
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:26,619
organism that perceives and acts on our

1074
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:26,619
world by generating more accurate models,

1075
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:26,619
understandings and beliefs about our

1076
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:35,627
world.

1077
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:38,631
These ever more accurate world models

1078
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:38,631
enable better decisions, a smarter world.

1079
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:42,634
.

1080
00:48:42,634 --> 00:48:44,637
And this is the true measure of

1081
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:45,637
intelligence.

1082
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:50,643
So Active Inference AI as the operator,

1083
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:53,645
this is the final section.

1084
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:57,649
So you have the Internet of everything.

1085
00:48:57,649 --> 00:48:59,652
The days of training AI on big data will

1086
00:48:59,652 --> 00:48:59,652
give way to an interconnected Internet of

1087
00:48:59,652 --> 00:48:59,652
everything that deploys Active Inference

1088
00:48:59,652 --> 00:49:08,654
AI throughout the network.

1089
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,658
Inherently secure and accurate because it

1090
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:11,658
takes any point of real time data and

1091
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:11,658
makes it smart through an empowered

1092
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:11,658
ecosystem of interconnected AI apps that

1093
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:22,668
act as intelligent agents.

1094
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,673
Active Inference, QASM and the Spatial

1095
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:27,673
Web.

1096
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,677
Active Inference AI inside of the versus

1097
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:30,677
AI QASM operating system has access to

1098
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:30,677
the entire Spatial Web with IoT sensors

1099
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:30,677
and cameras and all context markers

1100
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:30,677
attached to all objects within all spaces

1101
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:30,677
within the network, tracking and

1102
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:47,693
identifying changes over time.

1103
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,697
This AI becomes an ecosystem of

1104
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:50,697
intelligent agents that are all

1105
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:55,701
interoperable over HSTP.

1106
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,705
So what does this mean for the planet?

1107
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:03,703
Active Inference AI can run the planet.

1108
00:50:03,703 --> 00:50:05,706
Dan Mapes, who's one of the co-founders

1109
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:05,706
of versus, he describes the Spatial Web

1110
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:05,706
with Active Inference AI as a nervous

1111
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:11,711
system for the planet.

1112
00:50:12,712 --> 00:50:14,715
Together, these technologies enable the

1113
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:14,715
only AI in the world that can run

1114
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:14,715
critical operations for systems,

1115
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:14,715
infrastructures, smart cities and the

1116
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:22,722
planet.

1117
00:50:22,722 --> 00:50:25,726
So when you're thinking of climate or

1118
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:25,726
traffic control or smart cities or

1119
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:25,726
advanced education or hospitals or

1120
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:25,726
airports, all of these are critical

1121
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:25,726
systems that need accurate functioning of

1122
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:38,738
the AI.

1123
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:41,742
You cannot rely on machine models who

1124
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:41,742
give you plausible answers, plausible

1125
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:41,742
outputs that sound accurate, but aren't

1126
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:41,742
necessarily accurate because they're just

1127
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:53,753
trained to make it sound appropriate.

1128
00:50:54,754 --> 00:50:55,756
Appropriate and accurate are very

1129
00:50:55,756 --> 00:50:56,756
different things.

1130
00:50:57,757 --> 00:51:00,755
So because the Active Inference AI is

1131
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:00,755
based on real time data, actual data,

1132
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:00,755
context that's baked into everything, it'

1133
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:00,755
's an accurate form of AI and it can be

1134
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:15,769
trusted to run these critical systems.

1135
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,772
So it can be the operator.

1136
00:51:21,775 --> 00:51:24,778
And then we come to sentient intelligence.

1137
00:51:24,778 --> 00:51:24,778
.

1138
00:51:24,778 --> 00:51:26,781
So this is the missing piece of the data

1139
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:26,781
puzzle that gets us to artificial general

1140
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:30,784
intelligence.

1141
00:51:30,784 --> 00:51:32,787
We now have the world model and we now

1142
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
possess the ability for continuous and

1143
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
adaptive context markers, enabling a

1144
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
cognitive world, a cognitive model of

1145
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:32,787
this world and the ability to compute

1146
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:44,798
awareness.

1147
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:46,801
So this is taking us from the artificial

1148
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:46,801
narrow intelligence, which is what these

1149
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:46,801
machine models are, to potentially

1150
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:46,801
artificial general intelligence and then

1151
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:56,810
artificial super intelligence.

1152
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,814
Because the more the Active Inference AI

1153
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
learns about the world, it can start to

1154
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
question and become curious about the

1155
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:07,815
world.

1156
00:52:08,816 --> 00:52:11,820
And it's the difference between asking

1157
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
the AI agent something and then having

1158
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:11,820
the AI agent ask you something to clarify

1159
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:21,829
what you want or what your needs are.

1160
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:24,833
It's that curiosity back on you that'll

1161
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
take us to the artificial super

1162
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,835
intelligence.

1163
00:52:28,836 --> 00:52:31,840
So I'm just going to close by letting you

1164
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:31,840
know that versus AI, their CosmOS is

1165
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:31,840
going to be launching at the end of the

1166
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:39,847
year.

1167
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:42,851
And the idea is let's create a new world

1168
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:43,851
together.

1169
00:52:43,851 --> 00:52:46,855
They've created the tools for anybody to

1170
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:49,857
create the AIs on top of.

1171
00:52:49,857 --> 00:52:53,861
So, you know, it's a huge opportunity.

1172
00:52:53,861 --> 00:52:54,863
They're going to be launching the beta at

1173
00:52:54,863 --> 00:52:56,864
the end of this year.

1174
00:52:56,864 --> 00:52:59,868
If you go to my website, DeniseHolt.us,

1175
00:52:59,868 --> 00:52:59,868
there's a menu item where you can sign up

1176
00:52:59,868 --> 00:53:05,867
for the beta if you'd like.

1177
00:53:14,876 --> 00:53:16,879
So if you'd like to be considered, feel

1178
00:53:16,879 --> 00:53:18,880
free to sign up there.

1179
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:22,885
And then, of course, I have a podcast and

1180
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:22,885
it's on YouTube or Spotify, Apple,

1181
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:28,890
anywhere you find a podcast.

1182
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,893
But if you'd like to learn more about

1183
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:30,893
this, you know, that's really my role is

1184
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:30,893
I've just been educating on the Spatial

1185
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:30,893
Web protocol and this Active Inference AI.

1186
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:38,900
.

1187
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,904
So there's a lot of information on my

1188
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:42,904
website.

1189
00:53:42,904 --> 00:53:45,907
There's a lot of articles on the podcast.

1190
00:53:45,907 --> 00:53:45,907
.

1191
00:53:45,907 --> 00:53:47,910
There's just a lot of information so that

1192
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:49,911
you can learn more.

1193
00:53:49,911 --> 00:53:51,913
So I think that's it.

1194
00:53:56,918 --> 00:53:58,920
Daniel: Awesome. Thank you.

1195
00:53:59,921 --> 00:54:00,917
Denise: Thank you, Daniel.

1196
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:04,921
Daniel: All right. I'm going to come back

1197
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:07,923
on video and then?

1198
00:54:07,923 --> 00:54:08,924
All right.

1199
00:54:09,925 --> 00:54:11,928
Well, thank you for the amazing

1200
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:12,928
presentation.

1201
00:54:12,928 --> 00:54:15,932
There's many places to begin, many ways

1202
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:16,932
to do it.

1203
00:54:16,932 --> 00:54:18,935
But again, thank you again for sharing

1204
00:54:18,935 --> 00:54:20,936
this information. So?

1205
00:54:20,936 --> 00:54:22,938
Denise: My pleasure!

1206
00:54:26,942 --> 00:54:27,944
Daniel: I'll start by just asking the

1207
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:27,944
live stream viewers if they want to ask

1208
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:31,947
anything, just put it in a live chat.

1209
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:33,950
And then perhaps? just there were so many

1210
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:33,950
topics that you brought up that perhaps I

1211
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:33,950
can just reflect on a few of the topics

1212
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:41,957
and just kind of

1213
00:54:41,957 --> 00:54:43,960
summarize it as as I heard it, especially

1214
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:43,960
where it's different from what we've

1215
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:43,960
heard in terms of framings on other

1216
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:43,960
streams where we go way more into the

1217
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:51,967
technical.

1218
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:53,970
But but there are just so many great ways

1219
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
that you had of framing what was

1220
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,972
happening.

1221
00:54:56,972 --> 00:54:57,973
OK, so good?

1222
00:54:57,973 --> 00:54:59,975
Denise: Yeah, sounds great.

1223
00:54:59,975 --> 00:55:01,972
Daniel: All right. So you described

1224
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:05,975
Active Inference as biologically based;

1225
00:55:06,976 --> 00:55:08,979
and one way that... biologically INSPIRED,

1226
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:08,979
, perhaps exactly, but based upon

1227
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:12,982
biological systems.

1228
00:55:12,982 --> 00:55:14,985
And it made me think about the way of

1229
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:14,985
viewing the world in terms of its spatial

1230
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:14,985
connectivity and then thinking about the

1231
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:14,985
world in terms of its statistical or

1232
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:26,996
causal connectivity.

1233
00:55:27,997 --> 00:55:29,000
And so when people think about what would

1234
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
biologically inspired AI look like, they

1235
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
might think about the actual connections

1236
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
amongst the neurons in the brain or the

1237
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
actual connections amongst ants in the

1238
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:39,009
colony.

1239
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:42,013
But that connectivity allows solving that

1240
00:55:42,013 --> 00:55:43,013
problem.

1241
00:55:43,013 --> 00:55:45,016
So if you want to solve some different

1242
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:45,016
problem or some thing else, you need to

1243
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:45,016
learn from those structures, but not copy

1244
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:51,021
them verbatim.

1245
00:55:51,021 --> 00:55:53,024
And so that level of learning that we

1246
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
have to pull back to and the level of

1247
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
thinking is about the agent in their

1248
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
engagement with the environment and the

1249
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
minimization of surprise instead of the

1250
00:55:53,024 --> 00:56:04,028
maximization of reward.

1251
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:06,031
And that's a really clear path, I think,

1252
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
from what we can generalize from natural

1253
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
intelligence towards how we can think

1254
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
about what kinds of imperatives we should

1255
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,031
design and what design principles should

1256
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:19,043
be for synthetic intelligent agents.

1257
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,046
Denise: Absolutely. Yeah.

1258
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,049
Daniel: Okay.

1259
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,054
What brought you to this presentation?

1260
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:29,054
Like what was your way into the Spatial

1261
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:35,059
Web or how did this even come to be?

1262
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,063
Denise: Well, so Dan Mapes, who's one of

1263
00:56:38,063 --> 00:56:38,063
the co-founders, he's a longtime friend

1264
00:56:38,063 --> 00:56:42,066
of mine.

1265
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:47,072
And, you know, so I knew when he and his

1266
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
co-founder, Gabriel Ren?, who's the CEO

1267
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:47,072
of Verses, when they were starting Verses

1268
00:56:47,072 --> 00:57:01,079
back in 2016, 2017 -

1269
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,084
so, you know, I knew what I knew what was

1270
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:06,084
coming.

1271
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:08,087
And I've been kind of watching it unfold

1272
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:08,087
over the last, like, you know, handful of

1273
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:11,089
years.

1274
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,094
And so then last summer, you know, it

1275
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:15,094
became really clear to me that, you know,

1276
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:15,094
Verses was getting close to launching to

1277
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:24,102
the public.

1278
00:57:24,102 --> 00:57:26,105
You know, they've been working over the

1279
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:26,105
past, you know, couple of years with like

1280
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:26,105
Fortune 500 companies, with, you know,

1281
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:26,105
governments and smart city development

1282
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:35,113
all over the globe.

1283
00:57:35,113 --> 00:57:37,116
They've been involved in this Flying

1284
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:38,116
Forward project.

1285
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:40,119
You know, they've been deep into the

1286
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:41,119
supply chain -

1287
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,123
one of the first apps they created was an

1288
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:44,123
app called Wayfinder, which is

1289
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:44,123
specifically built for, you know, the

1290
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:51,129
supply chain.

1291
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,133
And so, you know, watching all of that,

1292
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:54,133
but then knowing it's coming to later

1293
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:54,133
this year, I was like, okay, there's a

1294
00:57:54,133 --> 00:58:01,133
transition.

1295
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:03,136
And, you know, people need to understand

1296
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
what's coming, because, you know, I've

1297
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
been involved in like, you know,

1298
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
blockchain and Web3 for the last, you

1299
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:13,145
know, handful of years.

1300
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:15,148
And so you see all these amazing

1301
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:15,148
technologies being built and all these

1302
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:20,152
awesome projects.

1303
00:58:20,152 --> 00:58:22,155
But one of the biggest problems is that

1304
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:22,155
they're all siloed and the

1305
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:22,155
interoperability is the biggest struggle.

1306
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:26,158
.

1307
00:58:26,158 --> 00:58:28,161
So, you know, to me, it's like, okay, you

1308
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:28,161
know, these people need to know that this

1309
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:32,164
is coming.

1310
00:58:32,164 --> 00:58:34,167
And, you know, the interoperability is

1311
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:34,167
going to be there for, you know, not just

1312
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:34,167
within the Web3 or the blockchain space,

1313
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:41,173
but really all technology.

1314
00:58:42,174 --> 00:58:44,177
Really, you know, anybody who has a

1315
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
business that is present on the World

1316
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
Wide Web is going to want to evolve that

1317
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
presence into the Spatial Web, just for

1318
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
the empowerment of what this AI and this

1319
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:44,177
interoperability is going to do for their

1320
00:58:44,177 --> 00:58:57,189
business.

1321
00:58:57,189 --> 00:59:02,188
So I knew there was a learning curve.

1322
00:59:02,188 --> 00:59:04,191
So that's really what I set out to do,

1323
00:59:04,191 --> 00:59:04,191
was to kind of break down that learning

1324
00:59:04,191 --> 00:59:04,191
curve and really start to educate people

1325
00:59:04,191 --> 00:59:04,191
about the protocol, about the AI and

1326
00:59:04,191 --> 00:59:12,198
about what to expect.

1327
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,203
Daniel: All right. Great. Um, few more

1328
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:16,203
questions. Again, we're just starting to

1329
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:21,207
explore this.

1330
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:23,210
And so whatever you do or don't know is

1331
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,210
all good. How will the open source nature

1332
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,210
of the web and the ecosystem around

1333
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,210
Active Inference related technologies be

1334
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:33,219
secured?

1335
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,223
Denise: Well, so, so basically, you know,

1336
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:36,223
you have to think of the COSM operating

1337
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:36,223
system as that's, that's literally the

1338
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:36,223
operating system that is going to enable

1339
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:36,223
people to easily build with build these

1340
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:36,223
intelligent agents within the Spatial Web

1341
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:51,237
network, right?

1342
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:55,242
So, you know, that allows anybody to come

1343
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
on this network and build these, build

1344
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
these intelligent agents, these

1345
00:59:55,242 --> 01:00:03,997
intelligent apps, right?

1346
01:00:03,997 --> 01:00:07,060
So the beauty of it is that the protocol

1347
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:07,060
itself for the Spatial Web, it bakes in

1348
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:15,598
security at every touch point, right?

1349
01:00:15,598 --> 01:00:19,012
So you can program in access permissions,

1350
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:19,012
different things like that into whatever

1351
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:25,597
you're building.

1352
01:00:26,697 --> 01:00:28,931
So it really becomes individualized,

1353
01:00:28,931 --> 01:00:28,931
right? You can, you can gate off to where,

1354
01:00:28,931 --> 01:00:28,931
, you know, you have data that's

1355
01:00:28,931 --> 01:00:34,496
proprietary.

1356
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:36,738
And then you have data that's allowed to

1357
01:00:36,738 --> 01:00:38,896
be accessed by the world.

1358
01:00:38,896 --> 01:00:40,137
You can, you can make it look however you

1359
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:40,137
want for whatever you're building,

1360
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:44,495
whatever your project is.

1361
01:00:44,495 --> 01:00:46,743
And what these intelligent apps then

1362
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:46,743
become is, it's your opportunity to share

1363
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:52,294
your knowledge with the world, right?

1364
01:00:52,294 --> 01:00:54,547
And you can share it to whatever extent

1365
01:00:54,547 --> 01:00:57,794
that you, that you want to, you know.

1366
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:00,500
Daniel: Thanks.

1367
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,874
When talking about just a few terms, I

1368
01:01:03,874 --> 01:01:03,874
wrote down - culture, ownership,

1369
01:01:03,874 --> 01:01:07,199
authority -

1370
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,536
How do differences amongst locations and

1371
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:10,536
peoples play out when there are such

1372
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:10,536
different concepts of those mentioned

1373
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:20,498
terms and many other terms that arose?

1374
01:01:20,498 --> 01:01:23,800
It might not just be something like, well,

1375
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:23,800
, the drone can go a hundred feet here

1376
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,197
and 10 feet here.

1377
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:29,407
What about when there's different

1378
01:01:29,407 --> 01:01:29,407
concepts of authority and ownership and

1379
01:01:29,407 --> 01:01:33,796
justice and culture?

1380
01:01:33,796 --> 01:01:37,217
Denise: Right. So, well, so that's, that'

1381
01:01:37,217 --> 01:01:37,217
's one of the, it's one of the beauties

1382
01:01:37,217 --> 01:01:37,217
of the world is that, you know, we all

1383
01:01:37,217 --> 01:01:37,217
have our own unique understandings, our

1384
01:01:37,217 --> 01:01:37,217
own unique beliefs, our own unique

1385
01:01:37,217 --> 01:01:55,099
cultural traditions.

1386
01:01:55,099 --> 01:01:59,139
And the differing governing bodies and

1387
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:02,109
types of government, right?

1388
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:04,138
So the protocol needed to be built to be

1389
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:07,159
able to preserve all of that?

1390
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:09,180
"You know, you don't want there to be

1391
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:09,180
this next evolution of technology that

1392
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:09,180
includes AI that becomes this

1393
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:09,180
dictatorship of, you know, ""This is the

1394
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:17,259
way the world's going to be,"

1395
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:18,274
"and this is how everybody has to

1396
01:02:18,274 --> 01:02:19,279
operate!"""

1397
01:02:19,279 --> 01:02:21,308
This preserves the uniqueness and the

1398
01:02:21,308 --> 01:02:25,339
individuality of everybody in any area.

1399
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:28,379
So really the way this plays out, it's

1400
01:02:28,379 --> 01:02:28,379
going to be able to be customized for

1401
01:02:28,379 --> 01:02:28,379
region, for, you know, cultures, belief

1402
01:02:28,379 --> 01:02:39,479
systems, you know.

1403
01:02:39,479 --> 01:02:42,512
So it's like this socio-technical ability

1404
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:42,512
to, you know, safeguard and preserve

1405
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:42,512
traditions and different things and

1406
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:49,579
mindsets.

1407
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:52,614
So, you know, really it's, it's, it's,

1408
01:02:52,614 --> 01:02:52,614
you know, it's not going to be a

1409
01:02:52,614 --> 01:02:52,614
hindrance as much as it is going to be

1410
01:02:52,614 --> 01:02:52,614
something that, you know, kind of

1411
01:02:52,614 --> 01:03:06,689
preserves the beauty of individuality.

1412
01:03:06,689 --> 01:03:08,711
And so when you're talking about systems

1413
01:03:08,711 --> 01:03:08,711
like that, like you were talking about,

1414
01:03:08,711 --> 01:03:08,711
you know, it's pretty much going to be

1415
01:03:08,711 --> 01:03:14,769
similar to where it is today.

1416
01:03:14,769 --> 01:03:16,797
You know, like, you know, people have the

1417
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:16,797
right to? the right of refusal, right?

1418
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:20,829
[Laughs]

1419
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:22,851
"You know, even in a restaurant, you know,

1420
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:22,851
, ""no shirt, no shirt, shoes, no service,

1421
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:25,879
,"" you know!"

1422
01:03:25,879 --> 01:03:27,904
So, you know, there's not going to be a

1423
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,929
lot of difference with that, you know.

1424
01:03:30,929 --> 01:03:32,951
And then, so when you're talking about

1425
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:32,951
things like drone delivery and things

1426
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:32,951
like that, then you're going to have

1427
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:32,951
other standards bodies that are making

1428
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:32,951
those decisions to, you know, make things

1429
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:32,951
more inclusive rather than, you know,

1430
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:32,951
kind of silliness of, you know, denying

1431
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:47,099
people for whatever reason.

1432
01:03:48,109 --> 01:03:49,119
Daniel: Wow! All right.

1433
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,149
I'll ask a question from the live chat.

1434
01:03:52,149 --> 01:03:54,176
"Bert asks, ""Thank you for the

1435
01:03:54,176 --> 01:03:56,189
presentation."

1436
01:03:56,189 --> 01:03:58,219
What is the limitation of implementing

1437
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:00,170
this vision?

1438
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,192
"Is it getting people to use the

1439
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:02,192
hyperspatial language or getting Active

1440
01:04:02,192 --> 01:04:07,239
Inference working right?"""

1441
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:10,269
Or I'll add a secret third thing.

1442
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:14,310
Denise: "Well, so, so, you know, I've had

1443
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:14,310
people say that, you know, ask that with

1444
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:14,310
me saying, you know, ""Well, what's the

1445
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:14,310
guarantee that anybody's going to, you

1446
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:14,310
know, you know, take part in this new

1447
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:27,439
Spatial Web?"""

1448
01:04:27,439 --> 01:04:29,468
And it's you have to think of the way the

1449
01:04:29,468 --> 01:04:32,489
Internet has evolved, right?

1450
01:04:33,499 --> 01:04:35,519
This isn't just like this whole separate

1451
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:35,519
network that you're going to try to bring

1452
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:38,549
everybody on to.

1453
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:39,569
It's the same network we're already on,

1454
01:04:39,569 --> 01:04:39,569
and it's just evolving the capabilities

1455
01:04:39,569 --> 01:04:43,599
within that network.

1456
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,627
So, you know, when you think of the way

1457
01:04:45,627 --> 01:04:45,627
the Internet started, you know, when you

1458
01:04:45,627 --> 01:04:45,627
had like TCP/IP and the killer app was

1459
01:04:45,627 --> 01:04:52,689
email.

1460
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:57,739
And then Sir Tim Berners-Lee created HTTP

1461
01:04:57,739 --> 01:04:58,749
and HTML.

1462
01:04:58,749 --> 01:05:00,715
And then you had the World Wide Web,

1463
01:05:00,715 --> 01:05:01,719
right?

1464
01:05:01,719 --> 01:05:04,749
So it didn't get rid of email!

1465
01:05:04,749 --> 01:05:05,769
It just enabled this whole other

1466
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:05,769
capability that now people could build

1467
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:09,799
websites.

1468
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:11,826
Now, instead of just sending, you know,

1469
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:11,826
digital messages from computer to

1470
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:11,826
computer, you could actually bring an

1471
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:11,826
audience to your web page and engage that

1472
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:21,919
way on the Internet.

1473
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,936
And you could do it that way on like a

1474
01:05:22,936 --> 01:05:24,949
property within the network.

1475
01:05:24,949 --> 01:05:26,976
So that's all that's happening right now,

1476
01:05:26,976 --> 01:05:26,976
is that we're just taking the capability

1477
01:05:26,976 --> 01:05:26,976
from this Web 2 environment that really

1478
01:05:26,976 --> 01:05:33,039
lacks security;

1479
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,070
and it lacks protection for people and

1480
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:37,079
their data;

1481
01:05:38,089 --> 01:05:40,117
and it opens up a lot of vulnerabilities,

1482
01:05:40,117 --> 01:05:40,117
because you have to all of the

1483
01:05:40,117 --> 01:05:45,159
transactions are taking place,

1484
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:48,193
the data is transacting on a website,

1485
01:05:48,193 --> 01:05:48,193
which is the property of a centralized

1486
01:05:48,193 --> 01:05:54,249
organization, right?

1487
01:05:54,249 --> 01:05:55,267
So what this is doing is, it's

1488
01:05:55,267 --> 01:05:57,279
decentralizing it;

1489
01:05:57,279 --> 01:06:00,257
now, everything in any space becomes

1490
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:00,257
programmable and becomes a spatial domain,

1491
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:06,309
, right?

1492
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:11,359
So now you have self-sovereign identity;

1493
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,389
you have zero-trust architecture;

1494
01:06:14,389 --> 01:06:17,422
you have this ability to program 3D

1495
01:06:17,422 --> 01:06:18,429
spaces.

1496
01:06:19,439 --> 01:06:21,469
So it's going to be a natural progression

1497
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:21,469
for people to come, you know, tp take

1498
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:21,469
advantage of this new programming

1499
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:21,469
language to, you know, be able to empower

1500
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:21,469
and expand what they can do within the

1501
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:35,599
network we already are on.

1502
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,625
So, you know, the World Wide Web is like

1503
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:39,639
40 billion computers!

1504
01:06:39,639 --> 01:06:41,667
Now we're evolving from just computers to

1505
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:41,667
spaces and objects and everything within

1506
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:45,699
there.

1507
01:06:45,699 --> 01:06:47,721
So, you know, it's not going to be a

1508
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:47,721
matter of people? getting people to do

1509
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:50,749
that.

1510
01:06:50,749 --> 01:06:52,775
"It's, you know, people are going to go, "

1511
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,789
""Wow, I can do that!"""

1512
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:57,819
And, you know, it's going to be a natural

1513
01:06:57,819 --> 01:06:58,829
progression.

1514
01:06:58,829 --> 01:07:00,794
As far as the Active Inference AI, it's

1515
01:07:00,794 --> 01:07:00,794
going to start working within the network,

1516
01:07:00,794 --> 01:07:05,839
, and it's just going to grow.

1517
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,869
So the more people are engaging on, you

1518
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:08,869
know, within the Spatial Web network, and

1519
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:08,869
the more people that are building these

1520
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:15,939
AI apps?

1521
01:07:15,939 --> 01:07:17,961
And I think, if we look at what's

1522
01:07:17,961 --> 01:07:17,961
happened just in the first six months of

1523
01:07:17,961 --> 01:07:17,961
this year since ChatGPT came out, with

1524
01:07:17,961 --> 01:07:17,961
all of the, you know, all of the open

1525
01:07:17,961 --> 01:07:17,961
source and everything that's been

1526
01:07:17,961 --> 01:07:17,961
available as soon as it got available to

1527
01:07:17,961 --> 01:07:31,099
the public -

1528
01:07:31,099 --> 01:07:33,119
And now we can tinker with it.

1529
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,129
Now we can build things.

1530
01:07:34,129 --> 01:07:37,159
You've had an explosion of development!

1531
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:39,189
So, you know, with the ability to build

1532
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:39,189
these intelligent agents within the

1533
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:39,189
network and do it very easily and have

1534
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:39,189
this interoperability within the network,

1535
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:39,189
I just see it as, we're going to have

1536
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:54,329
this explosion of development.

1537
01:07:54,329 --> 01:07:57,362
So that's, of course, that's my opinion,

1538
01:07:57,362 --> 01:08:00,330
but that's what I see happening.

1539
01:08:01,339 --> 01:08:02,349
Daniel: You stake your claim!

1540
01:08:02,349 --> 01:08:03,359
That's a beautiful thing.

1541
01:08:04,369 --> 01:08:05,379
I'll ask another question.

1542
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:07,399
Your answer led perfectly to it.

1543
01:08:08,409 --> 01:08:09,419
Bert asked again in the chat:

1544
01:08:11,439 --> 01:08:13,464
"""Also, is there a resource where we can

1545
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:13,464
learn more about how to build a

1546
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:17,499
hyperSpatial Website?"""

1547
01:08:18,509 --> 01:08:21,541
Denise: So, I don't think there? I don't

1548
01:08:21,541 --> 01:08:24,569
think those resources are out yet.

1549
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:28,612
And, you know, and it's not going to be a

1550
01:08:28,612 --> 01:08:29,619
website.

1551
01:08:30,629 --> 01:08:33,661
So, you know, it's as soon as the COSM

1552
01:08:33,661 --> 01:08:33,661
operating system launches, the AI is

1553
01:08:33,661 --> 01:08:33,661
going to become a tool for building

1554
01:08:33,661 --> 01:08:40,729
anything.

1555
01:08:41,739 --> 01:08:43,765
So the other side of this app store where

1556
01:08:43,765 --> 01:08:43,765
you can build an intelligent agent is the

1557
01:08:43,765 --> 01:08:47,799
interface.

1558
01:08:48,809 --> 01:08:50,835
The public interface is an intelligent

1559
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:50,835
agent called GIA, and it stands for

1560
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:55,879
General Intelligent Agent.

1561
01:08:56,889 --> 01:08:59,923
So GIA then becomes the interface for the

1562
01:08:59,923 --> 01:08:59,923
public of the network, of the Spatial Web.

1563
01:08:59,923 --> 01:09:03,899
.

1564
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:06,930
So GIA is going to become your personal

1565
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:07,939
assistant -

1566
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:09,959
everybody's personal assistant.

1567
01:09:10,969 --> 01:09:13,002
GIA will be able to act on your behalf

1568
01:09:13,002 --> 01:09:15,019
within the network.

1569
01:09:16,029 --> 01:09:20,072
So, you know, just like with ChatGPT-4

1570
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:20,072
and how the AIs are starting to be able

1571
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:26,129
to program.

1572
01:09:27,139 --> 01:09:29,163
So within the Spatial Web, the AI is

1573
01:09:29,163 --> 01:09:29,163
going to play an integral part in

1574
01:09:29,163 --> 01:09:29,163
creating your own intelligent agents and,

1575
01:09:29,163 --> 01:09:36,229
you know, doing your own?

1576
01:09:38,249 --> 01:09:40,273
establishing your own presences and, you

1577
01:09:40,273 --> 01:09:40,273
know, spatial domains and things like

1578
01:09:40,273 --> 01:09:43,299
that.

1579
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:46,336
So I don't have a lot of detail on how

1580
01:09:46,336 --> 01:09:46,336
that's going to look or work, but that's

1581
01:09:46,336 --> 01:09:52,389
my general understanding of it.

1582
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:54,412
So I don't think there's going to be a

1583
01:09:54,412 --> 01:09:54,412
huge learning curve when it comes to that.

1584
01:09:54,412 --> 01:09:57,439
.

1585
01:09:59,459 --> 01:10:01,422
Daniel: Wow. All right! I'll go to

1586
01:10:01,422 --> 01:10:01,422
another question. Dave asked in the chat,

1587
01:10:01,422 --> 01:10:04,449
,

1588
01:10:05,459 --> 01:10:07,485
"""Does Verses plan eventually to expand

1589
01:10:07,485 --> 01:10:07,485
the inventory of Element types (beyond

1590
01:10:07,485 --> 01:10:07,485
the 12 mentioned in today's

1591
01:10:07,485 --> 01:10:13,539
presentation)?"

1592
01:10:14,549 --> 01:10:15,568
"People negotiate concerns that don't

1593
01:10:15,568 --> 01:10:18,589
seem to fit easily in this framework."""

1594
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:22,636
Denise: Yeah. So I don't know. I don't

1595
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:26,669
know if I can really answer that.

1596
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,699
And the reason why is because I don't?

1597
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:32,738
I don't? my technical knowledge of what's

1598
01:10:32,738 --> 01:10:32,738
happening behind the scenes is very

1599
01:10:32,738 --> 01:10:36,769
limited.

1600
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:39,806
So the answer could be yes; it could be

1601
01:10:39,806 --> 01:10:41,819
it's already there.

1602
01:10:41,819 --> 01:10:44,853
I mean, the reality is, is those those 12

1603
01:10:44,853 --> 01:10:44,853
aspects are just, you know, kind of a

1604
01:10:44,853 --> 01:10:44,853
generalized idea of what you can program.

1605
01:10:44,853 --> 01:10:51,919
.

1606
01:10:52,929 --> 01:10:54,957
But when you're talking about, you know,

1607
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:54,957
HSTP being multidimensional, you know,

1608
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:54,957
and you can program in everything from

1609
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:54,957
like, you know, temperature to, you know,

1610
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:54,957
pressure to, you know, you can... you can.

1611
01:10:54,957 --> 01:11:07,019
... you can?

1612
01:11:07,019 --> 01:11:09,049
If it's programmable and definable, you

1613
01:11:09,049 --> 01:11:09,049
know, in a computational form, you can?

1614
01:11:09,049 --> 01:11:09,049
you can bake it into, you know, the

1615
01:11:09,049 --> 01:11:09,049
context around whatever you're

1616
01:11:09,049 --> 01:11:19,139
programming.

1617
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:22,176
So, you know, in that respect, it's it's

1618
01:11:22,176 --> 01:11:22,176
pretty unlimited, except for that

1619
01:11:22,176 --> 01:11:22,176
limitation, as long as it's measurable

1620
01:11:22,176 --> 01:11:30,249
and definable in a computational way.

1621
01:11:30,249 --> 01:11:31,268
Daniel: I'll try to restate that, just

1622
01:11:31,268 --> 01:11:31,268
how I heard it, because I think it's a

1623
01:11:31,268 --> 01:11:35,299
really important point.

1624
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:38,337
The 12 (again, this can be totally off

1625
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:38,337
base if I don't have any information),

1626
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:38,337
but the 12 components shown are kind of

1627
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:38,337
like fully? one way of fully showing your

1628
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:48,429
work.

1629
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:52,472
But when you really get down to the last

1630
01:11:52,472 --> 01:11:52,472
mile and the shoes on the ground, you're

1631
01:11:52,472 --> 01:11:52,472
in the realm of the particulars and the

1632
01:11:52,472 --> 01:11:52,472
specific measurements, at which point

1633
01:11:52,472 --> 01:11:52,472
complex cultural topics will be playing

1634
01:11:52,472 --> 01:11:52,472
out through the minute particulars, not

1635
01:11:52,472 --> 01:11:52,472
necessarily inheriting some stringency

1636
01:11:52,472 --> 01:12:14,629
from a top-down ontology.

1637
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:17,660
If that's fair, I just want to kind of

1638
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:18,669
say it that way.

1639
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:20,689
Denise: Yeah.

1640
01:12:20,689 --> 01:12:22,712
Daniel: OK! You mentioned, I think, a few

1641
01:12:22,712 --> 01:12:22,712
times in the presentation, the idea of

1642
01:12:22,712 --> 01:12:25,739
realities.

1643
01:12:26,749 --> 01:12:28,776
So, yeah, we have our beloved cyber-

1644
01:12:28,776 --> 01:12:30,789
-physical reality.

1645
01:12:31,799 --> 01:12:33,819
And what other are the plural realities?

1646
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:37,862
Denise: So basically, when you think of

1647
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:37,862
being able to, you know, program the

1648
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:37,862
context into the spaces, right, then that

1649
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:37,862
provides you with a digital twin, which

1650
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:37,862
automatically is giving you this mixed

1651
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:52,009
reality ability.

1652
01:12:53,019 --> 01:12:56,050
Right? Because, you know, digital twin

1653
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:56,050
and then physical reality, this is going

1654
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:56,050
to open us up to this augmented existence,

1655
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:56,050
, this augmented reality existence that

1656
01:12:56,050 --> 01:13:08,109
we all kind of envision.

1657
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,129
But the foundation hasn't been there.

1658
01:13:11,139 --> 01:13:13,159
The framework hasn't really been there.

1659
01:13:14,169 --> 01:13:15,179
This is providing that framework.

1660
01:13:16,189 --> 01:13:18,219
So we're going to? we're going to see

1661
01:13:18,219 --> 01:13:18,219
this kind of augmented reality future for

1662
01:13:18,219 --> 01:13:18,219
us, you know, where we're able to cross,

1663
01:13:18,219 --> 01:13:29,319
you know, cross through mixed realities.

1664
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:31,344
You're going to have the virtual reality,

1665
01:13:31,344 --> 01:13:31,344
you're going to have the augmented

1666
01:13:31,344 --> 01:13:31,344
reality, and then you're going to have

1667
01:13:31,344 --> 01:13:35,379
the physical reality.

1668
01:13:36,389 --> 01:13:38,411
And there's going to be an unlimited way

1669
01:13:38,411 --> 01:13:39,419
of mixing that.

1670
01:13:40,429 --> 01:13:42,452
And then the other aspect of this, too,

1671
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:42,452
is when you talk about like virtual

1672
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:42,452
reality and you talk about the metaverses

1673
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:42,452
and different, you know, metaverse

1674
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:42,452
experiences, you know, I think one of the

1675
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:42,452
reasons why the metaverse experience has

1676
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:42,452
been so lackluster is because they're

1677
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:57,599
siloed right now!

1678
01:13:58,609 --> 01:14:00,571
When you consider the Spatial Web, that's

1679
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:00,571
going to be able to make it to where you

1680
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:00,571
can jump in and out of these virtual

1681
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:05,619
reality spaces.

1682
01:14:06,629 --> 01:14:08,659
You can actually take your assets from

1683
01:14:08,659 --> 01:14:08,659
one space to another space, because all

1684
01:14:08,659 --> 01:14:08,659
of it then becomes interoperable over the

1685
01:14:08,659 --> 01:14:16,729
network.

1686
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:19,761
So this is going to really open up -

1687
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:19,761
everything that we've been wanting to do

1688
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:19,761
is going to now be possible within this

1689
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:28,849
Spatial Web network.

1690
01:14:29,859 --> 01:14:32,890
Daniel: Great. All right. As we kind of

1691
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:32,890
begin to land the plane, I'll just

1692
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:32,890
reflect on two or so positive aspects

1693
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:32,890
that I think are part of the vision,

1694
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:32,890
which we will, of course, await future

1695
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:32,890
sensory observations to confirm, reduce

1696
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:48,049
our surprise.

1697
01:14:49,059 --> 01:14:51,079
But in Active Inference, what we expect

1698
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:52,089
is what we prefer.

1699
01:14:53,099 --> 01:14:54,117
So if we think it's the most likely path

1700
01:14:54,117 --> 01:14:56,129
forward, then c'est la vie.

1701
01:14:56,129 --> 01:14:59,161
So the first positive thing is that it

1702
01:14:59,161 --> 01:14:59,161
starts from the actual and the

1703
01:14:59,161 --> 01:14:59,161
measurements, defining things at some

1704
01:14:59,161 --> 01:14:59,161
defined cyber-physical layer; and

1705
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:11,219
(potentially extrapolating here, but)

1706
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:14,251
earlier this week, we had a GuestStream

1707
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:14,251
with Mahault [Albarracin] and Maxwell

1708
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:17,279
[Ramstead].

1709
01:15:18,289 --> 01:15:20,318
And in the quantum Free Energy Principle

1710
01:15:20,318 --> 01:15:20,318
approach to the brain, there is a top

1711
01:15:20,318 --> 01:15:20,318
level decision maker within that blanket

1712
01:15:20,318 --> 01:15:28,389
where the buck stops.

1713
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,425
So that doesn't mean like that the brain

1714
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:31,425
is not composed of, you know, as a

1715
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:31,425
component of part of larger compositions;

1716
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:31,425
but within the given blanket, there's a

1717
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:40,509
highest stop.

1718
01:15:41,519 --> 01:15:43,547
So instead of handing our self-

1719
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:43,547
-sovereigntizing ability and intelligence

1720
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:43,547
to the black box, here we can start from

1721
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:43,547
the actual, maybe even pick up and

1722
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:43,547
stabilize or change what we already have.

1723
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:58,689
.

1724
01:15:59,699 --> 01:16:01,661
So rather than proposing just a totally

1725
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:01,661
different future that some scaling law is

1726
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:01,661
going to help us get to, maybe or maybe

1727
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:01,661
not, we start with like what we already

1728
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:01,661
measure and the decisions we already make.

1729
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:10,749
.

1730
01:16:11,759 --> 01:16:13,784
So I very much appreciate the pragmatism.

1731
01:16:13,784 --> 01:16:13,784
What else might you reflect on that

1732
01:16:13,784 --> 01:16:16,809
point?

1733
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:22,869
Denise: I think you said it well. Yeah.

1734
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:25,906
Daniel: OK! Then the second piece was

1735
01:16:25,906 --> 01:16:25,906
that everyone's knowledge is adding

1736
01:16:25,906 --> 01:16:29,939
something.

1737
01:16:30,949 --> 01:16:33,983
It might be a close sample or a distant

1738
01:16:33,983 --> 01:16:33,983
sample on some dimension in some setting;

1739
01:16:33,983 --> 01:16:33,983
but everyone, every cognitive agent is

1740
01:16:33,983 --> 01:16:43,079
adding non-zero information.

1741
01:16:44,089 --> 01:16:46,114
And there's a lot of technical details

1742
01:16:46,114 --> 01:16:48,129
underneath why that is.

1743
01:16:49,139 --> 01:16:51,162
The amount of information added might be

1744
01:16:51,162 --> 01:16:51,162
very small for a given question; but

1745
01:16:51,162 --> 01:16:51,162
because of differences, we literally get

1746
01:16:51,162 --> 01:16:57,219
more perspectives.

1747
01:16:58,229 --> 01:16:59,247
So we always see better with more

1748
01:16:59,247 --> 01:16:59,247
perspectives if we have the right

1749
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:03,219
integration approach.

1750
01:17:04,229 --> 01:17:06,255
So that's also very powerful. And it's

1751
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:06,255
something that is formally true with the

1752
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:11,299
math and the statistics.

1753
01:17:12,309 --> 01:17:15,340
And I think we want it to be true for our

1754
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,349
ecosystems.

1755
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:19,379
Denise: Right. Yeah, absolutely.

1756
01:17:20,389 --> 01:17:25,441
And it's interesting because, yeah, you

1757
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:25,441
want to preserve that, the diversity of

1758
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:25,441
information and opinion and have that

1759
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:37,559
accessible.

1760
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:39,579
For sure.

1761
01:17:39,579 --> 01:17:42,617
Daniel: Awesome. Well, it will be quite

1762
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:42,617
the coming days, probably, or at least as

1763
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:49,679
expected or preferred.

1764
01:17:50,689 --> 01:17:52,716
But we'll very much look forward to you

1765
01:17:52,716 --> 01:17:52,716
coming back on the ActInf Streams, as

1766
01:17:52,716 --> 01:17:52,716
well as some technical presentations that

1767
01:17:52,716 --> 01:17:52,716
might help our community and our

1768
01:17:52,716 --> 01:17:52,716
Institute learn, more about the details,

1769
01:17:52,716 --> 01:18:06,789
or more philosophical discussions.

1770
01:18:06,789 --> 01:18:08,812
The whole spectrum of learning and

1771
01:18:08,812 --> 01:18:08,812
applying and implementing these

1772
01:18:08,812 --> 01:18:08,812
technologies will be really important to

1773
01:18:08,812 --> 01:18:14,869
characterize.

1774
01:18:15,879 --> 01:18:16,896
But for sure, it's been incredible to

1775
01:18:16,896 --> 01:18:18,909
have you share this first bit.

1776
01:18:19,919 --> 01:18:21,939
Is there any last words you'd like?

1777
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:23,965
Denise: No, just thank you so much for

1778
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:24,969
having me.

1779
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:26,989
It's been a pleasure.

1780
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:29,001
And I will throw this out there.

1781
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:31,004
I know there's not a lot of information

1782
01:18:31,004 --> 01:18:31,004
available out there regarding the Spatial

1783
01:18:31,004 --> 01:18:37,009
Web and the Active Inference AI.

1784
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:39,012
So if anybody has any questions, feel

1785
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:41,013
free to reach out to me.

1786
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:45,018
You can reach me on Twitter or LinkedIn

1787
01:18:45,018 --> 01:18:48,020
or my blog, deniseholt.us.

1788
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:49,022
There's plenty of ways on there to reach

1789
01:18:49,022 --> 01:18:50,022
me.

1790
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:52,025
So I'm happy to answer any questions

1791
01:18:52,025 --> 01:18:53,025
anybody might have.

1792
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:56,028
Daniel: All right. Thank you, Denise.

1793
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:57,029
Till next time.

1794
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:59,031
Denise: Thanks a lot. Bye bye.
