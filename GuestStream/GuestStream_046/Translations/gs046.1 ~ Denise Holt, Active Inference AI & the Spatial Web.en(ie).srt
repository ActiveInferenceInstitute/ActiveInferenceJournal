1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,780
foreign

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,440
2023 we're in active guest stream 46.1

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,020
with Denise Holt so Denise thank you

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,240
very much for joining we'll have your

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,060
presentation first any length of time

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,460
you want and then we'll have a

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,619
discussion about some of the topics

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,080
you're bringing up and I'll read some

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,240
comments from the live chat too so

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,098
thanks again Denise looking forward to

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,960
your presentation

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,180
hi Daniel thank you so much for having

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,980
me today

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,960
um yeah so let's just Dive Right In

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,840
today I'm going to be talking about

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,840
active inference Ai and the spatial web

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,960
and uh for those who are not familiar

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,180
um there is a company called versus Ai

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,960
and they're basically uh delivering the

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,379
next generation of AI this is beyond uh

21
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,300
the current machine learning deep

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,640
learning models that we're all so

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,159
familiar with that are incredible tools

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,280
but really those are tools they are

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,860
great at creating content performing

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,799
tasks things like that but you know they

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,260
operate in a way that is

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,020
um you know pattern matching and they're

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,840
all siled in their ability for what they

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,600
they can do they're trained on enormous

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,180
amounts of data to increase the pattern

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,280
recognition you know and hopefully

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,820
increase accurate you know outputs but

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,100
that's really what they do

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,079
um what versus has created is something

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
completely different and it's based on

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
active inference and so active inference

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,860
AI is entire really new and this is the

39
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,799
AI that will be able to give us to uh

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,420
AGI you know leading to synthetic

41
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,180
self-evolving intelligence

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,439
so today

43
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,659
um what I'm going to be talking about in

44
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,880
uh this deck is

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,740
um you know active inference Ai and the

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,340
spatial web and how these Technologies

47
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,459
are going to affect and change the world

48
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,319
we'll talk about how active inference

49
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,180
Works within with artificial

50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,379
intelligence

51
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,500
uh how the spatial web protocol enables

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,840
the perception and the belief updating

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,140
of the AI and how these Technologies

54
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,840
together enable the only AI in the world

55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,020
that can run critical operations

56
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,840
um for systems or infrastructure smart

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,599
cities you know the planet so when

58
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,640
you're talking about airports hospitals

59
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,200
things like that

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,920
um

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,220
so yeah so let's Dive Right In

62
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,580
so the spatial web what is that

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,400
so the spatial webs being called the

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,920
network of everything basically it's the

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,379
next evolution of the internet and it's

66
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,340
powered by AI so this is taking us from

67
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,180
a library of pages and documents that we

68
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,060
have in the world wide web and

69
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,599
um

70
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,300
oh my gosh my dog is wanting out I'm so

71
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,159
sorry I have to let him out

72
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,120
sorry about that so um

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
the next evolution of the internet

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,659
um now you know as I said World Wide Web

75
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,599
a library of pages documents

76
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,120
um you know everything is static

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,940
um the spatial web protocol hstp

78
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,959
hyperspace transaction protocol and uh

79
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,180
the programming language for the

80
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,940
protocol called uh hsml which is

81
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,280
hyperspace modeling language

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,799
this new protocol takes us into a

83
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,200
library of spaces where you know we have

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,659
spatial domains and everything within

85
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,180
any any space

86
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,239
um can be locatable and programmable

87
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,580
within this new network

88
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,620
so and it's just extending the protocol

89
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,620
that we have now right so same internet

90
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,060
just more capabilities

91
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,780
now uh Dr Carl J friston and the versus

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,540
AI white paper and I'm sure a lot of you

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,560
are familiar with him uh the father of

94
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,820
active inference and the free energy

95
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,259
principle

96
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,639
now um

97
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,280
so versus

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,860
with uh with Dr friston has developed a

99
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,840
new type of AI that mimics the

100
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,479
self-organized systems of nested

101
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,000
intelligence found in nature and it's

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,580
based on his methodologies of active

103
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,560
inference and the free energy principle

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,500
and the spatial web protocols which I

105
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,720
just mentioned which were developed by

106
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,080
versus AI in December they put out a

107
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,660
white paper called designing ecosystems

108
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,419
of intelligence from first principles

109
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,080
and just to back up a second you know

110
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,500
versus created the protocol uh the hstp

111
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
and the hsml but donated it to the

112
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,300
public because nobody can own the

113
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,280
internet but they needed that in place

114
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,380
for what they wanted to do as a company

115
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,780
so that framework needed to be there so

116
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,479
then they also donated the protocol and

117
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,080
the IP to the IEEE which is one of the

118
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,840
largest core standards bodies that

119
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,280
develops everything with you know

120
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,620
electronics and Engineering you know

121
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,360
they're responsible for the core

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
standards around things like Bluetooth

123
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
and Wi-Fi and and things like that

124
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,120
so the core standards have been being

125
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,860
developed around the protocol for the

126
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,580
last almost three years and

127
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,680
um and yeah versus in that time has been

128
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,620
building you know what they've what

129
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,180
they've been building which I'll I'll be

130
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,560
talking about

131
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,120
so

132
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,000
what is this why paper about

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
um it's basically about shared

134
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,100
intelligence so in the white paper they

135
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,340
proposed cyber physical nested

136
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,100
ecosystems of distributed intelligence

137
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,220
joining humans machines and AI agents on

138
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,900
a common Network

139
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,759
so um

140
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,639
we're talking about uh

141
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,060
humans as integral participants uh

142
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,080
adaptive Behavior self-evidencing

143
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,240
self-organization belief updating over

144
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,520
several scales

145
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,100
um belief sharing over ensembles of

146
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,319
Agents so we're talking about a network

147
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,259
of intelligent agents and collective

148
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,600
intelligence and then of course the

149
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,780
protocols uh hstp and hsml

150
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,560
so

151
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,000
the knowledge graph and digital twins

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,039
um digital twins of our planet and all

153
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,819
nested systems and entities within them

154
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,180
um so nested ecosystems intelligent

155
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,900
agents both human and synthetic

156
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,180
sensing and perceiving continuously in

157
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,000
evolving environments

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,600
making sense of changes updating their

159
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,520
mental model and what they know to be

160
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,560
true and then acting on the new

161
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,120
information they receive

162
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,220
and in the white paper it's also

163
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,860
discussing a network of distributed

164
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,520
intelligence so this enables a cognitive

165
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,099
architecture made up of the collective

166
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,919
intelligence of multiple agents that

167
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,259
continuously communicate coordinate and

168
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,080
collaborate with each other

169
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,699
um individual and specialized

170
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,940
intelligences are all coming together on

171
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,180
a common Network

172
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,060
uh they're speaking a Common Language

173
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,759
hsml and hstp

174
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,660
um

175
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,120
it's efficient powerful cross

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,759
communication to perform tasks regulate

177
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,340
systems and address problems in real

178
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,940
time and it scales up and grows in

179
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,960
tandem with humans

180
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,300
so active inference and the free energy

181
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,060
principle

182
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,900
so what exactly is active inference

183
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,500
active inference is a biologically

184
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,020
inspired approach to AI systems as a

185
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,060
method for understanding Behavior

186
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,940
incorporating the brain cognition and

187
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,339
behavior modeled after the design

188
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,580
principles from nature and from how the

189
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,860
brain nervous system and the body act

190
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,479
and react

191
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,880
one of the questions that Dr friston

192
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,600
asks in this paper that is uh an

193
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,519
important question in reference to

194
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,240
active inference is you know with AI

195
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
systems you need to be able to

196
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,200
understand what is it that intelligence

197
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,080
must be given that intelligent systems

198
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,200
exist in a universe like ours

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,300
so active inference is a theoretical

200
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,300
framework that describes how agents like

201
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,540
people animals robots or artificial

202
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,640
systems can maintain their internal

203
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,760
States and behavior in unison with their

204
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,320
objectives or goals

205
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,019
so what is the free energy principle the

206
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,940
free energy principle is the theoretical

207
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,060
Foundation of active inference it

208
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,580
proposes that organisms or agents

209
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,620
maintain their internal States and

210
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,080
behavior by acting in a way that

211
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,820
minimizes the difference between their

212
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,680
current beliefs about the world and what

213
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,920
they expect to be true so in other words

214
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,560
the agents try to make things more

215
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,420
predictable by mitigating the difference

216
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,240
between what they expect to happen and

217
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,120
what actually ends up happening

218
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,839
and they do this uh by way of a cons a

219
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,700
continuous cycle of improving their

220
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,660
perception by acting on the environment

221
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,600
um so basically it helps to extract the

222
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,019
signal from the noise and extract the

223
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,320
regularities from the irregularities

224
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,899
um so extracting the prediction error

225
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:21,240
minimizing the prediction error

226
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,240
and you know there are there are two

227
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,420
parts to this uh to this inference cycle

228
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,339
you know there's the perceptual

229
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,820
inference part uh which minimizes the

230
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,620
free energy by improving the internal

231
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,500
model to better match the sensory uh

232
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,540
input

233
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,760
um making Bayesian inferences about the

234
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,519
world the brain minimizes free energy by

235
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,540
optimizing perception so through

236
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,640
hypothesizing and observation in other

237
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
words the brain models the environment

238
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,100
better improving the perception now the

239
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,000
active inference part uh minimizes the

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,940
free energy by acting on the environment

241
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,519
so acting on the environment to reduce

242
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,180
the surprises the disorder or the

243
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,779
unpredictability and action can

244
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,079
indirectly influence the observation

245
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,480
so active inference the active inference

246
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,060
part of free energy minimization is

247
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,760
equal to lowering the surprise in the

248
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,760
sensory observations by acting on the

249
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,959
environment

250
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,779
actions can't directly change

251
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,180
observations but they can indirectly

252
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,220
change them by acting on the

253
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,180
environmental States

254
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,420
so then we get to active inference AI

255
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,240
so in the context of artificial

256
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,120
intelligence active inference and the

257
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,820
free energy principle explain how agents

258
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,760
can learn and adapt to new situations

259
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,980
and how they can generate predictions

260
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,040
and plan actions based on their goals or

261
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,120
objectives

262
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,579
which leads to more accurate predictions

263
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,680
and results which is the real goal of AI

264
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,200
active inference AI enables us to

265
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,360
overcome current limitations with

266
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,040
machine learning and deep learning AI

267
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,500
models providing a realistic path

268
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,040
towards artificial general intelligence

269
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,700
um

270
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,279
so you know the idea is that an agent

271
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,620
can use active inference to minimize the

272
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,920
free energy and optimize Its Behavior in

273
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,660
a way that's consistent with its

274
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,240
objectives which uh

275
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,459
yeah which leads to more accurate AI

276
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,660
so the action perception Loop

277
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,240
um the perceptual inference and active

278
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,899
inference unfold continuously and

279
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,200
simultaneously uh underlying deep

280
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,300
continuity between perception and action

281
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,459
they're both sides of the same coin

282
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,019
performing the same free energy

283
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,360
minimization algorithm

284
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,240
so the free energy can be minimized by

285
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,240
improving the perception and then acting

286
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,940
on the environment in this Loop that

287
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,779
just keeps narrowing down the focus

288
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,279
um and then also by learning the

289
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,500
generative model you know how the brain

290
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,600
codes the environment

291
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
um so you know

292
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,060
that's the side that the the spatial web

293
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,279
protocol actually helps with because it

294
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,980
bakes context into every person place or

295
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,180
thing in any space so that context

296
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,940
informs the um the AI

297
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,060
so then it it's optimizing the expected

298
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,200
precision

299
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,860
and regulating the learning so thus we

300
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,200
update the model over and over to

301
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,060
improve our understanding of the world

302
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,399
and that is what the AI does as well

303
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,980
so how does it do this so

304
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,440
self-optimization and self-evolution so

305
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,660
active inference Ai and the free energy

306
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,440
principle through the Bayesian inference

307
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,540
allows a neural network to self-optimize

308
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,240
through intake and continuous updating

309
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,779
of new real-time sensory data while

310
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,820
simultaneously considering previously

311
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,860
established outputs and determinations

312
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,500
so past decisions plus the new input

313
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,779
lead to Future outcomes

314
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,839
um and that that cycle is a

315
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:29,160
self-optimization and self-evolution

316
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,579
cycle

317
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,579
so a self-evolving system evolves over

318
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,440
time

319
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
um

320
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,180
current systems current AI systems are

321
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,760
more like a machine they're just neural

322
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,860
Nets that are trained to do a specific

323
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,420
task

324
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,180
but a self-evolving system is learning

325
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,820
from moment to moment and upgrading its

326
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,380
World model and thus it mimics biology

327
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,079
while also enabling general intelligence

328
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,120
So within the free energy principle

329
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,300
neural networks self-optimize through a

330
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,639
set of mathematical rules enabling Next

331
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,040
Generation artificial intelligence to

332
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,279
efficiently learn predict plan and make

333
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,880
decisions

334
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,079
um

335
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,240
spatial web protocol let's talk about

336
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,339
this

337
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,399
so what is the spatial web protocol

338
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,820
hstp hyperspace transaction protocol

339
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,639
it gives browsers the ability to link

340
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,820
spaces with an ID for every person place

341
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,699
or thing both digital and physical so

342
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,740
virtual or real

343
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,360
but it's much more than a location

344
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,680
identifier hstp is also a gatekeeper it

345
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,079
allows various parties the ability to

346
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,019
agree on who what and where anything is

347
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,860
in space who owns it has access to it

348
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,360
and what can be done with it

349
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,000
foreign so hstp gives browsers the

350
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,940
ability to link the spaces with an ID

351
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,639
oh did I get this in here

352
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,360
so hstp is multi-dimensional query so it

353
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,980
allows for query over multiple

354
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,199
Dimensions

355
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,420
identifying localizing and updating the

356
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,060
attributes conditions excuse me

357
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,459
contingencies and interrelationships of

358
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,920
objects in space and over time

359
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,019
so if it can be defined and calculated

360
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:30,360
in the sphere of natural or Digital

361
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,519
Science it can be searchable through

362
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,519
hstp

363
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,660
so hsml this is the programming language

364
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,139
of that informs the protocol and I like

365
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,440
to call it the smartest contract around

366
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,480
because it's it's the foundational

367
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,699
contract now for every person place or

368
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,759
thing in any space in any reality

369
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,759
so the only way to create a truly

370
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,579
technologically augmented existence is

371
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,040
to be able to consider and measure the

372
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,260
contextual elements that affect the

373
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,900
expression of shared information by and

374
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,319
between all objects in space

375
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,699
uh this is known as computable context

376
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,280
and this is what hsml hyperspace

377
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,520
modeling language was made for

378
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,099
and what are the some of the uh

379
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,679
contextual elements that uh can be

380
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,540
programmed

381
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,360
um location the where the when of

382
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,960
anything in any space uh and you know

383
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,940
you're talking about you know reality

384
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,260
the different realities spaces time and

385
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,860
uh channels as well and then activities

386
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,460
so the the what and the how you know

387
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,620
um and this is this is in regards to

388
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,500
things like rights and credentials or

389
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,039
claims or activities and then when

390
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,500
you're talking about identities uh The

391
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,480
Who and the what of anything in any

392
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,980
space you know you're talking about

393
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,760
Authority or domains or users or assets

394
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,140
so all of these uh all of these uh

395
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,600
contextual elements can affect the

396
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,520
expression of the shared information by

397
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,940
in between anything

398
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,960
so belief updating through context and

399
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,000
sensors

400
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,280
so hsml is a cipher for context

401
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,059
the spatial web which is web 3.0 the

402
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,520
next evolution of the internet is a

403
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,740
library of spaces that contain objects

404
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,080
people places and things

405
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,020
these objects do things and change over

406
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,400
time

407
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,039
the context or circumstances that govern

408
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,559
these shifts and changes is the most

409
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,840
important factor to consider if we're to

410
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,240
understand how objects relate to each

411
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,700
other to people and to their

412
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,140
environments

413
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,620
hmm

414
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,720
so the free energy principle and hsml

415
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,360
the free energy principle is perfectly

416
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,460
suited to the programming language of

417
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,919
the spatial web

418
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,620
hsml uh the hyperspace modeling language

419
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,919
which enables computable contests to

420
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,760
context based on defining recording and

421
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,299
tracing the changing details in physical

422
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,100
and digital Dimensions social Dimensions

423
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
meanings culture conditions

424
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,380
circumstances situations whether

425
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,500
geometrical geopolitical or geosocial by

426
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,660
Nature

427
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,179
thank you

428
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:50,340
self-evidencing and belief updating so

429
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,900
hsml computes context enabling the ai's

430
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,480
perception to understand the real-time

431
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,840
Changing State of anything in the world

432
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,640
accumulating evidence for a generative

433
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,059
model of one's sensed World also known

434
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,340
as self-evidencing

435
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,600
so

436
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,100
um

437
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,340
we're talking about multiple agents so

438
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,640
individual intelligences

439
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,880
and based on each agent's generative

440
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,880
World model unique perspective frame of

441
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,240
reference and nested ecosystems of these

442
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,480
intelligences uh and different levels of

443
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,240
self-organization so all of this results

444
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,760
in a collective shared intelligence

445
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,660
so uh pollen architecture and Markov

446
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,059
blankets

447
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,820
so the spatial web is a hollonic

448
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,960
structure

449
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,720
so active inference uh

450
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,000
well active inference AI within the

451
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,120
spatial web on the versus cosm OS

452
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,580
platform operates with a hellonic

453
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,980
structure of nested spatial demand

454
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,360
domains

455
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,600
so if you're not familiar with what a a

456
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,020
hollon is a hollon is where you know

457
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,660
something can be a hole in and of itself

458
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,059
and yet also be a part of something

459
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,240
greater so the human heart is a great

460
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,160
example the human hearts made

461
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,059
of cells each one of those cells their

462
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,120
whole cells in and of themselves yet

463
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,600
they're also part of the heart and then

464
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,700
the heart is a whole heart but yet it's

465
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,640
part of the human body so you have this

466
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,520
nested structure of whole parts that are

467
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,840
governed by the outside part but still

468
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,419
have this intrinsic governing going on

469
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,580
within itself as well

470
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,419
so each component is a whole element

471
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,880
part of the entire organism

472
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,860
they're nested entities and they're

473
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,720
governed by the rules of the greater

474
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,980
influencing organism and then uh there's

475
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,740
they have inherited uh

476
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,840
they inherit the governing and it's

477
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,520
passed to the internal parts that are

478
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,039
nested within it and each part has its

479
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,960
own governmental considerations for its

480
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,360
specific intrinsic requirements as well

481
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,059
so this is how the spatial web is set up

482
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,400
to work as well so you know when you're

483
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,320
talking about spatial domains you're

484
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,760
talking about

485
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,340
um you know like for instance you can

486
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,380
have a um

487
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,780
you know a restaurant that's inside of a

488
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,600
skyscraper building that's inside of a

489
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,480
city and that city is inside of a state

490
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,600
you know these nested domains

491
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,919
and then the active inference AI also uh

492
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,780
includes the principle of Markov

493
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,020
blankets at each level of analysis so

494
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,380
the mark off blankets uh Define define

495
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,960
boundaries acting as partitions to

496
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,820
mediate the interactions between the

497
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,000
internal and external States

498
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,640
um of of the spatial domains such as

499
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,520
like a single unit or a region or entire

500
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,460
you know complex Network and this

501
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,400
results in a self-organizing system

502
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,900
and a Markov blanket is just a mediator

503
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,240
between how things are attuned to each

504
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,900
other through the free energy principle

505
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,200
foreign

506
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,059
s in the spatial web

507
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,780
so one good example of how this may work

508
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,200
uh is you know if you take a factory

509
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,120
right so

510
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,500
um

511
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,299
you know a factory is a part of the

512
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,260
supply chain and uh has raw raw

513
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,240
materials feeding into it from various

514
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,980
locations

515
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,760
like mines or you know anywhere and then

516
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,000
the factory produces finished goods that

517
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,980
may ship to another donut another

518
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,460
destination like a warehouse right like

519
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,380
a distribution warehouse

520
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,020
so just as that factory is an object

521
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,780
within a larger ecosystem of the supply

522
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,520
chain

523
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,659
um

524
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,539
every object within the factory belongs

525
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,059
to its internal ecosystem right so with

526
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,799
a factory you've got all the internal

527
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,539
ecosystem of what's going on in that

528
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,000
factory but yet it's still part of this

529
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,059
Global supply chain with you know

530
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,820
um uh you know raw materials being fed

531
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,220
into it and then it when it's done with

532
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,320
what it's doing it's feeding out to

533
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,900
other like distribution

534
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,140
um you know Pathways so

535
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,179
um you have an internal and an external

536
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,340
ecosystem and they simultaneously

537
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,740
operate according to the individual

538
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,400
internal and external standards the

539
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,679
interdependencies the in the inner

540
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:07,679
relationships so you know this is how

541
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,559
you can see things working within the

542
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,100
spatial web

543
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,820
so every object within the entire

544
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,340
spatial web network is part of an

545
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,520
interrelated ecosystem that feeds a

546
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,159
continuous stream of real-time context

547
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,580
between all points in space and time

548
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,980
this continual interaction and

549
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,260
communication stream takes note of all

550
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,840
the nuances and changes within the

551
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,600
relationships between all objects and

552
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,179
the parameters that govern them

553
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:43,559
foreign

554
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,100
which leads to Adaptive collective

555
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,799
intelligence automation so you have

556
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,440
programmable spaces

557
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,620
and uh

558
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,000
you know within these spaces everything

559
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,880
within these spaces have a digital ID

560
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,940
and the way the spatial web is set up is

561
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,400
it enables zero knowledge proofs between

562
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,299
all of these entities so anything inside

563
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,940
of any space is uniquely identifiable

564
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,779
and programmable with a digital twin of

565
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,659
the earth producing a model for data

566
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:22,200
normalization so by programming context

567
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,440
into everything in any space it creates

568
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,559
this digital twin of the space so the

569
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,720
spatial web becomes a digital twin of

570
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,860
everything

571
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,620
from the planet to every single system

572
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,799
every single object within it that's on

573
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,600
the network

574
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,860
so

575
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,860
um

576
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,419
the contingencies and changing details

577
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:50,700
inherent qualities circumstances for all

578
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,980
objects and situations can now be

579
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,900
measured and computed

580
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,539
uh providing a basis for the AI

581
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,840
perception affecting all entities and

582
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,179
their interrelationships uh to each

583
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,640
other so you're talking about adaptive

584
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,020
intelligence automation security through

585
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,480
geo-encoded governance

586
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,039
multi-network interoperability

587
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,159
and it enables all Smart Technologies to

588
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,919
function together on a unified system so

589
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,419
you know

590
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,940
um when you consider all of the web 3

591
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,279
Technologies all of the extended reality

592
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,299
Technologies you know AR VR

593
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:33,000
distributed Ledger Technologies so you

594
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,919
have all of these technologies that are

595
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,740
siled and disparate this brings all of

596
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,440
those Technologies onto a common unified

597
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,740
Network now

598
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,419
with a Common Language between them so

599
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,700
it makes all of these all of these

600
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,980
Technologies then become interoperable

601
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,840
and when you're talking about Smart

602
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,340
Technologies when you're talking about

603
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,279
like The Internet of Things

604
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,260
um there's been no common language for

605
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,480
these internet of things to talk to each

606
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,820
other and communicate so the spatial web

607
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,679
brings all of the internet of things

608
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,919
onto the common Network now where they

609
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,299
become baked into this um

610
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:15,120
this network and informing the AI so all

611
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,860
of the data being gathered by all of

612
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,400
these sensors or cameras or you know the

613
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,340
context that's baked into the protocol

614
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,080
this is all the data that is now coming

615
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,200
together that is continually updating in

616
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,360
real time and informing the AI

617
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,580
so you have

618
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,679
ecosystems of nested intelligence

619
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,559
the design of intelligence systems must

620
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,840
begin from the physicality of

621
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,600
information and its processing at every

622
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,419
scale or level of organization

623
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,299
So within the spatial web you have ai

624
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,260
that scales up the way nature does

625
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,760
aggregating locally contextualized

626
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,260
knowledge bases

627
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,340
and acting across ecosystems and this

628
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,000
maximum this maximizes efficiency

629
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,520
um so this is the complete opposite of

630
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,980
the way the machine learning models work

631
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,860
because they're top down it's just

632
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,500
massive amounts of data

633
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,279
and you know that's what's training the

634
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:23,399
the Machine model AI

635
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,140
um but there's a cutoff date so then

636
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,559
that model now can only reference this

637
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,480
historical data that it's been trained

638
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,080
on and you know again it's just a it's

639
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,480
it's a pattern recognition machine the

640
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,760
algorithms are just to make sense of the

641
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,340
data that that it's been fed and how to

642
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,220
recognize patterns within it

643
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,760
um every time those models have to

644
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,080
compute and try to perform an output it

645
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,000
requires massive amounts of energy

646
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,159
because it still has to pull from its

647
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:56,960
Library

648
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,460
this massive library to try to make

649
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,559
sense of things now the way that the

650
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,000
spatial web works with the active

651
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,419
inference AI is you have any amount of

652
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:07,799
data

653
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:11,279
you know small amounts of data can now

654
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,620
be made smart because you have context

655
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,880
informing the AI and you have sensors

656
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,760
that are giving it real-time data inputs

657
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,659
uh to let it kind of look outward and

658
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,419
see what's happening in the world now

659
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:32,640
not you know referencing historical data

660
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,080
so this leads to minimizing complexity

661
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,580
so when you're talking about the machine

662
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,120
learning versus the active inference for

663
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,820
efficiency and accuracy

664
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,640
the more complex a system is the more

665
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,039
energy it consumes so that's what I was

666
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,320
just referring to with all this big data

667
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,200
approach on these machine models

668
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,120
active inference in the free energy

669
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,760
principle naturally minimize the

670
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,700
complexity that's the whole idea with

671
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,760
the free energy principle is to minimize

672
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,600
the prediction error and use the

673
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,320
information that it can sense right so

674
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,440
it's taking in this the senses from from

675
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,860
sensors like the internet of things and

676
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,539
cameras and things like that but it's

677
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,539
also taking in what it knows about its

678
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:30,000
uh its you know the data at hand right

679
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,580
and it's informed

680
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,039
protocol the spatial web protocol with

681
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,039
all of the context all of the all of the

682
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,340
attributes around everything in any

683
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,799
space or any data set

684
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:47,100
so you know sensor data is noisy and

685
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,659
ambiguous but hsml provides Clarity with

686
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,840
specific and precise contextual data to

687
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,179
narrow the complexity and close the gap

688
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,220
on the free energy

689
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,059
so more certainty means less noise and

690
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,340
that each that equals free energy is

691
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,919
reduced faster and lower so it's a it's

692
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,320
a faster way to operate more efficient

693
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,440
and you know another point to this

694
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,720
switch is really interesting too is that

695
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,740
you know most of the data that exists

696
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,840
exists behind uh

697
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,620
password walls right behind gated uh it

698
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,840
within gated password areas right

699
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,880
whether it's you know on the internet

700
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,039
and it's all the data that people have

701
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,020
behind a password or whether you're

702
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,419
talking about like an Enterprise

703
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:40,320
organization that has all their

704
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,440
proprietary data that's internal you

705
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,179
know so

706
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,460
um the awesome thing about the spatial

707
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,500
web is that

708
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,480
um and the active inference AI is that

709
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,480
you can be within this network

710
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,880
and still have all of your proprietary

711
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,880
data gated off because the protocol

712
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,000
allows for that security you know it's a

713
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,700
it's gated at every touch point so you

714
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,679
can put boundaries around your

715
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,140
particular data but still be able to

716
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,559
access the the the power of the network

717
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,140
and the power of the active inference AI

718
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,600
now for your proprietary data because it

719
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,460
can take that small amount of data and

720
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,980
make it smart so

721
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,919
um this is a game changer for you know

722
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,880
access to AI for any systems in any

723
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,659
databases

724
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:36,360
so embodied AI

725
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,559
active inference uh is mimics biological

726
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,659
design uh and it's so it's like embodied

727
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:48,960
AI with the ability to take action and

728
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,360
this is the core engine of the spatial

729
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,600
web

730
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,460
so what makes active inference so

731
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,840
accurate

732
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,120
active inference is so accurate because

733
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,460
it continually looks outward into the

734
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,279
world measuring the world in real time

735
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,460
through a Global Network of sensors iot

736
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,780
devices cameras robots drones anything

737
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,879
that's connected within the spatial web

738
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,800
the digital twin network of the world

739
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,760
hsml informs the AI with precise data

740
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,099
extracts the signal from the noise

741
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,839
minimizing the prediction error

742
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,239
and this mimics the way humans and

743
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,500
animals make decisions

744
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,119
so the perception of the world

745
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,379
in the spatial web active inference AI

746
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:44,879
uh you know

747
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,159
create this creates a cybernetic

748
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,520
feedback loop of perception of the world

749
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,179
and it updates the model of the world

750
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,619
with the belief of what it knows to be

751
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,380
true gaining the understanding of the

752
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,420
intricacies and inner workings of the

753
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,480
world so that it can make decisions and

754
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,260
take action

755
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,400
and it provides ever ever evolving

756
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,099
intelligence so the more this feedback

757
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:20,339
loop plays out the AI learns more about

758
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,920
the world and the results of the actions

759
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,619
taken just as a child learns about the

760
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:28,619
world as it grows and interacts with it

761
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,560
and the more accurate this AI becomes by

762
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,540
further updating its understanding of

763
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,619
the world

764
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:38,220
so um it's been described to me that you

765
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,280
know when versus launches their cosm

766
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,760
operating system and then you know which

767
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,640
is going to be uh later this year

768
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,220
uh it's going to enable everybody to be

769
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,079
able to build these intelligent agents

770
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,660
on top of the network right there they

771
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,880
have a

772
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,980
intelligent app store that's going to be

773
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,839
launching with the operating system so

774
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,280
then everybody can make these

775
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,619
intelligent agents the difference is

776
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:08,040
these agents so when you build an app on

777
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,200
say like the Apple Store app store or

778
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,420
Google Play You're Building a siled

779
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,760
piece of software right those apps are

780
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,500
not aware of each other they just do

781
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,200
whatever their function is to do the

782
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,180
difference is these intelligent agents

783
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,099
that you're building on cosm are going

784
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,720
to be aware of each other and aware of

785
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,119
the network so they're going to be

786
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,339
empowered with the AI and be able to act

787
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,520
as an agent within the the network now

788
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,920
it's been described to me that you know

789
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,380
when people are first building these a

790
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,579
these you know intelligent agent apps

791
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,800
um it's not going to be like this Stark

792
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,320
difference of like the power of what it

793
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,599
can do versus the power of what these

794
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,040
machine models can do because they're

795
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,660
all pretty it's all pretty impressive

796
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,720
right now but the difference is is if

797
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,760
you take like uh the comparison of like

798
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,760
a chimpanzee and a toddler at first they

799
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,339
seem about the same intellectually but

800
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:03,960
the difference is that toddler is going

801
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,940
to grow it's going to grow into a full

802
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,040
fledged adult it's going to continue

803
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,859
learning whereas that chimpanzee has

804
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,320
maxed out so

805
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,760
um so that's going to be really

806
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,280
interesting to watch over the next you

807
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,440
know a year or two is that we're gonna

808
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,560
see this active inference AI really

809
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,260
modeling the same way that humans learn

810
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,960
and it's going to grow in intelligence

811
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,320
with with this you know scores of these

812
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,359
intelligent agents now all working

813
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,520
together within the network so

814
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,020
now one of the really awesome things

815
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,000
about this too is that the active

816
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,300
inference AI is explainable auditable

817
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,920
and governable so versus AI uh just

818
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,839
published a groundbreaking industry

819
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,520
report about a week week and a half ago

820
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,800
called designing explainable artificial

821
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,740
intelligence with active inference a

822
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,440
framework for transparent introspection

823
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,540
and decision making

824
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:12,740
so active inference is explainable AI

825
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,440
now how how can this be well active

826
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,780
inference can self-report

827
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,079
so machine learning models they're black

828
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,980
boxes uh you know and and therefore they

829
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,980
can't quantify their uncertainty they're

830
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,880
unobservable unalterable and unknowable

831
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,280
basically the the way the algorithm is

832
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,079
processing the data and coming up with

833
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,320
its output you

834
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,960
you can't see what's happening you can't

835
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,880
know how it's coming to its decision

836
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,800
it's just this black box that's

837
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,540
happening and there's no way to really

838
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,000
know what it's doing just how you know

839
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,820
the the input and the output

840
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,660
so you can't explain that now one of the

841
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,220
interesting things

842
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,400
um you know with this call for you know

843
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,119
putting governance around AI is that if

844
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,940
you have these black boxes that are not

845
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,119
controllable and not explainable how do

846
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,000
you govern that

847
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,980
so you know the only options have been

848
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,700
to you know uh either you know regulate

849
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,859
the the companies that are developing

850
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:27,960
these you know uh these uh tools or to

851
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,000
just let the free market rain now

852
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,040
letting free market rain is a little bit

853
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,920
tricky with AI because that can really

854
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,560
lead to like this AI arms race kind of a

855
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,480
thing you know for AI domination and

856
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,200
that that that has some risks to you

857
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,460
know like the

858
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,220
human nature right so

859
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,320
um and then the other problem with

860
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,720
regulating the the companies that are

861
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,420
developing these tools is that you're

862
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,099
asking them you're basing those

863
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:58,260
regulations off them being able to do

864
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,660
things like you know explain how the

865
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,060
results are coming you know uh to

866
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,700
fruition through their tools or holding

867
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,339
them accountable for you know

868
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,740
um for outputs that are you know

869
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,140
false or you know causing harm to

870
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,700
anybody or you know different things

871
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,859
like that which you really can't do that

872
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,599
either because what's happening within

873
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,780
these tools is not controllable it's not

874
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,060
auditable it's not controllable so

875
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,520
there's a real issue with governance

876
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,000
around these Machine model AIS now with

877
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,880
active inference AI it is completely

878
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,780
explainable auditable transparent and

879
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,520
when you're talking about the the self

880
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,700
report you know active inference AI is

881
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,220
capable of introspection

882
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,160
so this enables the intelligent agents

883
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,160
to access and analyze their own internal

884
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,940
States and decision-making processes so

885
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,680
we get better understanding of their

886
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,380
decision-making process and they have

887
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,900
the ability to report on themselves to

888
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,599
basically report on how they arrived at

889
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,640
their decisions

890
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,940
um beliefs and belief updating are known

891
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,060
so this this dissolves the

892
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,220
explainability problem of the

893
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,359
conventional AI

894
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,940
and then you also have programmable

895
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,880
intelligence so uh versus refers to this

896
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,700
as code AS law

897
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,119
so the act of correcting a machine

898
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,460
occurs within the code within the

899
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,280
computational architecture of versus AI

900
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,060
system human law can now be transformed

901
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,940
into computable law that AI can

902
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,359
comprehend abide by and then act

903
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,460
accordingly within its decision-making

904
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,119
process this is a process which is fully

905
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,300
auditable knowable and it updates in

906
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,619
real time

907
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,980
and verses has been

908
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,700
um improving this concept uh in a

909
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,420
program called Flying forward 2020.

910
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,200
um

911
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:16,020
and this is a European drone project uh

912
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,079
the

913
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,300
conducted with the European Union and

914
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,119
you know there's eight or 12 different

915
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:27,839
countries involved I'm I'm not sure but

916
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,839
um basically what they've proven is that

917
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,720
uh they can take the the spatial web

918
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,859
protocol the hstp and hsml and they can

919
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:40,740
translate human laws all the laws around

920
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,920
like the airspace laws and you know laws

921
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,960
how how they shift crossing country

922
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,599
boundaries different things like that

923
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,560
um

924
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,740
they can take those laws

925
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,640
put them in a programmable uh you know

926
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,220
code through the protocol that the AI

927
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,339
within the Drone can understand and then

928
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:05,880
abide by so they've they've met with

929
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,119
great success through this project

930
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,880
um and they've they've proven that you

931
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,980
know these drones can deliver medical

932
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,800
supplies you know to a hospital Crossing

933
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,280
Borders uh into various air State air

934
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,400
spaces you know understanding no-fly

935
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,260
zones versus fly zones all

936
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,420
all these things so basically human law

937
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,060
computable that the AI can understand

938
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,520
and abide by so when you're talking

939
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,720
about uh AI governance you know

940
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,819
this the the protocol

941
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,140
allows you to actually program law that

942
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,640
the the AI can understand

943
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,220
so then the other aspect of this too is

944
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,520
you know humans with AI because you know

945
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,380
there's a lot of

946
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,940
um

947
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,680
there's a lot of

948
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,819
fear baked into people uh especially in

949
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,700
regard to all these sci-fi scenarios

950
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,920
that have played out in you know

951
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,260
fictional books and and movies and

952
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,480
things like that but one of the great

953
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,180
things about uh the active inference AI

954
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,240
within the spatial web is that the AI

955
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,819
grows in tandem with the humans you know

956
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:44,339
because you can take programmable law

957
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,079
and make it to where the the AI

958
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,760
understands and you've got this

959
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,520
symbiotic relationship

960
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,760
um between the AI and the human it's a

961
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,220
network system that operates in tandem

962
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,339
with humans and then the AI is growing

963
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:02,160
its intelligence in sync with the growth

964
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,099
of humans and the world right so it

965
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:08,579
makes a controllable AI

966
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,260
um so in uh versus white paper

967
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,940
uh you know one of their opening

968
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,819
statements was that the the purpose of

969
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:20,940
the white paper its denouement is a

970
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,700
cyber physical ecosystem of natural and

971
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,400
synthetic sense making in which humans

972
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,440
are an integral are integral

973
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,140
participants what we call shared

974
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,579
intelligence

975
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,859
so versus Ai and the spatial web

976
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:37,319
Foundation offer us the framework in

977
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,359
which we can build an ethical and

978
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,420
Cooperative path forward for AI and

979
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,060
human civilization and one thing I want

980
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,099
to read to you from the white paper

981
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:50,760
that's you know specific about this

982
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,480
um

983
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,040
is is this so quote we believe that

984
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,560
developing a cyber physical network of

985
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,960
emerging intelligence in the manner

986
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,140
described above not only ought to but

987
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,020
for architectural reasons must be

988
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,660
pursued in a way that positively values

989
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,119
and safeguards the individuality of

990
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,540
people as well as potentially non-human

991
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,160
persons the idea this idea is not new

992
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,980
already in the late 1990s before the

993
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,920
widespread adoption of the internet as a

994
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,680
communication technology a future state

995
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,560
of society had been hypothesized in

996
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,440
which the intrinsic value of individuals

997
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,900
is acknowledged in part because

998
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,839
knowledge is valuable and knowledge and

999
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,060
life are inseparable

1000
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,480
that is each person has a distinct and

1001
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,740
unique life experience and as such knows

1002
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,500
something that no one else does

1003
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,560
this resonates deeply with our idea that

1004
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,780
every intelligence implements a

1005
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,319
generative model of its own existence

1006
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,240
the form the form of collective

1007
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,420
intelligence that we envision can emerge

1008
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,460
only from a network of essentially

1009
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,760
unique epistemically and experientially

1010
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,839
diverse agents this useful diversity of

1011
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,599
perspectives is a special case of

1012
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,480
functional specialization across the

1013
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,440
components of a complex system so you

1014
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,020
know within the the versus white paper

1015
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,220
for this active inference AI

1016
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,579
you know they're very clear about the

1017
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,720
importance of uh of The Human Experience

1018
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,200
and the various human experiences

1019
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,500
in tandem with the growth of of the the

1020
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,560
AI within the spatial web so I just

1021
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,500
thought that was really important to uh

1022
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,940
to kind of let people know

1023
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,200
so then you have accurate World models

1024
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,300
collective intelligence trained on

1025
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,480
real-time data evolves making decisions

1026
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,599
and updating its interior model based on

1027
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,359
what is happening now not on historical

1028
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,920
data sets

1029
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,680
active inference AI is not a language

1030
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,280
model generating words about the world

1031
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,440
based on outdated knowledge it's been

1032
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,420
fed regarding the world

1033
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,880
active inference is like a biological

1034
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,819
organism that perceives and acts on our

1035
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,880
world by generating more accurate models

1036
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,400
understandings and beliefs about our

1037
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,420
world

1038
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,240
these ever more accurate World models

1039
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,300
enable better decisions a smarter world

1040
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,640
and this is the true measure of

1041
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,220
intelligence

1042
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,940
so active inference AI as the operator

1043
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,180
and this is the final section

1044
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,140
so you have the internet of everything

1045
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,960
the days of training AI on Big Data will

1046
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,300
give way to an interconnected internet

1047
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,180
of everything that deploys active

1048
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,579
inference AI throughout the network

1049
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,220
inherently secure and accurate because

1050
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,040
it takes any point of real-time data and

1051
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,440
makes it smart through an empowered

1052
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,220
ecosystem of interconnected AI apps that

1053
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,020
act as intelligent agents

1054
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,420
active inference cosm and the spatial

1055
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,540
web active inference AI inside of the

1056
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,319
versus AI cosm operating system has

1057
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,079
access to the entire spatial web with

1058
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,319
iot sensors and cameras and all context

1059
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,020
markers attached to all objects within

1060
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,020
all spaces within the network tracking

1061
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,900
and identifying changes over time this

1062
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,660
AI becomes an ecosystem of intelligent

1063
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,119
agents that are all interoperable over

1064
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:57,119
hstp

1065
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,240
so what does this mean for the planet

1066
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,020
active inference AI can run the planet

1067
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,220
uh Dan Mapes who's one of the

1068
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,619
co-founders of versus he describes the

1069
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:09,960
spatial web with active inference AI as

1070
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,420
a nervous system for the planet

1071
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,000
together these Technologies enable the

1072
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,099
only AI in the world that can run

1073
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:19,460
critical operations for systems

1074
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,260
infrastructures smart cities and the

1075
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,300
planet so when you're thinking of

1076
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,300
climate or traffic control or smart

1077
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,359
cities or Advanced education or

1078
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:33,240
hospitals or airports all of these are

1079
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,040
critical systems that need accurate

1080
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,079
functioning of the AI you know you

1081
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,960
cannot rely on machine models who you

1082
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,960
know give you plausible answers

1083
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,380
plausible outputs that sound accurate

1084
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,420
but aren't necessarily accurate because

1085
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,579
they're just trained to make it sound

1086
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:56,099
appropriate appropriate and accurate are

1087
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:59,400
very different things so because the

1088
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,740
active inference AI is based on

1089
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,579
real-time data actual data context

1090
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:09,559
that's baked into everything it's it's a

1091
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:13,079
it's an accurate form of AI and it can

1092
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:16,079
be trusted to run these critical systems

1093
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,480
so it can be the operator

1094
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,579
and then we come to sentient

1095
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:26,040
intelligence so this is the missing

1096
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,380
piece of the data puzzle that gets us to

1097
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,380
artificial general intelligence we now

1098
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,319
have the world model and we now possess

1099
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,839
the ability for continuous and adaptive

1100
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:39,839
context markers enabling a cognitive

1101
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,059
World a cognitive model of this world

1102
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:45,180
and the ability to compute awareness so

1103
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,160
this is taking us from the artificial

1104
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,440
narrow intelligence which is what these

1105
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,140
machine models are to potentially

1106
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,780
artificial general intelligence and then

1107
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,420
artificial super intelligence because

1108
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,880
the more the active inference AI learns

1109
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,380
about the world uh it it can start to

1110
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,380
question and become curious about the

1111
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,420
world and you know it's the difference

1112
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,880
between you know

1113
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,540
asking the AI agent something and then

1114
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,180
having the AI agent ask you something to

1115
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,540
clarify what you want or what your needs

1116
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,300
are you know it's that Curiosity back on

1117
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,400
you that'll take us to the artificial

1118
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,920
super intelligence

1119
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,920
so I'm just going to close by letting

1120
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,660
you know that versus AI their cosm OS

1121
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:38,819
is going to be launching uh at the end

1122
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:39,900
of the year

1123
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,839
and uh the idea is let's create a new

1124
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:45,380
world together they've created the tools

1125
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,440
for anybody to create the AIS on top of

1126
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,240
so

1127
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,940
um you know it's a huge opportunity uh

1128
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,500
they're going to be launching the beta

1129
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,720
at the end of this year if you go to my

1130
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:02,099
website Denise holt.us there's a menu

1131
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:04,559
item where you can sign up for the beta

1132
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,119
if you'd like they're going to be

1133
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,380
selecting

1134
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,099
um you know uh you know

1135
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:13,200
they're going to be selecting developers

1136
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,059
and projects to be a part of this beta

1137
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,800
so if you'd like to be considered feel

1138
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,619
free to sign up there

1139
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:22,440
and then of course I have a podcast

1140
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,579
um and it it's on YouTube or any Spotify

1141
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,920
Apple anywhere you find a podcast but if

1142
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,319
you'd like to learn more about this

1143
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:33,480
um you know that's really my role is

1144
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,420
I've just been educating on the spatial

1145
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,579
web protocol and this active inference

1146
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:41,880
AI so there's a lot of information on my

1147
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,300
website there's a lot of articles on the

1148
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,800
podcast there's just a lot of

1149
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,260
information so that you can learn more

1150
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,480
so I think that's it

1151
00:53:56,339 --> 00:53:59,579
awesome thank you

1152
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:02,280
thank you Daniel all right I'm gonna

1153
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,280
come back on uh

1154
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,720
video

1155
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,119
and then all right

1156
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,400
well thank you for the

1157
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,740
amazing presentation there's many places

1158
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,760
to begin many uh ways to do it but again

1159
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,280
thank you again for sharing this

1160
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:25,160
information so my pleasure

1161
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,099
I'll uh start but just asking live

1162
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,780
stream viewers if they want to ask

1163
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,819
anything just put it in a live chat and

1164
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:34,559
then perhaps just

1165
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,660
there were so many topics that we

1166
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,780
brought up that yeah perhaps I can just

1167
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,940
reflect on a few of the topics and just

1168
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,339
kind of summarize it as as I heard it

1169
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:46,260
especially where it's different from

1170
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,599
what we've heard uh in terms of framings

1171
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,640
on other streams where we go way more

1172
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,079
into the technical but but there are

1173
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,880
just so many great ways that you had of

1174
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,760
framing what was um happening okay sound

1175
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,619
good yeah sounds great all right so you

1176
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:03,420
described active inference as

1177
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,920
biologically based and one way that uh

1178
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,140
biologically inspired perhaps exactly

1179
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,359
but but based upon biological systems

1180
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,900
and it made me think about the way of

1181
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,300
viewing the world in terms of its

1182
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,040
spatial connectivity

1183
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,559
and then thinking about the world in

1184
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,680
terms of its statistical or causal

1185
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,140
connectivity and so when people think

1186
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,000
about what would biologically inspired

1187
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,940
AI look like they might think about the

1188
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,160
actual connections amongst the neurons

1189
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,680
in the brain or the actual connections

1190
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,500
amongst ants in the colony but that

1191
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,319
connectivity allows solving that problem

1192
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:44,640
so if you want to solve some different

1193
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,140
problems or some

1194
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,660
thing else you need to learn from those

1195
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,540
structures but not copy them verbatim

1196
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,660
and so that level of learning that we

1197
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,400
have to pull back to and the level of

1198
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,420
thinking

1199
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,760
is about the agent in their engagement

1200
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,020
with the environment and the

1201
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,240
minimization of surprise instead of the

1202
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,980
maximization of reward

1203
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,460
and that's a really clear path I think

1204
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,619
from what we can generalize from natural

1205
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,260
intelligence towards how we can think

1206
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,359
about what kinds of imperatives we

1207
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,460
should design and what design principles

1208
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,260
should be for synthetic intelligent

1209
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,740
agents

1210
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,160
absolutely yeah

1211
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,300
um okay

1212
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,380
uh

1213
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,619
what brought you to

1214
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:34,020
this presentation like what was your way

1215
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,700
into the spatial web or how did this

1216
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,660
even come to be

1217
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,839
uh he's a long time friend of mine and

1218
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,940
um you know so I I knew when uh

1219
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,300
he and his co-founder Gabriel Renee

1220
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,640
who's the CEO of versus

1221
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,740
um when they were starting verses back

1222
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,940
in 2016 2017

1223
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,599
um so you know I knew what I knew what

1224
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:08,280
was coming and I've been kind of

1225
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,319
watching it unfold over the last like

1226
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,540
you know handful of years

1227
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,599
and so then last summer

1228
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,559
um

1229
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,599
you know it became really clear to me

1230
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,079
that uh you know versus was getting

1231
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,140
close to launching to the public you

1232
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,420
know they've been working uh over the

1233
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,400
past you know couple of years with like

1234
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,400
Fortune 500 companies with you know

1235
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,440
governments and Smart City development

1236
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,720
all over the globe they've been involved

1237
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,780
in this flying forward project you know

1238
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,880
they've been deep into the supply chain

1239
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,160
they one of the first apps they created

1240
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,500
was an app called wayfinder which is

1241
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,079
specifically built for

1242
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:53,280
um you know uh the supply chain uh

1243
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,280
and so you know watching all of that but

1244
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,680
then knowing it's coming to uh later

1245
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,839
this year I was like okay there's a

1246
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,059
transition and you know people need to

1247
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:05,280
understand what's coming because you

1248
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,460
know I've been involved in like uh you

1249
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,579
know uh blockchain and web 3 uh for the

1250
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:14,579
last you know handful of years and so

1251
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:17,819
you see all these amazing Technologies

1252
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:19,740
being built and all these awesome

1253
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,260
projects but one of the biggest problems

1254
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,540
is that they're all siled and they're

1255
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,160
the interoperability is the biggest

1256
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,680
struggle so you know to me it's like

1257
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,960
okay you know these people need to know

1258
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,420
that's this is coming and you know the

1259
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,980
interoperability is going to be there

1260
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,520
for you know not just within the the web

1261
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,680
3 or the blockchain space but really all

1262
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,079
technology really you know anybody who

1263
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:45,720
has a business that is present on the

1264
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,240
world wide web is going to want to

1265
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,339
evolve that presence into the spatial

1266
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:53,280
web just for the the empowerment of what

1267
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,559
this Ai and this interoperability is

1268
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,020
going to do for their business

1269
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,500
um so I knew there was a um a learning

1270
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,780
curve so that's really what I set out to

1271
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,700
do was to kind of break down that

1272
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,559
learning curve and really start to

1273
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:09,540
educate people about the protocol about

1274
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,500
the AI and about what to expect

1275
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,200
all right great

1276
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,680
um a few more questions again we're just

1277
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,260
starting to explore this and so whatever

1278
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,599
you do or don't know is all good

1279
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:28,680
how will the open source nature of the

1280
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,140
web and the ecosystem around active

1281
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,240
inference related Technologies be

1282
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,779
secured

1283
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,240
so so basically you know you have to

1284
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,460
think of the cosm operating system as

1285
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,440
that's that's literally the operating

1286
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,960
system that is going to enable people to

1287
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,359
easily build with build these

1288
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:50,880
intelligent agents within the spatial

1289
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,059
web Network right so you know

1290
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:57,599
um that allows anybody to come on this

1291
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,359
network and build these build these

1292
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:02,220
intelligent agents these intelligent

1293
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,880
apps right so the beauty of it is that

1294
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,859
the protocol itself for the spatial web

1295
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:12,420
it bakes in

1296
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,140
um

1297
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,260
security at every touch point right so

1298
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,200
you can program in

1299
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,940
um

1300
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,119
access permissions different things like

1301
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:26,819
that into whatever you're building so it

1302
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:29,220
really becomes individualized right you

1303
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,099
can you can gate off to where you know

1304
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:35,520
you have data that's proprietary and

1305
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,619
then you have data that's allowed to be

1306
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:40,140
accessed by the world you can you can

1307
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,359
make it look however you want for

1308
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,099
whatever you're building whatever your

1309
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,020
project is and what these intelligent

1310
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,020
apps then become is it's your

1311
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,540
opportunity to share your knowledge with

1312
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,240
the world right and you can share it to

1313
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,579
whatever extent that you that you want

1314
01:00:56,579 --> 01:00:59,579
to you know

1315
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:01,559
thanks

1316
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:04,559
when talking about just a few terms I

1317
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,640
wrote down culture ownership Authority

1318
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,460
how do differences amongst locations and

1319
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,140
people's

1320
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,020
play out when there are such different

1321
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,780
concepts of those mentioned terms and

1322
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:21,599
many other terms that arose it might not

1323
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,280
just be something like well the Drone

1324
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,000
can go 100 feet here and 10 feet here

1325
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,740
what about when there's different

1326
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,740
concepts of authority and ownership and

1327
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:36,240
Justice and culture right so well so

1328
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,440
that's

1329
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,020
that's one of the

1330
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,480
it's one of the beauties of the world is

1331
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,420
that you know we all have our own uh

1332
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,859
unique

1333
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:50,579
um understandings our own unique

1334
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:54,000
um beliefs our own unique cultural

1335
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,799
Traditions

1336
01:01:55,799 --> 01:02:00,660
um and the differing governing uh bodies

1337
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,780
and types of government right so the

1338
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,700
protocol needed to be built to be able

1339
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,339
to preserve all of that you know you

1340
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:09,900
don't want there to be this next

1341
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,599
evolution of technology that includes AI

1342
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:15,480
that becomes this dictatorship of you

1343
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,980
know this is the way the world's going

1344
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,720
to be and this is how everybody has to

1345
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,720
operate this preserves the uniqueness

1346
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,020
and the individuality of everybody in

1347
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:28,500
any area so really the way this plays

1348
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,079
out it's going to be able to be

1349
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:35,760
customized for region for you know

1350
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,579
um cultures belief systems you know

1351
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:42,140
um so it's like this socio-technical

1352
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:46,200
ability to you know Safeguard and

1353
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,240
preserve traditions and different things

1354
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,700
and mindsets so

1355
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,720
um

1356
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,339
you know really it's it's

1357
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:58,440
you know it's not going to be a

1358
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,260
hindrance as much as it is going to be

1359
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,760
um something that you know kind of

1360
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,660
preserves the beauty of of individuality

1361
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,000
and so when you're talking about systems

1362
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,040
like that like you were talking about

1363
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,319
you know it's pretty much going to be

1364
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:15,299
similar to where it is today you know

1365
01:03:15,299 --> 01:03:17,760
like you know people have the right to

1366
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,920
the right of refusal

1367
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,500
right you know even in a restaurant you

1368
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,780
know no shirt no shirt shoes no service

1369
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,180
you know so

1370
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,799
you know there's not going to be a lot

1371
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,420
of difference with that you know and

1372
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,160
then so when you're talking about things

1373
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,900
like drone delivery and things like that

1374
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,980
then you're going to have other

1375
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,079
standards bodies that are making those

1376
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,660
decisions to you know make things more

1377
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:42,900
inclusive rather than you know kind of

1378
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,440
silliness of you know denying people for

1379
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,040
whatever reason

1380
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,400
oh

1381
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,619
all right I'll ask a question from the

1382
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:55,380
live chat Bert asks

1383
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,780
thank you for the presentation

1384
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,480
what is the limitation of implementing

1385
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,040
this vision

1386
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,260
is it getting people to use the

1387
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,140
hyperspatial language or getting active

1388
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,780
inference working right

1389
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,400
or I'll add a secret third thing

1390
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:18,299
well so so you know I I've had people

1391
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:20,460
say that you know ask that with me

1392
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,020
saying you know well what what's the

1393
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,299
guarantee that anybody's going to you

1394
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:28,140
know uh you know take part in this new

1395
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,780
spatial web and it's

1396
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,359
you have to think of of the way the

1397
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,460
internet has evolved right this isn't

1398
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,740
just like this whole separate Network

1399
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,420
that you're gonna try to bring everybody

1400
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,000
on to it's the same network we're

1401
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,859
already on and it's just evolving the

1402
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:46,619
capabilities within that Network so you

1403
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:48,660
know when you think of the way uh the

1404
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,520
internet started you know when you had

1405
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,079
like tcpip and the killer app was email

1406
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,220
and then sir Tim berners-lee created

1407
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,619
HTTP and HTML and then you had the World

1408
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:04,500
Wide Web right so it didn't get rid of

1409
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,400
email it just enabled this whole other

1410
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,660
capability that now people could build

1411
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:13,980
websites now instead of just sending uh

1412
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,839
you know digital messages from computer

1413
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,180
to computer you could actually bring an

1414
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,819
audience to your web page and engage

1415
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:23,700
that way on like a property within the

1416
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,280
network so that's all that's happening

1417
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,680
right now is that we're just taking the

1418
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:30,720
capability from this web 2 environment

1419
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,380
that really lacks security and it lacks

1420
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,280
protection for people and their data and

1421
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,140
it opens up a lot of vulnerabilities

1422
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,780
because you have to all of the

1423
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,599
transactions are taking place the data

1424
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,859
is Tran is is uh transacting on a

1425
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:52,319
website which is the property of a

1426
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:55,200
centralized organization right so what

1427
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,480
this is doing is it's decentralizing it

1428
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,500
now everything in any space becomes

1429
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,520
programmable and becomes a a spatial

1430
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,299
domain right so now you have

1431
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:13,140
self-sovereign identity you have zero

1432
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,960
trust architecture you have this ability

1433
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,000
to program 3D spaces so it's going to be

1434
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,020
a natural progression for people to come

1435
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:27,480
you know take take advantage of this new

1436
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,539
uh programming language to you know be

1437
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:33,900
able to empower and expand what they can

1438
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,760
do within the network we already are on

1439
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,280
so you know the World Wide Web is like

1440
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,039
40 billion computers now we're evolving

1441
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,680
from just computers to spaces and

1442
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,980
objects and everything within there so

1443
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:48,240
you know it's not going to be a matter

1444
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,420
of people getting people to do that it's

1445
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,520
you know people are going to go wow I

1446
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,859
can do that and you know

1447
01:06:55,859 --> 01:06:57,859
it's going to be a natural progression

1448
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:01,140
as far as the active inference AI it's

1449
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,359
going to start working within the

1450
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,880
network and it's just going to grow so

1451
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,480
the more people are engaging on you know

1452
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,480
within the spatial web Network and the

1453
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,520
more people that are building these AI

1454
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,059
apps and I I think if we if we look at

1455
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:21,059
what's happened just in the first six

1456
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:23,760
months of this year since chat GPT came

1457
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,079
out

1458
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:27,180
um with all of the you know all of the

1459
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,220
open source and everything that's been

1460
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,200
available as soon as it got available to

1461
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,119
the public and now we can Tinker with it

1462
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,460
now we can build things you've had an

1463
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,000
explosion of development so you know

1464
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,119
with the ability to build these these

1465
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:44,220
um intelligent agents within the network

1466
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:47,039
and do it very easily and have this

1467
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,039
interoperability within the network

1468
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:53,160
I just see it as we're gonna have this

1469
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,160
explosion of development so

1470
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,559
that's and of course that's my opinion

1471
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,920
but that's what I see happening

1472
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,720
you stake your claim that's a beautiful

1473
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,920
thing

1474
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,079
I'll ask another question your answer

1475
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:10,260
LED perfectly to it Bert ask again in

1476
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,700
the chat

1477
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,700
also is there a resource where we can

1478
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,738
learn more about how to build a

1479
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:19,879
hyperspatial website

1480
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,839
I don't think those resources are out

1481
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:26,580
yet

1482
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:29,399
um and you know and it's not going to be

1483
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:32,040
a website so

1484
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,500
um you know it's it's as soon as the

1485
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,620
cosm operating system launches the

1486
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:40,140
the AI is going to become a tool for

1487
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,719
building anything so the other side of

1488
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,819
this app store where you can build an

1489
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:48,420
intelligent agent is the interface the

1490
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,839
public interface is uh an intelligent

1491
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,359
agent called Gia and it stands for

1492
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:57,359
General intelligent agent so Gia then

1493
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,238
becomes the interface for the public of

1494
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:03,779
the of the network of the the spatial

1495
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:06,660
web so Gia is going to become your

1496
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,000
personal assistant everybody's personal

1497
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,899
assistant uh Gia will be able to

1498
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,179
um you know act on your behalf within

1499
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,359
the the network so you know

1500
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:21,359
just like with um

1501
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,198
chat gpt4 and you know how you know the

1502
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,880
AIS are starting to be able to program

1503
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,000
right so within the spatial web the AI

1504
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,698
is going to play an integral part in

1505
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:35,698
creating your own intelligent agents in

1506
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:37,738
you know doing your own

1507
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:38,839
um

1508
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:41,580
establishing your own presences and and

1509
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:44,219
you know spatial domains and things like

1510
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:46,020
that so

1511
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,420
um I don't have a lot of detail on how

1512
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,939
that's going to look or work but that's

1513
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:53,819
my general understanding of it so I

1514
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:55,500
don't think there's going to be a huge

1515
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,540
learning curve when it comes to that

1516
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:01,739
wow all right I'll go to another

1517
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:05,580
question Dave asked in the chat

1518
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,640
does versus plan eventually to expand

1519
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,640
the inventory of element types Beyond 12

1520
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,520
mentioned in today's presentation people

1521
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,920
negotiate concerns that don't seem to

1522
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,040
fit easily in this framework

1523
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,719
yeah so

1524
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:22,560
um

1525
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,159
I so I I don't know I I don't know if I

1526
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:28,500
can really answer that and the reason

1527
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,460
why is because I don't I don't my

1528
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,500
technical knowledge of what's Happening

1529
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:38,280
behind the scenes is very limited so

1530
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,860
um the answer could be yes it could be

1531
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,560
it's already there I mean the reality is

1532
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,280
is those those 12 uh aspects are just

1533
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,679
you know kind of a generalized you know

1534
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,920
idea of what you can program but when

1535
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,880
you're talking about you know hstp being

1536
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,199
multi-dimensional you know and you can

1537
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:01,080
program in everything from like you know

1538
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,260
temperature to you know

1539
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,320
um pressure to you know you can you can

1540
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,380
you can Pro if it's programmable and

1541
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:13,020
definable you know in a computational

1542
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,280
form you can you can bake it into you

1543
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,860
know the context around whatever you're

1544
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,440
programming so you know

1545
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,840
in that respect it's it's pretty

1546
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,020
unlimited except for that limitation as

1547
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,179
long as it's measurable and definable in

1548
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:33,199
a computational way

1549
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,340
I'll try to restate that just how I

1550
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:36,360
heard it because I think it's a really

1551
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,540
important point the 12 again this could

1552
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,460
be totally off base of I don't have any

1553
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,360
information but the 12

1554
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,640
components shown are kind of like fully

1555
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,460
one way of fully showing your work but

1556
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,080
when you really get down to the Last

1557
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,719
Mile and the shoes on the ground

1558
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,300
you're in the realm of the particulars

1559
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:00,420
and the specific measurements at which

1560
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,320
point complex cultural topics will be

1561
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,780
playing out through the minute

1562
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:10,020
particulars not necessarily inheriting

1563
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:16,760
some stringency from a top-down ontology

1564
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,260
if that's fair just wanted to kind of

1565
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,480
say it that way um yeah

1566
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,699
okay you mentioned I think a few times

1567
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:25,380
in the presentation the idea of

1568
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,820
realities

1569
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,140
so yeah

1570
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,600
we have our beloved cyber physical

1571
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,420
reality and what other are the plural

1572
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,960
realities

1573
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:40,020
being able to

1574
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:40,739
um

1575
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:44,340
you know program the context into the

1576
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:47,040
spaces right then that provides you with

1577
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,380
a digital twin which automatically is

1578
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,600
giving you this

1579
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,780
um mixed reality ability right because

1580
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:59,520
you know digital twin and then physical

1581
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,820
reality this is going to open us up to

1582
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:05,460
this augmented existence this augmented

1583
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:08,760
reality existence that we all kind of

1584
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,159
Envision but the foundation hasn't been

1585
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:13,199
there the framework hasn't really been

1586
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,020
there this is providing that framework

1587
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,020
so we're gonna we're gonna see this kind

1588
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,940
of augmented

1589
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:24,659
uh reality you know future for us you

1590
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:27,420
know where we're able to like cross you

1591
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,000
know cross through mixed realities

1592
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,800
you're going to have the virtual reality

1593
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,480
you're gonna have the augmented reality

1594
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,800
and then you're gonna have the physical

1595
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,560
reality and there's there's going to be

1596
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,739
an unlimited way of mixing that

1597
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:43,980
and then the other aspect of this too is

1598
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,260
when you talk about like virtual reality

1599
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,540
and you talk about the metaverses and

1600
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,760
different you know metaverse experiences

1601
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,500
you know I think one of the reasons why

1602
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,140
the metaverse experience has been so

1603
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,360
lackluster is because they're siled

1604
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,300
right now when you consider the spatial

1605
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,100
web that's going to be able to make it

1606
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,659
to where you can jump in and out of

1607
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:06,900
these virtual reality spaces you can

1608
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,620
actually uh take your assets from one

1609
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,620
space to another space because all of it

1610
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,320
then becomes interoperable over the the

1611
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,980
network so this is going to really open

1612
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,179
up

1613
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:23,460
everything that we've been wanting to do

1614
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,580
is gonna now be possible within this

1615
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:30,199
this spatial web Network

1616
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,440
great

1617
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,780
all right as we kind of begin to land

1618
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,580
the plane um

1619
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:38,159
I'll just reflect on two

1620
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,860
or so positive aspects that that I think

1621
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:44,280
are part of the vision which we will of

1622
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,739
course await future sensory observations

1623
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:49,260
to con to confirm reduce our surprise

1624
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,219
but

1625
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,199
in active inference what we expect is

1626
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:53,940
what we prefer so if we think it's the

1627
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:57,239
most likely path forward then celavi so

1628
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,520
the first positive thing

1629
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,640
um is that it starts from the actual

1630
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,640
and the measurements defining things at

1631
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:10,080
some defined cyber physical layer and

1632
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,360
potentially extrapolating here but

1633
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,780
earlier this week we had a guest stream

1634
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:21,000
with MAO and Maxwell and in the quantum

1635
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,920
free energy principle approach the brain

1636
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,380
there is a top level decision maker

1637
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,380
within that blanket where the buck stops

1638
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,300
so that doesn't mean like that the brain

1639
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,340
is not composed of

1640
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,980
um you know as a component of part of

1641
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,620
larger compositions but within the given

1642
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:41,520
blanket there's a highest stop

1643
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,199
um so

1644
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:47,060
instead of handing our self

1645
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,980
sovereigntizing ability and intelligence

1646
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,679
to the black box

1647
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:55,080
here we can start from the actual maybe

1648
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,480
even pick up and stabilize or change

1649
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,640
what we already have so rather than

1650
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,219
proposing just a totally different

1651
01:16:01,219 --> 01:16:04,380
future that some scaling law is going to

1652
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,780
help us get to maybe or maybe not

1653
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,820
we start with like what we already

1654
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:10,440
measure and the decisions we already

1655
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,900
make so I very much appreciate the

1656
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,120
pragmatism what else might you reflect

1657
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,900
on that point

1658
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,260
I

1659
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:22,920
I think you said it well yeah

1660
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,679
okay in the second piece was that

1661
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,840
everyone's knowledge

1662
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,960
is adding something

1663
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,719
it might be a closed sample or a distant

1664
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:36,780
sample on some dimension in some setting

1665
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:41,040
but everyone every cognitive agent is

1666
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,340
adding non-zero information

1667
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,340
and there's a lot of technical details

1668
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,739
underneath why that is the amount of

1669
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:52,080
information added might be very small

1670
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,260
for a given question but because of

1671
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,420
differences we literally get more

1672
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,940
perspectives so we always see better

1673
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:01,920
with more perspectives if we have the

1674
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,920
right integration approach

1675
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,980
so that's also very powerful and it's

1676
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:11,219
something that is formally true with the

1677
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:13,440
math and the statistics and I think we

1678
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,940
want it to be true for our ecosystems

1679
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:22,440
right yeah absolutely you know and and

1680
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,260
it's you know it's interesting because

1681
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,260
um

1682
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,239
yeah you just you want it you want to

1683
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,120
preserve that the diversity of uh

1684
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,239
information and opinion and and you know

1685
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,940
have that accessible

1686
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,320
for sure

1687
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,780
awesome well

1688
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:46,980
it will be quite becoming days

1689
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:50,280
probably or at least again as expected

1690
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,800
or preferred but will very much look

1691
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,300
forward to you coming back on the active

1692
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,820
streams as well as some technical

1693
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,760
presentations that might help our

1694
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,800
community and our Institute learn more

1695
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,900
about the details or more philosophical

1696
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,960
discussions like the whole spectrum of

1697
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,880
learning and applying and implementing

1698
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,640
these technologies will be really

1699
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,980
important to characterize but for sure

1700
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,199
it's been incredible to have you share

1701
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,540
this first bit is there any last words

1702
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,280

know I know there's not a lot of

1707
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:35,400
information uh available out there

1708
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,500
regarding the spatial web and the active

1709
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,659
inference AI so if anybody has any

1710
