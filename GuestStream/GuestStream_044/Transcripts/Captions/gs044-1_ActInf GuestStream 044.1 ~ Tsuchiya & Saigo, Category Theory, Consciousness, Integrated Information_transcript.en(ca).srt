1
00:00:01,049 --> 00:00:01,599
Hayato: Hello.

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:05,657
Daniel: Just 1 second.

3
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:06,520
I'll make sure it's going.

4
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:07,433
It's all good.

5
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:11,266
All right, welcome to both.

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:16,744
It is June 13 at zero UTC.

7
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:20,124
We're here in active guest stream number

8
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:20,124
44.1 with Hayata Saigo and Nasugu Suchiya.

9
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:24,514
.

10
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:26,717
So we're looking forward to this

11
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:27,894
presentation and discussion.

12
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:30,164
Hayato, please say hello, and then we'll

13
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,407
continue with Nasuku's presentation.

14
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:36,720
Hayato: Hello, I'm Hayato Saigo.

15
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:39,062
I'm a mathematician and a mathematical

16
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:39,062
physicist also interested in

17
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:39,062
consciousness; and have worked a lot with

18
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:39,062
Nao, by using category theory and the

19
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:39,062
application to IIT or other consciousness

20
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:54,561
theories. So, Nao?

21
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:58,982
Nao: All right. So, my name is Nao

22
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:00,509
Tsuchiya.

23
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:03,860
I'm a professor in Monash University and

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,161
also having a lab in ATR in Japan.

25
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:09,457
And as a sort of introduction to this

26
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:09,457
today's session, I will give a brief talk

27
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:09,457
on our recent project called the Choreo

28
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:09,457
Structure, which Ayaton and I will be

29
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:09,457
collaborating and also a little bit on

30
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:24,912
the quantum quality hypothesis.

31
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:28,311
Both of them are hopefully relevant to

32
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,511
active inference issue.

33
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:33,874
So the Quota Structure project is the

34
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:33,874
Japanese funding that we received

35
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:33,874
recently, and it's going to continue for

36
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:41,623
five years.

37
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,901
This will be to establish a super

38
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:44,901
interdisciplinary research program to

39
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:44,901
tackle the program of consciousness,

40
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:44,901
especially qualia through the

41
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:52,077
interdisciplinary research.

42
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:55,103
We are planning to also host summer

43
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:55,103
school for two to three weeks every year.

44
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:58,130
.

45
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:01,109
And here's the fantastic members for this

46
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:02,116
grant.

47
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:06,153
And Hayato is basically working with me

48
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:06,153
in the part of the mathematical approach

49
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:13,223
to the consciousness and aquaria.

50
00:02:16,256 --> 00:02:19,285
One of the problems, for example, we want

51
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:19,285
to address is, for example, when you see

52
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:19,285
this square, Daniel, what do you see

53
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:25,344
here?

54
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,360
Daniel: Blue.

55
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:30,395
Nao: Yeah, so you say blue, and I say

56
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:30,395
maybe owl in Japanese, and the Haito may

57
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:35,447
say sunny in Russian.

58
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:39,481
But we could mean the same experience

59
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:39,488
quadria.

60
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,509
But how do we know that we are actually

61
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,523
experiencing the same thing?

62
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:46,552
And I'm actually curious whether this

63
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:46,552
kind of question is something that free

64
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:46,552
energy or active inference kind of style

65
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:53,620
approach can ever tackle.

66
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:55,649
And my approach is to go into the

67
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:55,649
category theory kind of inspired

68
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:59,685
direction.

69
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:03,669
And here's the first study that published.

70
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:03,669
.

71
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:06,699
We published in a few years ago with

72
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:06,699
Ayato and the Shigeru, together with also

73
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:06,699
the another category theorist, the Steve

74
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:15,782
Phillips, that in the category theory.

75
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:18,814
There is an interesting lemma called the

76
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:18,814
Yona Dilemma that proves that all the

77
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:18,814
relationship characterize its internal

78
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:25,889
intrinsic property.

79
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,929
And we are using that idea to study the

80
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:30,936
Chore.

81
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:34,971
That's the kind of inspiration of our

82
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:34,979
approach.

83
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,010
So instead of trying to characterize what

84
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,010
the blue is or red is, we are trying to

85
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,010
characterize all the relationship between

86
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,010
a particular color or particular quota to

87
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:48,114
other exhaustive.

88
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:52,151
And then by finding the correspondence of

89
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:52,151
this relationship, we try to identify

90
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:57,203
what the actual blue is.

91
00:03:57,205 --> 00:04:00,170
So if you say blue is similar to green

92
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,170
but also similar to red, then that's

93
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,221
going to be very different from my blue.

94
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:07,246
And that's the way how we detect this

95
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,268
blueness, it's same or different.

96
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:13,302
And one recent application of this kind

97
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:13,302
of idea is this unsupervised alignment

98
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:13,302
that we are using with another

99
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:13,302
collaborator, Masafumi Oism in University

100
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:22,391
Tokyo.

101
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:25,425
And I'll skip the detail, but basically

102
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:25,425
what we are doing is to do some kind of

103
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:25,425
experiment and then collect lots of data

104
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:25,425
to obtain so called similarity matrix

105
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:25,425
between all the colors and then without

106
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:25,425
really knowing what color maps onto what

107
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:25,425
we try to use on the relationship to

108
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:48,651
predict what we are seeing.

109
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:51,681
So in a sense, this is a pure category

110
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:51,681
theoretical kind of approach to the

111
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:56,729
problem of consciousness.

112
00:04:57,743 --> 00:05:01,723
Then I'll just skip the details here.

113
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:06,777
So we are doing this kind of approach on

114
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:06,777
other types of aquaria and then this is

115
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:06,777
the thing that we are planning to do for

116
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:12,835
next five years.

117
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:17,880
And then another just brief kind of

118
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,894
introduction.

119
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:20,917
If you have some other question, we can

120
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:21,927
come back later.

121
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:24,955
So this is potentially more to do with an

122
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:24,955
active inference aspect of our approach

123
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:27,989
in a sense.

124
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,011
And this is called the Quantum Courier

125
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:30,017
hypothesis.

126
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:33,048
We published this preprint really

127
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:36,075
recently and so you can access it later.

128
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:40,111
So one of the there are many programs in

129
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:40,111
the current models of our chore or

130
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:40,111
consciousness where we tend to think that

131
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:40,111
experience or consciousness is like one

132
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:53,240
point in the high dimensional space.

133
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:56,278
And we use that kind of idea for our

134
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:56,278
previous alignment experiment approach,

135
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:56,278
but it lacks dynamics and it also lacks

136
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:56,278
the effects that we tend to experience

137
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:56,278
where the observation or report or

138
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:56,278
introspection itself sometimes change our

139
00:05:56,278 --> 00:06:18,433
chore, right?

140
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:21,462
And that's sort of the active inference

141
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,482
aspect that I'm talking about.

142
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:27,524
Attention or introspection changes

143
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:28,534
experience.

144
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,572
But traditional approach is very

145
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:32,572
difficult to deal with this and one way

146
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:32,572
to deal with that is this quantum

147
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:43,685
formalism that we think is appropriate.

148
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:46,713
So here we think that there is some kind

149
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:46,713
of chorea experiencing system that is

150
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:51,761
defined as this blue boundary.

151
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:53,787
You can consider that as sort of the

152
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:53,787
Markov blanket like thing in the free

153
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:57,826
energy kind of idea.

154
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,807
And then we consider particular type of

155
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:01,807
the quail like redness or blueness itself

156
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:06,858
as an observable.

157
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,885
It's a terminology in quantum theory.

158
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:12,918
Something that in principle can be

159
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:15,940
observed within this quarry.

160
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,996
And then we consider this measurement as

161
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:20,996
a process that probe this quadrilateral

162
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:26,058
observable.

163
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:31,101
And unlike classical theoretical thinking,

164
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:31,101
, we think that the measurement or

165
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:31,101
probing of this observable through it's

166
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:31,101
called a state, changes its state and

167
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:43,220
also observable itself.

168
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:47,266
And that's something that we can actually

169
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:47,266
formalize mathematically using a concept

170
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:47,266
called a very general concept of this

171
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:47,266
conditional probability called instrument.

172
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:57,360
.

173
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,337
It's very technical for the quick talk,

174
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:02,351
so I'll leave it.

175
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:05,386
But this is a modern quantum theoretical

176
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:05,386
idea that captures both how we can affect

177
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:05,386
on the world and the quota itself can be

178
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:15,485
affected by that measurement.

179
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:18,518
And then using this we think that we can

180
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:18,518
explain probably quota in a much more

181
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:18,518
reasonable way with the mathematics

182
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:18,518
mathematical formalism, and so far, it's

183
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:18,518
just a kind of theory, but we already

184
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:18,518
think that it's probably better than the

185
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:18,518
existing kind of a model of, for example,

186
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:37,700
attention and the consciousness.

187
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,736
And also it also provides some kind of

188
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:40,736
prediction and the explanation of why

189
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:40,736
some of the two concepts or two

190
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:40,736
experience can feel different depending

191
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:54,872
on the order that you experience.

192
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,913
So this is just like conceptual kind of

193
00:08:58,913 --> 00:08:59,921
example.

194
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:03,902
But if I ask you, Daniel, that is China

195
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:05,925
similar to North Korea?

196
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:09,961
Then you might say probably no.

197
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:09,968
Right.

198
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,004
Daniel: I don't even know the reference

199
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:13,007
point.

200
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,018
Nao: Yeah, okay.

201
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:17,042
But let's say just subjectively, china

202
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:19,065
doesn't feel similar to North Korea.

203
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,073
Daniel: Okay.

204
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:21,082
Nao: Yeah.

205
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:24,115
However, if I reverse the order, is now

206
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:24,115
North Korea similar to China, then many

207
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:24,115
people actually start to say that, yeah,

208
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:33,201
it's kind of similar.

209
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:38,254
Daniel: Does that have to do with one

210
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:39,267
being larger or what?

211
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:42,292
Is it about the order that primes people

212
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:43,307
to respond differently?

213
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,339
Nao: Yeah, so many people have already

214
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:46,339
came up with many different kind of ideas

215
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:46,339
to explain this kind of individual

216
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:54,418
aspects of this order effect.

217
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,448
But as we mentioned, we are actually

218
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:57,448
computing or measuring these kind of

219
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:57,448
order effects systematically through all

220
00:09:57,448 --> 00:10:05,467
combination of the colors, for example.

221
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:09,508
Then it's hard to systematically explain

222
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:09,508
why this order effect emerges in one

223
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:09,508
cases but not the other, and in which

224
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:16,573
direction.

225
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,606
Right, but that's what we found,

226
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:20,617
basically.

227
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:23,647
And but using this in a quantum cognition

228
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:23,647
kind of framework, we can explain it

229
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:27,683
really nicely.

230
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,721
In this case, it's just a projection

231
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:31,721
postrate, but we are probably going to

232
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:31,721
extend much more in the more instrument

233
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:39,799
like framework in the future.

234
00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:41,822
Yeah.

235
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,852
And also we are also predicting that

236
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,869
there may be some kind of.

237
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:48,896
Violation.

238
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:52,929
Of inequality like situation in

239
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:53,942
perception.

240
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:56,974
And if we can confirm that, that also

241
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:56,974
gives a credence to our proposal that the

242
00:10:56,974 --> 00:10:56,974
quality needs to be framed or explained

243
00:10:56,974 --> 00:11:05,005
in the quantum framework.

244
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:08,032
So I think that's probably enough to

245
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:10,057
start up the conversation, I guess.

246
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:13,089
Daniel: Awesome.

247
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:21,164
Okay, great lot to jump into.

248
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:22,176
Hayato: I'll.

249
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:30,251
Daniel: Share my screen so we can take

250
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:31,266
some notes.

251
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:37,323
Okay.

252
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,368
Hato, do you want to give a first remark

253
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:41,368
or I'm happy to, but do you have a first

254
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:41,368
remark or what parts of the work do you

255
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:49,442
want to reflect on first?

256
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:57,521
Hayato: I think maybe the Categorical

257
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:58,530
approach.

258
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:02,518
The importance of Categorical approach is

259
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:02,518
one issue to talk with you, I think,

260
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:02,518
because you first pointed out that paper

261
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:14,635
with Shiger Tabuchi 2016.

262
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:20,692
So I'm interested in why you and your

263
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:20,692
colleague are interested in that paper

264
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:27,767
from the active inference side.

265
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:32,809
So can you explain some feeling?

266
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:36,850
Daniel: Yes.

267
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:42,915
So this is using category theory to

268
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:42,915
assess the relationship between

269
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:42,915
consciousness and integrated information

270
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:42,915
theory with the two of you and Taguchi

271
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:55,041
from 2016.

272
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:59,079
So I've long been interested in scale

273
00:12:59,079 --> 00:12:59,079
free or scale independent ways to

274
00:12:59,079 --> 00:12:59,079
describe systems and information theory

275
00:12:59,079 --> 00:12:59,079
has been recognized as one of those

276
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:10,130
approaches.

277
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:13,166
And information theory has been proposed

278
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:13,166
to not just play, of course, a central

279
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:13,166
role in the functionality of information

280
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:13,166
systems, but with IIT and related

281
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:13,166
theorems to also strike at the heart of

282
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:13,166
the most quintessential aspect of our

283
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:32,352
conscious experience.

284
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,390
So that seems like an incredible

285
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:36,390
synthesis of the functionality of systems

286
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:36,390
that don't necessarily seem to have

287
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:36,390
anything qualia like at all merely

288
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:36,390
performing calculations like a super fast

289
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:52,549
abacus basically.

290
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:58,611
And so I am curious and feel free to

291
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:01,587
address either of these things.

292
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:07,640
When we describe information systems,

293
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:07,640
what is it that would or could or is

294
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,698
experienced?

295
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,738
Are they experiencing their information,

296
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:16,738
what they are processing or what is it

297
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:21,781
about?

298
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:24,817
Information integration would grant a

299
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:24,817
system the ability to move beyond a

300
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:24,817
behavioral functionality into again

301
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:24,817
strike at the heart of one of the most

302
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:24,817
ineffable questions that the mind can

303
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:38,956
really consider.

304
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:45,028
Hayato: Okay, interesting actually the

305
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:45,028
category itself in mathematics originated

306
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:45,028
created in mid 20th century to bridge the

307
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:45,028
two different fields, that is geometry

308
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:45,028
and algebra, more specifically the

309
00:14:45,028 --> 00:15:03,142
topology.

310
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:07,188
You know something about topology maybe

311
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:07,188
which is a very general kind of

312
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:07,188
mathematical mesos to capture the essence

313
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:07,188
of the figures like a circle or

314
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:22,335
complicated figures.

315
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:27,386
And the fundamental problem of the

316
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:27,386
topology is can you identify the two

317
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:35,468
different figures?

318
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,507
Essentially that means can you transform

319
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:39,507
continuously to the other figures or

320
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:43,546
not?

321
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:47,583
So if the one figure goes to another

322
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:47,583
figure with a continuous transformation

323
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:47,583
and back then it is viewed as essentially

324
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:56,675
the same.

325
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,690
But to determine the two figures same is

326
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,737
a very difficult question.

327
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:13,785
So like great mathematician figured out

328
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:13,785
the utility of the algebraic method that

329
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:13,785
like making the one figure to the other

330
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:13,785
from the figure you can construct the

331
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:13,785
algebra system like groups or something

332
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:13,785
and then the transform the program into

333
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:39,042
the algebra region.

334
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:44,096
Then the point is very essential point is

335
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:44,096
taking one figure to constructing one

336
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:44,096
algebra from the one figure is not

337
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:53,185
sufficient.

338
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:56,213
The point is the relation should be

339
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:58,237
transformed the other regions.

340
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:02,213
So one region here, other regions here

341
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:02,213
but one to one correspondence of object

342
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:02,213
is not sufficiently but the relations if

343
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:02,213
you can transform the order relations

344
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:02,213
into the other regions then you can prove

345
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:02,213
something from one region to another

346
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:21,401
region.

347
00:17:21,402 --> 00:17:25,444
Because this is a notion of the function

348
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:25,444
like the region intuitively I talked

349
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:32,515
about using term the region.

350
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:34,538
It is mathematically called category.

351
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:38,572
Category consists of objects and arrows,

352
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:38,572
arrows or morphism which is a generate

353
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:38,572
kind of relationship between these

354
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:45,640
objects.

355
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:48,670
So topological region is some kind of

356
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:48,670
category of topology like a top that

357
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:48,670
objects topological space and continuous

358
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:48,670
functions, continuous mapping is ro or

359
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:58,772
something.

360
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,741
There are other regions, for example RGB

361
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:01,741
region like groups and group homophism or

362
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:06,797
the module vector space or something.

363
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,827
So something RJ rack and the relationship

364
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:10,837
between them.

365
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,884
So category is defined to formulate the

366
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:15,884
intuitive concept of bridging something

367
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:21,941
functor.

368
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:24,974
So first the Island Bag and Macbrain

369
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:24,974
defined category to define this notion of

370
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:31,004
functor by the bridging to region.

371
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:35,008
Then, if this is established, then you

372
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:35,008
can infer about the topological region

373
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:35,008
category by using the algebra relation or

374
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:46,019
something.

375
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:50,023
So we that is now Shiger and me talked

376
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
about the possible application of this

377
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
kind of argument into the consciousness

378
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
study that it is just a program of

379
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
bridging different kind of regions like

380
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
physically testable region and our role

381
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
experience itself or something so it is

382
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
apolia it seems apolia it is too

383
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
difficult question too hard problem to

384
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
connect to these regions but if you only

385
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
focus on the object but the relationship

386
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
if you can compare the relationship then

387
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
you can infer something about you cannot

388
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,023
directly touch or you directly manipulate.

389
00:18:50,023 --> 00:19:42,069
.

390
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,072
So this is the idea.

391
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:49,076
Nao: Maybe I'll just add a little bit.

392
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:55,082
As Hyatt said, you are taking really

393
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:56,083
diligent notes.

394
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:01,082
So that may be quite a good but from my

395
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:01,082
end.

396
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:04,085
So this paper was inspired by really

397
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:04,085
talking to Hayato Shigaru and the meeting

398
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:12,093
in this summer school on consciousness.

399
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:15,096
And there I encountered in this category

400
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,098
theory for the first time.

401
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:22,103
And there were several shocking kind of

402
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
concepts that I learned from this first

403
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:27,108
encounter.

404
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:30,111
One is that there isn't a way to compare

405
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:30,111
two completely different things and then

406
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:36,117
extract common structure between them.

407
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:39,120
And Hayato first introduced me this very

408
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,120
strange paper which I didn't understand

409
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,120
at all, but was so interesting that I

410
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:48,129
could read for hours and hours.

411
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:49,130
It's called the Rosetta Stone.

412
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:53,134
It points out commonality between the

413
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
topology, quantum physics, logic and

414
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:58,139
computation.

415
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,136
That was the title.

416
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:03,138
And then I didn't understand what the.

417
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,141
Heck is this in a paper, but that uses

418
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,143
this category theory.

419
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:11,146
And as a whole, I feel like I see.

420
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:15,150
So maybe if we understand the structure

421
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
behind each of this concrete example, we

422
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
may be able to find a commonality or

423
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:26,161
explanation at that level.

424
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:29,164
And that naturally applied to my program

425
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:29,164
at the time, which is how to bridge the

426
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:29,164
gap between the quotia and the

427
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:29,164
information structure derived from neural

428
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:40,175
activity.

429
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,177
This looks also completely different.

430
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:46,181
But if there is any possibility to bridge

431
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:46,181
the gap, it must be some kind of

432
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:46,181
structural mathematics, and that is

433
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:53,188
category theory.

434
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:03,192
Hayato: Another point is that I think you

435
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
can get the ideas of functions by

436
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:10,199
breathing the two regions.

437
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,201
Then the really interesting thing,

438
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:12,201
another really interesting concept is

439
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:16,205
called natural transformation.

440
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:20,209
Natural transformation is the kind of

441
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:20,209
deformation or transformation between

442
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:24,213
transformation.

443
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:28,217
So you imagine some theory bridge some

444
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:31,220
addition to the another region.

445
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:36,225
So there is one meta level arrow code but

446
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
another theory predicts another thing or

447
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:41,230
something.

448
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,235
But can you connect these theories or

449
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:47,235
models?

450
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:50,239
This is a problem of natural

451
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
transformation so one representation, one

452
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
theory or something may map the one

453
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
region to another region but there may be

454
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
another various kind of mappings factors

455
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
so the problem is to compare or to unite

456
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
to connect this transformation function

457
00:22:50,239 --> 00:23:19,262
is called natural transformation.

458
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:22,265
If the function is naturally isomorphic,

459
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:22,265
that means there is a reversible natural

460
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:28,271
transformation between functions.

461
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:32,275
Then these theories seems different but

462
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:34,277
essentially same.

463
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:38,281
So kind of natural transformation is

464
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:38,281
maybe the hint to connect the various

465
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:44,287
theories on consciousness or something.

466
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:49,291
And also our consciousness experience

467
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:49,291
itself will be connected to the concept

468
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:56,299
of natural transformation.

469
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:59,302
Because I see something that the

470
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:01,298
different thing, something.

471
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:05,302
But there is no divided discrete kind of

472
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:05,302
structure, but there is some continuous

473
00:24:05,302 --> 00:24:10,307
or relating something.

474
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:14,311
So this is this view is something like

475
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:15,312
function.

476
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:18,315
Another view is something like function,

477
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:20,317
but there is no division.

478
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:22,319
There is some relationship.

479
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,323
So our experience maybe itself a kind of

480
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:31,327
product of a natural transformation.

481
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:38,335
Like, maybe now you can explain, like a

482
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:46,343
periphery or maybe no, you are muted.

483
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:47,344
Muted.

484
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:51,348
Nao: Is it all right if I draw some kind

485
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:52,349
of figure?

486
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:53,350
Daniel: Of course.

487
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,351
Would you like to share your screen?

488
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:55,352
Hayato: Yeah.

489
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:59,356
Nao: And also if you can give me the

490
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:02,353
access to the annotation okay.

491
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:07,358
Daniel: I will make it so everyone can

492
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:10,361
edit and I'll put it into the chat here.

493
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:12,363
And then also if you want to draw, that

494
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:13,364
would be awesome.

495
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:14,365
Hayato: Yeah.

496
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:17,368
Nao: Do you see the whiteboard now?

497
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:18,369
Daniel: Looks good.

498
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:19,370
Hayato: Yeah.

499
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,373
Nao: So just to kind of recap, what Hyatt

500
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:22,373
was talking about is that we tend to

501
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:22,373
think about something like a category,

502
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:31,382
and then another category is there.

503
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:35,386
And then there is some kind of object

504
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:38,388
which could be quite abstract.

505
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,391
And then it's related by arrow like this.

506
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:40,391
.

507
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:46,397
And then if this category C is somehow

508
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:46,397
possible to map onto this category D

509
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:56,407
while kind of preserving this arrow.

510
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:58,409
For example, this arrow goes to here, and

511
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:00,405
then this arrow goes to here.

512
00:26:00,405 --> 00:26:03,408
And then each object is also preserved.

513
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:06,411
Then it's much more than the usual kind

514
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,413
of idea of a function between the sets.

515
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:09,414
Right.

516
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:12,417
Because it also impose the correspondence

517
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,419
between the relationship.

518
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,424
And in our idea, basically, if this is,

519
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,424
let's say, Claudia of the category, and

520
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,424
if this is a neuronal activity or maybe

521
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,424
information domain, and then maybe we can

522
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:19,424
have a back and forth of the factor, that

523
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:35,439
would be great.

524
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,444
Usually most of the mathematical theory

525
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:39,444
of consciousness tries to go from here to

526
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:42,447
here, right?

527
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:47,452
Let's say in the case of IIT arrow here,

528
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:47,452
and then what Hyatt was kind of talking

529
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:47,452
in a way as natural transformation is

530
00:26:47,452 --> 00:27:02,461
this kind of secondary level arrow.

531
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:03,462
Let's say.

532
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:06,465
I don't know whether free energy or

533
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:06,465
active inference can count as a

534
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:06,465
prediction from neural activity to the

535
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:06,465
particular quadria, but let's say if

536
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:06,465
there is something like that, and then

537
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:06,465
maybe there is some kind of a translation

538
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:22,481
between these two theories.

539
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:24,483
Yeah.

540
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:27,486
If that exists, that's called a natural

541
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:28,487
transformation.

542
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:31,490
Daniel: Awesome.

543
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:33,492
A few comments on this.

544
00:27:34,492 --> 00:27:37,496
The idea of mapping the maps between the

545
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:40,499
spaces is so important.

546
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:43,502
It reminds me of metaphor where we're

547
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:43,502
conveying relationships and saying, well,

548
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:48,507
it's like a hammer, or it is a hammer.

549
00:27:49,507 --> 00:27:50,509
For this other situation.

550
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:53,512
So that's how we get few shot learning

551
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:53,512
and applicability and how we grasp

552
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:53,512
concepts is perhaps developmentally or

553
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:53,512
from an evolutionary perspective in a

554
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:53,512
large extent by generalizing our spatial

555
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:53,512
and embodied understandings and then

556
00:27:53,512 --> 00:28:08,521
certainly communication.

557
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,524
If you want to have some semantics that

558
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
are being communicated across minds,

559
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
through an interface, through a classical

560
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
interface, then certainly you want the

561
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:23,536
structure to be preserved.

562
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,539
And then I think the one that you have

563
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
here is one of the most provocative for

564
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
those empirically studying consciousness

565
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
because it's kind of like this side is

566
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
empirical and let's just say we don't

567
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
know what the Q side is for now, but let'

568
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
's just say it's another space that isn't

569
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:45,558
that.

570
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,562
And then if there is a certain landscape

571
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:49,562
that neural activity patterns flow

572
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:49,562
through like some kind of winnerless

573
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:49,562
competition or you get some sort of limit

574
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:49,562
cycle and you find that there's a limit

575
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:49,562
cycle of neural activity and then there's

576
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:49,562
also that is being paralleled by

577
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:49,562
experiential cycles, then that is not

578
00:28:49,562 --> 00:29:14,581
just an accounting system.

579
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:16,583
That's a very strong finding about

580
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,583
potentially the real underlying causal

581
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,583
system, especially because it can suggest

582
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,583
unique other explanations or

583
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:28,594
manipulations to make right.

584
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:30,597
Nao: Do you want to mention anything

585
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:31,598
about the metaphor?

586
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:36,603
Hayato: Yeah, before that very hard to

587
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
say.

588
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:40,607
The technical remark is that for the

589
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
original problem that connects topology

590
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
and algebra, then in that case the

591
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
algebra is more concrete, more

592
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:54,621
manipulative in that case.

593
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:57,624
And the topology is something mysterious

594
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:58,625
in this case.

595
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:02,623
So in general the function is a kind of

596
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:06,627
generalization mapping in sets.

597
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:09,630
So there's something mysterious into

598
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,631
something concrete.

599
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:16,637
So now picture C and D should be switched

600
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,639
maybe in that case.

601
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,643
But of course there is a back and maybe

602
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:24,645
back and forth.

603
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:29,649
So the idea is your brew and my brew

604
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:29,649
program is for example, you can prove

605
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:39,660
that your brew and my brew is different.

606
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,663
If there's something, informational or

607
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:42,663
something, the detectable structure is

608
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:42,663
completely different, then your brew and

609
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:51,672
my brew is different.

610
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:56,677
Of course you cannot prove the sameness

611
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:56,677
between your brew and my brew if there is

612
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:56,677
no how to say the back and forth function.

613
00:30:56,677 --> 00:31:06,681
.

614
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:10,685
But even if you don't have the backwards

615
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:10,685
function, at least you can demonstrate

616
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:10,685
that your brew and my brew is different,

617
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:10,685
seems to be different if the

618
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:10,685
correspondence is functional or something.

619
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:23,698
.

620
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:28,703
So it is a big step from the experience

621
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:28,703
side and with me and colleagues do such a

622
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:35,710
thing.

623
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,715
So this is not by focusing your brew, my

624
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:40,715
brew only, but your brew read something

625
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:40,715
or you don't have to say, even do not

626
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:54,729
have to say the name of something.

627
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,732
So just how to say no labeling for

628
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:57,732
example, but the relationship you can

629
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:04,733
teach the relationship these things.

630
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,735
You can teach the relationship these

631
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:06,735
things.

632
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:09,738
So then compare that so very

633
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:11,740
interestingly.

634
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:17,746
In general the structure is surprisingly

635
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:20,749
coherent between persons.

636
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:26,755
It is very nice and also maybe it's

637
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
suggesting that the known isomorphic case,

638
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:26,755
, then your brew and my brew is something

639
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:36,765
different or something.

640
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:40,768
So I think this approach is very

641
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:40,768
interesting even if there's no

642
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:40,768
BioDirection or only one direction, but

643
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:50,779
even that case it is useful.

644
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,782
Yeah, it is my remark.

645
00:32:57,786 --> 00:32:58,787
Daniel: Yeah, please.

646
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:00,783
And then I'll have a question about your

647
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:01,784
drawing.

648
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
Nao: Right.

649
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:04,787
So this is one of the slides that I didn'

650
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:05,788
't show today.

651
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:08,791
But what Hyatt was talking about is kind

652
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:11,794
of explaining this figure.

653
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:14,796
Like the way you experience red is

654
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:14,796
related to with the other experience, not

655
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:14,796
only color but shape and also sound and

656
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:23,806
so on in a very complicated way.

657
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:26,809
And then we can actually measure how

658
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
similar they are by asking the people and

659
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:26,809
then you can also do that for the other

660
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:32,815
people.

661
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:35,818
And then these two similarity metrics can

662
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
be directly compared with our new method

663
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:40,823
of this unsupervised running.

664
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:43,826
And also IIT, for example, may allow us

665
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:43,826
in the future to go back and forth

666
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:43,826
between this quoria structure and the

667
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:51,834
information structure.

668
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:54,837
Mathematically, we believe that the

669
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:54,837
information structure to information

670
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:54,837
structure should be potentially

671
00:33:54,837 --> 00:34:00,837
translatable in some way.

672
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:03,840
And if that is possible in some way,

673
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:03,840
eventually we may be able to say, okay,

674
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:03,840
so the way you are experienced red is

675
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:03,840
same or different in this way or that way.

676
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:14,851
.

677
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:16,852
That's sort of the idea.

678
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:21,858
Daniel: Can you go back to your drawing?

679
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:22,859
Nao: Right.

680
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:27,864
Daniel: Awesome.

681
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:32,869
So for the top arrow, if we're kind of

682
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,869
just exploring, what might it mean that

683
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,869
IIT is going back and forth and also that

684
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,869
active inference is going back and forth.

685
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:43,880
.

686
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,883
So what exactly does the edge between C

687
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:48,885
and D represent in IIT?

688
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:51,888
Is that a quantitative evaluation like

689
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:51,888
the five variable or what is being

690
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:56,893
accounted for with that arrow?

691
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:01,892
Nao: Do you want to say something?

692
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:02,893
Hayato: Yeah.

693
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,896
There is various possibilities actually.

694
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:09,900
For example, the sameness or difference.

695
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,906
So if you have some kind of gradation

696
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:15,906
with sameness, sameness gradation but to

697
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:15,906
formulate the gradation of sameness, you

698
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:33,924
have to move on the enriched category.

699
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,927
Not a simple kind of category, but it's a

700
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
generalized kind of category called

701
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,931
enriched category.

702
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:44,935
In that case, for example, the simplest

703
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:44,935
example for enriched category is

704
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:51,942
generalized generalized metric space.

705
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:52,943
Metric.

706
00:35:55,946 --> 00:36:00,945
In metric space, for example, the point P

707
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
and P itself has a distance zero of

708
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
course, and kind of P two Q, two R is

709
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:00,945
there is a triangular inequality or

710
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:14,959
something.

711
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,962
Then it can be considered as a

712
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
generalized kind of compositional

713
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:23,968
structure called enriched category.

714
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:28,972
It is a typical kind of enriched category,

715
00:36:28,972 --> 00:36:28,972
, but symmetry does not always hold or

716
00:36:28,972 --> 00:36:33,978
something.

717
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:38,983
So this is one, how to say, one small

718
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:43,988
step to grasp our Korea structure.

719
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:47,992
Because like now pointed out, North Korea

720
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:47,992
China distance and the China North Korea

721
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:47,992
distance is in general different or

722
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:55,000
something.

723
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,999
So almost all studies assume that some

724
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:01,000
symmetry.

725
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,006
But we need to go beyond that.

726
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:11,010
And then maybe the one number or

727
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,010
something is too poor to represent

728
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,015
everything.

729
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:19,018
So you have to go more and more richer

730
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
structure, like not just numbers but some

731
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
kind of projection operator or something.

732
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:27,025
.

733
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:31,030
Then you enter into the quantum region.

734
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,034
So relationship we feel should be maybe

735
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:35,034
should be represented from some kind of

736
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:35,034
relationship between the notion of state

737
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:35,034
in quantum theory and the state

738
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:51,050
transition between that.

739
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,054
So our approach is step by step and you

740
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:55,054
can choose the many arrows to study

741
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:55,054
something and then goes to unify the more

742
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:55,054
and more general kind of arrows and

743
00:37:55,054 --> 00:38:09,062
categories.

744
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:13,066
And this is just for the speculation but

745
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:13,066
this kind of quantum theoretical like as

746
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:13,066
a mathematical framework do not need to

747
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:13,066
the kind of physics but the kind of

748
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:13,066
mathematics can you use unify these kind

749
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:28,081
things.

750
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,084
Daniel: Awesome.

751
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:34,087
Just a few comments on that.

752
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:38,091
When we're doing free energy minimization,

753
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:38,091
, we use the KL divergence which is very

754
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:38,091
importantly not a distance because a

755
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:38,091
distance would have the symmetry

756
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:47,100
characteristic.

757
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,104
And so the KL is chosen because it's easy

758
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:51,104
to fit optimization on these variational

759
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:51,104
distributions, but it's almost like it's

760
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:51,104
a feature, not a bug, that the KL

761
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:51,104
divergence between Q and p is not the

762
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:51,104
same as P and q, because it turns out

763
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:51,104
that that kind of a divergence based

764
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:51,104
quantification actually has some

765
00:38:51,104 --> 00:39:21,128
advantages over a distance measure.

766
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:25,132
And then the mapping between observables

767
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
and hidden states and the cognitive

768
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
operators that we bring to bear on that

769
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:33,140
kind of mapping problem.

770
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,143
Those are some of the most fundamental

771
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,143
pieces of the partially observable Markov

772
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,143
decision processes that are used in the

773
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,143
active inference generative model, which

774
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,143
is first the mapping between observables

775
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,143
and hidden states and then how do hidden

776
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,143
states change through time and how does

777
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,143
action selection, policy selection

778
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:36,143
influence how hidden states unfold

779
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:58,164
through time?

780
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:01,162
So this mapping between hidden states and

781
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
observables and between hidden states and

782
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
the hidden state at the next time point

783
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:12,173
and again how action influences that.

784
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:15,176
If you understand those operations, then

785
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:15,176
it's like a game of chess and the ball

786
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:15,176
just rolls downhill and the variational

787
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:24,185
distribution works exceedingly well.

788
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:27,188
But when those are off base, then you're

789
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:30,191
fitting your way like right off a cliff.

790
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:38,199
Nao: So maybe then I'll just add one more

791
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,200
point.

792
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,203
So you asked in the original like five

793
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:42,203
minutes ago what each of these points or

794
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:42,203
arrow correspond to in the case of the

795
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:50,211
IIT and so on.

796
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:53,214
And then this is kind of related to all

797
00:40:53,214 --> 00:40:54,215
these ideas.

798
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:57,218
But one of the fundamental insights from

799
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:57,218
IIT but also from philosophy, especially

800
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:57,218
some kind of philosophy called the

801
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:57,218
process theory is it is important to

802
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:57,218
really understand that the process of

803
00:40:57,218 --> 00:40:57,218
flow or movement is really fundamentally

804
00:40:57,218 --> 00:41:19,234
important kind of aspect of things.

805
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:22,237
And then that may be really

806
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:22,237
distinguishing some kind of static set or

807
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:22,237
the thing in the static world when they

808
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:32,247
start to interact.

809
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:35,250
And when the process emerge then

810
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,250
something starts to potentially generate

811
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,250
or support subjective quality like

812
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:46,261
protocol kind of thing.

813
00:41:47,262 --> 00:41:50,265
And in the case of the IAT, it is deeply

814
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:50,265
kind of entrenched in this formation of

815
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:50,265
the transition probability matrix of an

816
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:50,265
entity like how this thing neuron or

817
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:50,265
logic gate, it might have come from the

818
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:50,265
previous state and it may go into the

819
00:41:50,265 --> 00:42:09,278
next state.

820
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:12,281
So any kind of a moment is already

821
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:12,281
embedding the possible previous and the

822
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:17,286
possible future.

823
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:19,288
There is some kind of a with us in the

824
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:21,290
moment because it's a process.

825
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:25,294
And when the process is considered, then

826
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:25,294
as I have said, that this kind of dot is

827
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:25,294
a very kind of two thing kind of

828
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:33,302
structure to think about.

829
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:36,305
So we need a more elaborated structure of

830
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:38,307
a dot itself.

831
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,310
But the category theory is great in the

832
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,310
sense that each dot can itself contain

833
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,314
complicated structure.

834
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:50,319
It's just represented as a single dot but

835
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,322
it can contain something more.

836
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:55,324
Right?

837
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:58,327
So in an upshot, one dot could correspond

838
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:58,327
to a collection of the neuronal states

839
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:58,327
and the connectivity pattern and things

840
00:42:58,327 --> 00:42:58,327
like that, which can go from one to the

841
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:07,330
other.

842
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:11,334
And then this kind of movement may

843
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:11,334
correspond to something like we see

844
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:11,334
redness or whatever in this way but that'

845
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:11,334
's also with respect to other kind of

846
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:24,347
arrows as well.

847
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:26,349
And that's the sort of wave of the

848
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:26,349
relationship that we are trying to

849
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:26,349
characterize both in the domain but

850
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:26,349
aquaria, but also brain is also the wave

851
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:26,349
of the relationship, gigantic ones,

852
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:36,359
right?

853
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,363
And as you said, that transition from one

854
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:41,363
state to the another state that's pretty

855
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:41,363
much like dynamical system like approach

856
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:41,363
and then the simple idea called a monoid

857
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:41,363
is applicable to this kind of dynamical

858
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:57,380
system approach.

859
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:00,377
Correct me Hayato, if I'm saying

860
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:00,377
something out of the bounds of my comfort

861
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:00,377
zone, but any kind of state can

862
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:00,377
transition into another state and then

863
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:00,377
this transition itself can be represented

864
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:12,389
by the arrow.

865
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:21,398
The combination of that particular kind

866
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:21,398
of arrow composition may correspond to

867
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:26,403
one experience.

868
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:33,410
So that's one thing I wanted to say.

869
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:36,413
The other thing that I had also mentioned

870
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:36,413
about observable state and why we are

871
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:36,413
interested in a quantum framework,

872
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:36,413
quantum theory, by the way, it's not a

873
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:46,423
quantum brain hypothesis.

874
00:44:46,423 --> 00:44:48,425
We are not saying that quantum phenomena

875
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
in the brain is critical for

876
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
consciousness, but it's just a

877
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
mathematical structure of the quantum

878
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
theory that is important to understand

879
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:57,434
the quota.

880
00:44:58,435 --> 00:45:01,432
And the essence is most likely to be this

881
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
noncommutativity any kind of process that

882
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
you do, like cooking, putting the water

883
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
and then model is different from model

884
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:15,446
and then putting water.

885
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:15,446
Right?

886
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,450
And so any kind of process we do, there

887
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
is some kind of temporal dependency that

888
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
commutativity doesn't hold and that's

889
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:27,458
also probably the case for the quota.

890
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,462
And if that's the case, then for you

891
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:31,462
maybe it's a bit surprising, but Bayesian

892
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:31,462
kind of statistics and Bayesian

893
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:31,462
probability may not work as you might

894
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:42,473
wish.

895
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:45,476
Hayato: Yes.

896
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,480
So in other words, using the Kanam

897
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:49,480
mathematics there is a quite good

898
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:56,487
generalization of Bayesian.

899
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:04,489
Innovation kind of inference.

900
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:10,495
Yes, actually the one step generalization

901
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:10,495
is called a projection in kind of

902
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:18,503
mathematics.

903
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:23,508
Then there is more generalization called

904
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:24,509
instrument.

905
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:29,513
So instrument is general notion of

906
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:29,513
measurements like a system and

907
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:35,520
environment interacting.

908
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,524
Then more precisely, the measurement is

909
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:39,524
something like the interaction feature

910
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:47,532
has some probe over the apparatus.

911
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:52,537
So probe is some kind of the apparatus is

912
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:52,537
some very small tips or something which

913
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:52,537
can be considered as a quantum that this

914
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:52,537
quantum system and this probe system

915
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:52,537
interacting quantumly, then we can

916
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:52,537
measure this probe by the macro side of

917
00:46:52,537 --> 00:47:13,552
the apparatus.

918
00:47:13,552 --> 00:47:17,556
So this is a very general kind of

919
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
measurement which is identified

920
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
mathematically with the notion of

921
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
instrument originated by the Davis and

922
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:17,556
Lewis and Ozawar, one of our

923
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:33,572
collaborators.

924
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:39,578
We begin in the collaboration, but Ozawar,

925
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:39,578
, who is also famous for the Ozawa's

926
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:39,578
inequality, Ozawa inequality as a

927
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:39,578
generalization of Heisen belt universally

928
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:39,578
valid version of Heisen magazine

929
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:52,591
inequality.

930
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:56,595
But he identified this general notion

931
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:56,595
measurement and instrument called a

932
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:56,595
completely positive instrument in

933
00:47:56,595 --> 00:48:05,598
mathematics.

934
00:48:05,598 --> 00:48:08,601
But this CP completely positive

935
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:08,601
instrument is quite general and

936
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:08,601
generalizing very beautifully the

937
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:08,601
Bayesian inference into the quantum side.

938
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:19,612
.

939
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:23,616
So I think focusing this kind of

940
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:23,616
instrument kind of concept is the key

941
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:23,616
maybe to bridge the active inference side

942
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:23,616
on our side and quantum side or something.

943
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:36,629
.

944
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:40,633
So, yeah, it is my speculation, but I

945
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:43,636
think it is very fruitful direction.

946
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:46,639
Daniel: It's awesome.

947
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:48,640
Just one comment on that.

948
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,643
The probe with the instrument or the

949
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:50,643
quantum reference frame, I believe, as

950
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:50,643
Chris Fields might describe it, is an

951
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:58,651
experimenter's choice.

952
00:48:59,652 --> 00:49:02,649
And so the way that we could talk about

953
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:02,649
policy selection and inference on which

954
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:02,649
experiment to run would be in terms of

955
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:02,649
which sequence of observations is going

956
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:15,662
to minimize expected free energy.

957
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,666
So which sequence of observations is

958
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:19,666
going to have high pragmatic value and

959
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:19,666
epistemic value that's the expected free

960
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:25,672
energy functional.

961
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:28,675
Now, as researchers, we might seek out

962
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:28,675
the most informative experiments and not

963
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:34,681
prefer to see a certain measurement.

964
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:37,684
So we can say, well, all measurements are

965
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:37,684
a priori equally pragmatically valuable

966
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:40,687
to us.

967
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:43,690
So now expected free energy is going to

968
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
be driven by information maximization

969
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:48,695
just by pure learning.

970
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:53,700
But this recognition that action is woven

971
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:53,700
into the process of reducing uncertainty

972
00:49:53,700 --> 00:50:02,703
about other systems across blankets.

973
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:06,707
It's absolutely fundamental, because if

974
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
you don't have the constraint that you

975
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
need to actively select which experiments

976
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
to run and to probe and to interfere in

977
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
this quantum way, this way described by

978
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
quantum mathematics, you're kind of in a

979
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
delusional alternative world where you

980
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:06,707
get information from photons, but you don'

981
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:25,726
't have a sensor.

982
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:29,730
So it's not an empirically tractable

983
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,734
world unless we take on this constraint.

984
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:37,738
And then once we do, our mathematics are

985
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:39,740
the quantum mathematics.

986
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,742
And again, it's kind of a subtle point.

987
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:44,745
This isn't the ORC or this isn't

988
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
necessarily taking a stance one way or

989
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
the other on what kinds of electronic

990
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
scale quantum phenomena exists in any

991
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
system, but rather just sees quantum

992
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
mathematics as fundamental to decision

993
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
making and uncertainty, which is quite a

994
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:44,745
change from how it's been discussed for

995
00:50:44,745 --> 00:51:07,762
100 years.

996
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:15,770
Hayato: Actually, as now said, we are not

997
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,773
dependent on the hypothesis.

998
00:51:18,773 --> 00:51:23,778
Like there is a quantum physical process

999
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:25,780
behind the courier.

1000
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:31,786
But why we can use the quantum mathematic

1001
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:35,790
is very simple reason.

1002
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:39,794
Because conventional probability theory,

1003
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:39,794
classical probability theory depend on

1004
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:44,799
the probability space.

1005
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,803
Classical one is too narrow to capture,

1006
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:51,806
for example, order effect or something.

1007
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:54,809
But you can generalize it.

1008
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:57,812
So quantum mathematics is just

1009
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:00,809
generalized the Crasco mathematics.

1010
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:03,812
And I believe that why quantum

1011
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
mathematics is found for quantum physics

1012
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
is a very simple reason because in Crasco

1013
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:17,826
physics, some kind of determinism.

1014
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:23,831
Determinism is very universal and the

1015
00:52:23,831 --> 00:52:23,831
probability only comes from some kind of

1016
00:52:23,831 --> 00:52:30,839
ignorance of us.

1017
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,843
But in quantum physical context there is

1018
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:34,843
some kind of very fundamental randomness.

1019
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:39,848
.

1020
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:43,852
The fundamental accidents or something is

1021
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:43,852
found and they are all surprised because

1022
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:43,852
if you go into the microsite, the

1023
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:43,852
determinism should be stronger and

1024
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:55,864
stronger they sold.

1025
00:52:55,864 --> 00:53:00,863
But actually there needs some kind they

1026
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:00,863
found fundamental noncommutativity and

1027
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:06,869
microside.

1028
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:08,871
But who?

1029
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:12,875
Isabel Bohr and Heisenberg some people

1030
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:12,875
pointed out that Evening Grascow or

1031
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:20,883
Evening sorry, a macroscopic side.

1032
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:24,887
But this kind of the importance of

1033
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:24,887
noncommutativity is very universal, not

1034
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:24,887
especially in microsite, but it is a

1035
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:24,887
historical reason that we first find in

1036
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:38,901
mathematics in the microsite.

1037
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:41,904
But there is many, many phenomena which

1038
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:41,904
cannot be captured by the determinism or

1039
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:48,911
the classical probability theory.

1040
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:52,915
So I think the courier or something is

1041
00:53:52,915 --> 00:53:54,917
just some kind of.

1042
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,921
Nao: Example.

1043
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:00,917
Hayato: Yeah, example, yes.

1044
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:03,920
Nao: By the way, maybe Daniel, can you

1045
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:03,920
replace this quantum consciousness with

1046
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,924
the quantum quadria?

1047
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:07,924
Daniel: Yes.

1048
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:11,928
Nao: So the quantum consciousness has

1049
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
been used to imply this quantum brain

1050
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
hypothesis, which may be potentially true,

1051
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
, but so far we don't really see the

1052
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
strong evidence about this particular

1053
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:27,944
thing.

1054
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,953
Daniel: What's funny, I'm thinking of the

1055
00:54:36,953 --> 00:54:36,953
classic qualia question what is it like

1056
00:54:36,953 --> 00:54:40,957
to be a bat?

1057
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:43,960
And it's like, what if the like is

1058
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,963
interpreted as a metaphor?

1059
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:52,969
What if there's a metaphorical mapping to

1060
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:52,969
bat which is an observer dependent

1061
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:59,976
mapping amongst spaces?

1062
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:04,975
Because we've moved the focus from the

1063
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:04,975
objective standalone experience of the

1064
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:04,975
bat to considering mappings amongst

1065
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:04,975
cognitive systems, one critical, one

1066
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:04,975
being, for example, whoever's listening

1067
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:04,975
to the question and a bat who's the one

1068
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:24,995
who actually answers that question.

1069
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:34,005
Nao: Okay, so you asked also about the

1070
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:34,005
inspiration from the category theory

1071
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:34,005
relevant to the issue of the metaphor,

1072
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:41,012
right?

1073
00:55:42,012 --> 00:55:43,014
And also communication.

1074
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:48,019
Now, it's a bit far from this quantum

1075
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:48,019
corey and they jump back to another topic.

1076
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:51,022
.

1077
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:57,028
Metaphor is something that the Hiato has

1078
00:55:57,028 --> 00:55:58,029
been working on.

1079
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:02,027
So yeah, but the other part, which is

1080
00:56:02,027 --> 00:56:05,030
this communication.

1081
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:09,034
And that's something that we also wrote

1082
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:09,034
together last year and using this concept

1083
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:09,034
called adjunction in category theory,

1084
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:09,034
which may be also interesting to discuss.

1085
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:20,045
.

1086
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:25,050
So in 2016 paper we already mentioned

1087
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:25,050
that category theory is very promising

1088
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:25,050
for the study of consciousness precisely

1089
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:25,050
because it provides different levels of

1090
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:38,063
sameness.

1091
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:44,068
When I heard this from Hayato, I was like

1092
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,070
what do you mean?

1093
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:49,074
But as simultaneously it makes a lot of

1094
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:49,074
sense and in fact many controversy or

1095
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:49,074
confusion among the field of

1096
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:57,082
consciousness.

1097
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:58,083
But not only for consciousness.

1098
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:01,080
Other fields like ecology as well like

1099
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080
classification of the animal species and

1100
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:08,087
things like that all depends on this.

1101
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:10,089
What do you mean by the same?

1102
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:13,092
Right?

1103
00:57:13,092 --> 00:57:16,095
And this is something that also relates

1104
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,095
to what you are talking about a moment

1105
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,095
ago, which is observer dependence,

1106
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:22,101
right?

1107
00:57:25,104 --> 00:57:28,107
Even at the very bottom of this reality,

1108
00:57:28,107 --> 00:57:28,107
I think that what matters is some notion

1109
00:57:28,107 --> 00:57:28,107
of this subjective choice of what it

1110
00:57:28,107 --> 00:57:37,116
means to be the same.

1111
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:41,120
Equivalence or adjunction is a

1112
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,120
particularly interesting kind of

1113
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,120
situation where, for example, integer and

1114
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:50,129
the real number is definitely different.

1115
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,132
But in terms of the relationship, if you

1116
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:53,132
start to think about the relationship,

1117
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:53,132
there is some kind of one to one

1118
00:57:53,132 --> 00:58:00,133
correspondence between them.

1119
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:04,137
And also Hayato's book, also written in

1120
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:04,137
Japanese, but recently I did read it and

1121
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:04,137
one of the interesting example is also

1122
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:04,137
multiplication and exponentiation at the

1123
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:04,137
level of object or number it doesn't

1124
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:19,152
match, right?

1125
00:58:20,153 --> 00:58:23,156
But there is a very nice relationship

1126
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:23,156
between them that is very fundamental and

1127
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:23,156
something like this apparently completely

1128
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:23,156
different thing but finding really

1129
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:23,156
meaningful relationship that's very

1130
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:36,169
fundamental.

1131
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:39,172
In communication we are talking different

1132
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
kind of language with different kind of

1133
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
meaning, but because when I say something,

1134
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
, you reply and then there is some kind

1135
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
of systematic difference between what I

1136
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:53,186
expect and what I hear.

1137
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:57,190
That's the kind of prediction error,

1138
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,190
right?

1139
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:01,188
I think the prediction error may not need

1140
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:01,188
to be minimized in fact, but as long as

1141
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:01,188
it's consistent and systematic then it

1142
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:01,188
actually works as a very nice

1143
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:12,199
translational kind of device.

1144
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:19,206
After living like 20 years, more than 20

1145
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:19,206
years of living outside of Japan, I still

1146
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:19,206
have very strong English accent, either

1147
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:19,206
in Japanese or Japanese, living in

1148
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:29,216
Australia or US.

1149
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:32,219
I can't minimize this prediction error.

1150
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:35,222
But because I have this systematic

1151
00:59:35,222 --> 00:59:35,222
prediction error for you, you totally

1152
00:59:35,222 --> 00:59:40,227
understand me, right?

1153
00:59:40,227 --> 00:59:43,230
Something like this is the interesting

1154
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,231
thing about that junction.

1155
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:50,237
Daniel: This makes me think about nested

1156
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:52,239
reference frames in communication.

1157
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,244
And let's just say that the expected free

1158
00:59:57,244 --> 00:59:57,244
energy or maybe even the integrated

1159
00:59:57,244 --> 00:59:57,244
information content is such and such a

1160
00:59:57,244 --> 01:00:07,769
level, but it varies within some range.

1161
01:00:07,801 --> 01:00:09,074
It's 100 plus or minus ten.

1162
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,423
Instead of just trying to naively

1163
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:13,423
minimize that to zero, we can create a

1164
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:13,423
nested model such that we expect that to

1165
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:13,423
be 100 plus or minus ten, at which point

1166
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:13,423
the non zero value is stabilized or

1167
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:29,005
buffered.

1168
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:33,435
And so then that becomes the kind of

1169
01:00:33,435 --> 01:00:33,435
stabilizes or wraps the fact that we're

1170
01:00:33,435 --> 01:00:33,435
not perfectly transmitting information

1171
01:00:33,435 --> 01:00:33,435
but we can be perfectly aligned, that we'

1172
01:00:33,435 --> 01:00:33,435
're not perfectly transmitting

1173
01:00:33,435 --> 01:00:50,148
information.

1174
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:55,679
And also our language understanding for

1175
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:55,679
fluent speakers we're able to map the

1176
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:01,669
phonemes a little bit deeper.

1177
01:01:01,672 --> 01:01:03,895
We're able to read between the lines or

1178
01:01:03,895 --> 01:01:05,061
listen between the phonemes.

1179
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:11,604
So that people who say words differently

1180
01:01:11,604 --> 01:01:11,604
map to the exact same syntax, let alone

1181
01:01:11,604 --> 01:01:17,294
the semantics.

1182
01:01:18,328 --> 01:01:20,587
The sound gets kind of abstracted out,

1183
01:01:20,587 --> 01:01:22,791
but it influences our qualia.

1184
01:01:23,825 --> 01:01:26,189
So something is being passed forward with

1185
01:01:26,189 --> 01:01:29,411
tonality and the timing.

1186
01:01:29,424 --> 01:01:33,827
And I wonder about with of course large

1187
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:33,827
language models how much context they're

1188
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:33,827
able to garner from the string of tokens

1189
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:33,827
when for our experience sending and

1190
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:33,827
receiving natural language communication

1191
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:33,827
it's all about the timing and the tone

1192
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:55,104
and the setting.

1193
01:01:57,121 --> 01:02:00,093
And so finding ways that we can describe

1194
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:00,093
that type of information, the category

1195
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:00,093
theory capacity for the different levels

1196
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:00,093
of sameness seems like exactly the tool

1197
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:11,201
that we need.

1198
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:19,286
Nao: Do you want to add anything?

1199
01:02:20,296 --> 01:02:23,322
Hayato: Yeah, I'm thinking about but.

1200
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:29,387
Nao: About the multilevel kind of free

1201
01:02:29,387 --> 01:02:31,405
energy minima.

1202
01:02:31,406 --> 01:02:33,425
I actually have a question to you

1203
01:02:33,425 --> 01:02:34,430
actually.

1204
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:39,486
So I recently discussed with roboticist

1205
01:02:39,486 --> 01:02:39,486
in Japan, Jun Tani, do you know his

1206
01:02:39,486 --> 01:02:45,542
work?

1207
01:02:45,548 --> 01:02:49,582
Yes is using this predictive coding kind

1208
01:02:49,582 --> 01:02:49,582
of scheme for constructing the set of

1209
01:02:49,582 --> 01:02:49,582
autonomous robot and he thinks this

1210
01:02:49,582 --> 01:02:49,582
intermingle of the top down prediction

1211
01:02:49,582 --> 01:02:49,582
and the bottom up prediction error is the

1212
01:02:49,582 --> 01:02:49,582
place that Korea emerges and things like

1213
01:02:49,582 --> 01:03:06,695
that.

1214
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:10,736
But one of his most interesting aspect of

1215
01:03:10,736 --> 01:03:10,736
his model to me is that he has this

1216
01:03:10,736 --> 01:03:10,736
different timescale for his neural system.

1217
01:03:10,736 --> 01:03:18,813
.

1218
01:03:19,824 --> 01:03:22,853
The most peripheral motor level and

1219
01:03:22,853 --> 01:03:22,853
sensory level has a very fast time scale.

1220
01:03:22,853 --> 01:03:25,888
.

1221
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:28,918
So that tries to match with what's

1222
01:03:28,918 --> 01:03:28,918
happening outside and then what they want

1223
01:03:28,918 --> 01:03:34,974
to do towards outside.

1224
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:37,006
And the intermediate level has a slightly

1225
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:39,026
longer kind of time scale.

1226
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:42,049
So there is some kind of inertia and an

1227
01:03:42,049 --> 01:03:42,049
even higher level has a much much longer

1228
01:03:42,049 --> 01:03:45,080
timescale.

1229
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:52,150
In the probably neural system there is

1230
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,150
also different level of the timescale and

1231
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,150
also different levels of the mechanism

1232
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,150
acting at the same time like change in

1233
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,150
the activity state in spiking or not and

1234
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,150
also release of the snaptick

1235
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,150
neurotransmitters that could increase or

1236
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,150
decrease over the time and also even the

1237
01:03:52,150 --> 01:04:17,348
new neurons emerging and going out.

1238
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:18,357
So.

1239
01:04:21,385 --> 01:04:24,411
The minimization, when you are talking

1240
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:24,411
about minimization, probably that kind of

1241
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:24,411
minimization is actually happening

1242
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:24,411
independently and also coherent tree

1243
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:24,411
potentially or contradictory across

1244
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:37,540
different levels and also regions.

1245
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,570
And there may be some kind of effort or

1246
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:40,570
whatever to also coordinate these kind of

1247
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:40,570
contradictory demands of the minimization.

1248
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:46,634
.

1249
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:49,669
What do you think about this issue?

1250
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:53,708
Do you still think it's a useful way to

1251
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:53,708
think about or use the term minimization

1252
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:59,765
in this situation?

1253
01:05:01,721 --> 01:05:03,740
Daniel: That's a great question.

1254
01:05:03,742 --> 01:05:06,774
Well, one thing that stood out to me was

1255
01:05:06,774 --> 01:05:06,774
you described the slower moving levels as

1256
01:05:06,774 --> 01:05:06,774
having inertia and from the Bayesian

1257
01:05:06,774 --> 01:05:06,774
mechanics perspective that's exactly how

1258
01:05:06,774 --> 01:05:17,887
we would model it.

1259
01:05:17,889 --> 01:05:20,918
They're slower moving, they have more

1260
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:20,918
inertia, and they move more like

1261
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:20,918
classical objects, whereas the faster

1262
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:20,918
timescales are moving more like lighter

1263
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:20,918
particles, more like that quantum probe

1264
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:20,918
in the limit and then the sort of center

1265
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:20,918
or the highest nested model would be like

1266
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:20,918
the most cognitively massive, potentially

1267
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:20,918
the slowest, potentially integrating

1268
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:20,918
information over the longest time window.

1269
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:49,204
.

1270
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:53,243
And certainly this is underlaned by these

1271
01:05:53,243 --> 01:05:53,243
multiple timescales of mechanism spiking

1272
01:05:53,243 --> 01:05:53,243
neurons from a few hundred milliseconds

1273
01:05:53,243 --> 01:05:53,243
timescale neuromodulatory processes over

1274
01:05:53,243 --> 01:05:53,243
seconds and minutes, synaptic plasticity

1275
01:05:53,243 --> 01:05:53,243
even neurogenesis and the development of

1276
01:05:53,243 --> 01:06:10,354
our brain.

1277
01:06:10,355 --> 01:06:13,380
So what does it really mean that

1278
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:13,380
minimization is occurring when we have

1279
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:13,380
this heterarchy where we have similar

1280
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:13,380
types of free energy minimizing units or

1281
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:13,380
active inference units within a level

1282
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:13,380
like Cortical columns or grid cell units

1283
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:13,380
and then also we have these nested models

1284
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:13,380
that are optimizing across spatial

1285
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:37,622
temporarily separated scales.

1286
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:40,658
Well, one paper that looked at this was

1287
01:06:40,658 --> 01:06:40,658
Our Livestream 42 on the Slam

1288
01:06:40,658 --> 01:06:40,658
simultaneous localization and mapping

1289
01:06:40,658 --> 01:06:48,735
also in robotics.

1290
01:06:48,736 --> 01:06:51,762
And so they had a two nested model with

1291
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:51,762
two steps and the lower level was like

1292
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:51,762
the tactics and that was where you had

1293
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:51,762
the motor and the sensors and then the

1294
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:51,762
nested model was slower that was like

1295
01:06:51,762 --> 01:07:03,821
where do I want to be?

1296
01:07:03,822 --> 01:07:08,876
That was more like the strategy and you

1297
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:08,876
can create an expected free energy

1298
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:08,876
functional that sums across those two

1299
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:08,876
levels how you tune the parameters is

1300
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:08,876
going to matter because how do you wait

1301
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:35,140
this comes up with preference learning.

1302
01:07:36,156 --> 01:07:39,184
If you have left or turn and right turn

1303
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:39,184
and your preference vector is like two

1304
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:39,184
and one versus 2 million and 1 million,

1305
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:39,184
then the ratio of the preference is the

1306
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:39,184
same, but the amplitude of the preference

1307
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:39,184
is a lot different, which is going to

1308
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:39,184
swing the model towards Valuing pragmatic

1309
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:57,366
outcomes.

1310
01:07:57,367 --> 01:08:00,330
Whereas if you had zero two and zero one,

1311
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:00,330
the ratio of the preference would still

1312
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:02,359
be the same.

1313
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,377
But it's such a small amplitude

1314
01:08:04,377 --> 01:08:05,384
preference.

1315
01:08:05,384 --> 01:08:08,417
And so similarly, with expected free

1316
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:08,417
energy minimization you could make it so

1317
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:08,417
that the joint minimization was driven by

1318
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:19,522
just the top level of the model.

1319
01:08:19,524 --> 01:08:22,555
And then the sort of contradictions or

1320
01:08:22,555 --> 01:08:22,555
even increases in expected free energy of

1321
01:08:22,555 --> 01:08:22,555
the lower sensory model would basically

1322
01:08:22,555 --> 01:08:22,555
always be accepted in service of the top

1323
01:08:22,555 --> 01:08:34,674
model or vice versa.

1324
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:39,721
And it seems like biological systems with

1325
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:39,721
their sort of precarious or self

1326
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:39,721
organized criticality operations they're

1327
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:39,721
poised where you can have propagations

1328
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:39,721
where small changes in the bottom up

1329
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:39,721
model can propagate and induce phase

1330
01:08:39,721 --> 01:09:04,910
changes of higher levels and vice versa.

1331
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:06,936
So they're certainly poised

1332
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:06,936
parametrically at a special place where

1333
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:06,936
the composition of the faster sensory

1334
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:06,936
motor models and the slower like

1335
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:06,936
cognitive or narrative or metacognitive

1336
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:06,936
levels it's all poised in a very

1337
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:06,936
integrated way, potentially even one that

1338
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:06,936
is where the IIT measures tell us

1339
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:32,196
something useful.

1340
01:09:36,235 --> 01:09:39,268
But yes, the contradictory demands of

1341
01:09:39,268 --> 01:09:39,268
subunits within a level of collective

1342
01:09:39,268 --> 01:09:45,326
behavior and across levels.

1343
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:50,372
As a biologist I think we just point to

1344
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:50,372
ecology, evolution and development and

1345
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:50,372
just distributed systems that don't exist

1346
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:50,372
at an adaptive point or implement

1347
01:09:50,372 --> 01:10:02,436
adaptive dynamics amidst uncertainty.

1348
01:10:02,437 --> 01:10:05,463
They just fail to exist and so the

1349
01:10:05,463 --> 01:10:05,463
complex biological systems that we

1350
01:10:05,463 --> 01:10:11,520
observe today do manage that trade off.

1351
01:10:11,521 --> 01:10:13,548
And then in robotics, they have this

1352
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:13,548
unique challenge of developing systems

1353
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:13,548
with one shot or with Iterated

1354
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:13,548
development that do have some of those

1355
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:22,637
properties.

1356
01:10:22,638 --> 01:10:25,661
But for sure, there's no reason to think

1357
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:25,661
that just by laying out a nested active

1358
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:25,661
inference model that you would actually

1359
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:25,661
get, like, a more adaptive decision

1360
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:32,734
making agent.

1361
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:34,759
In fact, as you nest models, the state

1362
01:10:34,759 --> 01:10:37,780
space of these models becomes vast.

1363
01:10:37,782 --> 01:10:39,803
And with some back of the envelope

1364
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:39,803
calculations, you can see, like, well, if

1365
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:39,803
I do this level of nesting and have this

1366
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:39,803
kind of sensor array, we need this absurd

1367
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:39,803
amount of data to actually parameterize

1368
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:50,915
this model.

1369
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:53,942
And by the time we collected that many

1370
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:53,942
observations, maybe the causal structure

1371
01:10:53,942 --> 01:10:53,942
that we learned to the world, 200 hours

1372
01:10:53,942 --> 01:11:00,957
of video ago don't apply.

1373
01:11:03,984 --> 01:11:06,018
Nao: Yeah, that could be quite a huge

1374
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:06,018
difference between probably IIT and free

1375
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:11,063
energy.

1376
01:11:11,065 --> 01:11:14,099
I think the IIT explicitly states that

1377
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:14,099
this time scale that matters, but in this

1378
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:14,099
case, it's just about quaria is a

1379
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:14,099
particular time scale that maximize

1380
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:14,099
integrated information and that

1381
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:14,099
corresponds to the timescale of our

1382
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:32,273
experience.

1383
01:11:33,286 --> 01:11:37,322
Tannis model, the lowest timescale is

1384
01:11:37,322 --> 01:11:37,322
like, on the order of 100 seconds or

1385
01:11:37,322 --> 01:11:42,379
something like that.

1386
01:11:42,379 --> 01:11:45,403
And also new synaptic plasticity is on

1387
01:11:45,403 --> 01:11:46,416
the order of hours.

1388
01:11:46,418 --> 01:11:49,447
And most likely spiking neurons seems to

1389
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:49,447
be more mattering with respect to our

1390
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:55,503
particular experience at each moment.

1391
01:11:55,504 --> 01:11:56,509
Right.

1392
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:58,536
And why it is the case that the

1393
01:11:58,536 --> 01:11:58,536
provisional answer provided by IIT is

1394
01:11:58,536 --> 01:11:58,536
that because at that particular time

1395
01:11:58,536 --> 01:11:58,536
scale, integrated information is much

1396
01:11:58,536 --> 01:11:58,536
larger and across the scale and across

1397
01:11:58,536 --> 01:12:12,615
the regions.

1398
01:12:12,617 --> 01:12:15,644
But this is a huge conjecture, and nobody

1399
01:12:15,644 --> 01:12:17,666
knows whether this is true or not.

1400
01:12:17,668 --> 01:12:21,704
And when we use the Fly model, we weren't

1401
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:21,704
able to sort of confirm any kind of a

1402
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:21,704
clear peak in the integrated information

1403
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:31,799
using a different time scale.

1404
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,829
So it's still something that I'm very

1405
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:34,829
interested in looking, but still not

1406
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:39,885
clear whether this is the case.

1407
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:43,922
I don't know if Hayato has some idea or

1408
01:12:43,922 --> 01:12:43,922
insight into the appropriate time scale

1409
01:12:43,922 --> 01:12:43,922
for consciousness or something from the

1410
01:12:43,922 --> 01:12:52,017
physics point of view.

1411
01:12:53,023 --> 01:12:57,067
Hayato: Yeah, I have some thoughts, but

1412
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:57,067
maybe it becomes a long story and also

1413
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:57,067
connects to the observer dependence

1414
01:12:57,067 --> 01:13:07,103
program.

1415
01:13:07,105 --> 01:13:13,162
So I was thinking about how to explain

1416
01:13:13,162 --> 01:13:13,162
these very important things in one thread,

1417
01:13:13,162 --> 01:13:13,162
, and I found that first, the very simple

1418
01:13:13,162 --> 01:13:13,162
fact that there comes no identically same

1419
01:13:13,162 --> 01:13:33,368
two events.

1420
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:38,412
Every event is different in some respect.

1421
01:13:38,412 --> 01:13:38,412
.

1422
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:43,468
But to do science, or more generous, some

1423
01:13:43,468 --> 01:13:43,468
recognition of law, we need some

1424
01:13:43,468 --> 01:13:51,540
criterion of sameness.

1425
01:13:51,546 --> 01:13:57,602
For example, you want to know how to heal

1426
01:13:57,602 --> 01:13:59,620
the disease?

1427
01:14:00,572 --> 01:14:05,620
You should identify the different persons,

1428
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:05,620
, people as the same kind of samples or

1429
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:10,676
something.

1430
01:14:11,682 --> 01:14:16,736
Of course, there is no identical persons,

1431
01:14:16,736 --> 01:14:16,736
but you have to identify in the members

1432
01:14:16,736 --> 01:14:25,827
of the same group something.

1433
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:29,868
So all the scientific studies depend on

1434
01:14:29,868 --> 01:14:32,898
some choice of the sameness.

1435
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,939
And so in that sense, all the science

1436
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:36,939
depends on this kind of choice of the

1437
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:36,939
sameness as you both pointed out and I

1438
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:36,939
think that there is no canonical choice

1439
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:50,078
of the sameness.

1440
01:14:50,078 --> 01:14:55,121
You can choose sameness but if you choose

1441
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:55,121
some sameness, then you can talk about

1442
01:14:55,121 --> 01:15:00,115
observables.

1443
01:15:00,115 --> 01:15:03,144
Observables means some kind of quantities.

1444
01:15:03,144 --> 01:15:03,144
.

1445
01:15:03,145 --> 01:15:07,182
You can observe something, maybe it

1446
01:15:07,182 --> 01:15:07,182
randomly change the value or no value

1447
01:15:07,182 --> 01:15:13,244
like a count of case.

1448
01:15:13,245 --> 01:15:18,292
But by measuring process it become half

1449
01:15:18,292 --> 01:15:21,321
the value or something.

1450
01:15:22,332 --> 01:15:26,371
There may be indefinite nature of such

1451
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:26,371
kind of quantities, but anyway we can

1452
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:26,371
imagine that the quantities has some kind

1453
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:38,489
of structure between the quantities.

1454
01:15:38,491 --> 01:15:42,538
So in mathematical terms it will be some

1455
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,571
algebra of the observables.

1456
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:49,608
Then how to connect this idea theoretical

1457
01:15:49,608 --> 01:15:49,608
idea to the experimental thing is the key

1458
01:15:49,608 --> 01:15:55,663
is expectation value.

1459
01:15:55,664 --> 01:15:59,708
So theory provides expectation value of

1460
01:15:59,708 --> 01:15:59,708
something and we can connect theory and

1461
01:15:59,708 --> 01:15:59,708
experiments by comparing the theoretical

1462
01:15:59,708 --> 01:15:59,708
expectation value and the average of

1463
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:14,790
samples.

1464
01:16:14,791 --> 01:16:17,828
So all the quantitative science depends

1465
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:17,828
on this structure like algebra,

1466
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:17,828
observables and some mapping from the

1467
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:17,828
observables algebra to the sum number

1468
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:28,937
system.

1469
01:16:28,939 --> 01:16:35,000
So this is called a state in mathematics

1470
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,020
and algebra.

1471
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:40,053
And state is something like the mapping

1472
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:40,053
of quantities of random variables or

1473
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:46,117
observables into its expectation value.

1474
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:50,151
So this mapping of expectation is

1475
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:52,177
technically called state.

1476
01:16:53,179 --> 01:16:56,215
So if you start from observer algebra and

1477
01:16:56,215 --> 01:16:56,215
state, this is a starting point of

1478
01:16:56,215 --> 01:17:02,216
noncommutative probability theory.

1479
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:06,253
That is if this algebra is commutative,

1480
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:06,253
then the conventional probability theory

1481
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:06,253
can reconstruct from this commutative

1482
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:15,343
algebra and state.

1483
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:19,379
But if this is noncommutative as now

1484
01:17:19,379 --> 01:17:19,379
pointed out, if the process is essential,

1485
01:17:19,379 --> 01:17:19,379
then these algebra should be

1486
01:17:19,379 --> 01:17:27,466
noncommutative.

1487
01:17:27,467 --> 01:17:30,496
Then we have the noncommutativity

1488
01:17:30,496 --> 01:17:30,496
probability space features which I code

1489
01:17:30,496 --> 01:17:30,496
intuitively the counter mathematics or

1490
01:17:30,496 --> 01:17:38,574
something.

1491
01:17:38,576 --> 01:17:44,635
So in this case the observable dependence

1492
01:17:44,635 --> 01:17:46,655
is described.

1493
01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:50,697
The other kind of observable dependence

1494
01:17:50,697 --> 01:17:50,697
can be described because you can't have

1495
01:17:50,697 --> 01:17:50,697
the classical probability space for all

1496
01:17:50,697 --> 01:18:00,733
the observable.

1497
01:18:00,733 --> 01:18:03,765
But if you choose one observable, one

1498
01:18:03,765 --> 01:18:03,765
observable like position or momentum, you

1499
01:18:03,765 --> 01:18:08,815
can choose this.

1500
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,842
Then you can construct the classical

1501
01:18:11,842 --> 01:18:12,856
probability space.

1502
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:16,894
So the choice of context or the choice of

1503
01:18:16,894 --> 01:18:16,894
measuring something is by choosing

1504
01:18:16,894 --> 01:18:20,936
something.

1505
01:18:20,938 --> 01:18:24,973
So context you can have the classical

1506
01:18:24,973 --> 01:18:26,989
kind of reality.

1507
01:18:26,997 --> 01:18:30,003
So this kind of observer with dependence

1508
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:30,003
is well formulated by using

1509
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:36,009
noncommutative probability space.

1510
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:42,015
So I think this multilayered observable

1511
01:18:42,015 --> 01:18:42,015
observer dependence can be described by

1512
01:18:42,015 --> 01:18:52,025
using noncommutative probability.

1513
01:18:53,026 --> 01:18:55,028
And the last thing I would say is the

1514
01:18:55,028 --> 01:18:55,028
connection of the category theory and

1515
01:18:55,028 --> 01:19:00,027
noncommutativity probability.

1516
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:03,030
Very interestingly,

1517
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:07,034
if the category is given like a causal

1518
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:07,034
system causal system give us some

1519
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:12,039
category.

1520
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:16,043
Like a causaliation is arrow, and the

1521
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:16,043
composition is A is cause of B, B causes

1522
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:19,046
C.

1523
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:23,050
Then indirectly of course at least the A

1524
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,050
causes C or something, so it becomes can

1525
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:29,055
be considered as a category.

1526
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:33,060
There is many kind of category. But if

1527
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:33,060
the category is given, then the algebra

1528
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:33,060
refracting this categorical structure is

1529
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:33,060
necessarily noncommutative if there is a

1530
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:50,077
nontrivial arrow between two objects.

1531
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:54,080
So actually the category theory and the

1532
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:54,080
noncommutative probability is from the

1533
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:54,080
mathematical point of view, it's kind of

1534
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:54,080
the two aspects of the same thing, like

1535
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:54,080
the fundamental observer dependence or

1536
01:19:54,080 --> 01:20:11,092
contextual dependence or something.

1537
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:15,096
And this contextuality, like in topos

1538
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:15,096
theory, actually, this choosing concepts

1539
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:15,096
and the transformation between the

1540
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:15,096
contexts can be formulated in terms of

1541
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:15,096
topos, which is a very powerful kind of

1542
01:20:15,096 --> 01:20:32,113
category.

1543
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:36,117
So sorry for the too-long explanation!

1544
01:20:36,117 --> 01:20:36,117
But without that, this very fundamental

1545
01:20:36,117 --> 01:20:42,123
question cannot be organized.

1546
01:20:42,123 --> 01:20:46,127
Sorry for the long explanation.

1547
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:50,131
Daniel: Oh, it's it's awesome.

1548
01:20:50,131 --> 01:20:54,135
I mean, empirically, if you have a sensor

1549
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:54,135
that's getting measurements at a certain

1550
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:54,135
time scale, then there's a binding of the

1551
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:54,135
timescale of the observer and the

1552
01:20:54,135 --> 01:21:05,140
processing.

1553
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:09,144
Can I ask a question from the chat?

1554
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:11,146
All right.

1555
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:13,148
Dave asks.

1556
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:15,150
At one time, Professor Tononi was

1557
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,150
representing the shape of the relations

1558
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,150
between complexity and consciousness,

1559
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,150
such that too-richly-connected systems

1560
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:25,159
are nonconscious.

1561
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:28,163
They're overwhelmed by the complexity.

1562
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:32,167
Recently, the inverted U that shows this

1563
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:32,167
relation seems to have become scarce,

1564
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:37,172
leading to undue confusion.

1565
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:39,174
Have IIT people abandoned the idea that

1566
01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:39,174
there is a bounded sweet zone for

1567
01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:43,178
consciousness?

1568
01:21:43,178 --> 01:21:46,181
Can a system be either too simple or too

1569
01:21:46,181 --> 01:21:49,184
complex to act consciously?

1570
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:53,188
So is IIT lead us to a kind of monotonic

1571
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:53,188
consciousness concept, or could there be

1572
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:53,188
a U shaped relationship with information

1573
01:21:53,188 --> 01:22:03,192
integration and qualia?

1574
01:22:07,196 --> 01:22:08,197
Nao: I see.

1575
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:09,198
Yeah.

1576
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:12,201
I can also see that comment here.

1577
01:22:31,219 --> 01:22:33,222
In the end, the question is, can the

1578
01:22:33,222 --> 01:22:33,222
system be either too simple or too

1579
01:22:33,222 --> 01:22:37,226
complex to act consciously?

1580
01:22:37,226 --> 01:22:37,226
Daniel: Right.

1581
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:43,232
Nao: In the sense yeah, from an IAT point

1582
01:22:43,232 --> 01:22:43,232
of view, there are several things that

1583
01:22:43,232 --> 01:22:43,232
needs to be said, but inverted U is still

1584
01:22:43,232 --> 01:22:57,246
there in a sense.

1585
01:22:57,246 --> 01:23:00,243
And here this person seems to be

1586
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
confusing between the axis of the kind of

1587
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
complexity and the axis of the

1588
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
connectedness. In IIT original

1589
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:13,256
formulation -

1590
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:16,259
and it's still true for the IIT 4.0,

1591
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
which is the latest one - when the system

1592
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
is too connected, let's say if you have

1593
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
hundred neurons and each of them are

1594
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
connected to everybody in a uniform way,

1595
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
then IIT predicts that it doesn't have

1596
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
much complexity or compositionality or

1597
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:16,259
uniqueness to arrive from that kind of

1598
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:44,287
system.

1599
01:23:44,287 --> 01:23:48,291
And even if you cut the system, it doesn'

1600
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:49,292
't matter much.

1601
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:53,296
And so that would lead to, most likely,

1602
01:23:53,296 --> 01:23:56,299
very low level of consciousness.

1603
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:02,299
I think that's what… [Reads viewer’s

1604
01:24:02,299 --> 01:24:02,299
note] Yes. I should have typed

1605
01:24:02,299 --> 01:24:04,301
“connectivity.”

1606
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:05,302
Yes.

1607
01:24:06,303 --> 01:24:08,305
If that's the case, that's fine.

1608
01:24:08,305 --> 01:24:11,308
Daniel: But higher complexity, which is

1609
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
granted by some small world or some

1610
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
sparse connectivity structure, higher

1611
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
complexity is monotonically associated

1612
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:22,319
with more consciousness?

1613
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,323
Nao: That's not the case in IIT, and that

1614
01:24:26,323 --> 01:24:28,325
is true from the beginning.

1615
01:24:28,325 --> 01:24:31,328
And the easiest kind of example is to

1616
01:24:31,328 --> 01:24:31,328
have a two highly complex kind of system

1617
01:24:31,328 --> 01:24:39,336
that is loosely connected between them.

1618
01:24:40,337 --> 01:24:43,340
It's a kind of a situation where you are

1619
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:43,340
interested right, in a sense like ant

1620
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:48,345
colony, each ant has a huge brain.

1621
01:24:48,345 --> 01:24:51,348
Even though it looks extremely small, the

1622
01:24:51,348 --> 01:24:51,348
number of the neurons they have is more

1623
01:24:51,348 --> 01:24:54,351
than one million, right?

1624
01:24:54,351 --> 01:24:56,353
Daniel: I think in that order, yes.

1625
01:24:56,353 --> 01:24:57,354
Around a million.

1626
01:24:57,354 --> 01:24:58,355
Nao: Yeah.

1627
01:24:58,355 --> 01:25:01,352
So IIT would naturally predict that the

1628
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
causal connection or integrated

1629
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
information arising from this 1 million

1630
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:01,352
neurons within “I Am” are going to be

1631
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:12,363
really massive.

1632
01:25:12,363 --> 01:25:16,367
It's very difficult to disconnect in any

1633
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:18,369
way, in any meaningful way.

1634
01:25:18,369 --> 01:25:22,373
However, interaction between a single ant

1635
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:22,373
to the another ant has a much less direct

1636
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:22,373
causal relationship. And therefore the

1637
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:22,373
local minima or local maxima of the PHI

1638
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:22,373
value is going to be very huge within

1639
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:35,386
each ant.

1640
01:25:35,386 --> 01:25:38,389
But when you combine or when you treat

1641
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:38,389
all these lots of ants, it definitely

1642
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:38,389
does bring some kind of intelligent and

1643
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:47,398
complex kind of behavior.

1644
01:25:47,398 --> 01:25:50,401
But phenomenality is not there at that

1645
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:51,402
level.

1646
01:25:51,402 --> 01:25:54,405
Phenomenality, consciousness, lives

1647
01:25:54,405 --> 01:25:54,405
within this maximum level of integrated

1648
01:25:54,405 --> 01:25:54,405
information, pretty much like what we

1649
01:25:54,405 --> 01:26:02,407
talked about in timescale stuff.

1650
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,410
We have a huge, complex and very

1651
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:05,410
intelligent kind of behavior and

1652
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:05,410
artifacts in the long time scale and also

1653
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:12,417
short time scale.

1654
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,420
But what matters for our phenomenology is

1655
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:15,420
this particular several orders of 100

1656
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:15,420
milliseconds that corresponds the maximum

1657
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:23,428
of the integrated information.

1658
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,433
Daniel: So you still have emergent

1659
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
intelligence at the colony level, but

1660
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
that doesn't necessarily mean that you

1661
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
have qualia arising at that level for

1662
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
analogous reasons why our qualia are at

1663
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:28,433
the spiking timescale despite that being

1664
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:47,452
only one of the nested timescales.

1665
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:48,453
Nao: Exactly.

1666
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:50,455
Daniel: Very.

1667
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:53,458
Nao: IIT predicts that the intelligence

1668
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:53,458
and the consciousness – qualia - is

1669
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:57,462
completely dissociable.

1670
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:04,463
And that leads to the commentary about

1671
01:27:04,463 --> 01:27:05,464
large language model.

1672
01:27:06,465 --> 01:27:07,466
Probably right.

1673
01:27:07,466 --> 01:27:10,469
Large language model is probably

1674
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:10,469
structurally built to be very simple,

1675
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:10,469
almost like probably Cerebellum in the

1676
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:10,469
human brain, which accounts roughly like

1677
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:21,480
80% of our neurons in the brain.

1678
01:27:22,481 --> 01:27:25,484
Out of ten to the eleven neurons in the

1679
01:27:25,484 --> 01:27:27,486
brain, 80% are in the cerebellum.

1680
01:27:27,486 --> 01:27:30,489
But even if you remove it or lose it or

1681
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:30,489
are born without it, it seems

1682
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:36,494
consciousness is not that different.

1683
01:27:39,498 --> 01:27:42,501
And the simple kind of prediction that

1684
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:42,501
cerebellum is doing, maybe something

1685
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:42,501
similar to the large neural[?] model is

1686
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:42,501
doing. It's very modular, it's parallel,

1687
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:42,501
it's not integrated, does a lot of

1688
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:42,501
intelligent things, but nothing to do

1689
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:59,517
with the consciousness.

1690
01:28:00,513 --> 01:28:03,516
Daniel: Very interesting!

1691
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:08,521
Well, maybe in our closing sections, of

1692
01:28:08,521 --> 01:28:08,521
course, anything you want to share or ask,

1693
01:28:08,521 --> 01:28:08,521
, but how does active inference benefit

1694
01:28:08,521 --> 01:28:21,534
and grow from what you're sharing?

1695
01:28:21,534 --> 01:28:24,537
And how do you see things unfolding for

1696
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:26,539
people interested in these topics?

1697
01:28:30,543 --> 01:28:32,545
Nao: Do you want to say something first?

1698
01:28:32,545 --> 01:28:34,547
Hayato: Yeah, I'm thinking, “How would we

1699
01:28:34,547 --> 01:28:35,548
know?”

1700
01:28:35,548 --> 01:28:39,552
Nao: Okay, then from my end I used to

1701
01:28:39,552 --> 01:28:39,552
have difficulty in thinking about active

1702
01:28:39,552 --> 01:28:39,552
inference or Markov blanket and things

1703
01:28:39,552 --> 01:28:49,562
like that.

1704
01:28:50,563 --> 01:28:53,566
But by broadening my perspective and so

1705
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:53,566
becoming more generous, I started to feel

1706
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:53,566
like more maybe some aspects of the

1707
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:53,566
thinking and also formulation can be

1708
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:53,566
relevant at least for the explanation of

1709
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:53,566
the biological systems in various domain.

1710
01:28:53,566 --> 01:29:10,577
.

1711
01:29:10,577 --> 01:29:13,580
And if it's also useful to explain

1712
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:13,580
intelligence or construct intelligence,

1713
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:18,585
that would be great.

1714
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:22,589
And from our work of the quantum quarry

1715
01:29:22,589 --> 01:29:22,589
of hypothesis, if quarry is something

1716
01:29:22,589 --> 01:29:22,589
that is influenced by its measurement,

1717
01:29:22,589 --> 01:29:22,589
then that aspect may be emphasizing this.

1718
01:29:22,589 --> 01:29:33,600
.

1719
01:29:34,601 --> 01:29:39,606
Usually Corey of consciousness is kind of

1720
01:29:39,606 --> 01:29:42,609
considered a passive construct.

1721
01:29:42,609 --> 01:29:45,612
Like at a given moment what I'm

1722
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:47,614
experiencing static passive.

1723
01:29:48,615 --> 01:29:50,617
But now I'm more thinking about because

1724
01:29:50,617 --> 01:29:50,617
of this collaboration with the hat on the

1725
01:29:50,617 --> 01:29:53,620
other people.

1726
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:55,622
That can be the case.

1727
01:29:55,622 --> 01:29:57,624
And it's more to do with the process.

1728
01:29:57,624 --> 01:30:01,622
And the process it may not be the kind of

1729
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:01,622
the level of the active inference that

1730
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:01,622
you are thinking like not the level of

1731
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:01,622
the acting on the world, but more to do

1732
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:01,622
with this state itself, influencing

1733
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:01,622
itself might be some kind of important

1734
01:30:01,622 --> 01:30:21,642
insight to understand the quality.

1735
01:30:24,645 --> 01:30:29,649
Hayato: Okay, my comment is it is related

1736
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:29,649
to the concept of states again because

1737
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:29,649
expectation value I pointed out the

1738
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:29,649
importance of expectation value but for

1739
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:29,649
example what is the expectation value for

1740
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:29,649
example the strength of causality or

1741
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:51,672
something.

1742
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:54,675
Then the problem of time scale is very

1743
01:30:54,675 --> 01:30:55,676
important.

1744
01:30:55,676 --> 01:30:59,680
So you can cause grain for example the

1745
01:30:59,680 --> 01:30:59,680
brain activity for one time, scale

1746
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:05,680
another timescale.

1747
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:10,685
So I think if IIT is correct there is a

1748
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:10,685
good timescale which is of importance

1749
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:10,685
great importance of choosing this

1750
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:19,694
structure.

1751
01:31:19,694 --> 01:31:22,697
Then I think the brain information or

1752
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:22,697
something causal structure should be the

1753
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:22,697
good category and you can construct a non

1754
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:22,697
competitive algebra and the state is

1755
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:32,707
defined or something.

1756
01:31:32,707 --> 01:31:37,712
So the timescale is quite fundamental.

1757
01:31:37,712 --> 01:31:41,716
And on the other hand the state on the

1758
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:41,716
category that is state on the category

1759
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:41,716
algebra can be represented by some kind

1760
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:41,716
of weight on arrows, the positive kind of

1761
01:31:41,716 --> 01:31:56,731
weight on arrows.

1762
01:31:56,731 --> 01:31:59,734
So the changing the state is the change

1763
01:31:59,734 --> 01:32:01,730
in the weight of these arrows.

1764
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,732
The positive definite function.

1765
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:08,737
I think the transition or the weighting

1766
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:08,737
of this arrow is very at least

1767
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:08,737
mathematically very interesting to

1768
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:08,737
compare the active inference as a

1769
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:25,754
mathematical point of view.

1770
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:29,758
So good weight weight to the better

1771
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:29,758
weight or something is very how to say

1772
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:37,766
interesting to compare.

1773
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:43,772
I don't have much knowledge about active

1774
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:43,772
inference but it seems to me it is quite

1775
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:43,772
useful to connect this level the state

1776
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:51,780
change or something.

1777
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:59,788
So yeah it is very interesting for me and

1778
01:32:59,788 --> 01:32:59,788
other thing is I forgot to the sad point

1779
01:32:59,788 --> 01:32:59,788
but yeah so yeah yes, as now already okay

1780
01:32:59,788 --> 01:32:59,788
point out I talked about measurements

1781
01:32:59,788 --> 01:32:59,788
instruments but the point of this notion

1782
01:32:59,788 --> 01:33:30,813
is probe system.

1783
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:34,817
So measurement is always often considered

1784
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:34,817
as a very direct kind of interaction like

1785
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:42,825
the system and the environment.

1786
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:46,829
But environment has some kind of probe

1787
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:46,829
into the system then the interaction is

1788
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:46,829
occurred with this probe and this system.

1789
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:53,836
.

1790
01:33:53,836 --> 01:33:57,839
I think it is very analogous to the

1791
01:33:57,839 --> 01:33:57,839
quoria the case of so of course the outer

1792
01:33:57,839 --> 01:33:57,839
world is relating to the brain inside of

1793
01:33:57,839 --> 01:33:57,839
course at least process or the historical

1794
01:33:57,839 --> 01:34:11,848
or developmental.

1795
01:34:11,848 --> 01:34:15,852
But I think through perception or

1796
01:34:15,852 --> 01:34:15,852
something the brain has its probe over

1797
01:34:15,852 --> 01:34:20,857
the world.

1798
01:34:20,857 --> 01:34:23,860
For example this interaction is very hard

1799
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:24,861
to say.

1800
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:25,862
Interesting.

1801
01:34:25,862 --> 01:34:28,865
So measurement, the analogy to the

1802
01:34:28,865 --> 01:34:28,865
measurement theory may be some physically

1803
01:34:28,865 --> 01:34:33,870
within the.

1804
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:36,873
Brain, but some kind of probe of the

1805
01:34:36,873 --> 01:34:36,873
outer system under this chorea is

1806
01:34:36,873 --> 01:34:41,878
interacting.

1807
01:34:41,878 --> 01:34:46,883
So I think it unifies picture, I think.

1808
01:34:49,886 --> 01:34:51,888
What do you think now, for example?

1809
01:34:51,888 --> 01:34:53,890
Nao: Yeah, that's actually very much

1810
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:53,890
related to what I was actually

1811
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:58,895
constructing this morning.

1812
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:01,892
Nao: Yeah.

1813
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:05,896
Nao: So I was reading this Ozawa paper

1814
01:35:05,896 --> 01:35:05,896
that describes the instrument, and I'm

1815
01:35:05,896 --> 01:35:05,896
getting better understanding what it

1816
01:35:05,896 --> 01:35:14,905
means.

1817
01:35:14,905 --> 01:35:18,909
But what he says is that every observable

1818
01:35:18,909 --> 01:35:18,909
a of a system S is identified with the

1819
01:35:18,909 --> 01:35:18,909
observable a tensor with the instrument I

1820
01:35:18,909 --> 01:35:28,919
over system S plus S prime.

1821
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,924
So S here is the original system, and S

1822
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:33,924
prime is the one that with any system

1823
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:40,931
external to S.

1824
01:35:41,932 --> 01:35:44,935
And what Hayato was meaning is that this

1825
01:35:44,935 --> 01:35:44,935
S prime is probe system, which is a part

1826
01:35:44,935 --> 01:35:49,940
of the environment.

1827
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:50,941
Right?

1828
01:35:50,941 --> 01:35:51,942
Hayato: Yeah.

1829
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:55,946
Nao: And so here what this quantum, in

1830
01:35:55,946 --> 01:35:55,946
this case, quantum kind of system

1831
01:35:55,946 --> 01:35:59,950
description.

1832
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:01,946
But it's also true for the quantum

1833
01:36:01,946 --> 01:36:02,947
cognition.

1834
01:36:02,947 --> 01:36:05,950
And in my case, it is also true for the

1835
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:05,950
quantum coria hypothesis, is that some

1836
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:05,950
kind of chore experiencing system is

1837
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:05,950
interacting with the wired, but through

1838
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:05,950
the sort of membrane, or sort of that

1839
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:05,950
like a mark of branch like thing is

1840
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:05,950
already filtering interaction as a

1841
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:25,970
sensory input and out tension.

1842
01:36:26,971 --> 01:36:29,974
And this part itself is kind of

1843
01:36:29,974 --> 01:36:31,976
interacting with itself.

1844
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:36,981
These arrows are the critical part.

1845
01:36:36,981 --> 01:36:40,985
And then if we translate that other way

1846
01:36:40,985 --> 01:36:40,985
to in our case, this correspond to every

1847
01:36:40,985 --> 01:36:40,985
coil a of a coil experiencing system S,

1848
01:36:40,985 --> 01:36:40,985
which is, in the case of IAT, it's called

1849
01:36:40,985 --> 01:36:40,985
a complex observer, a times instrument of

1850
01:36:40,985 --> 01:36:56,001
a system s prime, S prime.

1851
01:36:57,002 --> 01:37:00,999
And this S prime here, I think, will

1852
01:37:00,999 --> 01:37:00,999
include all the neural net processes that

1853
01:37:00,999 --> 01:37:00,999
support the underlying choreography, but

1854
01:37:00,999 --> 01:37:00,999
it doesn't really necessarily directly

1855
01:37:00,999 --> 01:37:11,010
include the external environment.

1856
01:37:13,012 --> 01:37:16,015
Many people start to do that, but if you

1857
01:37:16,015 --> 01:37:16,015
do that, then suddenly hallucination or

1858
01:37:16,015 --> 01:37:16,015
dreaming and things like that becomes

1859
01:37:16,015 --> 01:37:16,015
very difficult to explain, including too

1860
01:37:16,015 --> 01:37:24,023
much.

1861
01:37:27,026 --> 01:37:29,028
I think that corresponds to what you

1862
01:37:29,028 --> 01:37:30,029
wanted to say, right?

1863
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:31,030
Hayato: Yes, exactly.

1864
01:37:33,032 --> 01:37:34,033
Nao: Yeah.

1865
01:37:35,034 --> 01:37:37,036
Daniel: Well, this is really awesome.

1866
01:37:37,036 --> 01:37:40,039
I very much appreciate that we could have

1867
01:37:40,039 --> 01:37:41,040
this conversation.

1868
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,042
Is there anything else you want to add or

1869
01:37:43,042 --> 01:37:44,043
ask?

1870
01:37:46,045 --> 01:37:46,045
Nao: Thank you.

1871
01:37:47,046 --> 01:37:49,048
I also enjoyed and it was also good for

1872
01:37:49,048 --> 01:37:51,050
me to formulate my thoughts as well.

1873
01:37:53,051 --> 01:37:55,054
Hayato: Yeah, I'm very surprised.

1874
01:37:56,055 --> 01:37:57,056
Yeah.

1875
01:37:57,056 --> 01:37:58,057
Surprised me.

1876
01:37:58,057 --> 01:38:08,061
The how consistent our thoughts are.

1877
01:38:12,065 --> 01:38:16,069
It was just a surprise for me, maybe.

1878
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:22,075
The conversation often goes, how to say,

1879
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:23,076
diverge.

1880
01:38:23,076 --> 01:38:26,079
But our conversation has a very

1881
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:28,081
surprisingly conversion.

1882
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:32,085
So I think it's quite interesting in

1883
01:38:32,085 --> 01:38:33,086
itself.

1884
01:38:36,089 --> 01:38:39,092
I learned much from this conversation.

1885
01:38:39,092 --> 01:38:42,094
Thank you for inviting us.

1886
01:38:43,096 --> 01:38:44,097
Daniel: Thank you so much.

1887
01:38:45,098 --> 01:38:48,101
Hope to join on your channel and hear

1888
01:38:48,101 --> 01:38:48,101
updates on your research as things

1889
01:38:48,101 --> 01:38:51,104
develop.

1890
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:53,106
So thank you again.

1891
01:38:53,106 --> 01:38:54,107
Hayato: Thank you.

1892
01:38:54,107 --> 01:38:55,108
Nao: Thank you.

1893
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:56,109
Hayato: Bye.

1894
01:38:56,109 --> 01:38:56,109
Nao: Bye.

1895
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:57,110
Hayato: Bye.
