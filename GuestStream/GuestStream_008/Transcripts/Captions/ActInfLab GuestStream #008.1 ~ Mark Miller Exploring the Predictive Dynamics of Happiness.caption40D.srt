00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:08,308
Hello

2
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:11,311
everyone,
and welcome to the Active Inference Lab.

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:16,282
Today it is August 9th, 2021,
and we're here in Guest

4
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:20,720
stream number 8.1
with Mark Miller and guests.

5
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:25,325
So this is going to be an awesome
presentation followed by a discussion

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,860
so if you have any questions

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,729
during the presentation,
please put them in the live chat

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,466
and we'll make sure to ask the panel
at the end of the presentation.

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,170
So thanks again
to all of our great guests for coming on

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,139
and please take it away.

11
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,107
Thank you. Excellent.

12
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,108
Thanks for that, Daniel.

13
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,978
OK, I'm just going to share my screen OK?

14
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,281
Can you turn on screen
cheering for me on your side?

15
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,120
It's under the advanced.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,855
So at the bottom
where it says share screen,

17
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,924
there should be a little little arrow
and click that.

18
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,293
There should be an advanced feature
and then should say allow.

19
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,463
Got it. OK. Yeah. That's it, huh?

20
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:05,565
Great.

21
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:05,965
How's that?

22
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,201
Can you just see my slide? Looks great.

23
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:09,569
Excellent.

24
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,038
Great. OK, well, Daniel, thanks.

25
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,642
Thanks so much, man, for the invitation
to come and give the talk.

26
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,277
I mean, we've been trying to get

27
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,611
we've been trying to find an opportunity

28
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,914
to speak together
for a couple of months now.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,082
Well, since I moved to Japan.

30
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,451
So I'm excited to be here,
and I'm excited

31
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,321
to be talking about this topic,
which we're, we're really excited about.

32
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:32,025
It's a new paper that actually Julian
Kiverstein, who's here right now,

33
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:36,329
and myself and Eric Wrightfeld
have a preprint out right now

34
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,766
in the paper titled titled On the Predictive 
Dynamics of Happiness and Wellbeing.

35
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,135
We're also anticipating that

36
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:46,773
Ines Hippolito and Lars Sandved-Smith
will be here this evening.

37
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,743
Lars has had a slight emergency
so he's on the road, but we're hoping

38
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,178
he'll be able to call in

39
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:58,518
because actually the work that we feature
in this paper, it builds on or it's

40
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:02,355
really closely related with the research
that Ines and Lars are doing.

41
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,458
So the idea was
that we're going to be able to get we're

42
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,695
going to be able to really talk to them
about their individual portions.

43
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,097
So hopefully they're on the stream
by the time we hit that place.

44
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,800
And if it turns out that they're not,
that's OK.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,736
We can just go through
and then we can chat at the end.

46
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,572
If you don't know me,
my name is Mark Miller.

47
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,809
I'm an assistant professor
at the University of Hokkaido

48
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,513
in their Center
for Human Nature, Artificial Intelligence

49
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:31,184
and Neuroscience
and I am an active inference researcher.

50
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,587
Right. So

51
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,322
let's see

52
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:38,591
right.

53
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:43,930
So I guess probably lots of people
who are listening to the stream tonight

54
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,832
and definitely
the guests who are here right now.

55
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,268
Hayden is great. You read it right on.

56
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,604
I know that recently

57
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:55,775
there's been a huge amount of research
coming out that's linking

58
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,510
using the active inference

59
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,781
framework in order to investigate
all sorts of psycho pathologies,

60
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,652
you know, mostly finding a home
in computational psychiatry circles,

61
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,521
but really where we're seeing active
inference accounts come up,

62
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:13,860
you know, relating to depression
and addiction and OCD and schizophrenia.

63
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:17,030
And so there's some sleep disorders
and all sorts.

64
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:23,403
And well, there is this sort of active
inference boom right now in relationship

65
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,840
to computational psychiatry
and in particular psychopathology.

66
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,978
We're not seeing any
we're really talking about

67
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,549
how we might apply active inference
frameworks to the theoretical

68
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,819
and formal approach
of discussing things like well-being.

69
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,455
So, you know, all those topics
that would naturally fit in

70
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:46,226
something like a positive psychology
are still primarily being overlooked.

71
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,293
Although, you know,

72
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,262
in all fairness, we are

73
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,298
starting to see it come up at the edges
because we're starting to see people talk

74
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:57,070
about the benefits of hallucinogens
and also the benefits of meditation.

75
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,340
So that was part of our motivation
in writing this paper, was to see

76
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,543
if there was anything interesting
to say in a positive account yet,

77
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,412
not just the negative account,
but the positive account.

78
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,349
The other reason why we decided to write
this paper was because

79
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,419
actually Julian and Eric
and I have written a series of papers now

80
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,990
on psychopaths allergies, in particular
using the Active Inference Framework.

81
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,760
So we have papers now on depression
and mood disorders and addiction

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,929
and depersonalization and OCD,

83
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,232
and we started to see that
there were some shared characteristics

84
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:30,103
between these various psychopathology is
if you look at them through the sort of

85
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,806
computational lens of active inference
and seeing

86
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,409
those shared characteristics

87
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:41,180
sort of started providing,
we think, clues about,

88
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:46,953
you know, what might be going right
when a human is happy, healthy and well.

89
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,090
And that's what our paper is about
and that's what this stream

90
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,191
will be about as well.

91
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:56,296
Looking a little bit more at what
some of the predictive dynamics might be

92
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,497
that are underlying

93
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,867
subjective
happiness and overall well-being.

94
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,702
And of course, it's a big topic.

95
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:07,240
So we're not trying to exhaust
you know, we're not trying to exhaust

96
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,311
the whole of what wellbeing would be, but
rather just taking a sort of first step

97
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,647
to see if we can work out some of that,
some of the points

98
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,015
that might be interesting.

99
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,352
So since I have these lovely people here
tonight with me,

100
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,289
I've decided to make my presentation
relatively short I hope it

101
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,392
won't be any more than sort of 30 minutes
all said and done.

102
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,696
I'm going to pitch it
at a relatively high level of abstraction

103
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,266
because I think there's like
a number of nice moves I'd like to give

104
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:38,638
to the audience here tonight to sort of
provoke research and provoke some ideas.

105
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,607
And if you're interested
more in the nitty gritty

106
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,777
we have the paper out in pre-print,
so you're, you're more than welcome to go

107
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,845
and actually check out the paper.

108
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,382
And, and of course, if any questions come
up, we can talk about that as well.

109
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,218
Great. OK, so

110
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,321
so I think

111
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:59,192
a sort of natural place
to start thinking about the relationship

112
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,662
between active inference and well-being
is to think about optimality

113
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:08,267
in cognitive neuroscience and psychology
today, wellbeing is often spoke of

114
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,270
as a form of optimal
psychological functioning.

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,674
But what exactly optimal means

116
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:19,112
is not very well explained usually,
or at least it's underdeveloped.

117
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,049
And of course as a free energy

118
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,652
principle and active inference
framework researcher.

119
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:30,022
When you look at that, you
the first thing I thought was, well,

120
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,659
there's a natural way to sort of
be thinking about optimal lity

121
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,964
in terms of the active inference
framework for energy minimization

122
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,668
over the long run approximates
optimal vision inference, right?

123
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:47,240
That is sort of Bayesian inference
is a form of optimal belief updating.

124
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,244
So that fact in some way
already gives us,

125
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,746
you know,
it gives the free energy principle

126
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,649
and the active inference framework,
you might think a sort of normativity

127
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:02,388
already, you know, predictive systems
tend to create or strive towards

128
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,892
an optimal set between their phenotypic
self-organization

129
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,295
and the sort of statistical regularities
that they encounter

130
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,797
in their environments.

131
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,300
So we think that an important part
of well-being

132
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,570
from this perspective
is going to have something to do

133
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,007
with being a good predictor
of the sort of hidden causes.

134
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,577
So that's both in the environment
and inside the agent

135
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,313
of the sort of sensory states
that we tend to encounter.

136
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,718
And of course, that crucially relies
on our being able to optimally update

137
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:37,356
our generative model in ways that are
life sustaining and flourishing inducing.

138
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,194
And I don't
think that that's an incredible stretch.

139
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,863
Just as an opening gambit

140
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:48,100
you know, we know that well-being
is closely related with health in various

141
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,537
various layers of health,
you know, mental health and emotional

142
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:56,142
health and physical health and on good
predictors, they tend to self-organize

143
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,646
in ways that allow them to maintain hope
homeostasis across various contexts.

144
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,182
And over the long term.

145
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:03,783
Right.

146
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:08,321
So, oh,
and you know, and sort of best of all,

147
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,656
if we think along these lines,
which I think

148
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,126
could be fruitful lines to think along
than we have at our disposal,

149
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,563
as lots of the listeners today
already know,

150
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:22,001
this sort of ever evolving
and ever growing mathematical suite

151
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,405
to help us describe what is a good model,
what's a good model all about.

152
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,773
So that's our starting point.

153
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,644
Our starting point was to think, well,
maybe wellbeing could be discussed

154
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,313
broadly as a kind of optimal updating.

155
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,882
Yeah, and the goodness,

156
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,418
the goodness of the generative model
that the agent uses to form beliefs

157
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:44,090
and control their actions in life
sustaining ways over the long term.

158
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,361
OK, so that's a good start

159
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,430
and I think it fits very nicely

160
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,967
with what we already know about
lots of psychopathology in particular.

161
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,905
That psychopathology is are characterized
by suboptimal beliefs

162
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,675
and the sorts of behaviors
that come from having suboptimal beliefs.

163
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,677
Depression is a good example.

164
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,379
It's just one out of a hat though,
really.

165
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,513
I think if you look at any

166
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:11,117
psychopathology, you're going to find
some sort of bad belief is at play.

167
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,785
At some level of the hierarchy.

168
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,654
I think depression is a nice example.

169
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,390
You know, recent accounts of depression
and not just from the active

170
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,627
inference camp are highlighting
the role that rigid beliefs

171
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,565
about one's inability
to manage the complexities of their life,

172
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,101
including especially
the social complexities of their life,

173
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,171
is playing a major role
in depressive symptoms.

174
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,008
And we've written a paper
on this pretty recently,

175
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:40,212
and in that paper we are using the active
inference framework.

176
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:45,051
We argued that when an agent is met
with enough persistent volatility,

177
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:50,690
then they can eventually develop
a high level prior about their own hype.

178
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:55,728
High level prior belief about their own
inability to manage volatility.

179
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,764
And when you get that high level prior

180
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,834
installed,
something pretty nasty can happen, right?

181
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,237
The system, a predictive system
then starts selectively

182
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,441
sampling the world
to try to confirm that hypothesis.

183
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,711
And in fact that down regulates
any sort of counter-evidence

184
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,214
that goes against that deep prior,
that deep pathological prior.

185
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,750
So so that even when the situation
changes, you know,

186
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,754
if the agent finds themselves
in more positively predictable

187
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:26,258
situations, they tend to hold on
to that belief in volatility.

188
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,495
And that's really about what we think
is that pathological moment

189
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,632
so another way of saying that
is that an agent,

190
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,769
at least a depressive agent,
has become overly confident

191
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,473
that it is uncertain, it's overly
confident about being uncertain.

192
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:40,706
Right.

193
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,041
The only people who've said that

194
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,410
Clarkin colleagues
have written a fantastic paper,

195
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,212
definitely check it out
if you don't know it.

196
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,849
And in that they come to the same
conclusions they write in this sense,

197
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,919
we might conjecture that major depression
occurs when the brain is certain

198
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,155
that it will encounter
an uncertain environment.

199
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,225
OK, and

200
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,762
as we all know, you know,
due to the central role that prediction

201
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,532
plays in sculpting our experience
and directing our behaviors, of course,

202
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,535
as soon as we have a high level bias
like this installed,

203
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,407
then it has tremendous power to produce
exactly the outcomes

204
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,943
that would
that would confirm those biases.

205
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,279
It's one of the problems
of being a predictive agent.

206
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,982
You know, the predictive system
is really good for lots of things.

207
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,285
But one of the problems is there's this
sort of deep self-fulfilling prophecy

208
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,721
that can occur OK?

209
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,760
The rigidity of these bad beliefs
is especially important here.

210
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,863
And it comes up again when we start
thinking about what well-being might be.

211
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,767
You know, there's mounting evidence
that cognitive rigidity,

212
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,537
you know, the sort of stickiness
of bad beliefs

213
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,841
that there are basic feature of
psychopathology is and in fact, you know,

214
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,142
some people are even saying

215
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,145
that it might be the root cause
of all psychopathology.

216
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,614
And I don't think we disagree.

217
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,551
There's a nice essay on article
about this if you

218
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,286
if you're interested in that point.

219
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,856
And I think I might just take a
take a little break there

220
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:08,994
and hand it over to a nurse and nurse,
have Alito has a really just a fantastic

221
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:13,532
forthcoming paper coming out that
everyone should be excited to be reading,

222
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:18,304
which offers a really beautiful
computationally rich account

223
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,640
of how insulated internal states.

224
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,141
Yeah.

225
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,212
When these bad beliefs sort of get stuck
and then they resist updating

226
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:30,182
how that creates
the sorts of pathological belief

227
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,152
systems, the pathological behaviors
that we see in psychopathology.

228
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,155
So if it's OK
and I'm just going to stop share

229
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,425
and let you maybe talk a little bit
about insulated bad beliefs

230
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,927
and then I'll pick it up from here
and keep going on to wellbeing.

231
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:42,962
Is that OK?

232
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,865
Yes, sure.

233
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,532
Hi, everyone.

234
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,068
Can you hear me and Siri?

235
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,102
Yeah, OK, great.

236
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,506
So first of all, thanks so much
for a lark for inviting me to be here.

237
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,809
And it's always such a pleasure
to be here with Daniel

238
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,911
for this wonderful session.

239
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,982
And hi Julian,
very nice to see you as well.

240
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,818
So I'll just now share my screen

241
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,654
if I think that's possible.

242
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,188
Yeah,

243
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,191
and I see.

244
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:16,195
That.

245
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,303
OK, so for some reason

246
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,772
I'm not able to share my screen.

247
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,243
I think it should

248
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,678
maybe try again.

249
00:13:46,091 --> 00:14:05,411
To. No,

250
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,746
it doesn't go through for some reason.

251
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:09,582
Strange.

252
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,382
It works for me.

253
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,250
Fine.

254
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,187
Yeah.

255
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,488
I mean,

256
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,727
I have no idea.

257
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,569
We could go for a

258
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,106
an audio thought
or you can try to share it.

259
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,407
Later.

260
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,910
Let me just leave and come back
if that's OK.

261
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,812
Maybe that's good. You know, the trick.

262
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,884
Is this is this
is the new world of technology, isn't it?

263
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,652
You have to do everything on the fly.

264
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,721
You have to do everything on the fly
and be willing to adapt.

265
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,358
I have one interim question.

266
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,226
Yeah, please. Yeah, I hit it.

267
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,897
Were you working on active inference
or interested in those approaches?

268
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,400
It then came to be studying
psycho pathology

269
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,470
or just wellbeing more broadly,
or was it the other direction?

270
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,572
Like which way did you go
this intersection from?

271
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,207
Yeah, you're right.

272
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,542
And it started the other way around.

273
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:15,581
So in my master's
in which Julian was my advisor

274
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,417
at the University of Edinburgh in 2010,

275
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,956
the last chapter of my senior
thesis was a proposal.

276
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,659
So I was working on empathy, looking at,

277
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,194
you know,
philosophy and cognitive science

278
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:32,364
of empathy, looking at dynamics systems,
theories of emotion.

279
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,334
The last chapter was on predictive
processing and active inference.

280
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:40,072
And then I got to do my PhD with Andy
Clarke, specifically on active inference,

281
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,875
and then it grew out of doing that
into psychopathology.

282
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,977
Yeah, we got it very good.

283
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:50,115
Because we got some technical
difficulties, but we are now good.

284
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,283
OK, all right.

285
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,518
You can see it fine. Yep.

286
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,319
Yep. Nice work.

287
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,520
Thanks. In this continue.

288
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,189
Effect. OK, so all right.

289
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,059
So yeah, so this work is on the

290
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,262
what we call psychotic blankets.

291
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:08,000
And this is something that I've been
working on for the last few months

292
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,904
with two different groups
applying this to different

293
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,206
two different things.

294
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,410
So one specifically schizophrenia
specifically, and the other one is

295
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,414
this embodiment
so what I thought I would do here today

296
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,185
be to do sort of like a combination
between the two

297
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:30,422
so that to get a bigger picture
of what we have in mind

298
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,059
with, with,
with applying this particular framework.

299
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,563
So yeah. So

300
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:43,002
let me just give some like framing
about where this comes from

301
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,838
and why I'm motivated to a little bit.

302
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:49,742
So we always depart from this concept

303
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,411
that Mark also just mentioned
and self-organization,

304
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,547
which is super relevant to these things
that we are talking about

305
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:59,084
when we refer to wellbeing
and mental health and all of that.

306
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,321
And as a few words about that

307
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:08,027
and emergence of order from disorder
and specifically without any intervention

308
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,897
from the external intervention
that is external to the system.

309
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,166
And then

310
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,269
what is important for us
is to think of self-organization

311
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:22,374
as a pattern or an arrangement
that gives rise to a specific way

312
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,978
in which the system is self producing
and self distinguishing.

313
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,580
And here
and not to the in activist literature

314
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,052
so but the idea here
that the fundamental concept

315
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,121
is in self-organizing part
and that comes up

316
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,061
this is why,
why are we talking about that?

317
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:47,599
Because we want to look at how
the systems or the organisms as a whole

318
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,804
are interacting with environment
in a way that has been called

319
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,540
in embodied literature
as attunement with the environment.

320
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,307
Right?

321
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,843
So the idea there is that

322
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,513
these organisms are
that systems are attuned with environment

323
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,485
and in a way that they will show
a certain specific part

324
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,789
and part of the arrangement
that will be distinct

325
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:14,927
from, for example, systems
that are not attuned to the environment.

326
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,197
And this is very well known in the whole

327
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,400
bulk of literature,
this embodiment and phenomenology.

328
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,170
So the idea that we want to pursue

329
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,475
here is actually relating to a little bit
to complex systems theory

330
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:34,546
in which we want to say that
this differentiation between embodiment

331
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:38,584
in this environment or different patterns
it doesn't mean that the system

332
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:43,355
that's a system
that is not adjusted to the environment

333
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:47,626
should be considered disordered,
but instead that it has a different

334
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,129
kind of order. Right.

335
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,432
So here would be sort of
like rejecting a little bit

336
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,668
the competition
with the pounds of psychopathology

337
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:01,740
as simply a disorder or a disorder or
an illness and opening up a little bit of

338
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,310
not more like broad scope or a spectrum

339
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,779
of to talk about mental health.

340
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,851
So then if we set up things like that,
then what needs to be explained

341
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:17,189
is how these sulfonamides
behavior of situated organisms

342
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,726
come to be altered in a certain way
rather than another.

343
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,396
And then it will be now
talking about mental health.

344
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,066
So then we think that

345
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,203
active inference is a very interesting

346
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,606
and useful tool precisely to think

347
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:39,678
about these self-organization,
the patterns that come from self

348
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,580
optimization.

349
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,584
We think about active inference
as a model of how

350
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,621
living things adjust to the environment
and we all know what active inference is.

351
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:53,792
So just to highlight what is relevant
here for us in terms of pattern dynamics

352
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,096
we think that it is a nice model

353
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,435
that when associated with tools
such as linkage or normalization group,

354
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,973
it can be applied to many different
scales of self-organizing activity.

355
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,608
And that's where we find

356
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,245
all of these patterns of our interest,
of our scientific interest.

357
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,381
So it is useful to explain these gradient

358
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:20,552
spectrums of kinds of bottoms of order
in self-organizing systems.

359
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,254
Let's just let you decide, you

360
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,025
say we take it as a model in this case.

361
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:31,964
So it means that we have not committing
to the to the realist view of the facts.

362
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:36,468
Let's say that the phenomenon studied
conducting ontological process

363
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:40,672
or leverages the conceptual tool,
but that the tool is really important

364
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,543
and useful for us to understand
such an phenomenon in this case

365
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:48,614
particular what you want to understand
is this embodiment,

366
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:50,582
right?

367
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,417
So we all know active inference.

368
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,154
But again, let me just highlight
just some important points

369
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,691
to understand
benzos, psychotic blankets later on.

370
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,162
So here are the ideas
that self-organizing

371
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:09,201
self producing, self distinguishing
system correspond to the internal states

372
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:14,306
which affect and which affect and affect
and are affected by the environment.

373
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,742
And external state

374
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:21,847
via a set of other states such
as the active and the sensory states.

375
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,385
Active and sensory states
are then constructed as influencing one

376
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:30,422
another, giving rise to a certain part,
and of self-organization.

377
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,658
And this is what's going to be relevant
for later on.

378
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,429
So in a way, what we want to say
is that, well, not just a system

379
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:42,234
that self-organize is a system
that minimizes the free energy,

380
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:46,338
which we all know can also be
in this uncertainty or entropy and so on.

381
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:46,872
Right.

382
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,542
But in a justice system
would be something like that, a system

383
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,912
that is just well adjusted
to its environment and for technicalities

384
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,615
obviously there are references
on the bottom.

385
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,387
Now, moving on to this embodiment
and then later on applying

386
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,891
want to apply these active inference
strategy

387
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:11,129
to further highlight or understand
what is going on with this embodiment.

388
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:12,931
Just a

389
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,767
few words about this embodiment
literature.

390
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,939
So the idea is
that comes from phenomenology

391
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,176
and the little bit from existentialist
philosophy and the idea is that

392
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:28,347
the primary experience of the body
is the body experience as such.

393
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,716
And this is really crucial

394
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,585
The thing is that this experience of

395
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:37,356
the body of subject can be lost,
and in which case

396
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:42,227
the body is inspected as an object
more like outside of scientific interest.

397
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:45,630
And here is what the literature says,
and that's

398
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,901
when this embodiment comes up
is on the body all the sudden ceases

399
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:54,139
to be experienced as a subject
and is now inspected as an object.

400
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,378
So what happens is in exploring and
interacting with the local environment,

401
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:03,248
we usually typically with an
not tend to our body.

402
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,318
We just take it for granted
that our body allows us

403
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,688
access, move around, interact,
explore the world.

404
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:14,926
So what we and it is
not until we cannot do these things or

405
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:19,765
something is wrong, that we will direct
our awareness towards the body

406
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:23,702
and then the body becomes salient
as an object of inquiry.

407
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,740
And it's right here at this point
where we find these embodiment.

408
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,845
It's when we cannot explore or interact
to the world as one would like.

409
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,482
So in a way, we can

410
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,551
distinguish embodiment in this embodiment

411
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:43,188
by saying, for example,
or just highlighting features.

412
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:43,588
Of course,

413
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,891
the literature is vast,
but I think that these are the ones

414
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,726
that work for us here.

415
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:51,963
Embodiment is an attunement
with the environment that is allowed

416
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:55,567
or enabled by having an experience of
the body is a subject

417
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,372
and that gets us attuned
to the environment

418
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:04,276
through a bodily self awareness
or something that is embodied

419
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:10,315
self awareness that is that is felt,
and there's embodiment on the other

420
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:14,586
hand is a visit to the environment
because it is a loss of the body.

421
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,155
As a subject body becomes an object,

422
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:21,460
there's a disappointment
and a diminished body awareness.

423
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,164
So this comes from the literature
and it is interesting for us here. Why?

424
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:30,101
Because then there's been
this links that have been made

425
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,139
between psychopathology and psychedelics
and this embodiment

426
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,810
as in this embodiment being something
that is reported in different

427
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:44,850
psychopathology such as vignette
personalization, even major depression

428
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,221
or other psychopathology
that involved rumination.

429
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:54,726
And another very important thing
is that this embodiment also cures

430
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,263
and these disorders reported in the in
psychedelics intake

431
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,702
and this has been even more relevant
to studying these embodiments

432
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,839
precisely in the psychedelic renaissance
that we are witnessing today.

433
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:11,743
And also another point that I want
to make just here, so in brackets

434
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:16,982
is just that this embodiment does not
necessarily need to be a bad thing

435
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,785
we usually put things in good or bad,

436
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:25,056
right or wrong, but it doesn't need
to be a bad thing because if we do get

437
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:30,295
some sort of physical effects
positive effects from psychedelics,

438
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:34,199
this precisely by having these
these embodied experience.

439
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:38,970
So it's just a different way
of interacting with the world.

440
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,375
And that's why we want to pursue
less of a disorder way.

441
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:44,543
And much more often

442
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:49,047
there's a spectrum of different path
turns off interaction with the world.

443
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,483
Right. OK, so just that not

444
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,121
then I want to look at this embodiment

445
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,424
and how we can use active inference

446
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,661
to understand
this embodiment in two ways.

447
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,363
One is the cycle,
the psychology of this embodiment.

448
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,667
So how that's the one that is felt
psychologically

449
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:12,604
and the other one
is the neurobiology of this embodiment.

450
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:17,275
So as we have said, this embodiment
is the loss of the body as a subject

451
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,412
which is replaced by

452
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,014
some formal intellectual effort.

453
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:27,419
So imagine that you now don't
have these broadly access to the world.

454
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,022
That is not possible
because that's exactly what is lost

455
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:35,427
by psychopathology or psychedelics intake
and many other things.

456
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,762
Right so then

457
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,800
try to cope and compensate
by literally engaging

458
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,469
in making inferences
about the state of affairs.

459
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,839
So here we could use a little bit
of literature and sophisticated

460
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,840
affective inference,

461
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,878
which is conscious reasoning and planning
and policy selection that you engage

462
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:57,849
now with having loss these access
to the world through the body.

463
00:26:59,284 --> 00:26:59,884
Now our

464
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:03,655
hypothesis is that the issue
is that in this disembodied

465
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:07,258
because we all engage in
sophisticated activity, that's all fine.

466
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,997
The difficulty is that in the case
of this embodiment

467
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:18,303
experience, these inference is insulated,
is isolated,

468
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,140
because what has been lost
is the access to the world

469
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,478
so then what happens is

470
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,148
so we will have something
that looks like this.

471
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,618
So we all know this is skin here, right?

472
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,489
And what we want to say
is that what is lost

473
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,259
now is the influences

474
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,362
between sensory and active states
and let me guide you through it.

475
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,833
So let's just
focus on the figure for now.

476
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,570
So we have internal states
as being disembodied reasoning.

477
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,507
So as subject that has lost this axis

478
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,910
of bodily access to the world
because it is not health as a subject.

479
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:03,014
So we've got this disembodied
reasoning as internal states.

480
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,351
Then we have external states
as the environment with that

481
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:09,320
that the subject
wants to explore and interact with.

482
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:14,626
And then we have a sensory state
the environmental constraints,

483
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,129
so these aspects
that should influence the subject.

484
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:22,634
And then as active states,
we have the effectivity

485
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:26,538
and the ways
in which the subject can affect

486
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,841
and benefit
and be affected by the environment.

487
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,812
But what has been lost here is

488
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,181
that there is

489
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:39,451
an imbalance between sensory
and active state.

490
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,887
So for one active states

491
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,357
are not sensitive
to sensory state, right?

492
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:49,761
So it is these effectivity
of this possibility

493
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,732
of being affected by the environment
that is not possible. Why?

494
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,635
Because the access to the body
as a subject

495
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:01,372
has been lost in this psychopathology
or psychedelics

496
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,509
as that label,
as this embodiment experience.

497
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:09,314
So as a coping mechanism,
what is going to happen

498
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:14,152
is there will be an increase of activity
of the activity of active states

499
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:18,123
by increasing the issuing of inferences
about the world.

500
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,092
So I do not understand

501
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,761
what is going on,

502
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,730
but I'm going to continue
to think about it and make

503
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,100
and develop theories
about what is going on.

504
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,104
The problem is that we can't
we all engage in these

505
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,739
developing theories and inferences

506
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,642
about what we think is the likelihood
of the state of affairs.

507
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,012
The situation here in this embodiment
just that

508
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,581
these inferences are disembodied,

509
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,518
so they tend to be false beliefs,

510
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:51,222
and that's because of the insulation
of eternal state.

511
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:52,924
What does this mean?

512
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,593
This means that that is not so.

513
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,632
The access that we have to
the world through our lives will be

514
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,400
is what is lost.

515
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,271
So then subject in a situation
where your only hope

516
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,240
is to increase in increased active state,

517
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:13,278
to make more inferences
about the world, to cope with death loss,

518
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,648
and then tendency is to have false
beliefs.

519
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:21,152
That's when we start entering the realm
of psychopathology and psychosis

520
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,255
so in these

521
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:28,059
disembodied cases,
this is actually a very important point

522
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:31,329
because one could say, OK,
so then the problem is the reason.

523
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,297
The level of reason

524
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:35,700
is on the level of, for example, state
terminal states, as we have set up here.

525
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,636
Now, the problem is not on the level
of internal states.

526
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:39,904
Reasoning is fine.

527
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:44,442
The inference mechanisms are working
perfect they find the subject can engage

528
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,078
in reason.

529
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,247
It can make you princess.

530
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,083
The problem is inside the blanket

531
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,887
the problem is in the unbalance
that there is between

532
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,923
active and sensory states
because those are the ones

533
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:02,327
that are supposed to directly influence
one another.

534
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:07,232
Such that indirectly there's a connection
between internal and external state.

535
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,501
But it is these direct influence

536
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:14,539
between sensory and active states
that is problematic.

537
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,875
They are not communicating well.

538
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:22,113
They're not influencing themselves
or each other in a balanced way.

539
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,515
In a sense,

540
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:28,019
and balancing the sense
that active states become super active

541
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,556
and sensory states cannot influence
active state

542
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,560
so then what we get,
we get to this idea of a psychotic

543
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,564
Markov linkage, which is if
we have this sort of arrangement

544
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,999
where there's a problem between

545
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,602
the balance of the strength of influences
between sensory and active state,

546
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:49,040
then we have a problem of the generation
of false beliefs.

547
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,710
The problem
being that these beliefs that are issued

548
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,813
by active states,
they cannot be updated by the world

549
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,350
because it is precisely this access
to the world that has been lost,

550
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,854
lost by virtue of having lost

551
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:06,157
the body as a subject

552
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,792
so then

553
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,398
because of these these attunement
that we can actually explain

554
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,434
as what is occurring inside the blanket

555
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,471
the reasoning subject makes inference
about entrances about world.

556
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:25,777
But these reasoning, of course, from
within the lack of experience of the body

557
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,446
as a subject
so it occurs in a selective manner.

558
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,115
And this is consistent actually

559
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:35,119
with a longstanding
literature and criminology of psychosis

560
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,523
where the subject and a

561
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:42,293
bunch of literature on psychosis
linked to solipsistic behavior

562
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:47,999
like shifting drawing and painting
and also the philosophical idea,

563
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:52,203
which is the philosophical idea
that only one's mind is short to exist.

564
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,842
And then some, some reports
I find quite interesting.

565
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:01,212
So some patients will report
I was no longer

566
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,815
sure that I was still the same person.

567
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:08,553
I became one with other creatures
or objects.

568
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,888
I lost the sense of my own boundaries.

569
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:15,126
When I have an experience
I often did not know which was mine.

570
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,261
Or the experience of someone else.

571
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,399
So it is quite interesting
what can be lost

572
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:27,205
when we lose these body as a subject
as it is developed in phenomenology.

573
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,975
This also happens a little bit
in the personalization disorder,

574
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:36,914
for example, showing this is important,
which is to invent when making people

575
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:41,252
feel estranged and detached
from their self, body and the world

576
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,590
OK, so this is all I have on

577
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,494
this and on the psychology
of this embodiment, and I would like

578
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,364
to turn to the neurobiology
and also in dance, apply

579
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,934
the same framework
now to the neurobiology of of

580
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,571
line neurobiologists.

581
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:05,343
So we think that applying
the same reasoning is consistent.

582
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:09,514
So this attunement that you were talking
about felt at agent level

583
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,717
should also be expected
that the neural neurological states.

584
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,153
So that's our hypothesis.

585
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:18,723
So I think that's what our two places are
two good candidates

586
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:21,993
for perception
and interception will be good candidates

587
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,797
so proprioception as a system underlying
movement and location of the body of

588
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,099
the environment as well as interception

589
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,601
as the system responsible
for homeostasis.

590
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,472
These are good candidates
we think for the neurobiology biology

591
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:38,376
of this general is a treatment
that is felt in this embodiment

592
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,781
so focus
active and interest, active systems

593
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:48,753
just like any situated organism can be
conceived this self-organizing system.

594
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:52,623
So we apply exactly the same principle
as we would apply to

595
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,259
the agent as a self-organizing system.

596
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,397
So the question then that we have is
what is the factor

597
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,568
that is at the basis of this
of a neuro biological pattern

598
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,804
underlying proprioception
and interception that will show

599
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:11,642
these maladjustment to the environment
so if we expect

600
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:15,113
the same sort of mechanism
or organization

601
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,219
or dynamics as to the heel of agent
and that we were just talking about, then

602
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,022
how are we going to find this out as well
in the neurobiology?

603
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,660
So we think that just like
in psychological experience, of this

604
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,364
embodiment where the agent becomes
insolated from the world,

605
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:38,336
and in this case we say
by virtue of losing the body is subject,

606
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,739
the answer will reside
in biological isolation

607
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,443
now I'm going to focus now on

608
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,646
interception because I don't have time
to also cover proprioception.

609
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,885
And I think that this does give us here
some very, very cool insights so

610
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,889
I'm going to focus now on the work

611
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:02,460
brought by Barrett and Siemens on these
receptive connections in the brain.

612
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,696
And they have a very cold model
which they call embodied

613
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,698
predictive interception coding model.

614
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:12,470
And the goal
there is to integrate an anatomical model

615
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,842
of course, cortical connections
with active inference principles,

616
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:22,580
and they propose a very cool thing,
which is that to a granular, visceral

617
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,783
motor cortices contribute to interception

618
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,352
by issuing interception predictions.

619
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,557
So more specifically,
what they want to say is that

620
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:38,029
the granular limbic regions that regulate
visceral motor of the body's

621
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:42,166
internal milieu, that is the visceral
motor cortex is less.

622
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:46,003
So this is their focus
and where they think they will find

623
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:49,740
the intercept system
and where they apply the model.

624
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:53,144
Now, so you can see the a

625
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,247
granular cortex here on the left.

626
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,382
And one very interesting thing
that I'm just going

627
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,751
to draw your attention to
and then if you feel

628
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:05,056
that you'd like to really super
interesting paper, then please go for it.

629
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,159
But I just want to draw your attention
to the fact that on the left side

630
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,027
you have the cortex.

631
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:14,365
And there's one thing that is missing
from the granular cortex as opposed

632
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:18,069
to the these granular and the granular
of course is says.

633
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,672
So what is missing is the layer four.

634
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,442
And what happens with that
is that there won't be

635
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,645
you cannot see there
any connection neurons.

636
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:32,817
So that's pretty cool
because that will give us an idea

637
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:36,287
that there is no connection
or neurons in the eight granular cortex.

638
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:38,856
So just

639
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,158
I'm just going to leave that out there

640
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:45,930
and just moving forward
to just like understanding

641
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,200
the third piece
of the predictive intercept

642
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,569
model,

643
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,939
they claim
that there is an intercept of the brain

644
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:58,943
in which a granular core
to send visceral motor

645
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,380
predictions to the body
and transmit intercept to predictions

646
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,651
about the visceral sensory
consequences of those predictions.

647
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:11,355
So they'll tell us that
the granular, visceral motor cortex

648
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:15,226
is estimate the balance
between the autonomic,

649
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:19,864
metabolic and immunological resources
that are available to the body

650
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:24,302
and the predictive requirements
of the body based on past experience.

651
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:25,469
Right.

652
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,039
So this is going to be very important
for us

653
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:32,243
because a chronic imbalance

654
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,313
on those things that I was just
mentioning can be

655
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,616
which can be caused by constantly
predicting the need

656
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:42,286
for more metabolic energy
to meet the demands or stressors,

657
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,157
can produce the well known depression
related disruption.

658
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,393
And it can also eventually down regulate

659
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:54,598
down regulation of hypothalamus or

660
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,968
oxygen's negative feedback loops

661
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,838
resulting in chronic hyper cortisol

662
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,975
and in turn can also promote
pro-inflammatory state.

663
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,012
So this is like some of the problems
of having

664
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:13,484
an imbalance
on the level of the autonomic metabolic

665
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:17,755
and logical resources,
which is what's the intercept of system

666
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,492
should be able to do is to keep
those steps nice balance, right?

667
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,762
So then applying exactly the same,

668
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,865
the same framework, the same model

669
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,369
that we apply to the whole body,

670
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,605
this embodiment of the generalized
female, this embodiment

671
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:38,342
that is vastly described
in the phenomenology literature

672
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,846
applying system to neurobiology
of central receptive system,

673
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:46,784
then what we get is something that can be
seemed as like quite similar

674
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,388
an imbalance
between sensory and active state.

675
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,124
So let me just go through the figures.

676
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,993
So here in this
figure, internal states are

677
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:57,228
or are

678
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,031
correspond to the receptive system
and the external environment,

679
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:05,236
whichever the multi scale systems,
the receptive system is part of.

680
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:10,040
And then we have active states
is that a granular Portis Scorsese's

681
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:15,312
that send visceral motor predictions
and then we have center stage status,

682
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:19,417
the requirements of the body
given the history that the body knows

683
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,354
to be required for homeostasis.

684
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,724
So then in this sense
Hollywood half is that active

685
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,161
states
are not sensitive to sensory state.

686
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,663
So even though active states can become

687
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:38,135
as a coping mechanism much more active
and send much more predictions

688
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:41,439
about what is going on,
what's the state of affairs

689
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,877
because I'm not receiving any information
from the requirements of the body.

690
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,412
So the sensory states.

691
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:53,017
So what will happen
then because of this installation

692
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,353
is that a false
belief is going to be generated

693
00:40:56,921 --> 00:41:00,791
so this will correspond
to constantly prediction

694
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:05,162
of the needs for more metabolic energy
to meet the demands of the stresses.

695
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:10,868
So in the sense we have here another case
of what we call a psychotic Markov

696
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:14,071
Blanca twice it's psychotic
because it delivers.

697
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,508
If there is this lack or because
imbalance between sensory states

698
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,845
are the thing, for instance,
between sensory states and active states,

699
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:25,149
then what we should
expect is a generation of a false belief.

700
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,052
And they can also expect
that at a nearby logical level,

701
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:31,055
which is also supported
by empirical evidence.

702
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:35,259
So this is what I want to say,
just thinking

703
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:39,263
I'm thinking of these collaborators here
that I've been thinking about

704
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,432
and guiding me
through as well. These ideas

705
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:48,005
thank
you for this really interesting stuff.

706
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:52,142
So I guess we'll return to Mark
and then anybody.

707
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:57,181
Yep. Anyone's free to ask a question
in live chat and I'm writing things down

708
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:01,218
and then after this second piece of
the presentation will have a discussion.

709
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,954
So thanks again. Go for it, Mark.

710
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,155
Yeah, that was great.

711
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,591
Thank you so much. Wow,
it's so interesting.

712
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,227
And I haven't heard some of your stuff
about this embodiment yet.

713
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,831
And you know, also this is a research
program that I'm extremely interested in.

714
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,834
So I'll be picking your brain
at the end of the Q&A.

715
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,203
And also after after this event,

716
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:25,142
what might what wasn't made obvious in
and as this talk, but I think is implied,

717
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:29,680
is that the stickiness,
the stickiness of these belief systems

718
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,217
and what's helping them
become insulated is a story

719
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,587
about how precision is being estimated
and how precision is being deployed.

720
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:41,225
That's surely one of the mechanisms
that is creating an imbalance

721
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,561
between active and sensory states.

722
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,830
So, you know, how precision is estimated
is really

723
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,767
the agent's ability to assess
the uncertainty of its own priors.

724
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,903
And when that's working right then

725
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,006
those estimation should results
inappropriate model updating.

726
00:42:56,206 --> 00:43:00,210
You know, you shouldn't get stuck in an
insulated in an insulated situation,

727
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,213
but rather you should know, well,
that's not working out the right way.

728
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,950
And so appropriate updating should occur.

729
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:11,822
And we know that like maladaptive
precision estimation is disastrous.

730
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:12,389
Right.

731
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,192
And we're seeing it everywhere
in the psychopathology literature today.

732
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,595
You know, schizophrenic delusion is being

733
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,532
characterized
as too little precision on sensory data.

734
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,969
Which is putting this heavy emphasis on
just top down predictions.

735
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,136
And that's why you're seeing the world

736
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:29,039
in a way that isn't being anchored
by what's really happening.

737
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,109
And of course, NASD is a little bit
the flip, right?

738
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:36,480
Too much precision on prediction errors
creates a lot of a lot of volatility

739
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,883
and a lot of difficulty
establishing good high level predictions

740
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:42,252
and as a quick

741
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,389
side note, you know that
the kind of insulated,

742
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:50,027
insulated outcomes
that create these maladaptive

743
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:54,331
self-organizing styles,
they can occur in lots of ways.

744
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,867
Right? So for instance.

745
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,235
Oh, yeah.

746
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,438
So addictive substances is one good way,
right?

747
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:05,743
Addictive substances impact directly
precision estimation machinery, right.

748
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:10,047
In the way that the addictive substance
engages the dopamine system.

749
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,318
So addictive substances
are setting precision outright in a way.

750
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,521
So no wonder they can create
these sort of suboptimal styles.

751
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,392
But societal expectations
do the same sort of thing,

752
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,662
you know, sub optimally
pinning precision on

753
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:28,599
expectations about success, for example,
you know,

754
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,435
so you can have cultural
pinning of precision

755
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,171
that you should achieve
a certain level of success in your life.

756
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,040
And, you know,
we have deep running relationships

757
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,810
between perfectionism and depression,
for example, and again,

758
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,981
for exactly the same reason
that and I said overly high precision

759
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:48,519
on some sort of expectation
would lead to a constant pervasive

760
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,322
background error as you're not hitting
that high level of expectation.

761
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:55,426
And then just like Feldman
Barrett suggests in Simmons,

762
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,697
you have to flip because the system just
doesn't have unlimited resources.

763
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,467
And then the one that I'm most interested
in today actually is social media,

764
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,270
which is turning out
to be a fantastic way

765
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,773
of bending our generative model
into all sorts of shapes

766
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,942
that cause suboptimal outcomes. Right.

767
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:12,976
And that makes sense.

768
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:16,080
It's just giving us wave after wave of

769
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,482
misinformation through

770
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:23,353
filtered images and staged images
and of course, social media platforms.

771
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,788
Some social media platforms

772
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:29,193
function just like addictive substances
or like casinos in a way.

773
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,129
So again,
they're hijacking the precision system

774
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,264
in just the sorts of ways
that cause these problems.

775
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:37,401
OK, I just want to quickly summarize
before I go onto

776
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:41,371
why what I think the natural mechanisms
that keep us out of these problems are so

777
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:46,577
well-being as optimal model generation
importantly depends on correct

778
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,813
and flexible
are not these stuck insulated outcomes

779
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:53,517
but correct inflexible
self estimations of uncertainty.

780
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,953
So that's precision assignments.

781
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,422
So mis assigning
precision to prediction errors,

782
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,725
which can happen in lots of ways,
especially in our in our modern world,

783
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,629
will inevitably lead to suboptimal styles

784
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:09,066
of self-organization, suboptimal
generative models, and with that,

785
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,835
the production of pathological beliefs
and pathological behaviors.

786
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:16,073
And so that's how it can go wrong,
or at least that's the starting point.
