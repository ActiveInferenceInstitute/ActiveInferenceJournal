00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,559
hello everyone and welcome to the active

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,920
inference lab

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,280
today it is august 9th 2021 and we're

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,400
here in guest stream number 8.1

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,600
with mark miller and guests so this is

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,840
going to be an awesome presentation

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
followed by a discussion so if you have

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,920
any questions during the presentation

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
please put them in the live chat and

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,399
we'll make sure to ask the panel at the

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,800
end of the presentation so thanks again

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
to all of our great guests for coming on

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,559
and please take it away thank you

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,320
excellent thanks for that daniel okay

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,719
i'm just going to share my screen

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,440
oh can you uh turn on screen sharing for

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,239
me on your side

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,960
um

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,719
it's under the advanced so at the bottom

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,079
where it says share screen there should

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,760
be a little little arrow and click that

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,199
there should be an advanced feature and

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,680
then should say allow got it

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,959
okay go for it yeah that's it uh-huh

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,960
great how's that can you just see my

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
slide does that look right

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,640
excellent great okay well daniel thanks

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
thanks so much man for the invitation to

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,080
come and give a talk i mean we've been

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
trying to get we've been trying to find

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,759
an opportunity to speak together for you

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,280
know a couple of months now well since i

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,840
moved to japan so i'm excited to be here

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,080
and i'm excited to be talking about this

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,759
topic which we're um we're really

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,680
excited about it's a new paper that

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,439
actually julian kiverstein who's here

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,640
right now and myself and eric reitfeld

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
um have a preprint out right now in the

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,799
the paper title title of predictiveness

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,799
of happiness and well-being we're also

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
anticipating that um inez hippolyto and

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,399
laura sinbad smith will be here this

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,560
evening lars has had a slight emergency

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,640
so um he's on the road but we're hoping

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
he'll be able to call in um because

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,920
actually the work that uh we feature in

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,040
this paper

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
it builds on or it's really closely

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,600
related with the research that anez and

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,840
lars are doing so the idea was that

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,439
we're gonna be able to get um we're

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,960
gonna be able to really talk to them

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
about their individual portions so

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,080
hopefully they're on the stream by the

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
time we hit that place and uh if it

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,680
turns out that they're not that's okay

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,599
we can just go through and then we can

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,239
chat at the end um if you don't know me

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,080
uh my name is mark miller

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,599
i'm an assistant professor at the

62
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,160
university of hokkaido um in their

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
center for human nature artificial

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,040
intelligence and neuroscience and i am

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
uh an active inference researcher

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,640
right so

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
let's see

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,239
um

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,519
right so i guess probably lots of people

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
who are listening to the stream tonight

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,519
and definitely the guests who are here

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
right now hey anez great you made it

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,840
right on

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,239
um know that um recently there's been a

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,879
huge amount of research coming out

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,120
that's linking um using the active

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,640
inference framework in order to

78
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,680
investigate all sorts of

79
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,800
psychopathologies you know mostly

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,560
finding a home in computational

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
psychiatry circles but really we're

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
we're seeing active inference accounts

83
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,200
come up

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,599
you know relating to depression and

85
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
addiction and ocd and schizophrenia and

86
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,560
dissoci dissociative disorders and all

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,599
sorts

88
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,440
and while there is

89
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,400
this sort of active inference boom right

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
now in relationship to computational

91
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,000
psychiatry and

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,640
in particular psychopathology we're not

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,959
seeing any work really

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,920
talking about um how we might apply

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
active inference frameworks to the

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
theoretical and formal approach of

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,400
discussing things like well-being so you

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,599
know all those topics that would

99
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,959
naturally fit in something like a

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,959
positive psychology are still primarily

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,480
being overlooked although you know um in

102
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,920
all fairness we are starting to see it

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,280
come up at the edges because we're

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,040
starting to see people talk about the

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,680
benefits of hallucinogens and also the

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
benefits of meditation so that was part

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
of our motivation in writing this paper

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
was to see if there was anything

109
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,280
interesting to say in a positive account

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
yeah not just the negative account but

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
the positive account

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,920
um but the other reason why we decided

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,000
to write this paper was because

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
actually julian and eric and i have

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,879
written a series of papers now on

116
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,920
psychopathologies in particular using

117
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,199
the active inference framework so we

118
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,519
have papers out now on um depression and

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,798
mood disorders and addiction and

120
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,960
depersonalization and ocd

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
and we started to see that there were

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,960
some shared characteristics between

123
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
these various psychopathologies if you

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
look at them through the sort of

125
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,400
computational lens of active inference

126
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
and seeing those

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,880
shared characteristics

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
sort of started providing

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
we think clues about you know what might

130
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,280
be going right when a human is happy

131
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
healthy and well and that's what our

132
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
paper is about and that's what this

133
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
guest stream will be about as well

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,320
looking a little bit more at what some

135
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
of the predictive dynamics might be that

136
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,600
are underlying um subjective happiness

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,440
and overall well-being and of course

138
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,639
it's a big topic so we're not trying to

139
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,440
exhaust you know and try to exhaust the

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,440
whole of what well-being would be but

141
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
rather just taking a sort of first step

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,759
to see if we can work out some of the

143
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,199
some of the points that might be

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,600
interesting so since i have these lovely

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,400
people here tonight with me um i've

146
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,680
decided to make my presentation

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
relatively short um i hope it won't be

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,120
any more than sort of 30 minutes all

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,919
said and um i'm going to pitch it at a

150
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,680
relatively high level of abstraction

151
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
because i think there's like a number of

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
nice moves i'd like to give to the

153
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
audience here tonight to sort of provoke

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
research and provoke some ideas and um

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
if you're interested more in the nitty

156
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,960
gritty um we have the paper out in

157
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,479
pre-print so you're more than welcome to

158
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,240
go and actually check out the paper and

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,759
of course if any questions come up we

160
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,080
can talk about that as well

161
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,880
great

162
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
okay so

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,360
so i think a sort of natural place to

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
start thinking about the relationship

165
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
between active inference and well-being

166
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,680
is to think about optimality um in

167
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,759
cognitive neuroscience and psychology

168
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,880
today well-being is often spoken of as a

169
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,720
form of optimal psychological

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,160
functioning um but what exactly optimal

171
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,360
means is not very well explained usually

172
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,840
or at least it's

173
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,600
underdeveloped and of course

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
as a free energy

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,919
principle and active inference framework

176
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
researcher when you look at that you the

177
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
first thing i thought was well there's a

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,840
natural way to sort of be thinking about

179
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,759
optimality um in terms of the active

180
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,120
inference framework right free energy

181
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,919
minimization over the long run

182
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,400
approximates optimal asian inference

183
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,479
right that is sort of bayesian inference

184
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
is a form of optimal belief updating so

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,880
um

186
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
that fact in some way already gives us

187
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,080
um

188
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,280
you know it gives the free energy

189
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,479
principle in the active inference

190
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,919
framework you might think a sort of

191
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,080
normativity already you know predictive

192
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,639
systems tend to create or strive towards

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
an optimal fit between their

194
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
phenotypical self-organization and the

195
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,160
sort of statistical regularities that

196
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,880
they encounter in their environments

197
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,840
so

198
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
um we think that an important part of

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,800
well-being

200
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
from this perspective is going to have

201
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,240
something to do with being a good

202
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
predictor of the sort of hidden causes

203
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,120
so that's both in the environment and

204
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,919
inside the agent of the sort of sensory

205
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,919
states that we tend to encounter and of

206
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,039
course that crucially relies on our

207
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,199
being able to optimally update our

208
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,720
generative model in ways that are

209
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,039
life-sustaining and flourishing inducing

210
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,319
and i don't think that that's an

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,319
incredible stretch just as an opening

212
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,879
gamut um you know we know that

213
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,639
well-being is closely related with

214
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,960
health in various um

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
various layers of health you know mental

216
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
health and emotional health and physical

217
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,039
health

218
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,360
and good predictors they tend to

219
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,840
self-organize in ways that allow them to

220
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
maintain homeostasis across various

221
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
contexts and over the long term

222
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,520
right so um oh and you know and sort of

223
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
best of all um if we think along these

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
lines which i think could be fruitful

225
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,440
lines to think along than we have at our

226
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,400
disposal as lots of um the listeners

227
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
today already know this sort of ever

228
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,520
evolving and ever-growing mathematical

229
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,879
suite to help us describe what is a good

230
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,720
model what's a good model all about so

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
that's our starting point our starting

232
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,479
point was to think well maybe well-being

233
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,719
could be discussed broadly

234
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,120
as a kind of optimal updating yeah and

235
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,479
the goodness the goodness of the

236
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,640
generative model that the agent uses to

237
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,760
form beliefs and control their actions

238
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,839
in life-sustaining ways over the long

239
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,760
term

240
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,040
okay so that's a good start

241
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,839
and i think it fits very nicely with

242
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,279
what we already know about lots of

243
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
psychopathologies in particular that

244
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
psychopathologies are characterized by

245
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,839
sub-optimal beliefs and the sorts of

246
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,519
behaviors that come from having

247
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,920
sub-optimal beliefs um depression is a

248
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
good example it's just one out of a hat

249
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,519
though really i think if you look at any

250
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,880
psychopathology you're going to find

251
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,279
some sort of bad belief is at play at

252
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,959
some level of the hierarchy i think

253
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,880
depression is a nice example you know

254
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
recent accounts of depression and not

255
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,880
just from the act of inference camp um

256
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
are highlighting the role that rigid

257
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,160
beliefs about one's inability to manage

258
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,399
the complexities of their life including

259
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
especially the social complexities of

260
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
their life is playing a major role in

261
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,440
depressive symptoms and we've written a

262
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,399
paper on this um pretty recently

263
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
and um in that paper we using the active

264
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,680
inference framework we argued that when

265
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,240
an agent is met with enough persistent

266
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,959
volatility then they can eventually

267
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,440
develop a high level prior

268
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,040
about their own

269
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
high level prior belief

270
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,040
about their own um inability to manage

271
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
volatility and when you get uh that high

272
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,240
level prior installed something

273
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,880
pretty nasty can happen right um the

274
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
system a predictive system then starts

275
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,959
selectively sampling the world to try to

276
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,120
confirm that hypothesis and in fact it

277
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
down regulates any sort of counter

278
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,680
evidence that goes against that deep

279
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,760
prior that deep pathological prior so so

280
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,519
that even when the situation changes you

281
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,519
know if the agent finds themselves in

282
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,959
more positively predictable situations

283
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,440
uh they tend to hold on to that belief

284
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
in volatility and that's really the what

285
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
we think is the pathological moment so

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,839
another way of saying that is

287
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,399
an agent at least a depressed agent yeah

288
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,519
has uh become overly confident that it

289
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,839
is uncertain it's overly confident about

290
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,959
being uncertain we're not the only

291
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,480
people who've said that clerking

292
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,920
colleagues have written a fantastic

293
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
paper um definitely check it out if you

294
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,959
don't know it and in that they come to

295
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,440
the same conclusions they write in this

296
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,519
sense we might conjecture that major

297
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,519
depression occurs when the brain is

298
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,120
certain that it will encounter an

299
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
uncertain environment

300
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,200
okay and um as we all know you know due

301
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
to the central role that prediction

302
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,959
plays in sculpting our experience and

303
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,800
directing our behaviors of course as

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,560
soon as we have a high level bias like

305
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,279
this installed um then it has tremendous

306
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,800
power to

307
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,680
produce exactly the outcomes that would

308
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,000
um that would confirm those biases it's

309
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,040
one of the problems of being a

310
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,279
predictive agent you know the predictive

311
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,880
system is really good for lots of things

312
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,240
but one of the problems is there's this

313
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
sort of deep self-fulfilling prophecy

314
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,279
that can occur okay

315
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,160
um

316
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,800
the rigidity of these bad beliefs is

317
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
especially important here and it comes

318
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
up again when we start thinking about

319
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,120
what well-being might be um you know

320
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,880
there's mounting evidence that cognitive

321
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,519
rigidity you know the sort of stickiness

322
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,760
of bad beliefs um but they're a basic

323
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,399
feature of psychopathologies and in fact

324
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,079
you know um some people are even saying

325
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,120
that it might be the root cause of all

326
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,480
psychopathologies and um i don't think

327
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,200
we disagree um there's a nice aeon

328
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,959
article about this if you uh if you're

329
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,959
interested in that point and i think i

330
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,600
might just uh take a take a little break

331
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,920
there and hand it over to anez um and

332
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,160
this hippolyto has a really just a

333
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,120
fantastic forthcoming paper coming out

334
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,200
that everyone should be excited to be

335
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,519
reading which offers um a really

336
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,760
beautiful computationally rich

337
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
account of how

338
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
insulated internal states yeah when

339
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,160
these bad beliefs sort of get stuck and

340
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,959
then they resist updating how that

341
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,920
creates um the sorts of pathological

342
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,279
belief systems the pathological

343
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,360
behaviors that we see in psychopathology

344
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,440
so um if it's okay and as i'm just gonna

345
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,680
stop share and let you maybe talk a

346
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,360
little bit about insulated bad beliefs

347
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
and then i'll pick it up from here and

348
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
keep going on to well-being you know is

349
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,399
that okay

350
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,040
yes for sure um hi everyone can you hear

351
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
me and see me

352
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
yeah okay great so first of all thanks

353
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
so much for mark for inviting me to be

354
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,120
here and it's always such a pleasure to

355
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,920
be here with daniel uh for these

356
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,959
wonderful sessions and uh hi julian

357
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,519
uh very nice to see you as well

358
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,880
so i'll just now share my screen

359
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,720
if i think that's possible yeah

360
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,040
let me see

361
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,519
okay so for some reason i'm not able to

362
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,480
share my screen

363
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,560
i

364
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,680
think it should maybe try again

365
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
okay

366
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,079
no it doesn't go through for some reason

367
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,120
uh

368
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,720
strange it works for me fine

369
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
i have no idea

370
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,560
we could go for a uh

371
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,760
an audio

372
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,959
thought or you can try to share it

373
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,120
later let me just leave and come back if

374
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,360
that's okay maybe that's good you know

375
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,959
the trick

376
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,519
um this is uh this is this is the new

377
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,199
world of technology isn't it you have to

378
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,959
do everything on the fly you have to do

379
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,240
everything on the fly and be willing to

380
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
adapt

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,399
i i have one interim question

382
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
yeah please yeah i hit it

383
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,639
were you working on active inference or

384
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,320
interested in those approaches and then

385
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,279
came to be studying

386
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,399
psychopathology or just well-being more

387
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,399
broadly or was it the other direction

388
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,839
like which way did you come at this

389
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,199
intersection from

390
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,680
yeah you're right and um it started the

391
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,760
other way around so um in my masters in

392
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
which julian was my advisor at the

393
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,800
university of edinburgh in 2010

394
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,720
um the last chapter of my senior thesis

395
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,120
was a proposal so i was working on

396
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,920
empathy looking at um um you know

397
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
philosophy and cognitive science of

398
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,440
empathy looking at dynamic systems

399
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
theories of emotion the last chapter was

400
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,880
on predictive processing and active

401
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,040
inference and then i got to do my phd

402
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,399
with andy clark

403
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
specifically on active inference and

404
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
then it grew out of doing that into

405
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,199
psychopathology yeah we got it very good

406
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,360
we got it excellent we got it some

407
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
technical difficulties but uh we are now

408
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,920
good okay all right you can see it fine

409
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
yeah yep nice work thanks and let's

410
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,440
continue perfect

411
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,279
okay so um all right so um yes this work

412
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,720
is on uh uh what we call psychotic macro

413
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
blankets and this is a something that

414
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,600
i've been working on uh for the last few

415
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,839
months with two different groups

416
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,199
applying this to uh different um

417
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,639
uh two different things so one

418
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,120
specifically schizophrenia specifically

419
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,279
and the other one is um

420
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,440
disembodiment so what i thought i would

421
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
do here today would be to do like sort

422
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,079
of like a combination between um the two

423
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,880
so that we get like a bigger picture of

424
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
what uh we have in mind with them with

425
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,360
uh with applying this particular

426
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,720
framework

427
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
so um

428
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,560
yeah so um

429
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,040
let me just uh give some like framing

430
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,079
about uh where this comes from and uh

431
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,519
why and to motivate it a little bit so

432
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,759
that was the parts from this concept

433
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,360
that mark also just mentioned the

434
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
self-organization which is super

435
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,880
relevant to these things that we are

436
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,720
talking about when we refer to

437
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,800
well-being and mental health and all of

438
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,320
that um

439
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
and as a few words about that it's an

440
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,240
emergence of order from disorder and

441
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
specifically without an intervention

442
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,640
from the external intervention that is

443
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
external to the system

444
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,359
um and then what is important here for

445
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,160
us is to think of self-organization as a

446
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,799
pattern or an arrangement that gives

447
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,039
rise to a specific way in which the

448
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,880
system is self-producing and

449
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
self-distinguishing and here and not to

450
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,600
the inactivist literature

451
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
so but the idea here that the

452
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
fundamental concept is the

453
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,919
self-organizing pattern that that comes

454
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,760
up

455
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
um

456
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,679
this is why why are we talking about

457
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,799
that because we want to look at how

458
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,080
the systems or the organisms as a whole

459
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,880
are

460
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
interacting with the environment in a

461
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
way that has been called in embodied

462
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,080
literature as a tournament with the

463
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
environment right

464
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,320
so the idea there is that these

465
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,559
organisms or the systems are a tune with

466
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,600
their environment and uh in a way that

467
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,080
they will show a certain specific

468
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,440
pattern um or part of the arrangement

469
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,320
that will be distinct from for example

470
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
systems that are not attuned to the

471
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,039
environment and this is very well known

472
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,760
in

473
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,840
the whole bulk of literature in this

474
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,880
embodiment and phenomenology

475
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
so uh the idea that we want to pursue

476
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
here is actually relating to a little

477
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,080
bit too complex systems theory in which

478
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
we want to say that

479
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,480
this differentiation between embodiment

480
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
and disembodiment are different patterns

481
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,360
it doesn't mean that the system

482
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,559
that the system

483
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,440
that is not adjusted to the environment

484
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,080
should be considered as disordered but

485
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
instead that it has a different kind of

486
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,280
order

487
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,160
right

488
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,880
so he would be sort of like rejecting a

489
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,039
little bit the computationalist accounts

490
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,400
of psychopathology as simply a disorder

491
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,640
a disorder or an illness and

492
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,880
opening up a little bit of more like a

493
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,880
broad scope or spectrum of um to talk

494
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,480
about mental health

495
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
um so then if we set up things like that

496
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
then uh what needs to be explained is

497
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,840
how uh this self-organizing behavior of

498
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,559
situated organisms come to be ordered in

499
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,960
a certain way rather than another and

500
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,679
then we'll be uh now talking about uh

501
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,919
mental health

502
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,640
so um then we think that active

503
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,440
inference is um a very interesting and

504
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,320
useful

505
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
tool precisely to

506
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,600
think about uh this uh self-organization

507
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,360
and the patterns that come from the

508
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,080
self-organization

509
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
um we think about um active inference as

510
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,919
a model of

511
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,360
uh leaving things adjust to the

512
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,039
environment and we all know what active

513
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,720
inference is so i'm just gonna highlight

514
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
what is relevant here for us in terms of

515
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,440
pattern dynamics

516
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,600
we think that it is a nice and cool

517
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,039
model that

518
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
when associated with tools such as macro

519
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,080
blankets or renormalization group it can

520
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,559
be applied to many different scales of

521
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,720
self-organizing activity and that's

522
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,039
where we find all of these patterns of

523
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,600
our interest of our scientific interest

524
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,840
so it is useful to explain um these

525
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,480
gradients spectrums of kinds of patterns

526
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,880
of order in self-organizing systems so

527
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,679
just highlighting these ideas

528
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,720
um so we take it as a model um in this

529
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,240
case so it means that we are not

530
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
committing to the

531
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,520
to the realist view of

532
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
that let's say that the phenomenon

533
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,200
studied under active inference

534
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
ontologically possess or leverages the

535
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,919
conceptual tool but that the tool is

536
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,840
really important and useful for us to

537
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,080
understand uh certain phenomenons in

538
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,919
this case particularly what you want to

539
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,080
understand is this embodiment

540
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,400
right so we all know active inference

541
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
but again let me just highlight uh just

542
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,280
some important points to understand than

543
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,320
the psychotic markov blankets later on

544
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,679
so um

545
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
here the idea is that self-organizing

546
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,159
self-producing self-distinguishing

547
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,799
system will correspond to the internal

548
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,679
states which affect and which effects

549
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,679
and affect and are affected by the

550
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,280
environment and the external states

551
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,240
via a set of other states such as the

552
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,039
active and the sensory states

553
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,559
active and sensory states are then

554
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,960
constructed as influencing one another

555
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,440
giving rise to a certain pattern of

556
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
self-organization and this is what's

557
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,600
going to be relevant for later on

558
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,840
so in a way what we want to say is that

559
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,919
well an adjusted system

560
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,720
that self-organizes is a system that um

561
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
minimizes the free energy which we all

562
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
know can also be understood as

563
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,880
uncertainty or entropy and so on right

564
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
but an adjusted system would be

565
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,000
something like that

566
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,760
a system that is just well adjusted to

567
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,919
its environment and for technicalities

568
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,000
obviously there are these references on

569
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,400
the bottom

570
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,039
now moving on to this embodiment and

571
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,120
then later on applying we want to apply

572
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,080
this

573
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,039
active inference strategy to

574
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,600
further highlight or understand what is

575
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,640
going on with this embodiment um

576
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,200
just a few words about the disembodiment

577
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,720
literature

578
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,000
so the idea is that comes from

579
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,679
phenomenology and a little bit from

580
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,679
existentialist philosophy and the idea

581
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,080
is that the primary experience of the

582
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,919
body is the body experienced as a

583
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,080
subject and this is really crucial

584
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,440
um

585
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,679
the thing is that this experience of the

586
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,720
body as a subject can be lost and

587
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,360
in which case the body is inspected as

588
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,760
an object more like a side of scientific

589
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
interest and here is what uh the

590
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,159
literature says that that's when this

591
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,799
embodiment comes up is when the body all

592
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,799
of a sudden ceases to be experienced as

593
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,760
a subject and is now inspected as an

594
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,039
object

595
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,600
so what happens is uh in exploring and

596
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,840
interacting with the local environment

597
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,799
we usually typically we do not attend to

598
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,159
our body we just like take it for

599
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,480
granted got our body that allows us to

600
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,360
access move around interact explore the

601
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,200
world through our body

602
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,000
and it is not until we cannot do these

603
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,200
things or something is wrong that we

604
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
will direct our awareness towards the

605
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,080
body

606
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,240
and then the body becomes salient as an

607
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,679
object of inquiry and it's right here at

608
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,880
this point where we find this embodiment

609
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,360
it's when we cannot um explore or

610
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
interact with the world as one would

611
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,440
like would like

612
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
so in a way we can um

613
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
distinguish embodiment and disembodiment

614
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,840
by saying uh for example or just

615
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
highlighting these features of course

616
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,200
the literature is vast but i think that

617
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,360
these are the ones that work for us here

618
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,000
um embodiment is an attunement with the

619
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,640
environment that is allowed or enabled

620
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,039
by having an experience of the body as a

621
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,720
subject

622
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,760
um and that gets us attuned um to the

623
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,840
environment through a bodily

624
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,679
self-awareness or something that there

625
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,159
is a bodily self-awareness that is

626
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,440
that is uh

627
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,320
felt

628
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,080
then this embodiment on the other on the

629
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,919
other hand is a disatonment with the

630
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,159
environment because there is a loss of

631
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,559
the body as a subject body becomes an

632
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,600
object

633
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,400
there's a disatonment and a diminished

634
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,559
body awareness so this comes from the

635
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,760
literature

636
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,240
and it is interesting for us here why

637
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
because

638
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,440
then there's been these links that have

639
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,080
been made between psychopathology and

640
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,039
psychedelics and disembodiment as in

641
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,960
this embodiment being something that is

642
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
reported in different psychopathology

643
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,679
such as schizophrenia the

644
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,200
personalization

645
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
even major depression

646
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,559
or other

647
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,400
psychopathologies that involve

648
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,080
rumination

649
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,039
and another very important thing is that

650
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,360
this embodiment also occurs or is what

651
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,799
is reported in the encyclopedias intake

652
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,520
and

653
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,400
this has been um even more relevant uh

654
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,640
studying this embodiment precisely in

655
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,720
the psychedelic renaissance that we are

656
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,880
witnessing today and also another point

657
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
that i want to make uh just here sounds

658
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,240
like in brackets

659
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,039
is just that disembodiment does not

660
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,520
necessarily need to be a bad thing right

661
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
we usually put things in

662
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,840
good or bad right or wrong but it

663
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,919
doesn't need to be a bad thing because

664
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,520
if we do get some therapeutical effects

665
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,240
um positive effects from psychedelics

666
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,720
this precisely by having this

667
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,000
disembodied experience so it's just a

668
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,640
different way of interacting with the

669
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,360
world and that's why we want to pursue

670
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,320
less of a disorder way and much more of

671
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,880
a there's a spectrum of different

672
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,120
patterns of interaction with the world

673
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,240
right

674
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,039
okay so just that note um

675
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,440
then um i want to look at this

676
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,360
embodiment um

677
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
and how we can use active inference to

678
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,640
understand this embodiment in two ways

679
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,960
one is the psycho the psychology of this

680
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,039
embodiment so how that disappointment is

681
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,840
felt psychologically and the other one

682
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,799
is the neurobiology of this embodiment

683
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,679
so as we have said uh this embodiment is

684
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
the loss of the body as a subject which

685
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
is replaced by

686
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
uh some form of

687
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
intellectual effort so imagine that you

688
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,880
now don't have these broadly access to

689
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
the world that is not possible because

690
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,360
that's exactly what has been lost by

691
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,159
psychopathology or psychedelics intake

692
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,679
and many other things right so then

693
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,200
try to cope and compensate by literally

694
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,360
engaging in making inferences about the

695
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,080
state of affairs so here we could use a

696
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,200
little bit of the literature and

697
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
sophisticated active inference which is

698
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,960
this conscious reasoning and planning

699
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,159
and policy selection that you engage now

700
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,880
with having lost these access to the

701
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,279
world through the body

702
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,080
now our hypothesis is that the issue is

703
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,559
that in this disembodied because we all

704
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,400
engage in sophisticated active inference

705
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,760
that's all fine

706
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,960
um the difficulty is that in the case of

707
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,400
this embodiment um experience this

708
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,559
inference is insulated is isolated

709
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,039
because what has been lost is the body

710
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,080
access to the world

711
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,600
so then what happens is um so uh we

712
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,840
would have something that looks like

713
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,559
this so we all know this um this scheme

714
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,080
here right and what we want to say is

715
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,240
that what is lost now is the

716
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,799
influences between sensory and active

717
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,960
states and let me guide you through it

718
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,440
so um let's just uh

719
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,520
focus on the figure for now so we have

720
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,080
internal states as being disembodied

721
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,559
reasoning so a subject that has lost

722
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,720
this access or bodily access to the

723
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,399
world because the body is not felt as a

724
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,600
subject so we've got this disembodied

725
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
reasoning as internal states and then we

726
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,679
have external states as the environment

727
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,000
where that that the subject wants to

728
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,159
explore and interact with

729
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,880
and then we have a sensory state

730
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
the environmental co-constraints so

731
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,360
these aspects that should influence uh

732
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,760
the subject right and then as active

733
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,960
straight states we have the effectivity

734
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,919
as um the ways in which the subject can

735
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,799
affect and being effect and be affected

736
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,559
by the environment

737
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,480
but what has been lost

738
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,880
here is

739
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,919
that there is an unbalance between

740
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,320
sensory and active states

741
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,919
so for one

742
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,559
active states are not sensitive to

743
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,000
sensoristics

744
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,200
right so

745
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,960
it is this effectivity or this

746
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,200
possibility of being affected by the

747
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,760
environment that is not possible why

748
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,039
because

749
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,120
the access through the sub the body as a

750
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,360
subject has been lost in this

751
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,159
psychopathology or psychedelics as that

752
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,760
we label as disembodiment experience

753
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,480
so um as a coping mechanism what is

754
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
going to happen is there will be an

755
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,360
increase of activity of the activity of

756
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,240
active states by increasing the issuing

757
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,880
of inferences about the world so i do

758
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,039
not understand

759
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,720
what is going on

760
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,039
but i'm going to continue to think about

761
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,679
it and make and and develop theories

762
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,840
about what is going on

763
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,720
the problem is that we can we all engage

764
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,159
in these developing theories and

765
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,080
inferences about what we think is the

766
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,240
likelihood of the state of affairs the

767
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,640
situation here in this embodiment is

768
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,320
that these inferences are disembodied

769
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,360
so they tend to be false beliefs

770
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,080
and that's because of the insulation of

771
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
internal states

772
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,679
what does this mean this means that

773
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,120
there is not um so the access that we

774
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,159
had

775
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,039
with the world through our lived body

776
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,679
is what is lost so then the subject in a

777
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,559
situation where um the only hope is to

778
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,919
increase in increase active states

779
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,840
to make more inferences about the world

780
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,840
to cope with that loss

781
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,159
and then tendency is to have false

782
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,320
beliefs that's when we start entering

783
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,399
the realm of psychopathology and

784
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,360
psychosis

785
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,720
so in these disembodied cases uh this is

786
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,559
actually a very important point because

787
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,480
one could say okay so then the problem

788
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,559
is the is on the level of reasoning so

789
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,919
on the level of for example of the

790
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,080
internal states as we have set up here

791
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,840
no the problem is not on the level of

792
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,919
the internal states reasoning is fine

793
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,080
the inference mechanisms are working

794
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,760
perfectly fine the subject can engage in

795
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,120
in reasoning

796
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,480
it can make

797
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,200
inferences the problem is inside the

798
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,159
markov blanket the problem is in the

799
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,559
unbalance that there is between active

800
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,640
and sensory states because those are the

801
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,399
ones that are supposed to

802
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,600
directly influence one another such that

803
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,760
indirectly there's a connection between

804
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,399
internal and external states but it is

805
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,279
this um direct influence between sensory

806
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,799
and active states

807
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,360
that is problematic they are not

808
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
communicating well they are not

809
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,399
influencing uh themselves or each other

810
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,039
in a balanced way

811
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,519
um in a sense and balanced in the sense

812
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,240
that active states become super active

813
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,799
and sensory states um cannot influence

814
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,600
active states so then what we get we get

815
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
to this idea of a psychotic markov

816
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,799
blanket which is if we have this sort of

817
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,720
arrangement where there's a problem

818
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,640
between the balance of the strength of

819
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,240
influences between sensory and active

820
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,480
states then we have

821
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,559
a problem of the generation of false

822
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,919
beliefs

823
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,840
the problem being that these beliefs

824
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,000
that are issued by active states they

825
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,480
cannot be updated by the world because

826
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
it is precisely this access to the world

827
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,279
that has been lost lost by virtue of

828
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,880
having lost

829
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,480
the body as a subject

830
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
so then um

831
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,200
because of this uh this achievement that

832
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,799
we can actually

833
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,440
explain as what is appearing inside the

834
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,120
marco blanket

835
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,880
the reasoning subject makes inference

836
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,760
about inferences about world but um

837
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,080
these reasoning occurs from within the

838
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,919
lack of the experience of the body as a

839
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,159
subject so it occurs in an insulated

840
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,720
manner and this is consistent actually

841
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,039
um with a long-standing literature and

842
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,679
phenomenology of psychosis

843
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,559
um where uh the subjects and sisters a

844
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,640
bunch of children on psychosis linked to

845
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,720
solipsistic behavior

846
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,279
um solid existing uh drawing and

847
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,080
painting and also the philosophical idea

848
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,840
which is the philosophical idea that

849
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,000
only one's mind is sure to exist

850
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,960
and then some some reports that i find

851
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,600
quite interesting is uh uh some patients

852
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,159
who report i was no longer sure

853
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,559
that i was still the same person

854
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,919
i became one with other creatures or

855
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,080
objects i lost a sense of my own

856
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,440
boundaries

857
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,919
when i had an experience i often did not

858
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,399
know it was mine or the experience of

859
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,760
someone else so it is quite interesting

860
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,960
what can be

861
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,840
lost

862
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,600
when we lose these

863
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,320
body as a subject as it is developed in

864
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,640
phenomenology this also happens a little

865
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,760
bit in the personalization disorder um

866
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,519
for example showing this disembodiment

867
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,960
is achievement

868
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,159
when

869
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,000
making people feel estranged and

870
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,799
detached from their self body and the

871
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,120
world

872
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,080
okay so this is all i had on the

873
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,240
disembodied on the psychology of this

874
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
embodiment and now i'd like to turn to

875
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,960
the neurobiology and also in the end

876
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
apply the same framework now to the

877
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,519
neurobiology of um of

878
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,279
the underlying neurobiology of this

879
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,880
environment

880
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,799
so we think that applying the same

881
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,559
reasoning is

882
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,640
is consistent so this this achievement

883
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,719
that you were talking about felt at

884
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,199
agent level should also be expected at

885
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,839
the

886
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,359
neurological state so that's our

887
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,119
hypothesis right

888
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,800
so now we think that there are two

889
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,199
places there are two good candidates for

890
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,119
perception and interception would be

891
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,359
good candidates um super perception as a

892
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,359
system underlying movement and location

893
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,800
of the body in the environment as well

894
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
as interception as the system

895
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,199
responsible for homeostasis these are

896
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,119
good candidates we think um for the

897
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,839
neurobiology biology of this general

898
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,760
disorder that is felt in this embodiment

899
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,719
um

900
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,199
so proprioceptive and interceptive

901
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,839
systems um just like any situated

902
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,520
organism can be conceived as

903
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
self-organizing systems so we apply

904
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,440
exactly the same principle as we would

905
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,320
apply

906
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,359
to the

907
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,000
agent as a self-organizing system

908
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
so the question then that we had is what

909
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,200
is the factor that is at the basis of

910
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,760
this of a neurobiological pattern

911
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,359
underlying proprioception and

912
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,599
interception that will show this small

913
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,800
adjustment to the local environment so

914
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,839
if we expect the same sort of mechanism

915
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,680
or organization

916
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,560
dynamics as to the whole

917
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
agent and that we were just talking

918
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,119
about then how are we going to find this

919
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,839
out as well in the neurobiology

920
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,440
so we think that

921
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,359
just like in psychological experience of

922
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,599
this embodiment where the agent becomes

923
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,320
insulated from the world and in this

924
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,599
case we say by virtue of losing the body

925
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,320
as a subject the answer will reside in

926
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,119
biological insulation

927
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,440
um now i'm going to focus now on

928
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,119
interception because i don't have time

929
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,680
to also cover proprioception um and i

930
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,920
think that this does give us here some

931
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,880
very very cool insights so um

932
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,720
i'm going to uh focus now on the work uh

933
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,960
brought by baritone siemens on

934
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
interceptive predictions in the brain

935
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
and they have a vertical model which

936
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,160
they call embodied predictive

937
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
interception coding model

938
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,480
and well the goal there is to integrate

939
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,960
an anatomical model of corticocortical

940
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,560
connections with beijing active

941
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,359
inference principles and they propose a

942
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,160
very cool thing which is that a granular

943
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,040
visceral motor cortexes contribute to

944
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,760
interception by issuing interception

945
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,359
predictions

946
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,760
so more specifically what they want to

947
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,200
say is that the granular limbic regions

948
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,440
that regulate visceral motor of the

949
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,800
body's um internal milia that is the

950
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,040
visceral motor cortexes so this is their

951
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,680
focus and where do you think they will

952
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,480
find the interceptive uh system and

953
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,119
where they apply the model

954
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,839
now um so you can see the agranular

955
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,200
cortex here uh on the left and uh one

956
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,240
very interesting thing that i'm just

957
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,680
gonna draw your attention to and then if

958
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,079
you feel uh that you'd like to read this

959
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,560
super interesting paper then um please

960
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,920
go for it but i just want to draw your

961
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
attention to the fact that on the left

962
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,079
side you have the a granular cortex and

963
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,680
there's one thing that is missing from

964
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,920
the a-granular cortex as

965
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,200
opposed to

966
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,960
the these granular and the granular

967
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,680
cortis so what is missing is the layer 4

968
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,839
and what happens with that is that there

969
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,839
won't be you cannot see

970
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,400
there any prediction error neurons so

971
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,119
that's pretty cool because that will uh

972
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,240
give us

973
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,839
an idea that there is no prediction

974
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,359
error neurons in the a granular cortex

975
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,880
um so just

976
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,800
i'm just going to leave that um out

977
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,640
there and um just moving uh forward to

978
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,560
just like a understanding like the very

979
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,839
cheese of the embodied predative

980
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,599
interceptive coding model

981
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,680
um they claim that there is an

982
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,280
interceptive system in the brain in

983
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,560
which a granular cortices sends visceral

984
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
motor predictions to the body and

985
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,119
transmits interceptive predictions about

986
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,839
the visceral sensory consequences of

987
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,280
those predictions

988
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,000
so they also tell us that adrenal are

989
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,640
visceral motor cortexes estimate the

990
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,240
balance between the autonomic metabolic

991
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,720
and immunological resources that are

992
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,880
available to the body and the predicted

993
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,680
requirements of the body based on past

994
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,880
experience

995
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,040
right so this is going to be very

996
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,119
important for us

997
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,560
because

998
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,480
a chronic imbalance

999
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,240
on those things that i was just

1000
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,560
mentioning can be which can be caused by

1001
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,119
constantly predicting the need for more

1002
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,520
metabolic energy to meet the demands for

1003
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,720
stressors

1004
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,040
can produce the well-known depression

1005
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
related disruption

1006
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,599
and it can also eventually down regulate

1007
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,040
uh

1008
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,920
provoke a down regulation of

1009
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,119
hypothalamus or

1010
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,079
hpa axis negative feedback loops

1011
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,000
resulting in chronic hyper cortisolemia

1012
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,599
and in turn can also promote

1013
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,160
pro-inflammatory state so this is like

1014
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,280
some of like the problems of having

1015
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,160
an imbalance on the level of the

1016
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,480
autonomic metabolic and immunological

1017
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,560
resources which is what the

1018
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,720
interoceptive system should be able to

1019
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,640
do is to give us that nice balance right

1020
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,760
so then applying exactly the same um

1021
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,560
the same framework the same model that

1022
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,880
we applied to the whole

1023
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,520
body this embodiment or the generalized

1024
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,839
feel of this embodiment that is vastly

1025
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,760
described in the phenomenology

1026
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,440
literature applying this to the

1027
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,359
neurobiology of the interperceptive

1028
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,520
system then what we get is something

1029
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,280
that can be seen as like quite similar

1030
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,079
an unbalance between sensory and active

1031
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,760
state so let me just

1032
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,000
guide through the figures so here in

1033
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,160
this figure internal states are

1034
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,760
interests are or correspond to the

1035
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,920
interoceptive system and the external

1036
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,320
stage the environment whichever um the

1037
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,319
multi-scaled system that receptive

1038
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,760
system is part of

1039
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
and then we have active stages that a

1040
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,000
granular quartus

1041
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,960
that send visceral motor predictions and

1042
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,680
then we have sensory stage stages the

1043
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,520
requirements of the body given the

1044
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,319
history that the body knows

1045
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,440
to be

1046
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,480
required for homeostasis so then in this

1047
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,720
sense what we would have is that active

1048
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,760
states are not sensitive to sensory

1049
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,240
states so even though active states can

1050
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,960
become uh as a coping mechanism much

1051
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,520
more active and send much more

1052
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,000
predictions about what is going on

1053
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
what's the state of affairs

1054
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,480
um because i'm not receiving any

1055
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
information from the requirements of the

1056
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
body so the sensory states

1057
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,920
so what will happen then because of this

1058
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,440
insulation

1059
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,599
is that a false belief is going to be

1060
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,960
generated

1061
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,000
so this will correspond to a constantly

1062
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,319
prediction of the need for more

1063
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,400
metabolic energy to meet the demands of

1064
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,960
the stressors so in this sense we have

1065
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,680
here another case of what we call a

1066
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,760
psychotic markov blanket why is it

1067
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,400
psychotic because it delivers if there

1068
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,720
is this lack or this imbalance between

1069
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,400
sensory states or the

1070
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,160
influences between sensory states and

1071
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,400
active states then what we should expect

1072
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,280
is a degeneration of a false belief and

1073
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,880
we can also expect that at a

1074
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,800
neurobiological level which is also

1075
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,920
supported by empirical evidence

1076
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,480
so yeah this is what i wanted to say uh

1077
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,119
just thinking um thanking these uh

1078
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,560
collaborators here that have been

1079
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,240
thinking about and guiding me through as

1080
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,359
well these ideas

1081
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,200
thank you ness really

1082
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,560
interesting stuff so i guess we'll

1083
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,319
return to

1084
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,280
mark and then anybody is

1085
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,440
yep anyone's free to ask a question in

1086
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,800
the live chat and i'm writing things

1087
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,960
down and then after this

1088
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,400
second piece of the presentation we'll

1089
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,800
have a discussion so thanks again go for

1090
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,000
it mark

1091
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,400
yeah that was great thank you so much

1092
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,920
wow it's so interesting and i haven't

1093
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,119
heard some of your stuff about

1094
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,440
disembodiment yet and you know also this

1095
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,359
is a research program that i'm extremely

1096
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,520
interested in so uh i'll be picking your

1097
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,839
brain at the end of the q a and also

1098
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,880
after after this event um what might

1099
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,760
what wasn't made obvious in anez's talk

1100
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,000
but i think is implied is that the

1101
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,720
stickiness the stickiness of these

1102
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,119
belief systems and what's helping them

1103
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,520
become insulated is a story about how

1104
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,040
precision is being estimated and how

1105
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,440
precision is being deployed that's

1106
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,079
surely one of the mechanisms that is

1107
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,000
creating an imbalance between active and

1108
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,520
sensory states

1109
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,800
so you know

1110
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,960
how precision is estimated is really the

1111
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,400
agent's ability to assess the

1112
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,319
uncertainty of its own priors

1113
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,119
and when that's working right then those

1114
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,200
estimations should result in appropriate

1115
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,880
model updating you know you shouldn't

1116
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,200
get stuck in an insulated in an

1117
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,880
insulated situation but rather you

1118
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,640
should know wow that's not working out

1119
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,480
the right way and so appropriate

1120
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,280
updating should occur um and we know

1121
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,400
that like

1122
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,960
maladaptive precision estimation is

1123
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,040
disastrous right and we're seeing it

1124
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,400
everywhere in the psychopathology

1125
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,319
literature today you know schizophrenic

1126
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,680
delusion is being um characterized as

1127
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,520
too little precision on sensory data

1128
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,839
which is putting this heavy emphasis on

1129
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,359
just top-down predictions so that's why

1130
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,960
you're seeing the world in a way that

1131
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,640
isn't being anchored by what's really

1132
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,280
happening and of course asd is a little

1133
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,599
bit the flip right too much precision on

1134
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,760
prediction errors creates a lot of a lot

1135
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,880
of volatility and a little bit

1136
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,040
difficulty um establishing good high

1137
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,560
level predictions

1138
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,599
um

1139
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,520
and as a quick side note you know the

1140
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,359
the kind of insulated insulated um

1141
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,240
outcomes that create these maladaptive

1142
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,119
uh self-organizing styles they can occur

1143
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,760
in lots of ways right so for instance

1144
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,640
yeah so addictive substances is one good

1145
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,880
way right addictive substances impact

1146
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,440
directly precision estimation machinery

1147
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,839
right in the way that the addictive

1148
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,680
substance engages the dopaminergic

1149
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,760
system so addictive substances are

1150
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,480
setting precision outright in a way so

1151
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,319
no wonder they can create these sort of

1152
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,800
sub-optimal styles

1153
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
but societal expectations do the same

1154
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,200
sort of thing you know sub optimally

1155
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,520
pinning precision on

1156
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,160
expectations about success for example

1157
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,240
you know um so you can have cultural

1158
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,240
pinning of precision that you should

1159
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,760
achieve a certain level of success in

1160
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,119
your life and you know we have deep

1161
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,800
running relationships between

1162
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,280
perfectionism and depression for example

1163
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,119
and again for exactly the same reason

1164
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,160
that anes said overly high precision on

1165
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,640
some sort of expectation would lead to a

1166
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,760
constant

1167
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,160
pervasive background error as you're not

1168
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,240
hitting that high level of expectation

1169
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,400
and then just like um feldman barrett

1170
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,200
suggests in simmons you have an hpa flip

1171
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,560
because the system just doesn't have

1172
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,960
unlimited resources um and then the one

1173
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,400
that i'm most interested in today

1174
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,680
actually is social media which is

1175
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,560
turning out to be a like fantastic way

1176
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,880
of bending our generative model into all

1177
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,280
sorts of shapes that cause sub-optimal

1178
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,119
outcomes right and that makes sense it's

1179
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,800
just giving us wave after wave of um you

1180
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,960
know misinformation through filtered

1181
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,079
images and staged images and of course

1182
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
social media platforms some social media

1183
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,560
platforms function just like addictive

1184
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,520
substances or like casinos in a way so

1185
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,560
again they're

1186
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,319
hijacking the precision system in just

1187
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:33,440
the sorts of ways that cause these

1188
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,280
problems okay

1189
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,800
i just want to quickly summarize before

1190
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,119
i go on to why what i think the natural

1191
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,480
mechanisms that keep us out of these

1192
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,400
problems are so

1193
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,880
well-being as optimal model generation

1194
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,800
importantly depends on correct and

1195
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,359
flexible yeah not these stuck insulated

1196
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,760
outcomes but correct and flexible

1197
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
self-estimations of uncertainty so

1198
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,599
that's precision assignments

1199
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,599
um so misassigning precision to

1200
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,280
prediction errors which can happen in

1201
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,040
lots of ways especially in our in our

1202
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,160
modern world um will inevitably lead to

1203
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,560
sub-optimal styles of self-organization

1204
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,720
sub-optimal generative models and with

1205
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,400
that the production of pathological

1206
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,560
beliefs and pathological behaviors and

1207
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,440
um

1208
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,880
so that's how it can go wrong or at

1209
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,240
least that's the starting point it's one

1210
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,520
of the ways that it can go wrong so

1211
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,440
that's how it goes wrong then what is it

1212
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,000
that ordinarily keeps us out of these

1213
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,480
sorts of bad bootstraps these sorts of

1214
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,119
insulated uh disharmonies between the

1215
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,599
the system and the environment and one

1216
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,520
answer that i like that we like as a

1217
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,839
team it was given by alex chance and

1218
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,000
colleagues er where they said that

1219
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,400
optimal free energy minimizing agents

1220
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,240
will benefit from striking a good

1221
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,200
balance between pragmatic and epistemic

1222
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,680
engagements okay so that is they don't

1223
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,400
only act in a pragmatic way that is in

1224
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,000
ways that they're highly confident will

1225
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
reduce free energy over time because

1226
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,599
they can be wrong that's part of the

1227
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,640
take-home message from some of the

1228
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,560
pathological self-organization styles

1229
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,800
right they say that you should also a

1230
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,119
good free energy minimizing system is

1231
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,000
going to balance that against being

1232
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,200
driven to epistemically explore and

1233
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
forage for more information about how

1234
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,880
the world works but also about how their

1235
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,920
own model works and implied there is

1236
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,000
that when they find important counter

1237
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,760
evidence while they're out exploring

1238
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,960
that they're willing to update their

1239
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,040
model relative to that counter evidence

1240
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,680
so then the question then if we buy that

1241
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,200
and i i think i do buy that's one of the

1242
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,319
ways that we stay out of these bad boot

1243
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,880
straps and these sub-optimal styles of

1244
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,119
interacting well how do we find that

1245
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,800
right balance i think that's a good

1246
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,079
question if we're gonna ask well how do

1247
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,680
we live well what is well-being all

1248
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,160
about how do we find that good balance

1249
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,680
and the central way that we've been

1250
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,359
arguing over a number of papers is that

1251
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,599
we literally feel our way to that

1252
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,160
balance and um that part of course is

1253
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
predicated on everything working right

1254
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,440
because if you have an affective

1255
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,599
disorder then it's going to be exactly

1256
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,839
that mechanism that's going to be

1257
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,760
mis-tuned and of course we get all the

1258
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,720
problems um that anna's just pointed out

1259
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,119
so um in a series of recent papers we've

1260
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,079
been exploring the suggestion that um

1261
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,319
good precision assignment is going to

1262
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,119
rely in part on the rate at which error

1263
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,720
is being reduced so that's commonly

1264
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,119
referred to as aerodynamics and um we're

1265
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,880
increasingly not alone in this

1266
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,440
conjecture um we have people like jeff

1267
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,040
lee and corcelli who gave the first

1268
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,200
paper on this and of course vanda cruz

1269
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,880
and then it was beautifully formalized

1270
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,920
by casper hesp and colleagues

1271
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,000
um so if you want to look really at the

1272
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,359
nitty gritty of this that's definitely

1273
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,400
the paper to check out and if you want

1274
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,359
to see a great paper on the

1275
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,280
computational bits of this you should

1276
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,440
see casper's talk it's there on the

1277
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,760
slide it's fantastic so um the idea um

1278
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,880
uh the idea has developed that these

1279
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,480
aerodynamics yeah the changes in the

1280
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,559
rate at which error is reduced are

1281
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,480
registered by the organism as affective

1282
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,000
states and um if we think of an agent's

1283
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,480
performance in reducing error in terms

1284
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,280
of a slope yeah that plots the various

1285
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,520
speeds that prediction error is being

1286
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,040
accommodated relative to our

1287
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,280
expectations then we can think that

1288
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,520
positively and negatively balanced

1289
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,920
affective states are a reflection of

1290
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,760
better than or worse than slopes of

1291
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,319
error reduction so um that is just to

1292
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,559
say we feel good when we're doing better

1293
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,200
than expected at reducing error relative

1294
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,480
to expectations yeah better than

1295
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,720
expected and we feel bad when we do

1296
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,200
worse than expected at reducing um

1297
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,680
prediction error and

1298
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,559
these embodied aerodynamics are

1299
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,400
important drivers of precision

1300
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
estimation it turns out and i think that

1301
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,480
makes sense of course right because

1302
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,480
unexpected increases or decreases in

1303
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,640
volatility relative to your model is

1304
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,559
important information for how you should

1305
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,480
set precision on your beliefs about

1306
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,040
action policies right so unexpected

1307
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,520
decreases in the rate at which error is

1308
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,200
being reduced tells you that your action

1309
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,440
policy isn't working the way that you

1310
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,119
thought it was going to work which means

1311
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,280
you should obviously reduce your

1312
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,440
confidence in that action policy and the

1313
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,640
other way as well right if you're

1314
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,200
unexpectedly doing better at reducing

1315
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,440
prediction error relative to some policy

1316
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,000
then you should up your confidence in

1317
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,440
that policy

1318
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,359
so the point being here is that

1319
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,720
precision then isn't adjusted only based

1320
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,960
on the amount of error or the amount of

1321
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,119
error reduction but precision is also

1322
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,640
being tuned

1323
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,280
relative to the rates at which air is

1324
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,760
being minimized over time

1325
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,400
and um that feature of the active

1326
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,559
inference framework gives us a rather

1327
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,640
sexy account of momentary subjective

1328
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,480
happiness which i think is so

1329
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,559
interesting right um momentary subject

1330
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,040
of happiness is the result of

1331
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,839
unexpectedly reducing prediction error

1332
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,839
and that feels good because we are

1333
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,760
suddenly doing better than we thought we

1334
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,280
would at getting a good predictive grip

1335
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,520
on our environment which under normal

1336
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,920
circumstances would usually mean that we

1337
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,000
are staying healthy and we're staying

1338
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,079
well and um juffley and corchelli's

1339
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,640
graph makes that clear you know as free

1340
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,520
energy is going up um you feel fear and

1341
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,440
then you feel unhappy when it's super

1342
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,520
high and then you feel hope when it

1343
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,079
starts getting better and you feel happy

1344
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,720
when uh error is being managed in an

1345
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,280
extremely good way but actually it's not

1346
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,800
only showing up in active inference

1347
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,359
these ideas are being presented in um

1348
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,599
in other camps as well rob rutledge is

1349
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,079
of course the paradigmatic case um he

1350
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,480
and his team have done a number of uh

1351
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,160
brain imaging studies that have already

1352
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,680
started to show the strong relationship

1353
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,920
between subjective feelings of happiness

1354
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,160
and doing better than expected in some

1355
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,440
particular nation you can see on the

1356
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,280
board behind rob there that's the

1357
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,200
calculation for happiness which i think

1358
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,119
is a bit of a cheeky way to go but i

1359
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,280
think it's cool um and uh if you know

1360
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,800
the maths then of course you're gonna

1361
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,920
you're gonna know what's going on there

1362
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,200
too

1363
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,079
okay

1364
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,599
now we get to the fun stuff this is the

1365
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,119
last thing this is sort of we're coming

1366
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,800
into the last stretch here's the fun

1367
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
stuff so

1368
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,880
we think that the same machinery that

1369
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,960
underlies momentary subjective happiness

1370
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,359
is also going to play a leading role in

1371
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,680
helping us tend towards optimality and

1372
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,359
to avoid these sort of sub-optimal

1373
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,599
styles of self-organization so we think

1374
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,200
it's going to play a special role in an

1375
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,319
active inference account of what it

1376
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,040
means to be well um to see

1377
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,680
why aerodynamics play that role

1378
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,040
we just have to ask ourselves well where

1379
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,599
are the best slopes to be found and the

1380
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,440
answer is the best slopes are found at

1381
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,800
the edge of our own predictive

1382
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,200
capabilities right between what's known

1383
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,680
and highly reliable and what's unknown

1384
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,160
and potentially more optimal and when

1385
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,920
it's all working right

1386
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,160
aerodynamics naturally move us out to

1387
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,880
that edge right where errors are neither

1388
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,119
so complex that we can't learn anything

1389
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,319
from them nor too easily predictable

1390
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,359
that there's no more epistemic value and

1391
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,640
really the best slope is going to be

1392
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,800
right there at the edge of your own

1393
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,960
capabilities and you know that's not a

1394
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,559
provocative that's not a provocative

1395
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,920
idea we see that everywhere in the

1396
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,480
curiosity literature um we know that

1397
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,119
babies are attracted to medium amounts

1398
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,440
of complexity not too well known not too

1399
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,920
volatile we see it in mice put them in a

1400
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,200
maze with varying rooms of uh grades of

1401
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,440
complexity and the mouse will tend to

1402
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,839
hang out in the room that's just above

1403
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,240
its comfortability and um and you know

1404
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,400
we're already building um adaptive and

1405
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,319
effective robots using these ideas so

1406
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,760
this isn't this isn't a far out idea

1407
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,680
so important for our current discussion

1408
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,880
is that

1409
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,040
in order to make the most

1410
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,040
of those good slopes that are right at

1411
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,280
the edge of our own capability a

1412
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,520
predictive system must be

1413
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,520
sometimes willing to disrupt

1414
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,640
its own

1415
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,040
fixed point attractors yeah so it must

1416
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,760
be willing to go beyond its habitual

1417
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,319
policies to go beyond its extremely

1418
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,119
well-known ways of self-organizing

1419
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,520
beyond its own homeostatic set points

1420
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,359
even right and that's one of the roles

1421
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,640
that aerodynamics should play when

1422
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,160
everything is working right when it's

1423
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,920
going well and you're on a good slope of

1424
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,599
error reduction then you should be

1425
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,599
motivated to continue along that path

1426
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,440
but when the niche

1427
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,000
thesis to give you productive prediction

1428
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,119
errors

1429
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,359
then the negative valence that comes up

1430
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,200
that signals to the system that it's

1431
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,280
time to destroy

1432
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,640
some of these fixed point attractors in

1433
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,920
favor of more wandering policies more

1434
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,079
explorative styles and i mean if you

1435
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,160
want to see that in technical terms um

1436
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,160
just check out uh fristen breaks beer

1437
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,440
and deco that's the paper to go to so

1438
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,880
agents that use aerodynamics in this way

1439
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,599
to set precision on action policies

1440
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,760
they're going to avoid getting stuck

1441
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,839
in any one fixed attractor basin for too

1442
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,760
long right they'll instead tend to exist

1443
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,720
in more meta-stable states more often

1444
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,400
they're going to be poised they're going

1445
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,480
to be optimally poised in some way

1446
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,599
between exploiting already existing off

1447
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,599
action policies and performing action uh

1448
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,440
information seeking epistemic actions

1449
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,440
that reduce uncertainty

1450
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,280
and that metastable poise

1451
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,079
um

1452
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,640
actually grants all sorts of fitness

1453
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,160
advantages over

1454
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,319
strictly ordered or more chaotic systems

1455
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,559
at least in our kind of environment and

1456
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,920
that's something that's very well known

1457
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,440
in the dynamic systems literature so

1458
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,200
again this isn't a very provocative

1459
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,960
claim here um and it's precisely because

1460
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,960
those sorts of systems have an optimal

1461
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
balance between you know what you might

1462
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,280
think of as efficiency and degeneracy

1463
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,440
another way of saying that is um they're

1464
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,799
set up to respond efficiently um to

1465
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,559
particular contexts those contexts that

1466
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,400
are highly predictable but they're also

1467
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,599
remaining open to exploring and growing

1468
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,839
in a wide variety of other possibilities

1469
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,640
okay so notice then that um for a free

1470
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,040
energy minimizing system in our kind of

1471
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,400
environment

1472
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,160
flourishing is not about avoiding errors

1473
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,200
i know that's starting to be more

1474
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,559
popular but i think it's a really good

1475
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:54,799
point to like hit right on the head

1476
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,040
it doesn't flourish by avoiding all

1477
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,240
errors

1478
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,720
it flourishes by selectively sampling

1479
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,640
the right errors

1480
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,240
and i think that's so cool like if that

1481
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,839
wasn't immediately obvious if you're

1482
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,280
still not like you're still not really

1483
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,960
catching that point then i think it's

1484
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,480
it's a good point to catch soon um

1485
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,640
what matters for flourishing for a free

1486
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,640
energy minimizing system in our kind of

1487
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,839
environment is that it gets the right

1488
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,280
kinds of errors because the right kind

1489
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,280
of errors into it and of course we know

1490
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,960
that you know like outside of the model

1491
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,119
it only sounds weird i think inside the

1492
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,880
model if you're in that camp outside of

1493
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,799
the model we all we already know that

1494
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,119
you know overly sterilized environments

1495
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,880
make children sick

1496
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,280
overly simplified cities make people

1497
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,520
depressed like we know too little

1498
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,240
volatility um causes problems for

1499
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,480
complex self-organizing systems like us

1500
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,760
again i don't think it's

1501
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,119
such a provocative claim although it can

1502
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,799
sound provocative from inside the active

1503
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,799
inference framework maybe so finding the

1504
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,440
right sorts of volatility and the suite

1505
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,359
of cognitive emotional mechanisms that

1506
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:54,720
keep us in touch

1507
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,799
with that good volatility uh we think

1508
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,319
that that's going to play center stage

1509
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,319
in any account of well-being if we're

1510
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,599
going to look at it through the active

1511
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,680
inference lens and we've done a little

1512
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,119
bit of work on this already this is our

1513
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,720
aeon article where we do this in a sort

1514
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,559
of popular way um if you want to check

1515
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,280
it out the title of the article is the

1516
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,760
value of uncertainty

1517
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,000
good okay uh

1518
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,359
last little bit and then we're done oh

1519
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,640
so

1520
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,640
um in and now we're going to come into

1521
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,040
the most speculative part of the idea

1522
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,119
and so then we'll stop and then we can

1523
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,400
we can talk about it and see where it

1524
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,359
goes so in the literature on well-being

1525
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,440
um researchers tend to congregate in a

1526
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,920
couple of big camps um and two of the

1527
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,920
most popular camps are thinking about

1528
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,760
well-being in terms of feeling good

1529
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,400
that's the hedonic camp and people who

1530
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,160
think that well-being is about being

1531
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,640
good and that's the eudaimonia camp and

1532
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,000
actually those go all the way back to

1533
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,240
aristotle featured here as the cool guy

1534
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,680
in the glasses so we speculate in our

1535
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,720
paper

1536
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,440
that actually we might be able to map

1537
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,119
those two subjective momentary

1538
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,880
subjective happiness and overall

1539
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,640
flourishing being a good sort of

1540
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,160
predictor on two forms of aerodynamics

1541
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,079
um

1542
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,680
a local form of aerodynamics and a

1543
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,680
global form of aerodynamics

1544
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,359
and we think that there's an uh good

1545
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,319
reason

1546
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,079
to start thinking about how we might

1547
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:19,240
distinguish between local and global

1548
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,160
aerodynamics um

1549
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,200
because for instance think about video

1550
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,480
game design okay so a well-crafted video

1551
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,520
game

1552
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,400
could be highly tailored in such a way

1553
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,559
that it provides you with just the right

1554
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,400
evolving changes

1555
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,640
to keep you continually making learning

1556
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,480
progress relative to the games you're

1557
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,079
going to keep finding those good slopes

1558
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,280
and we all know you know good game

1559
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,000
design does do that it keeps creating

1560
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,920
these good slopes of air reduction so do

1561
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,400
good casinos right um

1562
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,160
but um just like with substance

1563
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,480
addiction right you can get so immersed

1564
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,680
in those local good slopes that um you

1565
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,559
end up surfing them at the expense of

1566
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,319
the other things that matter in your

1567
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:03,599
life so you start neglecting your

1568
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,319
friendships and your schoolwork and your

1569
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,440
work um and your overall fitness okay so

1570
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,920
while you're succeeding locally at the

1571
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,640
game uh you're not flourishing overall

1572
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,760
because in fact there's going to be

1573
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,920
rising volatility

1574
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,760
across all of these other domains that

1575
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,079
you're temporarily not paying attention

1576
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:22,799
to

1577
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,440
right so sensitivity to global

1578
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,040
aerodynamics would essentially amount to

1579
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,920
being driven in ways that reflect

1580
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,920
how well we're managing errors across

1581
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,119
the various domains in our life and as

1582
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,240
long as an agent was using those more

1583
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,520
global

1584
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,359
estimations of how well or poorly

1585
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,280
they're doing over their various

1586
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,079
concerns uh to adjust their precision

1587
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,359
then you're going to have an agent who

1588
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,720
tends to stay in touch and who tends to

1589
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,440
move towards optimality relative to

1590
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,680
those multiple cares and concerns so

1591
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,760
you're not only improving locally but we

1592
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,880
think that there's good reason to think

1593
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,720
that we're also sensitive to how we're

1594
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,319
improving overall and that's going to

1595
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,400
play a special role in well-being in

1596
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,480
particular and um

1597
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,000
that makes

1598
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
if that's right if we're right here then

1599
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,319
that makes a really natural fit between

1600
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,760
this computational work that we've been

1601
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,079
interested in and more recent so-called

1602
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,400
network accounts of well-being where

1603
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,040
well-being is thought of as the result

1604
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,799
of tending to a complex ecosystem of

1605
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,319
positive states and positive

1606
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:31,599
achievements so then global aerodynamics

1607
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,319
would be crucial here we think to

1608
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,240
staying in touch with those various

1609
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,440
concerns

1610
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,079
in the kinds of way that would allow you

1611
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,280
as a whole

1612
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,480
to tend towards a good overall optimal

1613
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,480
shape um now like i said this is the

1614
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,559
most speculative part of the talk nobody

1615
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:49,760
has talked yet about thinking about

1616
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,480
aerodynamics happening in a nested way

1617
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,480
but i just want to say that we do have

1618
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,720
good reason to be thinking along that

1619
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,559
line it's unfortunate that lars isn't

1620
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,000
here with us tonight because it

1621
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,520
piggybacks on some of his deep

1622
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,760
parametric modeling so i was hoping to

1623
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,000
lay it off on him to really get into the

1624
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,240
computational nitty-gritty of why we're

1625
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,280
not just

1626
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,400
pulling this out of a hat for you um but

1627
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,799
we so we build up this idea

1628
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,200
that he's already been developing um and

1629
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,920
the idea is basically um

1630
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,760
he uses a deep parametric model and you

1631
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,920
can check out his paper on metacognition

1632
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,240
um if there's a way that we can um link

1633
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,000
this somewhere i can yeah we can okay

1634
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,160
i'll send it to you afterwards um but he

1635
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,760
ends up showing that you know there's

1636
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,559
higher level policies that are governing

1637
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,640
the allocation of precision on lower

1638
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,880
level tasks and the kind of cool thing

1639
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,079
about this deep parametric model is that

1640
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,400
it becomes possible to appreciate

1641
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,319
precisions over

1642
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,040
those higher level policies over

1643
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,200
precision allocation to particular tasks

1644
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,280
so you get this sort of nested you get

1645
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,240
this nested precision estimation where

1646
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,240
at the lower level you have precession

1647
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,000
precision being adjusted relative to a

1648
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,400
particular task at a higher level you

1649
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,760
have precision

1650
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,599
adjustments that are also effective we

1651
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,960
suspect uh being set over the policies

1652
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,599
about how you deploy your precisions

1653
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:12,480
over

1654
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,720
all the things you care about so that

1655
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,240
that better than or worse than the

1656
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,240
global better than or worse then is

1657
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,680
going to be all about are you doing

1658
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,520
better than or worse than a deploying

1659
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,520
precision across your various cares and

1660
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,160
concerns not relative to some local

1661
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,920
concern so then we think that what

1662
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,920
breaks down an addiction in particular

1663
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,760
is you start paying attention to

1664
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,000
aerodynamics locally in the drug seeking

1665
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,680
and taking behaviors and you actually

1666
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,920
have a separation of context and we see

1667
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,119
that in the brain right you see the

1668
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,720
striatum pull apart from the

1669
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,559
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex so the

1670
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,799
more contextualizing parts of the brain

1671
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,960
are no longer communicating in the same

1672
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,400
sorts of ways they were before because

1673
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,480
you have ultra high precision on these

1674
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,480
local aerodynamics so they're good again

1675
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,599
is a good example where we're going to

1676
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,359
get an insulated sort of psychotic

1677
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,280
markov blanket emerge because of an

1678
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,680
overestimation of precision because the

1679
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,880
the drugs of addiction are are

1680
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,039
making that happen so lars and myself

1681
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,440
are currently working on clarifying that

1682
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,440
aspect of the model so look forward to

1683
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,640
work soon on that um and we're looking

1684
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,480
at how we might apply that model to

1685
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,720
thinking about um meditative development

1686
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,960
thinking about attending to attention

1687
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,119
precision on precision modeling

1688
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,039
precision um

1689
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,880
and uh thinking about how those sorts of

1690
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,200
mechanisms might help us have better

1691
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,319
access to and be better guided by these

1692
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:33,359
higher level precision tuning processes

1693
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,480
um yeah so look forward to that and uh

1694
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,079
maybe that'll be another thing we can

1695
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,559
come on and uh talk about here on the

1696
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,640
lab and then hopefully lars will be uh

1697
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,480
not an emergency situation that time and

1698
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,839
he can come on

1699
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,760
great um

1700
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,920
so that's probably enough for me up

1701
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,839
maybe just as a final note before we

1702
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,880
turn it over to q a i might just say

1703
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,920
um the future directions for this are

1704
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,240
plenty if you buy some of the mechanisms

1705
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,760
that we've been thinking about right it

1706
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,200
would be cool to start now thinking

1707
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,160
about what sorts of endeavors encourage

1708
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,559
or disrupt that sort of meta-stable

1709
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:09,440
poise

1710
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,200
right meditation hallucinogens

1711
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,760
provocative art installations um you

1712
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,280
know are they are they helping or

1713
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,319
hindering

1714
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,839
um can we foster these metastable states

1715
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,319
you know and and how you so deep brain

1716
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,079
stimulation looks like it's doing

1717
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,359
something like this you're getting stuck

1718
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,760
in a tractor basin an ocd deep brain

1719
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,280
stimulation and julian can talk about

1720
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,880
that if it's an interesting point

1721
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,880
reopens up the field of affordances by

1722
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,000
creating more dynamic neural um

1723
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,319
ecosystems

1724
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,079
what does this mean for how we structure

1725
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,240
our environment if this is right if we

1726
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,839
flourish by hanging out at the edge of

1727
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,680
our own capabilities then what does that

1728
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,880
mean for how we structure our

1729
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,640
environment how should we build our

1730
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,000
cities i mean abby tabber at um at bath

1731
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,359
is doing incredible work on this

1732
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,720
thinking about how we might structure

1733
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,200
our cities in ways that are

1734
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,480
good for us and actually they turn out

1735
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,400
to be sort of paradoxically not making

1736
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,760
the city easier for us but making it

1737
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,160
more challenging getting more diversity

1738
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,640
more art installations more guerrilla

1739
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,720
gardening uh things because actually the

1740
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,799
more complexity we have actually the

1741
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,839
better we are as individuals and of

1742
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:15,760
course the biggest thing i'm working on

1743
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,000
right now here at uh hokkaido university

1744
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,760
is what does that mean for how we design

1745
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,839
our technology and how we consume our

1746
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,400
technology how about you know what role

1747
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,880
is misinformation as a digital crowbar

1748
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,119
uh prying us apart from the statistical

1749
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,599
realities of our environment what role

1750
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,640
is that playing if these flexible fluid

1751
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,400
dynamics are part of what it is to be

1752
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,559
well that's all that's all future stuff

1753
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,680
and uh if you're listening to this

1754
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,920
tonight and you think it's a cool talk

1755
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,000
and there's something of value here then

1756
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,599
uh that's the way i suggest starting to

1757
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,839
think next and i'd love to hear anybody

1758
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:50,240
you know here on q a but also um my door

1759
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,079
is always open if you uh if you sort of

1760
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,520
dig the talk and you dig the research

1761
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,960
then definitely reach out because we're

1762
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,119
we're always up for collaboration

1763
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,359
okay

1764
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,960
that's probably good for me you're

1765
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,839
welcome

1766
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:02,839
awesome

1767
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:06,799
so fun and so many cool ideas in there

1768
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,880
um anyone in the chat is welcome to

1769
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,200
provide a question and first i'll just

1770
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,799
pass to julian to maybe give any remarks

1771
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:15,520
or

1772
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,520
thoughts and then we'll see if there's

1773
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,799
any questions in the chat or some

1774
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,520
questions i've written down

1775
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,680
no i think mark did a great job so let's

1776
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,920
just jump straight into the q a

1777
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,480
thanks mark

1778
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,200
awesome um okay so

1779
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,599
you mentioned it kind of tantalizingly

1780
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,039
at the end about how we would

1781
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,240
differentially be using the technology

1782
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,119
and

1783
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,760
that just made me wonder like what would

1784
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,760
inactive inference

1785
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,319
social media look like or how would

1786
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:49,039
somebody of course not see any examples

1787
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,720
of it out in the wild how would we even

1788
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,799
go about imagining that kind of a system

1789
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,319
anybody else want to try to answer first

1790
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,520
because i've got something to say if

1791
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,440
anything comes up

1792
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,640
should i just should i just go

1793
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,240
yeah

1794
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,839
yeah i mean it's a good question it's

1795
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,839
something i'm really interested in um

1796
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,240
maybe one thing to say is uh

1797
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,880
you might think that uh there's a big

1798
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,280
market for making tech

1799
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,839
that uh reduces our option set

1800
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,319
um you know um that oh well this tech is

1801
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,640
great for us because it simplifies our

1802
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,799
affordance landscape and that's what

1803
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,000
people want they want a sort of

1804
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,160
simplified affordance landscape and the

1805
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,760
danger is is that actually we're going

1806
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,039
to be attracted to that because it's

1807
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,799
going to temporarily reduce free energy

1808
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,079
faster than we thought it would right

1809
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,880
google does a great job of

1810
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,119
quickly minimizing our uncertainty about

1811
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,480
various topics but over time uh you can

1812
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,319
have a sort of nasty outcome and i think

1813
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,079
we're starting to see that more and more

1814
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,160
where you collapse because it's so

1815
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,280
rewarding to come to one place like

1816
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,039
you know your smartphone ends up being

1817
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,039
one place to come again and again and

1818
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,520
again and over time your affordance

1819
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,960
landscape is collapsing it's

1820
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,039
increasingly collapsing to one and only

1821
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,799
one end it's a little bit like walmart

1822
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,880
you know it you know you want to buy

1823
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,480
there because you can get great deals

1824
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,599
but the problem is is that when the

1825
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,680
whole community buys there and all the

1826
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,080
mom and shop complexities go out of

1827
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,479
business uh then you're stuck just with

1828
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:19,759
walmart and then they put up their

1829
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,600
prices it's a little bit you know it's

1830
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,080
sort of like that you think that the

1831
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,279
collapsing

1832
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,439
uh tech is going to be good for us but

1833
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,520
actually over time having less

1834
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,880
complexity is harmful for us and think

1835
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,479
about social media platforms as well

1836
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,719
like you sterilize social interaction

1837
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,158
and it's really rewarding at first

1838
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,080
because social interaction is hard it's

1839
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,319
a complex affair you know it's very

1840
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,640
uncertain how to manage it to be with

1841
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,198
another human so temporarily online

1842
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:48,640
interactions can be really really

1843
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,839
rewarding because they're so much

1844
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,000
simplified but if you hang out there for

1845
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,920
too long and you lose some of your

1846
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,120
ability to

1847
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,120
engage with complex human affairs um

1848
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,719
then we're starting to see some of the

1849
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,799
ramifications of that sort of technology

1850
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:04,238
i mean we're literally

1851
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,399
dying of loneliness even though

1852
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:07,600
we're more

1853
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,439
superficially connected than we've ever

1854
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:10,799
been and i think that would be an

1855
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,319
interesting project is to start thinking

1856
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,679
about

1857
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,920
what is working when we have complex

1858
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,759
ecosystems of social interactions that

1859
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,319
we're losing by just using social media

1860
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,880
platforms for our social interaction

1861
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,719
yeah julian

1862
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,719
yeah so i was thinking about uh

1863
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,399
intellectual humility as this is

1864
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:29,600
something we've been talking about

1865
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,960
before and

1866
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,759
how important it is to

1867
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:36,880
be open to prediction errors if you're

1868
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,560
going to get the most out of social

1869
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,679
media

1870
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,158
so you can think of

1871
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:44,399
filter bubbles as a kind of psychotic

1872
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,799
markov blanket in a way and that

1873
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,359
there is insulation from any evidence

1874
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,640
that doesn't

1875
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,238
match with your

1876
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:54,480
your predictions or match with your

1877
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,480
expectations

1878
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,679
um

1879
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,159
so in order to flourish

1880
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:03,040
to to live well with social media

1881
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,520
perhaps what's necessary is

1882
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,320
is this kind of openness to

1883
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,239
uh other contradictory points of view

1884
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,360
um

1885
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,679
uh what the ancients would have thought

1886
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,600
of as humility

1887
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,840
and we need to foster that to be well

1888
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,760
with technologies

1889
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,440
so inis what do you think about filter

1890
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,440
bubbles as an example of

1891
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,600
a psychotic markov blanket do you think

1892
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,679
that's a stretch or does it fit with

1893
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,120
your

1894
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,920
the way that you describe this this

1895
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,159
insulation from sensory evidence that

1896
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:40,480
happens that can induce a kind of

1897
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,000
solipsism

1898
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,960
right

1899
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,800
yeah absolutely i think it's uh exactly

1900
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,040
on the right track um actually uh the

1901
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,120
way that algorithms are constructed to

1902
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,640
deliver precisely these bubbles in

1903
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,560
social media

1904
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,600
it's so interesting because it's

1905
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,960
precisely what's going to happen a

1906
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,719
psychological markov blanket because

1907
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,560
it's just going to be insulated from

1908
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,960
that amount of information making

1909
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,800
inferences about that

1910
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,640
that precisely precise information

1911
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,719
without having any other

1912
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:08,960
contact or exchange outside of the

1913
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,640
bubble so that

1914
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,560
that's very interesting as well and

1915
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,480
there are many many other forms of

1916
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,080
psychotic markov blankets that you can

1917
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,120
find in the societies and communities

1918
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,440
and um that kind of thing

1919
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,480
um

1920
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,400
but i didn't want to address exciting

1921
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,560
things about the concept that it's scale

1922
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,760
free

1923
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,880
so uh now you see it at collective

1924
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,760
levels of self-organization not just

1925
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,159
but also the level of the cell you show

1926
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,719
so that nmda receptor you can also think

1927
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,040
of in terms of

1928
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:41,760
a

1929
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,120
yeah psychology yeah

1930
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,120
yes i didn't have time to present that

1931
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,320
here uh because uh yeah but um but

1932
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,320
that's that's also formulated under the

1933
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,640
disconnection hypothesis

1934
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,280
by carl so it's also really cool because

1935
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,000
it's at a cellular level so it's quite

1936
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,760
interesting if anyone is interested so

1937
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,040
that would be also

1938
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,000
what we are um applying or looking at in

1939
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,320
the in this paper is another example of

1940
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,640
a psychotic markup blanket where there's

1941
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,920
a an imbalance between um

1942
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,280
again what i was saying the sensory in

1943
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,159
the active states formulated there um as

1944
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,640
the receptor so and specifically for

1945
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,880
schizophrenia but then you can scale all

1946
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,480
of these up and find all of these

1947
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,960
psychotic markov blankets um in many

1948
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,239
different levels and i think that in the

1949
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:31,520
case of social media the bubbles are an

1950
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,360
excellent example

1951
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,440
but i think that we also have that as

1952
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,360
mark was mentioning and i always i

1953
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,600
always find it's very interesting uh

1954
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,040
when we discuss this topic about um

1955
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,120
about how um

1956
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,600
specifically um the

1957
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,360
city living

1958
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,159
as an environmental

1959
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,920
daily living space

1960
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,040
influence

1961
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,880
mental health and

1962
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,159
and

1963
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,960
and specifically

1964
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,679
why and when some groups of individuals

1965
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,239
thrive in an urban setting so this is

1966
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:07,920
something that some people here in

1967
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,920
amsterdam for example are working on and

1968
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,719
it's really interesting um and i think

1969
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,560
that it becomes even more interesting if

1970
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,400
we come for example from

1971
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,880
studies in neurodiversity for example in

1972
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,640
autism and that kind of thing and if we

1973
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,960
think about the design of these spaces

1974
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,320
um daily spaces daily living spaces that

1975
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,880
um are not designed for example for

1976
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,440
diverse ways of interacting with worlds

1977
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,600
such as an autistic

1978
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,520
interacting with the world so i think

1979
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,000
that um it is very relevant to think

1980
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
about

1981
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,960
these

1982
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,400
mental problems and how we can inform

1983
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,560
interventions in the city planning and

1984
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,840
also

1985
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,239
smart environments um

1986
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,760
that would allow a more diverse way of

1987
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,679
interacting with the environment as

1988
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,640
opposed to reducing the complexity of

1989
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,880
the environment which is exactly what

1990
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,480
mark was talking about and i just wanted

1991
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,360
to add that um to that

1992
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,040
yeah we're actually working with a

1993
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,640
pretty cool group through the nested

1994
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,199
minds network um developing models of

1995
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,040
anti-fragility and what we're calling

1996
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,880
tropophilia which is the love of

1997
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,880
uncertainty so you're not just growing

1998
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,480
from volatility but you're actually

1999
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,400
seeking volatility in order to grow and

2000
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,679
we're thinking about it at the level of

2001
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,760
communities so um we're still just

2002
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,360
getting started but um it's a really

2003
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,920
fascinating really fascinating field

2004
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,560
yeah so one comment on that and then a

2005
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,719
question from the chat um julian you

2006
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,960
pointed out that active inference as a

2007
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,520
scale free and sort of uh base system

2008
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,719
agnostic framework really helps draw out

2009
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,800
these similarities across systems and

2010
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
then mark in the in the presentation you

2011
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,800
talked about neural ecosystems about

2012
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,000
social social media ecosystems and then

2013
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,840
thinking about some of these pathologies

2014
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,159
or perceived pathologies in an ecosystem

2015
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:55,920
case i mean imagine if someone said i

2016
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,600
like this tree this should be the only

2017
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,840
tree or i'm seeing a little tension here

2018
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,600
with a predator and the prey we should

2019
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,239
separate those two species

2020
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,239
those would lead to a catastrophic

2021
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,320
collapse because it wouldn't be the frat

2022
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,159
it wouldn't be the anti-fragile

2023
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,000
ecosystem that

2024
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,520
was the one that had made it all the way

2025
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,040
to the present moment and was existing

2026
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,719
far from equilibrium so it's sort of

2027
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,040
like when we can look across systems it

2028
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,480
gives us a new way to look at the

2029
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,719
systems that we can modify the nisha of

2030
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,440
like our cities the internet and then

2031
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,400
starts

2032
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,920
hopefully shining some light on where we

2033
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,760
can look

2034
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,920
here's the question from the chat dean

2035
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,600
wrote remark

2036
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,920
a simple provisioning rule

2037
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,400
when in doubt zoom in

2038
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,800
comma zoom out so that's dean's

2039
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,920
providing that is sort of like a little

2040
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,679
simple uh motto

2041
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,000
as an attending strategy could this be a

2042
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,080
happy person setting up a local or

2043
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,040
global non-isolating markov blanket like

2044
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,640
how do we go from these mathematical

2045
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,480
framings and some of these aerodynamics

2046
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,040
into nice slogans like dean does

2047
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,440
no i love that i mean right yeah exactly

2048
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,600
yeah look look close and look far i mean

2049
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,280
that's that sounds like that sounds like

2050
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,840
super good advice

2051
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,360
um a little bit you know this a little

2052
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,640
bit follows on from the same point

2053
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,040
julian was making earlier about virtue

2054
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,159
about some of the like what would the

2055
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,679
virtues be

2056
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:14,480
uh

2057
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,880
relative to this kind of good updating

2058
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,520
system and um i've been meaning to do a

2059
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,800
i've been meaning to write something on

2060
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,120
this for a long time now and you know

2061
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,800
i'm getting more and more motivated as

2062
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,400
we go along but have you ever heard of

2063
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,560
super forecasters have you heard of this

2064
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,719
it's a book out called super forecasters

2065
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,320
so there's people around the world who

2066
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,400
go to competitions and they predict

2067
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,239
things from noisy data sets and you can

2068
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,239
train in it and you get in a team you

2069
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:40,560
can do individual events and people can

2070
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,239
get better so you can train to be a

2071
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,560
super forecaster so you take noisy data

2072
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,560
you get good at predicting it and i like

2073
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,000
this idea because i think it's a nice

2074
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,600
metaphor you know i think we might be

2075
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,960
able to glean like if we're all

2076
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,159
predictors

2077
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,080
and we're trying to predict well then

2078
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,679
maybe there's something to learn from

2079
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,080
people who try to predict well as a

2080
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,840
hobby you know and try to see like what

2081
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,320
are they doing right um and there's some

2082
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,320
really interesting things that they do

2083
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,640
uh that i think are um

2084
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,560
useful given the kind of framework that

2085
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,560
we're proposing here a couple of them i

2086
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,679
think just everybody should know about

2087
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:13,679
one a super forecaster across the board

2088
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,360
the best the best super forecasters in

2089
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,440
the world they share a couple of common

2090
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,920
traits they are curious

2091
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,320
so they're always interested not just in

2092
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,520
their own field but they're interested

2093
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,199
in lots of field they tend to be

2094
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,120
polymaths so they're interested in lots

2095
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,199
of different sorts of things that's one

2096
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,280
thing the second thing and this is a

2097
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,040
little bit i feel like is related to

2098
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,440
this zoom in zoom out point and also

2099
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,360
exactly what julian said is that they

2100
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,440
have they have they hold so this active

2101
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,040
inference language but they hold

2102
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,719
high-level beliefs

2103
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,400
that all of their beliefs are only

2104
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,400
relatively right

2105
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,120
so

2106
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:47,920
um

2107
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,000
they know that when they're looking at

2108
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,560
something not to get too enamored by it

2109
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,120
because it's up for updating at any time

2110
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,960
so they're always checking it against

2111
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,560
the other things they know they're the

2112
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,400
kind of person that when you meet them

2113
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,840
in public and you tell them something

2114
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:03,440
they don't know they don't lock down and

2115
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,040
say no no i can't be like that no no you

2116
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,640
know they're the kind of person who says

2117
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,000
wow wow i didn't know that tell me more

2118
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,480
about that so i can update i can update

2119
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,239
my overall model

2120
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:16,560
relative to how the world is

2121
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,040
anyway i think i think these like

2122
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,560
this this approach to zooming in and

2123
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,320
zooming out sounds just right and i

2124
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,520
think it's so cool to start thinking

2125
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,360
about what some what are some of the

2126
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,679
practical virtues that would help us not

2127
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,560
get stuck and i think uh yes

2128
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,320
follow up on that so yeah i think what

2129
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,679
you just described to the super

2130
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,600
forecasters is

2131
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,199
something that goes back to the ancients

2132
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:40,080
again the peronean skeptics who put

2133
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,800
forward the idea that we shouldn't

2134
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,760
do we shouldn't endorse a

2135
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,760
proposition but nor should we withhold

2136
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,000
our endorsement we should rather try to

2137
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,080
find this balance

2138
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,000
and what you're describing with the

2139
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,920
super forecasters with that kind of

2140
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,480
hybrid project i think is exactly that

2141
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,159
same kind of

2142
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:00,880
uh

2143
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,600
balance well that's the paper peyronian

2144
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,960
skepticism

2145
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,719
through the lens of active inference

2146
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,960
that's

2147
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,040
realm it made me think about skepticism

2148
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,199
and like almost like a bayesian stoicism

2149
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,120
like okay the info has come in through

2150
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,199
the channel it came in from i would like

2151
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,840
to learn more i will marginally update

2152
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,080
like that sort of approach and then also

2153
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,040
another

2154
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,120
dialectic that you brought up that it'd

2155
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,320
be interesting to hear a little more

2156
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,280
about is that hedonic short-term

2157
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,480
happiness

2158
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,320
versus that um the eudemonia the longer

2159
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,719
term happiness just like that's super

2160
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,960
fascinating to see how

2161
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,640
you mapped

2162
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,280
two pillars of philosophy really going

2163
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,800
so far back

2164
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,600
and

2165
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,840
integrate them in in a new way like

2166
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,600
where do we go from there how do we

2167
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,800
think about these kinds of cool

2168
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,600
synthesis between philosophy and

2169
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,000
computational dynamics

2170
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,440
i love that julie do you want to say

2171
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,800
anything on that

2172
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,400
if not i could maybe start and you could

2173
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,719
follow on what do you think yeah so uh

2174
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,400
the way we were thinking about it was

2175
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,480
though to take i don't know if mark did

2176
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,320
this example in the talks i had to pop

2177
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,280
out but the computer game example did

2178
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,440
you go through that mark yes exactly you

2179
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,000
know you might you might find a

2180
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,920
a computer game that gives you just the

2181
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,679
right amount of challenges to keep you

2182
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:24,960
constantly

2183
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,719
making progress in

2184
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:28,400
playing the game

2185
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,560
but still in the rest of the person's

2186
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,639
life

2187
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,560
going to school

2188
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,920
uh having your friendships grow

2189
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,679
your family life all of these things

2190
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,080
could be suffering

2191
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:42,960
so

2192
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,800
they're just finding local pleasure

2193
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,719
which we can assume the computer game

2194
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:49,120
might continually give the person

2195
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,880
by presenting them with this constant

2196
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:51,920
challenge

2197
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,000
in the end wouldn't be conducive to

2198
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,320
flourishing for that person because all

2199
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,560
of the other aspects of their life that

2200
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,960
are also valuable and important to them

2201
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,120
would end up being neglected

2202
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,520
so thinking about that from a a

2203
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,840
dynamical or a computational perspective

2204
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,679
it seems what's important

2205
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:12,080
is a kind of psychological flexibility

2206
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,679
or

2207
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,600
and that

2208
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,360
you're able to

2209
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,679
be poised between

2210
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,840
exploiting and exploring

2211
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,760
so the person who's playing the computer

2212
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,360
game is really just stuck in a kind of

2213
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,199
exploitative mode

2214
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:28,400
where

2215
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,159
that's continually

2216
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:31,040
um

2217
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,679
yielding something rewarding for them

2218
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:35,920
because they're continually presented

2219
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,639
with challenges that they can solve

2220
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,560
but at the same time they're not

2221
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,800
exploring they're not curious

2222
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,159
and so there's not that kind of

2223
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,320
psychological flexibility which we think

2224
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,080
is required for

2225
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,639
eudaimonia or

2226
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:51,920
really living a good life and

2227
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,880
flourishing as a person

2228
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,120
and so we think what you get out of

2229
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,600
active inference then is is a

2230
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,920
neuro computational frameworks a

2231
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,520
biological story but also a

2232
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,520
computational story

2233
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,840
about uh what it might be to to as a

2234
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,440
person live a good life

2235
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,280
what might be required is this kind of

2236
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,679
openness and flexibility

2237
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,280
yeah yeah it's great

2238
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,800
two other quick things on the tale of

2239
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,560
that one is

2240
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,719
you know there's a very old debate about

2241
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,880
higher and lower hedonia

2242
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,520
yeah the low hedonia is the sort of

2243
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,000
animal life that causes all the problems

2244
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,520
higher hedonia but there is higher

2245
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,600
hedonia that leads you to whatever the

2246
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,440
good life is that's kind of interesting

2247
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,719
from this perspective as well because

2248
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,960
you can think about it i think maybe

2249
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,080
as lower hedonia is aerodynamics in

2250
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,000
niches that lead you away from the sort

2251
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
of metastable attunement

2252
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,760
right so drugs of addiction is a good

2253
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,239
example of lower hedonia because it's

2254
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,639
good prediction error slopes

2255
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,840
but they're only local at the expense of

2256
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,080
your more integrated

2257
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,400
holistic optimality

2258
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,400
of governing

2259
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,280
state right but what would a higher

2260
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,920
hedonia be well it would be a local good

2261
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,120
slope

2262
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,239
that leads you to a greater integration

2263
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:13,840
so at the tail end of our paper and i

2264
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,440
didn't mention it here because it's a

2265
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,040
bit of a further topic but we suggested

2266
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,040
maybe thinking about zero sum and

2267
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,600
non-zero sum activities and their role

2268
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,360
in producing or

2269
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,360
restricting these sorts of metastable

2270
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,199
attunements and i think that's a good

2271
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:28,639
example where you can get you can get

2272
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,120
hot about some small thing that reduces

2273
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,280
your dynamicism so you get this global

2274
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,880
rising in air even though you're locally

2275
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,800
succeeding that's a nice i think it's a

2276
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,960
nice way to think about lower hedonia

2277
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,679
higher hedonias local good slopes that

2278
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:45,440
encourage and expand and and generate a

2279
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,480
richer and more complex uh ecosystem of

2280
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,880
good slopes in your life so for instance

2281
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:51,760
like

2282
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,800
well like think about the things that

2283
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,880
are endlessly rewarding

2284
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,400
you know love

2285
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,880
relationships you know like you're never

2286
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,719
going to get to the end of being a good

2287
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,080
husband or wife you're never going to

2288
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,600
get to the end of being a good older

2289
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,400
brother or being a good dad good mom

2290
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,199
you're never going to get to the end of

2291
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:08,560
those that's that's an endless thing or

2292
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,600
patience patience compassion love

2293
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,520
you know sympathy empathy i mean you're

2294
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,560
never going to get to the end of those

2295
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,400
things service service to the people

2296
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,560
into your community service is such a

2297
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,199
good example here if you feel good like

2298
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,360
if you get good slopes in serving your

2299
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,199
community you're just going to keep

2300
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,520
creating more connections

2301
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,040
that are going to create more

2302
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,840
opportunities for new kinds of slopes to

2303
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,639
be caught and encouraged so i think it's

2304
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,000
it's perfect almost you know it's a

2305
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
local slope that leads to lots more

2306
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,360
other stuff and just one other quick

2307
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,280
thing and i won't i won't i won't harp

2308
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,560
on about it but

2309
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,159
uh and i think also that uh a system

2310
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:47,920
that's set up to be

2311
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,159
uh to have this more global aerodynamic

2312
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,159
regime working correctly i think they'll

2313
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:56,400
also tend to have more subjective

2314
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,000
happiness

2315
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,360
and it would be good to like go through

2316
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,719
this and build a

2317
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,199
detailed computational model because

2318
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,159
this part is just a little bit

2319
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,080
speculative but it seems to me that if

2320
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:09,440
you have a really rich diverse ecosystem

2321
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:12,239
of good slopes then if you reach the end

2322
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,159
of some particular slope like let's say

2323
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:16,480
you lose the video game if the video

2324
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,719
game is the only thing you have

2325
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,639
no wonder we have a problem regulating

2326
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,800
our emotions if you know you see this on

2327
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,800
youtube all the time you know mom or dad

2328
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,239
turns off the system and there's an

2329
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:27,840
explosion and they say so this is the

2330
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,520
only thing i have right so you're very

2331
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,360
very rigid you're very fragile with only

2332
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,199
one outcome but if you have lots of

2333
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,280
stuff going on in your life then if you

2334
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,520
lose a good slope here it's just a

2335
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,679
matter of task switching over to the

2336
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:42,480
next good slope and so i tend to think

2337
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,480
that people who have a diversity of good

2338
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,920
slopes in their life of course they're

2339
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,199
also going to have

2340
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,040
more persistent more pervasive good

2341
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,560
feelings

2342
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,080
but you know that's a bit speculative so

2343
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,520
love the look

2344
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,600
this local global nested slopes descent

2345
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,520
i think it really helps us understand

2346
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,000
active inference but also understands or

2347
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,920
helps us understand how to apply active

2348
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,840
inference because it doesn't have to be

2349
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,239
an active inference model about emotion

2350
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:09,600
but that's the one we're talking about

2351
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,040
but it could be some other kind of

2352
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,960
active inference model so kind of just

2353
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,920
two other um concordances i guess

2354
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,480
uh cezanne mahali's flow and flow

2355
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,719
psychology it's like you mentioned

2356
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:22,639
selecting the right kind of errors and

2357
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,560
so it's like there's there's being in

2358
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,880
the flow state of playing chess or of

2359
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,120
doing a skill and then there's like

2360
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,360
getting the rock out of your shoe it's

2361
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,400
like you're you're still in this sort of

2362
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,560
uncertainty regime but one of those is

2363
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,239
just delaying you on the journey and the

2364
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,960
other one kind of is the journey so that

2365
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,400
and then one other

2366
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,560
it's dead on it's dead on actually john

2367
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,320
verveigh at the university of toronto

2368
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,239
and i are planning a paper

2369
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:51,040
using this exact model to think about

2370
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,639
flow as cascading cascading insight so

2371
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,560
every time you reduce you hit that good

2372
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,320
slope and then you learn that's what the

2373
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,920
good slope is you're learning and when

2374
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,360
you get to the end of that learning what

2375
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,000
it does is it opens up a new good slope

2376
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,920
that you learn down which opens up a new

2377
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,679
good slope which you learn down and that

2378
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:10,000
happens in a sort of cascading a

2379
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,719
cascading pattern yeah i love that

2380
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,159
so that that

2381
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,560
perfectly comes to the second example

2382
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,639
the cascading insight like so many

2383
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:20,560
people whether they're in academia or

2384
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,400
just curious about something

2385
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,719
when they get a quote answer they say

2386
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:25,920
well you know just brought up so many

2387
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,360
more questions like now i know how much

2388
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,440
this planet is in diameter but now i'm

2389
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,120
curious about something else and so it's

2390
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,760
like that that short term minimization

2391
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,320
is like disciplinary research like we

2392
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,719
had 25 efficiency on this chemistry

2393
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,960
extraction we got the 27 it's a local

2394
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,480
who could who can say that's not a local

2395
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,120
improvement but then that global

2396
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,760
is the transdisciplinary understanding

2397
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,480
and as the research ecosystem if we just

2398
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,120
dove down local disciplinary rabbit

2399
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,080
holes we would end up with just a wreck

2400
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,920
but at the same time we do need to do

2401
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,840
some local gradient descent otherwise

2402
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,760
we're not extracting that compound so

2403
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,600
what can we build our transdisciplinary

2404
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,320
theory on and so it's just like

2405
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,760
very cool how we can um have a positive

2406
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,600
um i don't know can it be neutral and

2407
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,440
positive at the same time

2408
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,159
yeah yeah why not yeah it's positive in

2409
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,080
the sense that it's not negative uh i

2410
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,920
but i i love that and i think that's a i

2411
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,440
think it's a role that philosophers are

2412
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,239
increasingly um playing you know

2413
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,679
what you might call synthetic

2414
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,560
philosophers um philosophers who are

2415
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,000
trained in various scientific

2416
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,280
disciplines the neighboring scientific

2417
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,440
disciplines around a certain topic like

2418
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,679
dan dennett you know who are able to

2419
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:37,840
zoom out and create good overall

2420
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,040
frameworks that sort of uh that bring

2421
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,120
together various disciplines as well as

2422
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,360
the special sciences that zoom in that

2423
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,440
zoom in and uh discover locally they

2424
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,280
come in on this because i think one of

2425
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,960
the interesting thing is the three of us

2426
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,199
here are all philosophers so

2427
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:55,199
we will come at active inference through

2428
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:56,560
philosophy

2429
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,560
but through trying to do that synthetic

2430
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,320
kind of philosophy where

2431
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,040
we're integrating philosophy with

2432
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,000
neuroscience with biology

2433
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,520
and

2434
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,639
so that's a common theme and another

2435
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,639
thing that i think is interesting among

2436
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,639
the three of us is that we're all

2437
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,320
thinking about active influence as

2438
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,159
something that

2439
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,480
is environment involving so one of the

2440
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,360
crucial interesting things i think in

2441
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,120
innis's work on

2442
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,199
the psychotic mark off blankets is what

2443
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,800
happens when you are

2444
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,960
you're you have a

2445
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,360
a free energy minimizing system that's

2446
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,960
insulated or isolated from

2447
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,440
what's coming in from the environment

2448
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,800
and how that can induce pathologies

2449
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,560
and a lot of the things we've been

2450
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,239
talking about today are about kind of

2451
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,800
designing an ecosystem

2452
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,840
where

2453
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,600
being in that kind of environment would

2454
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,480
help you to flourish as an individual so

2455
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,719
what would uh how would you need social

2456
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,239
media to look

2457
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:00,960
if it was instead of creating

2458
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,719
the kind of social pathologies that

2459
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:04,239
we're seeing today

2460
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:07,520
with the misinformation problems and

2461
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,280
all of the problems that are arising

2462
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,400
from polarization you had a a social

2463
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,080
media environment in which people

2464
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,600
flourish

2465
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,520
and so we think that

2466
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,760
these ideas about active inference

2467
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,360
if you have a philosophical perspective

2468
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,280
on them you can see how they

2469
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,480
they could

2470
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,840
help you to

2471
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,880
know to think about ethical questions

2472
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,760
maybe political questions as well

2473
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,679
it's about synthetic perspective that

2474
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,679
philosophy can bring

2475
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:38,080
helps you to see how to

2476
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,719
to take this framework and

2477
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:41,679
and

2478
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:43,679
show how it can be applied in lots of

2479
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:44,960
different domains

2480
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,080
i think that was something that you

2481
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,239
touched on daniel in one of your

2482
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:51,120
observations questions

2483
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,920
awesome man i think it's a valuable

2484
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,920
contribution that philosophers can make

2485
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,760
from from using these ideas

2486
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,560
totally we see advances in philosophy

2487
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,800
alongside and deeply interwoven with

2488
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,440
governance and technology so here's just

2489
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,239
one

2490
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:10,159
last question i wanted to ask on that

2491
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,159
theme unless anyone has any other

2492
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:15,280
questions and this is um to and as his

2493
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,520
section so you talked about

2494
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,520
thinking about using active inference as

2495
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,480
a model which was invoking this realism

2496
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,159
instrumentalism

2497
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,840
distinction that we had talked about in

2498
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,679
some other streams

2499
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,080
and i just wondered how will realism

2500
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,880
versus instrumentalism or potentially

2501
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,360
other philosophical ideas play out

2502
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,960
clinically like

2503
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,159
what will it look like to

2504
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:42,320
deploy something instrumentally and say

2505
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,880
that for example this is being supported

2506
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,560
by a mathematical framework but that's

2507
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,199
not what is per se happening inside of

2508
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:51,440
you it's just how we're instrumentally

2509
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,199
interacting with it i don't know just

2510
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:55,040
how will that kind of a philosophical

2511
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,080
nuance

2512
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,480
enter into the regular protocols of

2513
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:01,599
medicine or governance

2514
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,760
um yeah um so i think that um

2515
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,120
instrumentalism is very much aligned

2516
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,000
with dynamical systems theory take on

2517
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,719
cognition or on brain activity

2518
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,719
right so it doesn't need to be something

2519
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,239
that um

2520
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,480
is highly mystical or that is like a

2521
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,239
framework that we use but then what can

2522
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:22,800
we do with it really like in in medicine

2523
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,960
or in more experimental settings right

2524
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,920
it's just that it's not um committed to

2525
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,159
a more computationalist

2526
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:31,120
account

2527
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,719
of cognition or of the brain it's much

2528
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:34,560
more aligned with for example in this

2529
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,480
framework with the dynamical systems

2530
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,520
theory as in the case of being

2531
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,600
a tool that is useful to

2532
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,520
explain and describe um

2533
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,679
an activity of scientific interests

2534
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,679
through some constructs that we know are

2535
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:54,560
constructs that are we build for our own

2536
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,960
scientific practice and understanding

2537
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,520
right so that's the idea

2538
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,080
so um

2539
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,639
it is useful in the sense that you can

2540
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:07,199
you can now put things together and make

2541
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:09,440
this activity that would otherwise be a

2542
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:13,040
blur intelligible in a scientific sense

2543
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:16,080
by using these constructs which you can

2544
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,679
think about it for example from

2545
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:19,760
dynamical systems theory

2546
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,920
mark was mentioning these attractors for

2547
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,719
example which by the way um i'd like to

2548
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,880
say something about that um

2549
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,280
um in the case of um for example in

2550
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,199
psychopathology there is this kind of

2551
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:33,520
like fixed points or attractors that

2552
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,840
kind of like we need to change etc we

2553
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,920
are not saying that there is actually a

2554
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,159
fixed point or an attractor

2555
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:42,000
in the psychopathology but we are

2556
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,600
explaining

2557
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,320
this in this sense for our own or to

2558
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,360
make these patterns intelligible

2559
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,840
from a scientific point of view

2560
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,239
right so it's in this sense that you can

2561
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,800
use this instrumentalist account to say

2562
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,000
that

2563
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,080
you gain explanatory attraction but

2564
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,760
you're not saying that actually there is

2565
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,560
a fixed point in the behavior itself

2566
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,679
does this help

2567
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:11,280
yeah i think so i mean if someone looks

2568
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,000
at an economic model and it uses a

2569
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,600
regression it's not saying the economy

2570
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,280
is a regression but then there's

2571
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,560
something about

2572
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,440
the the personal nature of the brain and

2573
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,800
our emotions

2574
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,199
where it feels almost like a model of

2575
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:29,040
emotion or emotional dynamics

2576
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,480
it's something that's been brought up

2577
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,080
many times i mean a lot of people like

2578
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,040
qualitative perspectives on these topics

2579
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,960
because it

2580
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,719
it averts this whole discussion on

2581
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,400
whether the mathematical models are real

2582
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,400
or instrumental and it almost feels like

2583
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,199
now with that philosophical clarity

2584
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:47,040
to be able to frame the two different

2585
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,360
modes we have there we can distinguish

2586
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,800
very clearly

2587
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,320
instrumentalism from a sort of

2588
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,000
background of

2589
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,239
implicit realism and then that would

2590
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:58,480
maybe help speak to a broader set of

2591
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,320
people who have different beliefs and

2592
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,000
different structures for what they think

2593
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,760
is the underlying system

2594
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,920
can i comment on this briefly yeah

2595
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:06,719
please

2596
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:08,960
yes i i think i take a different

2597
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,960
perspective reminisce on the realism

2598
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,199
instrumentalism issue

2599
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:16,239
so i i start from the cybernetic idea of

2600
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,960
the good regulator theorem that ashby

2601
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,119
put forward and

2602
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:22,719
i think that gives us a way of thinking

2603
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:27,280
about how values are actually built into

2604
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,280
living systems

2605
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,159
and so the idea of being a model of the

2606
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,560
environment it's not just having a model

2607
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,560
but actually being a model

2608
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,960
and how you can be a good model

2609
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,440
so what does it take to be a good model

2610
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,560
while there has to be as much complexity

2611
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,480
in the model as there is in the

2612
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:49,199
environment that you're interacting with

2613
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:52,000
so i think what we get out of there

2614
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,960
um

2615
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,360
out of ashby's good regulated theorem is

2616
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,920
an idea about what it is to be

2617
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,400
well adapted to the environment

2618
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,880
and i don't take that just to be like a

2619
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,560
model of

2620
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,760
uh of life or of systems that are well

2621
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,080
adapted but that we can actually get

2622
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,800
some principles that tell us how would a

2623
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,880
system need to be organized in order to

2624
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,880
be well adapted

2625
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,440
um and those principles yeah i mean they

2626
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,199
are a model i agree

2627
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,040
but they actually tell us something

2628
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,639
about

2629
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:25,679
the

2630
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,400
organization that a complex adaptive

2631
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,159
system would need to have

2632
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:33,119
if it was to remain well adapted over

2633
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:36,320
time so if it was to be a good model

2634
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,000
and then we can get some kind of value

2635
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,239
or normativity out of that because

2636
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,880
notice that there's a notion of goodness

2637
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,880
implied here that we're thinking about

2638
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,800
what would it take for a model to be a

2639
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,199
good model of its environment for it to

2640
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:51,360
remain well adapted when there's a kind

2641
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,239
of value or normativity implied there as

2642
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:56,239
well

2643
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:58,400
so i think all of that is not just there

2644
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,800
about you know finding

2645
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,199
explanatory models that

2646
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:03,920
do

2647
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,639
a good job for us as scientists but

2648
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:08,639
it's also telling us something about

2649
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,080
what it is to

2650
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,679
to be alive

2651
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:13,440
what it is to

2652
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,960
to be

2653
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,119
a good cognizer

2654
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,040
so that we could begin to get some kind

2655
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,600
of values out of biology

2656
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,480
and i take that to be a kind of realist

2657
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,239
project

2658
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:27,840
and

2659
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,960
because

2660
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,199
you know i think that

2661
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:33,280
we can

2662
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,080
we can get some motion or value

2663
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,199
ourselves

2664
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:40,400
free energy minimization in fact i think

2665
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,960
the notion of free energy is itself a

2666
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,520
kind of value for a system that tells a

2667
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:48,880
a system what it is to and to be well

2668
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,920
adapted it's well adapted if it

2669
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,800
if it is first of all minimizing free

2670
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,440
energy over time but we saw from marx

2671
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,679
talking from our paper that on its own

2672
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:01,280
isn't sufficient

2673
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:03,040
you need in addition this kind of

2674
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:06,000
maintaining less stable poise

2675
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
uh so now all of that is just to say

2676
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,199
well i think we can get some

2677
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,719
um

2678
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:15,360
some something more than just a model

2679
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,360
out of free energy free energy principle

2680
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,800
we can get

2681
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,280
some principles which help us to make

2682
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,639
sense of how there could be values in a

2683
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,040
in a world of facts

2684
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,159
and so it helps us with that question it

2685
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:32,239
may help us to understand

2686
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,280
you know

2687
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,159
what it is to live a good life so

2688
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:38,320
and how could you have

2689
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,040
natural systems that flourish

2690
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,440
so we could get some kind of

2691
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,119
um naturalistic account of

2692
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:50,800
uh of ethical values

2693
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,480
now so that would be my take on it and i

2694
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,239
think that's kind of different from from

2695
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:56,400
instrumentalism a different kind of

2696
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,400
perspective on instrumentalism i think

2697
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,800
you can also get out for free energy

2698
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,159
principles

2699
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:04,080
there's a debate here isn't there and

2700
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,840
that's one of the things that philosophy

2701
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:06,880
can bring in there's different

2702
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,800
perspectives you can have on

2703
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,520
what the free energy principle means

2704
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,600
and then we can fight about that amongst

2705
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,800
ourselves as philosophers

2706
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,320
great closing point we respect and value

2707
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,440
the uh

2708
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,440
the content but then also there's that

2709
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,760
hyper philosophical prior that the space

2710
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,520
for the debate and the space for

2711
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,119
different perspectives is itself

2712
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:31,760
important so with that

2713
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,239
thanks to all of you this was an awesome

2714
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:36,239
session you're always as well as anyone

else welcome to come back share any

2716
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,280

01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,480
so

2718
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,719
