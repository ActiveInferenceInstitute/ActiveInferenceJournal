1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,120
hello everyone it's april 25th 2022

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,519
we're here with adam saffron and today

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,600
we're going to be having a guest stream

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
the radically embodied conscious

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,760
cybernetic bayesian brain from free

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,199
energy to free will and back again so

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,680
adam thanks a ton for joining on this

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,439
day really looking forward to your

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,840
presentation and thanks again adam take

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,160
it away

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,160
uh thank you for inviting me and um or

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,079
letting me come to talk with you and

13
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,920
see i'll present some ideas from a

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,160
uh recent manuscript in

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,640
entropy called the radically embodied

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,960
conscious cybernetic bayesian brain

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
from free will from free energy to free

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,840
will and back again

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,680
and after that looking forward to

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,199
discussing some of the ideas with all of

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,039
you and um

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,799
hopefully this is the beginning of an

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,799
ongoing conversation

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,720
so what i tried to do with this

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,479
manuscript was

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,960
basically um

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,320
marry

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
good old-fashioned cognitive science

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,720
with a more an activist perspective

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,560
trying to find a middle way between

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,479
these ways of viewing of things and this

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,000
is the view that i've come to over a

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,880
number of years where um the idea being

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,520
that embodiment like

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,720
at this point you know it's not news

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,479
that the mind is embodied

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,439
but uh the claim is that it is uh very

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,920
very embodied some would say radically

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
embodied um i'm not sure if that made

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
the most sense to use that term because

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,079
the term radical with respect to

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,360
embodiment

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,320
is usually pointing to a perspective

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,479
or radical in activism

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,159
that avoids talking about

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,960
representations or models and instead of

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,560
saying you know what's really going on

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
is these couplings of the world and

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,159
maybe you can say there's like an

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,320
implicit information processing or

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,920
intelligence even that might be objected

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,439
to but

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,479
we talk of representations and

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,399
symbols and models from cognitive

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,800
science um that's

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,680
those are

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,599
not real things

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,080
and so this paper goes through a

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,160
perspective in which basically

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,040
um

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,160
we do uh have representations and models

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,560
and we also have um

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,239
these sort of inactive couplings with

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,280
the world

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
um and i say it's radical and that uh

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
nearly uh every mental process you would

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
care to talk about the way you have to

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,160
understand it

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,239
according to this view would be

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,800
first and fundamentally and foremost in

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,519
terms of its embodied character

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,959
so

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,959
before i move on as everything coming

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
across clearly uh just

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,160
okay

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,120
yeah i did disable my video because due

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
to some incredible consequences of

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
different situations i'm using a hotspot

79
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,640
but it's all good

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,560
okay

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,920
you're on the run

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,159
um

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,640
so

84
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
let's review a little background i mean

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
a lot of this um uh

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,959
people who were watching this

87
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,120
with but i'll review some uh background

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
on predictive processing and uh active

89
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,360
inference um

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,879
maybe some of what i'll

91
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,159
present is a somewhat heterodox view

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,799
that's also something to discuss

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,680
so a basic account of predictive coding

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,440
you have these

95
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,239
deep

96
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,159
pyramidal neurons and you have these

97
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,799
superficial pyramidal neurons

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,400
where they're deep with respect to

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,599
cortex as having this layered structure

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,680
roughly six layers with some variations

101
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,439
on the theme depending on where you look

102
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,120
and the idea is that

103
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
the cortex as a whole

104
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,400
is engaging in

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
what's sometimes called hierarchical or

106
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,920
what's often called hierarchical

107
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,599
predictive coding or

108
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,840
potentially predictive processing

109
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
because there might be some assumptions

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
with saying predictive coding that not

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,200
everyone would sign up for such as that

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,640
um

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,959
you are only suppressing and explaining

114
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,839
away information as opposed to

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,639
um

116
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,479
sometimes enhancing it

117
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,160
and there's other nuances that could

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
make people object to saying predictive

119
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,400
coding

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,639
instead of getting into those weeds uh

121
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,800
the idea would be that you have this

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
hierarchy of beliefs

123
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,320
implicit and neuronal organization um

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
the nature of these beliefs and this

125
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
gets into these

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,199
debates about representation and

127
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,360
inactivism but this idea that

128
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
you can say there's an implicit belief

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,320
at each

130
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,639
neuron and set of neurons about what

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,479
they expect what patterns they expect to

132
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,080
encounter and according to this

133
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,840
predictive processing view

134
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,960
through their activity they're trying to

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,560
predict this incoming activity and

136
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
suppress it or explain it away

137
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,360
to minimize overall activity

138
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
and you that you only update these

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,360
beliefs where you got it wrong via a

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,160
prediction error and this is a

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
under certain certain assumptions if you

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,680
have a good model and events in the

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,639
world are relatively slow relative to

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
your internal signaling units you can

145
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,039
have substantial energetic savings for

146
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
an organ of about two percent of your

147
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,680
body mass and 20 of your metabolism

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,800
seems like the kind of thing natural

149
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
selection would do and there's some

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,639
decent evidence for this

151
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,360
so

152
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
this

153
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
so the basics of neural architecture

154
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
here for cortex is viewing it as a

155
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,199
predictive processing hierarchy or a

156
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,160
header

157
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,800
and that each of your modalities would

158
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
be a different belief hierarchy and they

159
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,080
would all

160
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
come together and exchange their

161
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,919
information for a joint belief

162
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,680
across all your modalities in terms of

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,000
what you think um should be in your

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,319
sensorium as it moves through the world

165
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,759
uh whether it's the world you're in

166
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,160
right now or some sort of counterfactual

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,960
world in the present or future

168
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,400
so that's predictive processing in a

169
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
nutshell

170
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
and so in this account the goal was to

171
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
use

172
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,039
predictive processing to

173
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,280
try to get into the micro mechanics of

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,560
goal-oriented behavior and agency

175
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
and so what i suggested is that um the

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,759
work has been done within active

177
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,600
inference um

178
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
on this sort of

179
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,039
imaginative plan

180
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,440
pursuing of goals

181
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,880
the work to refer to would be

182
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,840
sophisticated inference or sophisticated

183
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,160
affect of inference which is

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
thinking about basically planning into

185
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,560
the future as this tree search of

186
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
possibilities where you're going on

187
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
different

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,360
branches of these possibilities and then

189
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,160
picking the ones either in imagination

190
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
or in reality that would correspond to

191
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,199
you

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,560
minimizing your prediction error the

193
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
best or realizing value the best

194
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,479
but

195
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,240
this exploration of a tree of

196
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,520
possibilities and going down different

197
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,639
branches

198
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,000
and so this would be i suppose a

199
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
particular flavor of this and the idea

200
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
being that um a lot of what would be

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,199
pulling along this stream of

202
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,080
consciousness of imaginings um

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
would be this iterative comparison

204
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
between

205
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
sensed and imagined states or between

206
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,199
various goal states

207
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,680
so here um i

208
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,120
have this comic book that a friend

209
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,800
helped me make

210
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,840
and

211
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
i have multiple comics throughout i tend

212
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,639
to view comics as being

213
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,759
really

214
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,000
highly expressive in a way that um i

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,759
think we should probably use them more

216
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,080
in terms of being able to capture the

217
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,800
the joints and experience space with

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
sufficient richness and detail and there

219
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
could even be something like comic

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,000
book-esque about the stream of

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
experience which could be part of the

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,280
reason that they're so effective

223
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,960
but to return to this

224
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
comic or a modal frame sequence as i

225
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,039
sometimes call it

226
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,360
um you see in the bottom here this is

227
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,560
the actual pose of the agent and up top

228
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
what's going through the mind's eye

229
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,919
whether we're talking about an

230
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,800
imagination or a perception and so here

231
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
it's just a simple contrasting of what

232
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
you're perceiving in each given moment

233
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
and then what you're imagining so you're

234
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,199
sitting you want tea

235
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,240
you

236
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
then look and you say i'm not drinking

237
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,360
tea i'm at my computer and there's a

238
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,199
laptop in front of me

239
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,800
you look down

240
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,560
and you're imagining having tea in your

241
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
cup but then you look and no there is

242
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,519
indeed no t

243
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,599
and then you imagine a next step and so

244
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,200
what's what's happening here is you're

245
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,679
doing this contrast and what i propose

246
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,120
is that in contrast between these states

247
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,760
they're arranging they're basically

248
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
setting up prediction errors for each

249
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,440
other where what doesn't match

250
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,040
would potentially

251
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,000
get you a natural prioritization

252
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,120
of

253
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160
what features are unaligned and then

254
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
from those you use that to retrieve some

255
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720
sort of relevant affordance to help you

256
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,040
bridge this gap between your imagination

257
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,279
reality and there's a lot of devils in

258
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,880
details of the ways this could work but

259
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,839
that some sort of iterative contrasting

260
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:14,640
of

261
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,600
um

262
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
goal states in a goal hierarchy where

263
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
it's like you might have an ultimate

264
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,959
goal but to achieve that goal you have

265
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,040
to now go and think of what are all of

266
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,959
the sub steps and the sub goals that

267
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,279
would be needed to actually get the tea

268
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
in my hand

269
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
you're going to have to

270
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,200
ambulate to the kitchen make the tea etc

271
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,320
etc

272
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,839
and as you're going back and forth at

273
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,160
some place some point you either have a

274
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
plan that's compelling enough or the

275
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,320
next action is close enough to your

276
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,040
present pose that you just find yourself

277
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,120
launching into action sometimes

278
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,800
accompanied by a feeling of having

279
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
decided sometimes you just find yourself

280
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
moving but that's the basic um account

281
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
here that

282
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
the stream of consciousness is being

283
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,279
pulled along in this goal-oriented

284
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,320
fashion

285
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,040
this value-driven fashion um sometimes

286
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,720
more freely wandering but sometimes but

287
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,440
but usually there's an interest and

288
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,600
you're as an active inference and

289
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,040
predictive processing

290
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,079
your

291
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,600
preferences or your attracting states

292
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
the tractors that you'll find as a

293
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,880
system which you're attracted to

294
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,959
takes the form of predictions and so the

295
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,079
things in your mind that you're

296
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,120
imagining

297
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
that

298
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,000
they become the goal state they become

299
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
the state of the world that you prefer

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
in that instance or in general if it's a

301
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,839
regular kind of imagining and this now

302
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,079
becomes the attracting state that your

303
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,480
system self organizes and

304
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
you engage in action selection of

305
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
different kinds to

306
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
minimize that difference between what

307
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,240
you're imagining

308
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,120
and what

309
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,079
you are estimating for the world

310
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,360
so

311
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,800
um i go into some discussion of uh

312
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,880
neural architecture and different

313
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,000
aspects that might be more or less

314
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,279
relevant for different um

315
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,600
of this kind of action selection um i

316
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,720
probably should have just you know

317
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
thrown this on top of a picture of a

318
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,920
brain um but i didn't but in some ways

319
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
it might be a good thing and that

320
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,320
i wonder whether

321
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,800
this account of having a dual-tier

322
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
system something like uh a system in a

323
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,440
system two

324
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,079
is a broader story than just brains and

325
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,680
so you know i have written out here like

326
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,040
here would be neural substrates of what

327
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,640
would enable you to do this

328
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,440
but um well it could be across brains

329
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,120
you might have similar processes

330
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,000
happening

331
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
within let's say like an insect nervous

332
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,519
system by different means like instead

333
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,200
of the basal ganglia you might be using

334
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,680
the mushroom bodies um if we're talking

335
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
like an ant colony for instance it's

336
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,560
possible you have a different like

337
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,120
attracting states of the colony where

338
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
some are taking this role like a higher

339
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,160
level controller and a lower level

340
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,120
controller but the basic idea here is

341
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,440
that you have an upper level controller

342
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,959
that's capable of aggregating

343
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,040
information across different so you have

344
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
this lower level process by in this

345
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,880
control hierarchy where the lower level

346
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,760
is

347
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,680
taking care of your immediate couplings

348
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
with the world this would be um the more

349
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,959
inactive portion um if we're talking

350
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,079
about the brain it would be something

351
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,360
like um

352
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,040
loosely assembled

353
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,959
um constellation of

354
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,160
um

355
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
cortical reactive dispositions may be

356
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,200
orchestrated by the cerebellar system

357
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,560
of what would be called amortized

358
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
inference and it would be largely

359
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,560
unconscious and automatic um

360
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,079
phenomenologists would talk about just

361
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,519
like um things being

362
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,519
ready at hand as opposed to being

363
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,399
present to hand you're just effortless

364
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,160
engagement and effortless mastery with

365
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,040
the world

366
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,079
but on top of this um you would have a

367
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,680
slower process in this case i'm saying

368
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,000
it's more involving conscious processing

369
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
something more

370
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,639
system two-like to use kahneman's

371
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,920
language um where it's involved in more

372
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
deliberate

373
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,279
potentially effortful uh modes of

374
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,000
cognition which would be a higher level

375
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,839
of control over

376
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,200
this um

377
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,760
faster smooth coupling

378
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,040
system

379
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,959
so

380
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,320
go into some details of neural

381
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,000
architecture

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,639
potentially this might be just

383
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,480
what you need for a lot of active

384
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,399
inferential agents

385
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,639
something like this across

386
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,440
whether or not we're talking about

387
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
neurons this this might be a broader

388
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,200
story for um active inferential agents

389
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,160
so to return to the example um

390
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,800
of making tea uh you go into it

391
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,719
somewhere saying that um you know

392
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
areas associated with mental imagery

393
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,720
maybe even physical and computational

394
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,360
substrates of

395
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
mental imagery phenomenal phenomenality

396
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
itself but like the petunias for

397
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,160
instance um involved in imagination have

398
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
heavily implicated um multiple reasons

399
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
to think why this would be the case but

400
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,600
you know i have this little cartesian

401
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,959
theater here with the different

402
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,399
imaginings

403
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,519
and

404
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,399
down below the idea is you are

405
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,800
iterating through different imaginations

406
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,079
imaginings

407
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,160
largely via

408
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
large-scale orchestration by the

409
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,320
hippocampal complex and it's a

410
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
capacities

411
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
to

412
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
couple with the rest of cortex to

413
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,800
guide these

414
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,639
high-level attracting states

415
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,920
where some portions of which would be

416
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,279
your experience

417
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,959
and so the reason you would bring up the

418
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,560
hippocampus in here is it seems to be

419
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,600
a specialized subsystem for

420
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,560
sequential predictive modeling

421
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,920
you could say that for cortex as a whole

422
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,279
technically hippocampus is a kind of

423
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,480
cortex

424
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
arcade cortex old vintage but that

425
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,800
basically um so demacia will talk about

426
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,320
this in terms of a convergence

427
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,839
divergence zone where many things will

428
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,000
funnel in and then funnel back with high

429
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,760
centrality um

430
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,519
uh i forget his name he said waterloo um

431
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,000
the spawn architecture um but uh he'll

432
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,240
talk about semantic pointers but there's

433
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,160
different ways of viewing the this the

434
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,079
high centrality of the campus as it

435
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,680
basically

436
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,639
will

437
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
predict this trajectory of the overall

438
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,639
organism through space

439
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,199
you can both encode

440
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,680
memories what was happening in my

441
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,040
thorium whether in reality or

442
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,360
imagination at each point as i was

443
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,800
moving moving through space and time and

444
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,399
you could also use it for replay

445
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,920
including in counter factual

446
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,959
circumstances and so um i have some

447
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,320
diagrams here at the neural systems

448
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,759
involved

449
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,680
and right here you would have the

450
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,480
i think that's good for now so um

451
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,839
everyone wants to know more details

452
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,480
about that later we could

453
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,839
so

454
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,720
to return to um

455
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,440
trying to go more phenomenological um so

456
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,600
these modal frame sequences are comics

457
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,680
ultimately what i'm trying to build up

458
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,399
to

459
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,240
is a sufficiently detailed account of

460
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
neural architecture and a sufficiently

461
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,800
detailed account of phenomenology

462
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
that we can talk about

463
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
so that we can basically talk about

464
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
something as highfalutin as free will

465
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,160
and have some purchase

466
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,120
um

467
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,600
so in this a little more complex modal

468
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,040
form sequence you have that up top

469
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,600
an imagining you know

470
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,519
row below that you have what's actually

471
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,120
in your perception

472
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,560
below that you have your pose your

473
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
proprioceptive

474
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,560
imprints and then below that you have

475
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,800
your enteroceptive inference

476
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
and

477
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,519
so

478
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,199
as you're stepping through

479
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,800
the stream of consciousness is evolving

480
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,120
through space and time

481
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
encoded or orchestrated

482
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,839
by the hippocampal system at this high

483
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,880
potentially

484
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,360
most integrative high level of action

485
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
selection

486
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,759
you

487
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,040
are having

488
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,079
different wounds in your body

489
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,120
um

490
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,600
corresponding to the enteroceptive

491
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,320
competence of um or the interceptive

492
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,800
aspects of um what it means to be in

493
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
different situations so for instance

494
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,640
like a hunger situation here you're

495
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,079
getting prediction air intercepted

496
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,799
prediction air that would be um roughly

497
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,039
vaguely localized here's like a cool

498
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,160
sensation

499
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,880
um around your um gut and mouth or

500
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,119
thirst or hunger something like this and

501
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,640
now as you're going into movement you

502
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,199
might have here like um

503
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,880
you're still having this enteroceptive

504
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,000
code of hot and cold states pleasant and

505
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
unpleasant but it's kind of getting

506
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,200
infused into other other modalities

507
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
where your proprioception some of the

508
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,559
phenomenology of like feeling like an

509
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,480
urge in your body it's

510
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,919
one of the claims i make is that you

511
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,160
have this kind of

512
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
quasi-synesthetic cross-mapping between

513
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
enteroceptive signals signals

514
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,799
and the proprioceptive and exterceptive

515
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,000
asp um

516
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
their associates

517
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,600
uh part of the reason i claim this and

518
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
say that this is both part of the

519
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,200
phenomenology of will and maybe part of

520
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,600
the mechanism also um is that

521
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,320
interceptive signals um are poorly

522
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
localizable in space and time they tend

523
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,200
to have pretty low resolution for them

524
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,000
um

525
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,360
and so they

526
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
may drift free from their sources and as

527
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,960
a kind of anomalous inference but

528
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,720
adaptively adaptive anomalous inference

529
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,080
you they may get infused into

530
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,559
the relevant um effector and sensor

531
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,000
systems and objects in the worlds for

532
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,760
which um they would be relevant

533
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,200
you know i make a lot of different

534
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
claims in this work uh from a number of

535
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
years of study

536
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
a lot of it can be taken a la carte like

537
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,720
you can find some things to be more

538
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
compelling some things be less

539
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,120
compelling

540
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,840
but

541
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,039
i do think you get a whole lot greater

542
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
than some of its parts but it can also

543
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,799
be taken in a piecemeal fashion so you

544
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,320
might not be particularly compelled by

545
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,360
this

546
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,280
account of interception as being

547
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,280
synesthetic in nature um but

548
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
nothing really not too much will ride on

549
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,480
that but

550
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,799
it could

551
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,240
will write on that but it could end up

552
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,360
being important so i'm putting it in

553
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
there

554
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,880
okay

555
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,280
and so across all of this is happening

556
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
within a

557
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,559
perspective of computational

558
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,160
neurophenomenology

559
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
as a neil seth calls it or i call it

560
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,919
marion neurophenomenology and the reason

561
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,360
i call it marion is specifically

562
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,280
his account of multiple levels of

563
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,559
analysis

564
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,919
which

565
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,480
i guess super vein on each other and

566
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
you can do two things because things

567
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,679
have these multiple levels that they can

568
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
be engaged with um you can either engage

569
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,480
with them a la carte because of uh let's

570
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,600
say for instance you want to do

571
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
cognitive science but you have no idea

572
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
how the brain works and then

573
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,880
for many years we haven't and there's a

574
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
lot of mystery still you can kind of

575
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,120
bracket like here's this big set of

576
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,640
unknowns but it's at a different level

577
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
but working at this other level we can

578
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
obtain knowledge even though we might be

579
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,919
ignorant at these other levels

580
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,280
um and

581
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,559
that would be you know functionalism and

582
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,559
cognitive science but uh for me what's

583
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,400
more exciting about this actually this

584
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,840
marian stack

585
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,559
is the capacity not for independence but

586
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,600
interdependence and mutual constraints

587
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,520
using the implementational level or the

588
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,600
mechanistic level as a constraint of

589
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,679
what's a likely set of algorithms using

590
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,919
a likely set of algorithms to test

591
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,039
hypotheses on the implementation level

592
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,960
using what you think

593
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,000
the functions

594
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,760
things like neuropsychiatric literature

595
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,280
to constrain and then your imaging

596
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
literature to constrain algorithm and

597
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,360
thereby implementational so they the

598
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,440
idea of what excites me is like building

599
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,360
in this crossroad puzzle

600
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,799
constraints

601
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,960
and then cross-referencing them within

602
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,919
the phenomenon

603
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,080
level

604
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,559
i'm using basically machine learning as

605
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,960
a person principle and typically uh

606
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,320
going to the races of this idea that a

607
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,760
lot of cortex could be understood in

608
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,679
terms of historical

609
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,159
predictive problems uh but also evoking

610
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,520
some additional machine learning

611
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,760
principles but that's the overall uh

612
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
scope of it

613
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,480
in terms of the um

614
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,080
like all the body parts and faces this

615
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,440
is part of like the radical embodiment

616
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,400
idea is that instead of like the cortex

617
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,280
being this like grab bag of associations

618
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,000
with areas and

619
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,280
does that mean

620
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
um the idea is that once you really

621
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,600
place it front and center as a

622
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,120
cybernetic controller for an embodied

623
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,799
embedded agent once you place embodiment

624
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,440
front and center

625
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,880
wait a second that's not too many steps

626
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,400
removed from where the ears first pipe

627
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,039
in so the idea that something like

628
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,960
you know going from

629
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,600
phonemes or you know going from sound

630
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,919
patterns undifferentiated to phonemes

631
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,919
and

632
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,840
it ends up making cortex and its

633
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,600
functions in my opinion a lot more

634
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,760
applicable it becomes somewhat like

635
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,240
location location location and location

636
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,080
relative to the modalities that ends up

637
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,360
explaining a lot of things a similar

638
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
story for broca's area um what a

639
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,559
coincidence that it's not too many you

640
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,000
know it's a hop skip and a jump away

641
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,799
from what might uh move your mouth bits

642
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,000
um

643
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
there's doubles in details here right i

644
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,120
don't be glib and underestimated

645
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,559
complexity but

646
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,000
the claim is that actually once you

647
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
place embodiment in the center an

648
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,520
elegance kind of falls out and becomes a

649
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,440
lot easier to keep track of things if

650
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,039
you're thinking of cortex as this

651
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,760
control cybernetic control hierarchy

652
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
over to basically help a body move

653
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,760
through the world and model the world as

654
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,000
it moves through it

655
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,159
so we are ready i think to get to free

656
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,480
will um

657
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,320
and so taking these modal frame

658
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,640
sequences and here is doing one for this

659
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,400
experience of standing um

660
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,000
to make tea

661
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,200
and then

662
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,440
taking that model and then pouring it to

663
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,039
a bad experience so what is a little bit

664
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,960
paradigm um

665
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
so some people say le bay some people

666
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,280
say look back i think

667
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,559
that's deadlocked

668
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,240
but i'll continue to say well bacon is

669
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,360
more common

670
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,679
and i just will um

671
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,799
but the idea is that you're there and

672
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,640
you want to see do people or don't they

673
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
have something like meaningful

674
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,600
conscious control over their actions

675
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,919
and so the idea is okay let's strip this

676
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,600
down and take like the most

677
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
insignificant of all actions like well

678
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,000
surely we need to have control there um

679
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,039
if we're gonna say we have control

680
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,840
anymore and so the decision to just move

681
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,159
your hand based on feeling like you want

682
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,080
to do so um

683
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,559
and this coming from

684
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,400
basically it's endogenous you're not

685
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
being it's not being decided from

686
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,240
without but um you doing something based

687
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,720
on something internal to you

688
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,080
and what was found with these

689
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,240
um lebet's studies

690
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
or the bay is that you get this ramping

691
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,799
activity um

692
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,640
preceding

693
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,240
the decision to move your hand

694
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,520
so it's one more thing you have this

695
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,720
clock right

696
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,159
and there is

697
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,320
it's a big clock that you're looking at

698
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,400
and there might be a dot or a big hand

699
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
moving in a circle and the reason that

700
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,559
you have this is basically so that you

701
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,279
can estimate the time when it was that

702
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,520
you said i will move my hand when did

703
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,880
you decide

704
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,200
and you then say okay when you made that

705
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,799
decision what were you looking at where

706
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,840
was this dot as it moved around in a

707
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
circle and this can get you very fine

708
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
resolution um sub second resolution

709
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
because if it's a big clock that's

710
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,279
because then the dot will be moving

711
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,559
slowly and you can say okay it was right

712
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,240
there

713
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,960
but what's observed is that you're

714
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,200
getting this ramping activity with this

715
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,679
predictive of the action called the

716
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,279
readiness potential

717
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,080
and it will peak you know a good 200

718
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,720
milliseconds before you reporting it

719
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,360
varies but it'll peak substantially

720
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,159
before you saying i've decided

721
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,600
and so if

722
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,520
and so the claim is well if this

723
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,760
potential has predictive information of

724
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,600
your action and is the cause of your

725
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,880
action and it's happening prior to your

726
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,039
conscious decision your decision cannot

727
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,760
be the thing that caused the action

728
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,120
um

729
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,799
there's a there's a problem right away

730
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,600
with this in that with erp methods

731
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,919
you're actually averaging over many many

732
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,159
trials to get these waveforms because

733
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,440
you're measuring from the outside of the

734
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,600
brain it's like trying to detect like

735
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,080
events inside a stadium while measuring

736
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,360
like listening to the roar of the crowd

737
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,960
on the outside and

738
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,240
you're limited what you can do so you

739
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,159
have to average together a lot of

740
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,559
different um episodes and then you get

741
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,039
these event-related potentials or erps

742
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,159
and but

743
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,919
so you get predictive information from

744
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,080
this of when people moved but the idea

745
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,000
that a readiness potential is causal or

746
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,919
deterministic in some fashion there's

747
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,360
some debate about that whether you can

748
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,559
infer that

749
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,720
i'm going to say the readiness potential

750
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,559
is in fact reflecting

751
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,720
a causal process

752
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,799
and it's reflecting a conscious causal

753
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,159
process even

754
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,960
that is contributing to the action um

755
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,200
upstream of um the decision itself where

756
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,000
the decision could have some more

757
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,840
you know it depends i don't know if

758
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,039
there's one account but it could have

759
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,279
some epithelial aspects to it and that

760
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,480
the decision

761
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,080
is not necessarily um the thing

762
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
is it's not the only uh difference maker

763
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,760
there but the idea is that this

764
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,640
is a function of

765
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,880
mental imagery where you

766
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,919
are imagining

767
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,080
and as you're rehearsing moving your

768
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,679
hand

769
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,960
you're having different things

770
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
associated with it

771
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,799
and that building up

772
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,720
of that recurrent a building up of

773
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,200
activity in these body maps

774
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,679
whether we're talking about the getting

775
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,960
ready to actually change your

776
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,440
proprioceptive pose as you're imagining

777
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
starting to move closer to a threshold

778
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,720
where you're going to get robust enough

779
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
activity that is actually going to drive

780
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,400
your muscles and your effector systems

781
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,320
or building up of activity

782
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,360
in your

783
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,039
anteroceptive modalities like your

784
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,480
insular and cingulate hierarchies and

785
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,760
maybe their cross

786
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,520
maybe their synesthetic like cross

787
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,120
couplings with other modalities that

788
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,520
that building up of a feeling of urge is

789
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,360
itself consciousness leading to the

790
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,480
stream

791
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,679
the causal stream of action

792
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,200
so

793
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,480
that i would say so yeah the

794
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
and then on top of all the different

795
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,440
imaginings would be orchestrated by the

796
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,039
capital system would be the basic model

797
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,200
so

798
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,039
currently

799
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,360
and so and and

800
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,720
so currently i am working on

801
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,840
uh expanding this um to seeing what

802
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,159
different states of consciousness um the

803
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,159
ways in which they could impact these

804
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,559
sorts of phenomena um

805
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,159
in terms of

806
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,080
changing your awareness of this

807
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,840
rehearsal process

808
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,520
uh or changing uh

809
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,360
that'll be one of the primary uh

810
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,760
things of interest

811
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,840
and also whether differences in the

812
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
mechanisms of agency could potentially

813
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,600
contribute to the phenomenology of

814
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,039
psychedelics i'll try to explain what i

815
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,399
mean um

816
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,080
so here would be someone relatively

817
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,559
unaltered engaging in mental rehearsal

818
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,080
their minds started wandering off to

819
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,919
nature they're seeing a tree here's

820
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,720
imagination here's perception here more

821
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,080
vivid than imagination and they're just

822
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,960
sort of

823
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,039
imagining things imagining will i

824
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,200
move won't i move and then at a certain

825
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,440
point

826
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,840
imagination becomes vivid enough that

827
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,760
they can really see it happening

828
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,200
and at a certain point of uh

829
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,840
vividness of imaginings as a function of

830
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,559
this rehearsal um of will i move won't i

831
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,440
move you get enough build up of whether

832
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,720
we're on the implementation level we

833
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,159
might talk or mechanistic level we might

834
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,559
talk about recurrent activity in terms

835
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,399
of active inference on the functional

836
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,520
level we might talk about model evidence

837
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,840
but at a certain point you cross a

838
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
certain threshold leading to model

839
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,120
selection

840
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,840
of you altering your proprioceptive pose

841
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,080
and this becoming a self-fulfilling

842
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,000
prophecy through active inference you

843
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,080
then minimize the prediction error

844
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,799
between your imagination i am moving and

845
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,360
the and the action through reflex arcs

846
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,399
the way that um basically motor control

847
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,840
is thought or is thought to work in

848
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,360
active inference

849
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,960
and predictive processing

850
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,120
so the psychedelic angle would be

851
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,600
as someone is dosing with these

852
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
compounds their imagination becomes more

853
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,720
vivid

854
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
and they might show stronger ramping at

855
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,120
first and maybe greater awareness of

856
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,520
this patterns of mental stimulation

857
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,360
leading up to the action

858
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,520
it might get stronger

859
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,039
still as you

860
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,960
dose more and more

861
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
um

862
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,240
also greater coupling between

863
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
anteroceptive and proprioceptive

864
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
modalities increasing the gain on this

865
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
positive feedback between mental imagery

866
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,000
influence of urge and so in a way this

867
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,399
would be an enhancement of

868
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,520
willing

869
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,240
the willing aspect of agency as you move

870
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,799
up this dose response curve but then you

871
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,080
get to a certain level and you start to

872
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,360
get into this psychedelic regime where

873
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,120
your thought becomes

874
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,559
highly creative

875
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,360
and then your directed willing

876
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,320
might start to go down um potentially

877
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
the idea is you might

878
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,320
find other things competing for your

879
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,360
awareness

880
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
different creative uh

881
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,039
possibilities so you're now imagining

882
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,559
nature very vividly and this is

883
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,600
competing with you rehearsing will

884
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,760
i move or won't i move

885
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,760
and

886
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:53,060
[Music]

887
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,399
you directing

888
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,880
extremely high doses you might get and

889
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,360
compromise of these mechanisms of agency

890
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,760
of this conjoining of your enteroceptive

891
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,919
and your proprioceptive predictions of

892
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,760
your basically

893
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,600
of your stream of consciousness being

894
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,159
pulled along by value-driven policy

895
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,559
selection via sophisticated effect of

896
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,519
inference

897
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,399
um

898
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,399
so i think

899
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,399
so the reverse direction is this um in

900
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,559
terms of uh

901
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,000
this paradigm potentially informing

902
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,960
psychedelics could be that one source of

903
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,519
hallucinations or delusions or

904
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,240
um atypical um altered

905
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,559
uh consciousness and cognition would be

906
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,240
that if you take the basic mechanic

907
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,679
micro mechanics

908
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,600
of agency

909
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,640
and and you compromise that so you know

910
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,519
as you're

911
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,880
you're beginning to somewhat imagine an

912
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,399
action but

913
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,240
it's not well integrated into some

914
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,760
causal controlling you could come to

915
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,200
this anomalous inferences about what's

916
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,880
causing these basically um

917
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,200
the different um endogenous activity

918
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,519
your brain the different like uh

919
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,760
events that could lead to motor to motor

920
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,399
actions if these aren't being integrated

921
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,799
into a self-consistent coherent causal

922
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,080
unfolding

923
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,240
one of the ways that you could try to

924
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
make sense of this would be a

925
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,600
confabulation of something like a

926
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,799
hallucination and so this could

927
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,840
potentially

928
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,519
also explain some of psychedelic

929
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,039
phenomenology um and potentially um a

930
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,120
clinical neuropsychiatric phenology with

931
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,720
things like schizophrenia

932
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,480
as potentially being a function of

933
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,840
disrupted agency mechanisms so that's

934
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,120
currently the area of focus and

935
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,720
there's going to be a pre-print just

936
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,519
came out on that called

937
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,159
on the degrees of freedom worth having

938
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,080
psychedelics is a window for

939
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,399
understanding and expanding

940
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,120
uh

941
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,039
free will i believe that's what i called

942
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,120
it

943
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,120
a little bit

944
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,080
um also apologies if there's any

945
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,919
strange stream hiccups but could you

946
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,080
maybe unpack what the alien

947
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,480
or extraterrestrial was doing and how

948
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,039
does the confabulation relate to a

949
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,120
narrative understanding of action

950
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,039
so in this one

951
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,880
so

952
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,000
you know we're starting out just like

953
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,679
imagining your hand moving or imagining

954
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,600
being in nature

955
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,399
and then same here as the dose goes up

956
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,320
and it goes up and you might start to

957
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,480
get some more intense enteroceptive

958
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,000
sensation um

959
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,039
sensations uh the five ht2a receptors

960
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,519
which um heavily mediate the effects of

961
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,760
classic psychedelics uh they're they're

962
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,519
highly expressed in the interior insulin

963
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,640
the top of the anteroceptive hierarchy

964
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,919
and so

965
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,279
you keep going up

966
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,240
becomes

967
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,320
the sensations become more intense

968
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,360
imagination becomes closer to reality

969
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
and so here like

970
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,039
what i'm calling the heroic dose in this

971
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,079
extreme dose regimes

972
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,399
you're starting to get for instance like

973
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,879
your ownership of the actions are

974
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,719
starting to get undermined so here i'm

975
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,839
depicting

976
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,159
like you find your hand moving but

977
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,199
you're not accounting for your willing

978
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,560
of the move

979
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,560
being the thing you're not saying oh i

980
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,719
was rehearsing it and it felt this way

981
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,399
and that was part of the cause of

982
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,599
streaming into action you just found

983
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,079
yourself moving and so one way you could

984
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,679
make sense of this or confabulate around

985
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,560
this here is a hand like it's a feeling

986
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,239
of the hand pushing down on your hand

987
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,719
from without like just an example of a

988
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,639
potential confabulation or hallucination

989
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,000
someone might have

990
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,440
and this one here it's expanded and it's

991
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,119
this basically

992
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,800
someone it's not even your hand anymore

993
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,399
pressing it but an alien's pressing it

994
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,719
it's just an example of for instance um

995
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,520
so psychedelics they the classic

996
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
psychedelics will act in these five ht2a

997
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
receptors

998
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,480
they are heavily expressed

999
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,760
on these deep pyramidal neurons um of

1000
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,720
quarter texas six layers uh the layer

1001
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,040
five um well basically they're big

1002
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,920
neurons that loop with the thalamus and

1003
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,520
they let you form these broad

1004
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,800
synchronous complexes which in

1005
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,160
predictive processing are thought to

1006
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,640
encode your beliefs some subset of which

1007
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,560
would be your experience

1008
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,839
and so if you increase the gain on these

1009
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,680
uh the idea is that you might have

1010
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,160
enhanced perceptual vividness but

1011
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,800
because though you've done a radical

1012
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,560
alteration to

1013
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,359
um

1014
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,599
of multiple kinds to like the normal

1015
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,160
regime of processing in your mind you're

1016
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,000
the normal ways you would model

1017
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,520
even though you're experiencing things

1018
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,079
intensely this would uh potentially be

1019
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,040
of an atypical variety of experience and

1020
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,920
so here it's the intense experience

1021
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,119
the intense

1022
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,000
perception at perception of the alien

1023
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,599
it's a counter factual alien it's not

1024
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,480
actually an alien uh but

1025
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,839
that would that would be an example of

1026
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,599
an anomalous inference you might make

1027
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,720
and it has some um relation to what's

1028
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,640
happening and the fact that maybe there

1029
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,359
was some motor rehearsal going on but

1030
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,280
you're not able to keep track of it and

1031
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,520
so and here this is um you're actually

1032
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,760
having phenomenal consciousness in each

1033
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,119
of these moments

1034
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,520
but you don't have conscious access

1035
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,280
unless in these iterative moments of

1036
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,560
experience

1037
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,880
you can somehow get call backs

1038
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,280
where um things can be contextualized

1039
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,839
within uh some sort of causal unfolding

1040
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,040
the claim would be that basically this

1041
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,119
would be a way of separating out

1042
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,800
phenomenal consciousness from conscious

1043
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,640
access that there's things that can

1044
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,560
happen as you're generating these quail

1045
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,760
states

1046
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,680
as estimates of what's happening of

1047
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,079
system world system world system world

1048
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,320
specifically your sensorium

1049
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,160
as you think it is based on your current

1050
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,520
engagement or in counter factual

1051
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,880
circumstances

1052
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
and that this that's the stream of

1053
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,160
consciousness but that not all the

1054
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,000
frames of experience

1055
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,079
are accessible or rememberable and so

1056
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,280
in this case here you know maybe there

1057
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,880
was some rehearsal but you're not

1058
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,240
keeping track of it

1059
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,320
and then the the um the the best causal

1060
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
account you were able to come up with

1061
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,720
was that an alien made you do it and you

1062
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,000
might have even forgotten that this was

1063
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,359
you or maybe you do remember it but

1064
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,160
would need probably some more

1065
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,960
contextualization or not it's unclear

1066
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,680
but yeah so that would be the basic idea

1067
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,320
is that psychedelics would be increasing

1068
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,079
consciousness level or the vividness of

1069
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,760
your experience

1070
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,240
but potentially undermining the

1071
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,800
coherence in terms of causal unfoldings

1072
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,040
or your usual priors by which you

1073
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,359
structure the world um in the spirit of

1074
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,280
um robin carrera harris and carl

1075
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,320
firstens rebus model which i'm currently

1076
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,160
discussing in the context of a broader

1077
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,800
framework that i call albus

1078
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,880
but yeah i don't know did that help at

1079
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,079
all or

1080
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:52,960
like

1081
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,599
like yeah it also it reminded me of what

1082
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,240
you said about the uh different levels

1083
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,839
and their interdependence and mutual

1084
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,079
constraints so it's like a sound is

1085
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,560
heard and potentially in one state of

1086
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,359
consciousness or mind or brain

1087
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,720
it's 98 likely to be one thing and

1088
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,320
option b and c are one percent

1089
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,560
likelihood and so just goes forward with

1090
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,280
as if option a like as if i'm in control

1091
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,560
but then

1092
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,839
some

1093
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,640
things might happen where like that um

1094
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
one percent chance that it is an alien

1095
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,079
gets accepted and sort of passed forward

1096
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,560
and then that might lead to the

1097
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,119
experience through the generative model

1098
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,320
of something that like

1099
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,800
was a distributional so it's like a

1100
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,000
change in

1101
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,839
quantitative distributions that leads to

1102
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,920
a qualitative change at increasingly

1103
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,079
higher and categorical and semantic

1104
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,119
experiential layers

1105
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,720
beautifully said

1106
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,200
i thought

1107
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,920
and it would depend on your um cultural

1108
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,640
priors so and whether we would call this

1109
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,320
like a relaxed belief or a strength and

1110
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,280
belief i'm not sure uh but you know for

1111
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,160
instance

1112
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,200
you might not be seeing in like if you

1113
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,240
you know or

1114
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,040
an indigenous people of south america

1115
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,200
for instance um

1116
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,720
you know depend they might not see an

1117
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,640
alien it might be um related to

1118
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,680
something having to do with their

1119
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,359
spirituality and

1120
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,359
their their whatever available myths you

1121
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,560
have

1122
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,440
um

1123
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,920
would then go into basically this

1124
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,880
um

1125
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,079
interpretation your best guess which

1126
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,560
is always wrong um sometimes useful but

1127
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,480
your best guess of what's going on will

1128
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,599
be different depending on um

1129
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,800
you know what they would call the the

1130
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,560
set in the setting but also where um

1131
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,720
the setting is the broader cultural of

1132
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,480
the sentence setting are also broader to

1133
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,599
the culture

1134
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,040
um

1135
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,720
not everyone will be not everyone will

1136
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,320
come to the inference of aliens probably

1137
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,920
and actually that's that's been shown um

1138
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,119
that that hallucinations are uh

1139
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,160
culturally specific

1140
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,160
yeah with which kinds of

1141
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,760
extraterrestrial

1142
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,640
morphologies are seen in relationship to

1143
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,520
which are prevalent in the media and the

1144
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,160
stories of a given region

1145
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,920
i don't know all the details but one can

1146
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,000
imagine

1147
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,599
yeah like not everyone i mean like you

1148
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,680
could like say like um

1149
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,800
uh

1150
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,560
maybe there is something about like gray

1151
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,920
aliens which is like a little more

1152
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,280
archetypal i don't know if i'd say this

1153
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,359
but like uh

1154
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,040
if you look at like the eigen dimensions

1155
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,560
like morphological variation what's

1156
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,720
relevant to us like

1157
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,720
you're just like exaggerating many of

1158
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,000
the dimensions

1159
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,520
that would be relevant for us engaging

1160
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,839
in inter-subjective modeling or modeling

1161
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,440
of ourselves even for the sake of

1162
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,920
control it's like hands like bigger

1163
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,400
hands might be important um

1164
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,680
where is like

1165
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,200
an attentional

1166
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,000
um

1167
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,839
inference like where is this person

1168
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,760
attending to where am i attending to so

1169
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,040
you don't want to know the heads and the

1170
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,119
eyes that's going to be really crucial

1171
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,920
um yeah that's that's a far out story

1172
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,280
but

1173
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,000
you know there could be aspects of uh

1174
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,480
that aren't just through the medium but

1175
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,280
it's it's super interesting

1176
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,160
and um uh yeah not not to go into alien

1177
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,599
stream mode

1178
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,880
but um thinking about a large headed

1179
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,000
archetype with very large

1180
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,240
dark eyes and the long fingers like

1181
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,000
you're kind of hinting at

1182
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,280
it's like

1183
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,960
it's all pupil

1184
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,359
it's all cortex

1185
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,119
it doesn't have the strength but it has

1186
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,800
a lot of nimbleness with its hands and

1187
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,079
with its body

1188
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,560
and so like that's like one archetype of

1189
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,319
of cognitive

1190
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,599
action

1191
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,400
it i don't know and then what

1192
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,240
maybe there's a blob and a shadow

1193
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,839
there's like these different

1194
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,440
archetypes different little characters

1195
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,119
in this comic book of cognition

1196
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,520
not that different from a child's

1197
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,200
affordances too

1198
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,960
right like they're not they're not

1199
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,560
capable of like moving things around

1200
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,800
much but it's like their intentional

1201
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,880
actions are mostly like hand-eye

1202
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,240
coordination

1203
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,160
of like that's their purchase on the

1204
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,799
world that's their grip

1205
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,760
but you know for all this you know so

1206
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,359
this is the current like

1207
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,160
focus is how might psychedelics

1208
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,079
inform our understanding of the micro

1209
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,200
mechanics

1210
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,640
of agency

1211
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,800
um and how might the micromechanics of

1212
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,720
agency inform our understanding of what

1213
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,480
psychedelics are and that's currently uh

1214
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,400
one of the things i'm focusing on and

1215
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,760
about to

1216
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,480
do some experiments on um at this center

1217
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,000
for psychedelic consciousness science

1218
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,760
i'm working out

1219
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,680
at hopkins but the

1220
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,560
uh

1221
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,960
fundamentally upstream of this uh the

1222
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,480
idea is that

1223
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,319
these studies which purportedly um show

1224
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,040
that there's no free will uh they show

1225
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,440
no such thing uh it's very ambiguous

1226
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,280
what they're showing and i believe if

1227
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,400
you do an active inferential handling of

1228
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,240
them uh you'll actually see that there

1229
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,880
are several ways in which consciousness

1230
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,960
is contributing to causal streams

1231
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,440
leading to action uh which would be

1232
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,359
having some of the varieties of free

1233
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,359
will worth having um you know is it

1234
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,960
arbitrary

1235
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,280
degrees of free will no uh are there

1236
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,800
some varieties of free will worth having

1237
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,319
that we don't have like can you just

1238
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,319
like fly all of a sudden that'd be nice

1239
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,160
it'll be worthwhile uh we can't do that

1240
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,760
either but if you want your beliefs and

1241
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,240
desires to be able to

1242
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,560
meaningfully said to be able to be said

1243
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,520
to be

1244
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,480
uh

1245
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,560
meaningful efficient core screenings

1246
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,079
maybe even maximally efficient core

1247
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,280
screenings of what is happening i think

1248
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,599
we do have that and i think you can find

1249
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,160
this even within uh these labet

1250
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,079
paradigms

1251
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,640
if you didn't uh i think you still could

1252
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,000
have many of the varieties of free will

1253
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,599
worth having because you know many

1254
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,280
people have criticized it saying like oh

1255
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,880
just moving your hand

1256
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,560
without a reason that's not really

1257
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,000
agency that's not what we want from free

1258
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,720
will we want like meaningful decisions

1259
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,319
um

1260
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,400
sure but i i think even though even

1261
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,359
though for these even for these studies

1262
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,000
um which people often will you know

1263
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,839
trot out and say look

1264
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,640
my brain made me do it even then i i

1265
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
don't think it follows

1266
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,560
that uh

1267
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,640
they show that we um that our

1268
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,280
consciousness is epiphenomenal um

1269
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,599
through and through and i think active

1270
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,160
inference basically shows some of the

1271
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,800
particular ways that consciousness is

1272
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,640
indeed causal even in these

1273
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,720
circumstances and i think that's a very

1274
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,599
big deal uh i i don't know how well it's

1275
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,000
surviving the replication crisis but you

1276
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,079
know there's plenty of studies uh

1277
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,880
showing that uh some undesirable

1278
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,599
consequences of people uh not believing

1279
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,280
in their own free will or their own

1280
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,680
agency uh whether or not that works i

1281
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,839
think there is a kind of um

1282
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,760
this face valid account

1283
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,680
of this and that like kind of like um

1284
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,359
dumbo's magic feather so like you know

1285
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,839
this elephant uh and i'm taking this

1286
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,359
from dan dennett uh from his book

1287
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,839
freedom evolves but uh the elephant uh

1288
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,160
has a feather that the crows told him uh

1289
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,800
we'll help him fly and he had his big

1290
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,160
ears and he used him to fly when he had

1291
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,680
the feather and but it was because he

1292
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,560
believed um whether or not um believing

1293
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,880
in free will gives you free will

1294
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,040
not believing you're a meaningful cause

1295
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,520
that becomes true just by believing it

1296
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,119
um

1297
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,680
so uh you know i think it's some it's

1298
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,200
quite dangerous

1299
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,680
to take basically

1300
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,200
something where we have

1301
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,480
something precious something that

1302
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,480
basically would empower us to pursue our

1303
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,520
values

1304
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,240
and to say based on

1305
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,079
the set of studies and using the

1306
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,400
authority of science telling people uh

1307
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,240
that they are not meaningful causes i

1308
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,960
think that's extremely pernicious um

1309
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,599
and i think active inference can

1310
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,960
there's already great work being done

1311
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,800
like within like the neurophilosophy of

1312
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,480
free will pushing back against us and i

1313
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,560
think active inference can help uh

1314
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,480
showing people what are the meaningful

1315
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,800
degrees of freedom that they have um and

1316
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,160
how can they be

1317
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,520
preserved and expanded

1318
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,720
wow very

1319
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,040
interesting do you have any more slides

1320
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,640
to go through or

1321
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,280
may i ask some questions

1322
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,520
uh no more slides uh

1323
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,200
that was it

1324
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,440
okay so um

1325
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,880
those who are watching live please feel

1326
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,800
free to ask a question otherwise i want

1327
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,160
to

1328
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,880
pick up near the beginning when you

1329
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,040
spoke about finding oneself in a stream

1330
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,720
of action

1331
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,800
so what is happening

1332
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,880
when we find ourselves in a stream of

1333
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,800
action

1334
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,960
and i i want to hear what you have to

1335
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,119
say and then take this to some questions

1336
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,440
about memory and free will but when we

1337
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,599
are suddenly aware

1338
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,680
like whoa i'm on a run i mean i guess i

1339
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,680
did make prior decisions about deciding

1340
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,680
and so on but like whoa now my leg is

1341
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,919
moving forward

1342
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,400
so the

1343
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,720
i imagine this this varies a good amount

1344
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,560
like as a in

1345
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,640
in

1346
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,800
pure and intra individual difference

1347
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,200
variable so like both between and within

1348
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,160
people you're going to need a good

1349
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,079
amount of variance on this i think

1350
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,160
but the way you know heidegger described

1351
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,720
it in terms of this difference between

1352
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,760
like describing like hammering and

1353
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,680
you know when you're a skilled crafts

1354
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,640
person uh it's the hammer is in your

1355
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,440
hand and it is ready at hand and you're

1356
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,720
you could your mind could be elsewhere

1357
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,079
or people might have the phenomenology

1358
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,280
of this like

1359
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,280
on a run or on a drive

1360
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,119
you might just find yourself home you

1361
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,400
can listen to an audio book you'll

1362
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,000
barely know you're just you have this

1363
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,200
effortless mastery of the task set

1364
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,559
and it's only when something goes wrong

1365
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,119
that things are brought into awareness

1366
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,240
and so

1367
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,240
the

1368
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,839
it's only and so then you get this

1369
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,520
motion between so here's the hammer just

1370
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,000
in your hand ready at hand to present

1371
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,359
to him

1372
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,720
and now it's in the foreground it was

1373
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,319
initially in this um

1374
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,240
unconscious or semi-conscious background

1375
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,000
and so if someone's running like for

1376
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,440
instance they could largely be in a

1377
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,599
similar state of effortless mastery

1378
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,520
especially because you know just natural

1379
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,359
pendulum motion gets you like a lot of

1380
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,440
the control um that combined with some

1381
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,079
spinal pattern generators you know it's

1382
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,880
and a little other tweaks it's like you

1383
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,119
barely need to do anything once once

1384
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,520
you've been trained up uh but

1385
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,000
let's say you're trail running and or

1386
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,960
let's say you run and then you step on

1387
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,160
something

1388
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,240
the idea would be that this violation of

1389
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,200
your expectations uh would cause uh

1390
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,880
basically prediction error

1391
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,359
and that this prediction error the the

1392
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,880
thing that was different so okay so

1393
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,040
within predictive processing part of one

1394
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,480
of this

1395
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,960
targaryen phenomenology where things

1396
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,040
just become unconscious

1397
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,480
and you only become conscious when

1398
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,599
you're um something's wrong you might

1399
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,880
while being careful not to conflate

1400
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,400
levels of analysis

1401
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,160
you could get a good amount of this just

1402
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,400
from predictive processing with the dual

1403
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,839
tier architecture

1404
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,359
like if

1405
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,520
basically you're

1406
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,680
really well trained up you can explain

1407
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,920
things you can basically handle things

1408
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,760
just with these efficient

1409
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,079
unconscious couplings unconscious

1410
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,119
inference

1411
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,359
uh as a in a bunch of reflex arcs being

1412
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,520
skillfully deployed doing most of the

1413
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,880
things you need to do

1414
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,599
uh

1415
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,119
and whether you want to call this

1416
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,359
modeling or not you know be a matter of

1417
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,520
choice i would call it modeling

1418
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,680
but you wouldn't need to become aware of

1419
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,559
it

1420
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,160
unless something was wrong and so then

1421
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,640
the idea is this lower down it's not

1422
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,240
handled you don't predict if you don't

1423
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,920
explain away the prediction error it

1424
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,599
makes its way deeper into the brain into

1425
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,559
the

1426
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,400
it becomes more broadly

1427
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,280
uh

1428
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,960
the deeper portions

1429
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,280
of course

1430
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,680
explicit modeling and conscious modeling

1431
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,480
of

1432
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,839
processing challenge

1433
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,480
prediction errors will be greater

1434
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,160
more capable of

1435
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,319
accessing these richly connected sub

1436
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,960
networks which could support basically

1437
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,440
this larger scale integrative simulation

1438
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,119
some aspect of which would be your

1439
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,480
experience

1440
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,119
i don't know if that got it at all but

1441
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:31,920
yeah

1442
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,280
awesome so

1443
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,319
we're we're driving back towards free

1444
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,920
will because i really liked how you

1445
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,119
approached it in in this conversation so

1446
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,200
i want to think about three

1447
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,920
concepts memory free will

1448
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,800
and experience

1449
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,160
what are their venn diagrams like

1450
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,359
can we

1451
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,920
of things that we remember did we have

1452
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,760
free will for them or not more or less

1453
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,440
than expected for things that we

1454
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,440
experience do we remember them more or

1455
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,440
not could there be something that you

1456
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,599
didn't experience but you remember and

1457
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,920
had free will on and so on like how our

1458
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,640
memory free will and experience bound

1459
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,040
together

1460
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,640
and that's a fantastic question i don't

1461
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,559
so what's coming to mind

1462
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:21,839
that's that that's a whole other

1463
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,200
conversation though what's coming to

1464
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,640
mind for me at the moment is um

1465
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,559
that

1466
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,839
there's a partial definitional

1467
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,480
aspect of a connection between

1468
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,640
free will and experience

1469
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,359
and that what people so people want

1470
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,559
different things i wouldn't call free

1471
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,119
will one thing um in fact i actually

1472
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,400
think there's a certain wisdom and just

1473
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,720
like the language of it like people want

1474
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,720
both like the the willing they want the

1475
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,760
agency

1476
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,280
and they want the degrees of freedom in

1477
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,119
terms of they want to be able to pivot

1478
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,119
they want to be able to

1479
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,079
uh

1480
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,800
have what they do be a function of their

1481
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,480
past and being constrained by their

1482
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,680
memories and their meanings from the

1483
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,480
past

1484
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,000
but they also want to be able to break

1485
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,800
free

1486
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,880
um whether in the face of something new

1487
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,079
or just

1488
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,720
encountering something new or to explore

1489
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,040
and so um

1490
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,280
having that that freedom for exploration

1491
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,559
is also going to be a part of agency

1492
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,960
both within a context and across time

1493
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,480
but the memory is going to be important

1494
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,960
because without the memory uh

1495
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,040
that's the constraint based on values

1496
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,079
based on you um

1497
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,160
you know there's the many aspects of the

1498
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,319
cell for instance uh some some of the

1499
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,000
most essential ones and maybe some of

1500
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,119
the the gold standards of free will some

1501
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,280
frankfurt mesh theory afraid it was but

1502
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,960
it's like this interface of like you

1503
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,800
both want things and you want that you

1504
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
want them where the wanting that you

1505
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,960
want is based on this integrative and

1506
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,880
like narrative type self

1507
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,000
and so that would be a way in which

1508
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,319
memory would very strongly like where

1509
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,319
free will be a function both of

1510
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,400
experience that you want your experience

1511
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,520
your consciousness and your experience

1512
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,520
to be part of the causal stream leading

1513
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,640
to action

1514
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,800
part of your your valuing your affective

1515
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,720
inference you want that to be

1516
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,240
influencing both across time and in the

1517
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,200
moment

1518
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,400
um and so the experience would be

1519
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,720
essential like

1520
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,559
it's not clear that many like dennis has

1521
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,480
argued like that um the freewill

1522
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,920
consciousness must always be handled

1523
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,480
together um but and

1524
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,359
without without memory um you also

1525
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,520
though it's not you either i think

1526
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,880
there's an interesting thing though um

1527
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,640
in terms of like you're alluding to like

1528
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,319
basically connections between causation

1529
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,640
and memory uh and i believe we are

1530
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,960
better capable of remembering things

1531
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,240
when we can

1532
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,800
take them up into a causal unfolding

1533
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,720
this gives this this basically affords a

1534
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,800
representation with a more of a sparse

1535
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,400
structure of of salience of this led to

1536
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,680
this led to this and then you hold that

1537
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,920
causal graph in your mind and as

1538
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,280
basically the core of your generative

1539
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,960
model and it seems to be like a highly

1540
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,640
efficient way of remembering things is

1541
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,720
come up with a causal account of them

1542
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,400
and so if something is a product of your

1543
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,359
agency in a way that's that is all

1544
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,359
automatically structuring things in this

1545
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,760
causal set fashion and so there should

1546
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,200
be a connection

1547
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,040
between having agency and free will in a

1548
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,720
circumstance and being better able to

1549
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,480
remember things i don't know if that's

1550
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,319
the case but um

1551
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,760
it seems like some things from education

1552
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,760
theory suggests like with respect to

1553
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,359
active learning but

1554
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,400
i could see that going a lot of

1555
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,280
different ways um but

1556
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,800
and so that's a deep question and those

1557
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,440
that's that's what came to mind but like

1558
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,200
what do you think

1559
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,520
wow well the the last piece you brought

1560
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,880
up about the

1561
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,960
the sparsity

1562
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,760
kind of the sharpness on the sparsity of

1563
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,079
the causal story

1564
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,520
and then things that have a sharp

1565
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,480
and a sparse causal architecture as

1566
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,200
experienced with our very limited

1567
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,400
working memory

1568
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,640
they're like pre-digested and therefore

1569
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,079
very apt

1570
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,799
to be able to

1571
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,880
leave certain kinds of traces

1572
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,559
and then maybe something could leave a

1573
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,960
trace that didn't have a perceived

1574
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,400
sparse causal architecture in the moment

1575
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,240
but that might be like an example of a

1576
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,559
memory that's hard to recall

1577
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,040
or that might be like

1578
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,599
cleaned up in post-production

1579
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,760
and maybe very susceptible to being

1580
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,680
influenced because like subsequent

1581
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,160
updates could um

1582
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,160
try to draw attention to part of that

1583
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,760
uncertainty

1584
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,720
and um like if there was just a loose

1585
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,559
memory of many things happening at a

1586
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,079
scene

1587
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,559
asking even a question about part of it

1588
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,480
could start to sharpen

1589
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,160
that aspect

1590
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,359
and

1591
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,200
so it's

1592
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,359
it's an interesting question and also

1593
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,599
kind of like the questions like what if

1594
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,599
you had some sort of suffering but you

1595
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,040
didn't remember it

1596
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,040
or in between moments or when you were

1597
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,400
sleeping you were having some sort of

1598
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,680
negative

1599
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,399
experience

1600
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,480
so just

1601
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,440
i mean

1602
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,280
what is happening with the

1603
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,680
mind and the brain the the brain seems

1604
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,799
to be

1605
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,559
continuous

1606
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,720
but then we have these

1607
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,680
more flashes and discreteness

1608
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,319
and shifting of mental attention

1609
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,480
but

1610
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,760
it's good

1611
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,359
i just like the way you're describing

1612
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:26,799
this um

1613
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,079
uh

1614
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,000
i feel like it's like like a really good

1615
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,240
case in point of like the answer to do

1616
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,599
we or don't we have free will should

1617
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,400
always be what do you mean and and the

1618
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,720
answer is always like um

1619
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,839
like you like the way like you're

1620
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,040
showing these different processes could

1621
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,799
either go together synergistically or

1622
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,200
come apart um

1623
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,160
it's like

1624
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,000
how many meaningful degrees of freedom

1625
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,599
do we have and what circumstances or and

1626
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,440
what senses do we have how much of which

1627
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,440
of the degree varieties of free will

1628
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,440
that we want in different circumstances

1629
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,359
so it's like the answer is there isn't

1630
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,480
their free will

1631
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,839
um

1632
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,520
it seems like like much more interesting

1633
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,319
is getting into the details and useful

1634
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,520
it's like getting into the details

1635
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,040
you're talking about right now with like

1636
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,559
the different ways that memory and

1637
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,520
experience and choice can all

1638
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,839
go together or not both within and

1639
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:14,880
across

1640
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,680
time

1641
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,000
like that's

1642
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,920
and then that answer is like that i

1643
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,960
guess you could say that's like that's

1644
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,480
the real problem of free will and then

1645
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,839
that that

1646
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:28,079
um interesting yeah like um that when

1647
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,839
the experiment of pushing the button is

1648
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,079
presented as being about the exertion of

1649
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,480
decision making in the moment

1650
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,400
rather than the um

1651
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,640
memory or the recalling of something

1652
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,400
that might have been different in the

1653
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,000
moments

1654
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,079
those are quite different

1655
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,440
settings and it could be a total

1656
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,559
different neurophysiology

1657
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,280
so and also what you said about how

1658
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,880
this sort of tension between having a

1659
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,480
connection to the past and the

1660
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,720
constraints that it provides but also

1661
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,559
the ability to choose and i guess that's

1662
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,440
what's explored in these varieties

1663
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,280
papers so i wanted to

1664
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,119
uh not just ask like what are the

1665
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,319
varieties but just specifically asking

1666
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,319
about the similarities and differences

1667
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,799
with bodily action

1668
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,240
what are the varieties of free will we

1669
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,480
might have with respect to bodily action

1670
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,319
like the so-called voluntary and

1671
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,839
involuntary bodily processes and then

1672
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,280
mental action

1673
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,319
where in active inference we can model

1674
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,040
regimes of attention and metacognition

1675
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,720
and thought as like action policies on

1676
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,319
mental states so what kinds of free will

1677
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,520
are out there for the body

1678
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,640
and what

1679
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,359
does that say about what might be

1680
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,799
a cognitive

1681
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,119
degree of freedom or not like you know

1682
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,160
just choosing what we want

1683
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,319
so

1684
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,799
in terms of like

1685
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,759
body actions

1686
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:14,160
if we're dealing with something highly

1687
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,240
rehearsed

1688
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,359
then it seems like

1689
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,880
that could be an example or or

1690
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,920
something where it's like

1691
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:29,680
um

1692
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,839
you can model that the predictive

1693
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,760
processing like a hammer strike and the

1694
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,240
loop is closed before it ever even

1695
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,520
enters like the brain it's in the um

1696
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,400
the

1697
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,480
cn the cns and the reflex arc but

1698
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,559
doesn't perhaps even make it up top

1699
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,400
where your body moves that's just after

1700
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,240
the fact that you're aware of it

1701
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,240
but then if you're doing something

1702
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,880
like uh

1703
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,400
and so then like at this other extreme

1704
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,480
of abstraction you might have something

1705
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,040
like planning uh

1706
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,040
reaching a distal goal where there's

1707
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,760
many steps involved and you need to come

1708
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,920
to some sort of sequence of the steps

1709
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,520
and along the way

1710
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,640
um actually i don't that'd be the

1711
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,160
extreme but that would be

1712
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,440
a little like

1713
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,319
there's certain things that have to

1714
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,760
happen in some ways like at the extreme

1715
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,599
of abstraction it might be something

1716
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,920
like uh going to grad school or

1717
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,920
something like that or you know uh too

1718
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,680
real winning a new job

1719
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,720
two

1720
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,839
ouch

1721
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,799
um but like that itself there's a lot of

1722
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,240
things that happen have happened before

1723
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,480
other things a lot of dependencies and a

1724
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,559
lot of multiple realizability like

1725
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,319
there's always multiple realizability

1726
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,520
like you know i go to reach for this

1727
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,280
glass i could have reached for like this

1728
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,720
i could have done a weird thing and gone

1729
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,359
like this or like you know i could have

1730
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,000
pinky out pinky n you know i prefer

1731
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,640
pinky out um but like there's all sorts

1732
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,680
of things that could have done there is

1733
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,200
multiple realizable but the multiple

1734
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,359
realizability of something like you know

1735
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,880
going to college going to grad school

1736
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,799
that's even more so like the number of

1737
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:56,799
ways you can go into it and then i guess

1738
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,720
i'm thinking like in this middle regime

1739
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,079
of something that's still like very

1740
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:01,119
clearly

1741
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,319
metoric

1742
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,240
but would be novel in that like um

1743
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,760
fine-grained motor control like i'm

1744
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,839
learning for the first time like i'm

1745
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:11,520
doing a tea ceremony or i'm learning

1746
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,319
a

1747
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,640
calligraphy or i'm just learning to knit

1748
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,839
or something like

1749
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,960
there it's the fine-grained things

1750
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,040
are now

1751
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,880
being monitored um as uh present at hand

1752
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,520
and and you actually need to use your

1753
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,680
sophisticated inference machinery

1754
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,799
to help

1755
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,000
scaffold

1756
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,920
this basically um

1757
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,200
uh

1758
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,160
the acquisition of skilled motor

1759
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,559
abilities of skill the capacity for

1760
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,400
skilled motor performance

1761
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,119
but

1762
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,599
i would also i think suggest that um

1763
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,599
the whole way through

1764
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,680
it's always built

1765
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,079
um experience when when once it's being

1766
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,000
co-opted or controlled in its

1767
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,520
controllability

1768
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,440
is always um modal in a motoric fashion

1769
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,760
uh so one of the

1770
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,039
uh claims i make in this paper

1771
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,359
it um out that uh

1772
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,359
it's called pre-motor theory but that

1773
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:12,000
basically like uh through partial

1774
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,200
expression

1775
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,400
of a motor command or a motor prediction

1776
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,760
the reference copy from that the

1777
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,000
associated sensations can be used as a

1778
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,960
means of top-down attentional selection

1779
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,200
could be used as a means of attending to

1780
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,599
memory in terms of working memory

1781
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,359
basically you can use these

1782
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,680
partially expressed motor predictions

1783
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,520
not enough to actually cross threshold

1784
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,440
but use them to basically as a source of

1785
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,559
control

1786
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,720
over dynamics um

1787
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,400
of where your awareness is going and

1788
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,760
what's going in and out of your

1789
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,599
awareness and the claim i make is

1790
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,599
actually that this is uh exhaustive like

1791
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,839
this is the only like lever you have

1792
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,440
is basically whatever is built off of a

1793
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,680
control hierarchy off of skeletal muscle

1794
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,920
it's a claim

1795
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,280
but

1796
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,640
the idea would be like even talk about

1797
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,599
something as abstract as

1798
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,839
you know going to college or grad school

1799
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,359
there's still going to be

1800
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,440
some so it has to cash

1801
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,720
out as

1802
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,559
attic and modal

1803
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:11,839
uh

1804
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,280
you're seeing yourself in the different

1805
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,280
contexts even for the abstracts like the

1806
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,359
most like justice

1807
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,720
um you you still to experience it

1808
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,280
it's still going to have some sort of

1809
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,440
thing that you you know here's justice's

1810
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,240
scales here's the courtroom here's

1811
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,839
seeing this memory from your past where

1812
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,440
there is an impulse or justice was

1813
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,079
served here's you feeling this like

1814
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,599
uneasiness or this like righteousness um

1815
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:38,880
so

1816
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,039
so the idea i would claim is that like

1817
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,799
any kind of control on any level will

1818
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,119
always cash out motorically

1819
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,039
but there are meaningful differences in

1820
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,160
terms of

1821
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,599
um whether you're engaging with

1822
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,200
something which is involving these

1823
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,960
immediate fast feedback loops it might

1824
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,760
be

1825
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,000
multiply realizable but less so or

1826
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,799
something which the um

1827
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,039
affordance structure is more

1828
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,240
being played out in terms of your

1829
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,720
capacity to control it and relate to it

1830
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,160
in terms of these

1831
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:06,960
uh

1832
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,280
even more multiply realizable high-level

1833
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,200
plans of all the things situations you

1834
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,559
might be in they'll be related to

1835
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:13,760
achieving

1836
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,799
high level

1837
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,039
uh goals or abstract goals

1838
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,960
um

1839
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,559
i don't know if that makes sense

1840
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,280
well one one thought on that is it's

1841
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,680
like a jigsaw puzzle

1842
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,000
so there's only one way to

1843
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,160
assemble it and it's kind of like there

1844
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,559
there's therefore this bundle of

1845
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,880
trajectories of different realizations

1846
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,760
of how one is going to assemble it like

1847
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,119
there's sort of what happens on the

1848
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,039
table all the combinatorics of the way

1849
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,119
to assemble it and then there's like all

1850
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,880
of the real-life combinatorics about how

1851
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,559
many minutes am i gonna spend playing

1852
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,799
this jigsaw and then i'm gonna go get up

1853
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:51,280
and do other stuff and so the multiple

1854
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,280
realization of the jigsaw where it does

1855
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,760
all kind of come back to being completed

1856
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,920
is one thing and then yeah you brought

1857
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,000
up how when things are

1858
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,559
even the outcomes are unknown or there's

1859
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,400
multiple realizations

1860
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,839
those are where

1861
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,599
we start to maybe think about

1862
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:10,240
hierarchical nesting of models like

1863
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,839
we've been discussing in the slam paper

1864
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:15,440
and also

1865
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,480
the vivid imagining of different

1866
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,079
future states

1867
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:21,760
what is the

1868
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,599
regime of attention

1869
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,839
that might

1870
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,720
for somebody who wants to be an athlete

1871
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,599
help them make practicing and

1872
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,319
being on that path like more natural so

1873
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,760
what what how specific and what

1874
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,280
modalities that's kind of what it made

1875
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,280
me think of but

1876
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,119
i i kind of want to keep on going on

1877
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,079
this mental action route has there been

1878
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,720
anything like a mental or a cognitive

1879
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,799
libay experiment like where the

1880
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,480
instructions would be like

1881
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,400
take a couple of breaths and just you

1882
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,760
know get up and walk around or whatever

1883
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,200
just take a couple breaths

1884
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,960
and then identify the moment on the

1885
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,680
clock when you chose to think about x

1886
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,559
a pure mental on mental

1887
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,119
assessment

1888
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,240
so

1889
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,000
just before i forget i actually think

1890
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,359
like the what you're just mentioning

1891
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,079
like the optimal intentional engagement

1892
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,920
for something like motor or something

1893
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,720
like like a sport or some performance

1894
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,640
actually that's like a key example of

1895
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,599
like

1896
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,160
through skilled mental action or not

1897
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,839
through the skillfulness of your mental

1898
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:40,160
actions having more or less freedom

1899
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,640
where like for instance um

1900
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,240
if you're choking for instance you do it

1901
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,039
wrong um

1902
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,559
june tony has a good paper on choking

1903
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,480
and active inference and so if you get

1904
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,319
that wrong that would be like your free

1905
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:55,520
will being undermined by your

1906
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,559
mental action not being uh well

1907
01:06:58,559 --> 01:06:59,760
calibrated in terms of where you're

1908
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,280
positioning your intentional selection

1909
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,000
for optimal grip or optimal engagement

1910
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,359
with what you're doing

1911
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,599
um

1912
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:08,960
the

1913
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,599
in terms of this pure like more purely

1914
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,920
uh mental action the bed and the there's

1915
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,200
a couple

1916
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,359
there's different um versions of it that

1917
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:18,480
have been run

1918
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,520
uh some of which i think

1919
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,000
would get a little bit

1920
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,880
more to that um

1921
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,640
and

1922
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,920
kind of what you described in terms of

1923
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,280
um uh

1924
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,400
uri mouse has one paper called um

1925
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,799
decisions like it's deciding or

1926
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:39,039
decisions that matter and so basically

1927
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,760
it would be choosing between charities

1928
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,119
and so then you so

1929
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,000
um

1930
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,920
and then in this charity choice you

1931
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,000
actually don't see this same type of

1932
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,960
ramping and i think the support to some

1933
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,039
degree um

1934
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,880
the model i'm suggesting and that like

1935
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,039
if this ramping is a buildup of

1936
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,400
basically activity in your

1937
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,720
action-oriented body maps

1938
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,640
cross-coupling with your

1939
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,039
interceptive body maps i mean this

1940
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,280
feeling of urge and mental stimulation

1941
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,480
it makes sense you would have that for

1942
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,319
something like pressing a button but if

1943
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,440
it's something like which charity i'm

1944
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,440
going to donate to um you might not get

1945
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,280
that same kind of tight coupling and

1946
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,040
feedback and so i think that's some

1947
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,040
evidence in support of that but i think

1948
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,880
the particular thing you brought up

1949
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,799
there's these um

1950
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,520
this is a direction i'm uh looking in

1951
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,359
beginning to look into there's these

1952
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,759
closely related waveforms to the

1953
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,880
readiness potential um the um

1954
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,719
event-related negativity

1955
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,799
and the um spn um

1956
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,319
stimulus preceding negativity and i

1957
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,839
believe so some of them would be for

1958
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:47,279
instance um preparing for

1959
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,920
information that's coming um and then

1960
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,080
acting i think that would be the ern or

1961
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,000
the spn the stimulus proceedings

1962
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,399
you're preparing to receive information

1963
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,279
that's

1964
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,000
possibly salient but there's no action

1965
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,040
required

1966
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,040
so i think that might be potentially you

1967
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,960
could think of all these things though

1968
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,839
um

1969
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:11,359
inactively as having they look

1970
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,679
very similar electrophysiologically and

1971
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,520
i would suggest that they are

1972
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,359
all fundamentally similar and that what

1973
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,120
they're using whether we're talking

1974
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,719
about um

1975
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,120
patterns of attentional selection or

1976
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,520
specifically um orchestrating mental

1977
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,759
stimulation to

1978
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,719
act or not in terms of an overt action

1979
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,880
in all these cases it is grounded in the

1980
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,040
modalities and this is basically

1981
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,479
understood implementationally as

1982
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,640
recurrent activity in different places

1983
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,120
of control hierarchy over body maps

1984
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,560
or

1985
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,920
in terms of

1986
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,520
algorithmically and functionally an

1987
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,759
accumulation of model evidence for

1988
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,759
shifting your proprioceptive pose now

1989
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,279
before an overt action but for talking

1990
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,400
mental action similar story but if

1991
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,120
partially ex but if

1992
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,239
your

1993
01:09:58,239 --> 01:09:59,840
if the model evidence i guess would be a

1994
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,880
slightly different model but it's

1995
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,480
i if you if what you're imagining is

1996
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,880
your own you're imagining your body

1997
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,000
being in a different state that would

1998
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,239
allow you to orient differently

1999
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,040
um

2000
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,880
to bias your sensors differently to move

2001
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,560
your attention around differently to do

2002
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,560
different precision weighting

2003
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,360
but

2004
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,520
you you don't imagine it vividly enough

2005
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,000
that it will actually drive your spinal

2006
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,560
reflex arcs and that but that this would

2007
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,360
be what you would use even for

2008
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,520
potential purely mental acts

2009
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,960
it would still be

2010
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,920
co-opting a control hierarchy off of

2011
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,760
skeletal muscle and the reason i focus

2012
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,520
on skeletal muscle is because you know

2013
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,679
it's designed to have basically

2014
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:45,040
large gross actions with low latency and

2015
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,760
it's controllable and and and

2016
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,440
the conditions for fine-grained control

2017
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,000
are realized because you can actually

2018
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,080
direct your sensors

2019
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,159
using your effectors

2020
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:00,000
um with a large-scale meaningful outcome

2021
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,560
that can be causally modeled and tracked

2022
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,360
and controlled and so then the idea is

2023
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,560
that basically

2024
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,360
um

2025
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,760
vygotsky first expressed an idea like

2026
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,600
this i think with respect to thought is

2027
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,159
inner speech where first you learn how

2028
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,080
to speak and then through partially

2029
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,000
expressing your speech

2030
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,880
you learn how to co-op this process for

2031
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,840
a stream of thought um as inner speech

2032
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,040
and then whether you want to say that

2033
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,640
that exhaust thinking is a whole other

2034
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,719
thing but inner speech would be part of

2035
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,280
a significant part of thinking um but so

2036
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,840
the idea is this is all

2037
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,760
intentional mental operations whether

2038
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,120
we're talking about

2039
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,880
um shifting around

2040
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,880
basically the the fine green adjustment

2041
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,600
of an overt skilled motor act or guiding

2042
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,360
your mental action with respect to

2043
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,199
attention and mental imagery and

2044
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,159
imaginings that in each case

2045
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:51,520
um

2046
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,760
you have the initial

2047
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,640
affordance structure the initial control

2048
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,840
levers established via

2049
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,159
these overtly expressed behaviors and

2050
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,080
couplings of the world which then later

2051
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,880
by

2052
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,560
partially expressing them

2053
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,159
gives you something you can repurpose uh

2054
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,120
for things like imaginative planning or

2055
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,360
covert detention it's

2056
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,800
or i would argue

2057
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,560
any intentionally influenced mental

2058
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,920
process

2059
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,840
may be

2060
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,800
ultimately

2061
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,239
have its origins in this co-opting of

2062
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,959
motor control

2063
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,000
bold claim

2064
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
hmm

2065
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,360
okay

2066
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,800
so what systems yes go ahead

2067
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,440
i just said could be wrong

2068
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,360
not financial advice not not

2069
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,760
extraterrestrial advice hardly even

2070
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,840
active

2071
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,480
advice though it's very interesting um

2072
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,599
what systems

2073
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,760
rise to this capacity

2074
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,120
and does their embodiment matter

2075
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,280
so like there are insects with

2076
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,760
tremendously reduced central nervous

2077
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,880
systems

2078
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,239
um one could imagine a uh computational

2079
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,840
system that can engage in counter

2080
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,000
factuals but it's only affordance or

2081
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,719
embodiment is like one you know

2082
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,960
morse code receiver or something like

2083
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,360
that so what

2084
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,360
systems

2085
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,679
have this capacity and why

2086
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,760
um so i i

2087
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,320
definitely don't know the boundaries but

2088
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,640
if i were to shoot from the hip on this

2089
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,920
the idea would be

2090
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,760
the handling would still be of this

2091
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,560
computational neural phenomenology or

2092
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,480
mario phenomenology but instead of

2093
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,840
drawing brains

2094
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,920
uh we would draw a different nervous

2095
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,520
system or whatever the um

2096
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,800
signaling

2097
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,120
information processing system is we

2098
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,480
would still give it this kind of

2099
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,920
handling where there would be a

2100
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,719
mechanism there would be a function

2101
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,080
there would be some intermediate

2102
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,600
algorithmic

2103
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,000
mapping across these levels and then you

2104
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,679
connect this to phenomenology and so if

2105
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:13,440
in this phenomenology you're having

2106
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,679
basically goal states being represented

2107
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,280
and these and the representation of

2108
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,360
these goal states um

2109
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,440
is part

2110
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,679
at that level you're also able to get an

2111
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:24,560
account

2112
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,040
of the guidance of action selection to

2113
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,199
bring them about then you could say that

2114
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:32,239
you have degrees of freedom in that way

2115
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,159
so for talking about something like in

2116
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:35,600
insects um they

2117
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,440
uh you actually sent me a really

2118
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,040
interesting paper recently about dual

2119
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,320
systems thinking broadly construed um

2120
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,000
including for insects

2121
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,120
where

2122
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,920
and this

2123
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,199
it seems like you would need

2124
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,600
at least a

2125
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,199
um

2126
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,040
a two-tier hierarchy

2127
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,199
where this upper level

2128
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,480
can

2129
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,040
break free of immediate engagements with

2130
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,880
the censorium

2131
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,800
and where

2132
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,000
this lower level would allow for your

2133
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,840
couplings with the world and the

2134
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,600
orchestration of

2135
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,360
overt action selection

2136
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,600
uh in terms of actually like sensory

2137
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,280
motor cup into the world

2138
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,760
and then a process which can basically

2139
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,760
um

2140
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,920
top of that hierarchically higher

2141
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,040
that could

2142
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,800
infer these state transitions but but

2143
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,880
without them being expressed

2144
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,280
and if you have that then you could do

2145
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,440
the type of counter factual processing

2146
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,880
that you would need for planning and

2147
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,800
constructing causal models

2148
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,760
um

2149
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,600
it seems possible that insects might be

2150
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,600
able to do this in terms of um for

2151
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,120
instance like in that paper you sent uh

2152
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,199
recently um

2153
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,000
like

2154
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,960
these like do this so the central

2155
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,719
complex uh

2156
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,239
has like a lot of these properties of

2157
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,640
the hippocampal system um it's kind of

2158
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,440
like it has properties of the

2159
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,040
hippocampal system

2160
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,640
and the thalamus

2161
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,760
um

2162
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,159
at the same time

2163
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,040
but

2164
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,719
and it's giving you like the salience

2165
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:07,600
map

2166
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,560
um

2167
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,360
used for both orienting and moving uh

2168
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,800
but that you also get these mushroom

2169
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,800
bodies which are like the stratum which

2170
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,560
would be basically helping with

2171
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,400
moment-to-moment action selection

2172
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,040
biasing it in a value driven direction

2173
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:21,920
and so

2174
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,520
uh in this paper you're getting like

2175
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,000
this um

2176
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,760
dual dual systems for control

2177
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,600
one which seems to be more immediate and

2178
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,840
reactive and the other seems to be

2179
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,880
governed by slower processes and so it's

2180
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,960
possible that something like this so

2181
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,600
it's possible that this could give you

2182
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,120
the ability to

2183
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,239
do

2184
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:45,440
sweeps

2185
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,280
of possibilities

2186
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,679
of counter factual inference where you

2187
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,520
basically take the beginning of

2188
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,000
expressing the motor command

2189
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,280
so the insect is thinking i'm a

2190
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,120
locomotive in that direction

2191
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,040
um i i don't know the evidence well

2192
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,400
enough to know if this is the case but

2193
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,360
um

2194
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,719
it could be

2195
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,400
and then

2196
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,880
so so for a like a rodent you'll see

2197
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,040
these sweeps in the hippocampus of like

2198
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,440
there's a maze and you'll see like

2199
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,440
predictive of whether the mouse goes

2200
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,280
left or right you'll see these place

2201
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,800
fields representing different points in

2202
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,440
space and in anticipation of this you'll

2203
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,520
see these sweeps ahead of activity and

2204
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,440
then where this sweep is most robust

2205
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,040
that'll be the branch that like the

2206
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,560
animal will go down we'll go down back

2207
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,840
to the places

2208
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,760
in theory you could do a similar thing

2209
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,159
by other means uh maybe with some

2210
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,000
homology even in the insect nervous

2211
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,880
system

2212
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,880
maybe you can even do it in an ant

2213
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,560
colony if you're getting like an inner

2214
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,880
attractor capable of aggregating

2215
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,360
across all these different

2216
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,920
finer grain couplings and

2217
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,400
engaging in control but so basically

2218
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,320
whatever has

2219
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,880
uh or what the i i can't say

2220
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,040
i'm not going to say sufficient but the

2221
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,040
claim i'll make for necessity would be

2222
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,640
some sort of

2223
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,960
dual-tier architecture where the lower

2224
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,920
level

2225
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,840
gives you the couplings of the world and

2226
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,280
the upper level

2227
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,800
gives you

2228
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,199
counter factual affordance

2229
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:12,640
and integration uh

2230
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,600
across uh these lower level potentially

2231
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,600
segregated um

2232
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,360
coupling processes

2233
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,880
something like that could could do it

2234
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,080
for you and so

2235
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,640
could insects do it oh sure potentially

2236
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,560
i don't know could the

2237
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,280
uh insect colony do it maybe

2238
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,719
the thing where i would place a

2239
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,159
potential constraint

2240
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,400
um

2241
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,800
is

2242
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,239
it seems like we might need an

2243
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,679
architecture

2244
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,719
to have properties where it could signal

2245
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,000
fast enough

2246
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,480
where these inferences of quickly enough

2247
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,679
that it can stay on top of its evolving

2248
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,760
action perception cycles so in terms of

2249
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,360
its surfing uncertainty it's moving

2250
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,040
through the world as couplings

2251
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,880
the architecture whether we're talking

2252
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,760
about a brain or some sort of

2253
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,760
signaling across multiple individuals

2254
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,600
like a hive mind

2255
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,159
we wanted i think to be fast enough

2256
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,040
to

2257
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,120
have the estimates correspond to this

2258
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,800
sparse

2259
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,560
graph um what benjamin would call i

2260
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,640
think independently controllable factors

2261
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,000
of the world

2262
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,159
and

2263
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,760
a causal world model where you are an

2264
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,360
agent within it

2265
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,280
but it seems like you would need to have

2266
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,760
the ability to model um independently

2267
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,920
controllable factors and so you need a

2268
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,159
signal signaling system that's fast

2269
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:33,120
enough

2270
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,199
to pull this off and so some sort of

2271
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,360
small world network architecture would

2272
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,199
be likely required where you have a

2273
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,800
combination of

2274
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,600
local modularity but then synergy

2275
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,760
through having some central hub

2276
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,520
and so if this could be pulled off by

2277
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,440
the hive mind and if this can

2278
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,080
orchestrate the overall swarm to do

2279
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,159
things quickly enough to basically have

2280
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,120
purchase

2281
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,199
have the right grips on the world that

2282
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,520
it can both inform and be informed by

2283
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,520
its action perception cycles

2284
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,760
then you could have an agency

2285
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,960
architecture

2286
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,400
which by some dimensions we might

2287
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,679
describe in terms of free will

2288
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,520
that dodged the question

2289
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,360
before i respond what about just the

2290
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,760
computational one what if it was a

2291
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,760
computational one and it was it was

2292
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,560
instantiating a digital twin a limited

2293
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,800
um or comprehensive digital twin of

2294
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,120
itself

2295
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,840
i mean i personally think um the the

2296
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,360
i feel like like an integrated

2297
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,719
information theorist would say

2298
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,920
absolutely not some people uh

2299
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,920
within like active inference communities

2300
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,320
would say uh no it has to be physically

2301
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,440
realized

2302
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,719
but i think something like a digital

2303
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:49,440
twin or some sort of emulation um the

2304
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,280
important thing for me is that the

2305
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,239
um

2306
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:55,280
there is a set of dependencies of

2307
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,080
effective connectivity that could be

2308
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,120
involving virtual processes and that if

2309
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,360
you trace out the patterns of effective

2310
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,159
connectivity of kinds not necessarily

2311
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:09,360
physical necessarily like made of matter

2312
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,320
that

2313
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,880
if that is entailing the modeling of a

2314
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,159
system and its relationships with the

2315
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,480
world and where within that system world

2316
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,960
model it has this kind of agentic

2317
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,239
affordance

2318
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,480
uh for me that counts but a lot of

2319
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,159
people would disagree on that but for me

2320
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,199
i think

2321
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,360
you're trying to find the

2322
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,840
maximally explanatory core screening and

2323
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,440
sometimes that might be fine found at

2324
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,280
the level of the virtual machine and not

2325
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,360
in terms of the physical realization and

2326
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,880
then that's actually the most meaningful

2327
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,880
cause and then if you trace it out there

2328
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,159
that's where you would look for it and

2329
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,880
so that could be in a digital twin or uh

2330
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,480
emulation but a lot of people would

2331
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,639
disagree with that

2332
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,719
so when you were talking about applying

2333
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,120
this to the colony level i thought about

2334
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,520
like the foraging behavior that's like

2335
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,000
reaching out of the ground and grabbing

2336
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,800
a seed and so that's like the enacted

2337
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,320
foraging trip

2338
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,440
and then

2339
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,159
is there a counterfactual

2340
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:06,000
i could be foraging or we could be

2341
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,400
foraging at some different scale

2342
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,480
underground uh on the other side of the

2343
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,719
markov blanket of

2344
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,400
the nest entrance

2345
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,000
and then what if somebody were going to

2346
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,719
be tracking the the elevation of a

2347
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,360
forager and they'd be like well they go

2348
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,600
up and down in the nest

2349
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,440
but on the times where they make that

2350
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,560
decision to forage they always go up 200

2351
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,880
milliseconds before foraging

2352
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,600
it's like well yeah that's where the

2353
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,360
nest entrance is

2354
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,199
so without

2355
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,440
going into whether they have will or not

2356
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,400
it's like

2357
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,520
it's some kind of cognitive motor

2358
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,040
integration

2359
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,080
when the person hits the button

2360
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,679
so then the way that you frame this as

2361
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:52,159
being like not a trivial artifact in

2362
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:53,280
fact

2363
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,880
an interesting

2364
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,880
outcome of aggregation of erps

2365
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,280
across trials

2366
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,120
it's like

2367
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,400
how couldn't there be

2368
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,000
a coherent

2369
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,679
preamble

2370
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:11,760
now i guess it doesn't if we're 30

2371
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,120
seconds long

2372
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,520
that would be a different setting

2373
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,120
but then when we connected to the

2374
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,840
specific

2375
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,440
mechanisms by which they're

2376
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,760
that do have to come together

2377
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,679
in order for there to be

2378
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,280
a coherent motor action

2379
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,920
it's it's quite an interesting view and

2380
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,440
i wonder how those who

2381
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,719
have um interpreted it

2382
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,199
in a very different way feel have you

2383
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,760
spoken or asked to anyone who has a very

2384
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,040
clear and

2385
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,719
um

2386
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:48,719
different interpretation of what this

2387
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:51,520
potential means

2388
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,040
i've been discussing it some with um

2389
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,400
before i forget

2390
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,639
i've been discussing some with them or a

2391
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,040
good amount with um erimos and aaron

2392
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,000
sugar

2393
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,679
aaron sugar has

2394
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,920
um

2395
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,840
he has multiple

2396
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,120
views but some of them do disagree and

2397
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,199
so one of them is you in theory because

2398
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,600
you're averaging across multiple trials

2399
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,360
there is an interpretation of readiness

2400
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,920
potentials as artifactual

2401
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,560
um and it's possible that sometimes

2402
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,639
you are dealing with an artifact of

2403
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,159
measurement

2404
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,719
and this is like an open question

2405
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:31,679
but he's also uh for instance uh uh

2406
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,679
very like he's he's testing out like the

2407
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,400
the mental simulation view also

2408
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,400
um another interesting hypothesis he has

2409
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,840
is actually some of the evidence

2410
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,800
accumulation is actually fast feedback

2411
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,400
loops with

2412
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,040
muscle spindles and actually

2413
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,679
you're getting basically the the the

2414
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,040
urge actually a lot of is actually in

2415
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,320
the body itself uh but one interesting

2416
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,760
thing before i forget is that these um

2417
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,639
like

2418
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,040
build up and then threshold crossing

2419
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,719
i believe this you'll see across all

2420
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,320
nervous systems where you get action

2421
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,440
selection and i would wonder whether

2422
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,840
this you know similarly similarly to me

2423
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,120
saying like you know this isn't just

2424
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,360
like a brain story

2425
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,360
might we see

2426
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,040
basically something like this if we're

2427
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,960
looking at them i think you're active in

2428
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,520
paper you talk about like stigmatic

2429
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,199
coherence but through some sort of like

2430
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,719
forgive me if i'm like butchering it but

2431
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:28,880
like some sort of like measure of that

2432
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,480
kind you might see something like

2433
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,120
generalized action potentials for large

2434
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,880
scale changes in

2435
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,679
um

2436
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,080
switching modes of the hive mind of the

2437
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,480
colony uh i and while i'm just

2438
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,800
speculating i actually also in terms of

2439
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,199
multi-stage hierarchies um

2440
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,679
i actually wonder whether um

2441
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:49,360
the brains like for instance the resting

2442
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,199
state networks of the brain maybe not

2443
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,320
like there's different like

2444
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,080
granularities and parcellations you can

2445
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,000
be as much as 17 or or more if you

2446
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,719
wanted but um there are some solutions

2447
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:00,400
that are like maybe you know so seven

2448
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,000
networks are most well known but there's

2449
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,159
also like five network solutions

2450
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,760
and i'm wondering if they're actually

2451
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,920
universality classes for active

2452
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,840
inferential agents that you'll actually

2453
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,840
get something like homolog

2454
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,760
of different western state networks in

2455
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,000
their patterns of effective connectivity

2456
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,320
so generalized wrestling state networks

2457
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,320
generalized

2458
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,320
empirical phenomena to like things like

2459
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,840
readiness potentials

2460
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,600
uh very uh

2461
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,840
very speculative but that's uh that's

2462
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,120
the i think we might

2463
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,080
a few interesting things that makes me

2464
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,960
think of and uh are we making

2465
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,560
cognitive science

2466
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,840
a creation in our own image if we talk

2467
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,679
about the generalized hippocampus and

2468
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:50,239
the general and so

2469
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:53,760
to what extent are we or can we must we

2470
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,440
generalize from our own action

2471
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,159
perception loop

2472
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:00,320
is uh

2473
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,480
putting another umbrella

2474
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,920
which the human mind is just a

2475
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,520
realization of

2476
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,239
and saying well the cognitive domain is

2477
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:10,639
bigger than the human brain because it

2478
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:13,440
includes the brain body and the extended

2479
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,600
niche but also includes non-human

2480
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,600
systems like if we want a cognitive

2481
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,679
science that includes a thermometer or

2482
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,199
something like that like a thermostat

2483
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,199
is that a

2484
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,760
is that a cope

2485
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,360
because actually

2486
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,920
that is still

2487
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,920
the water that that model swims in is

2488
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,320
still human and cognitive

2489
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,520
like

2490
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,880
i don't know but these are interesting

2491
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,400
pieces i mean

2492
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,760
it seems like

2493
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,880
it seems like surely what you're

2494
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,719
describing has to be the case and it's

2495
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,960
like

2496
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,880
and that's like both a good thing and a

2497
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,440
bad thing where it's like we need

2498
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,600
to be able to draw on

2499
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,400
an analogy with something we understand

2500
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,600
uh

2501
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,960
like we're always like

2502
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,880
we're usually making you know sense of

2503
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,239
things in terms of other things and so

2504
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,840
like your our own experience as this

2505
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,840
base domain in order to give us some

2506
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,000
purchase like

2507
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,280
can we do it without it you could say

2508
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,560
like first principles thinking but like

2509
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,199
which first principles um

2510
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,199
but then there's like all of the

2511
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,280
like the baggage that could come like

2512
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,360
the disallowed like if you're if it

2513
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,880
seems like

2514
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,040
we can't avoid doing that

2515
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,639
maybe we could but if we want to but

2516
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,080
then like we really need to be careful

2517
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,320
to track the dis analogies

2518
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,760
like

2519
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,360
if we're saying generalized hippocampus

2520
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,040
like okay wait wait wait what are the

2521
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,639
dis analogies here what are the proper

2522
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:41,199
unique properties that are present in

2523
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:42,480
the target domain and not the base

2524
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,159
domain of like the map the analogical

2525
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:47,839
mapping you're doing or vice versa

2526
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,679
yes yeah

2527
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,080
that's fraught what you're describing

2528
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,040
yeah

2529
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,360
um

2530
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,920
well i think a kind of closing

2531
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,560
area just one point that i want to pick

2532
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,639
up on i thought it was really powerful

2533
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:03,840
what you

2534
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,199
said about really the social

2535
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:07,040
consequences and the personal

2536
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,840
consequences

2537
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:13,040
of interpretation of neurosciences and

2538
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,280
in some ways even science communication

2539
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,600
around empirical results

2540
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,120
like

2541
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,280
the idea that we could opt out to free

2542
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,159
will

2543
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,480
and that in a world where there's

2544
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,440
limited degrees of freedom you might be

2545
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,360
coerced into thinking you had free will

2546
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,320
or not

2547
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:34,239
but if there's any glimmer of free will

2548
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,960
it can be used to

2549
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,520
deny and deceive itself

2550
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,719
so that

2551
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,000
puts

2552
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,560
research in this area

2553
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,080
in

2554
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,719
a different reflexive position

2555
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:49,760
than

2556
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,320
research on other systems so i guess

2557
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,199
just

2558
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,560
how do we

2559
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,120
move forward here while drawing on the

2560
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,600
specifics

2561
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,159
and being respectful of basically the

2562
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:06,199
past the present and the future

2563
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,760
i mean for me i definitely have a lot of

2564
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,040
um

2565
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,600
uh soul soul in the game and that like

2566
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,000
this is actually maybe the biggest thing

2567
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,199
that

2568
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:20,560
a couple things but this might have been

2569
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:21,760
one of the biggest things that got me

2570
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,679
into cognitive science was

2571
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:27,840
a very long extended um freak out about

2572
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,360
free will when i was younger where it

2573
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,320
was just

2574
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,679
i couldn't see how anything could be

2575
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,120
mean i couldn't see how anything could

2576
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,719
be meaningful without it

2577
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,719
um i don't know if i still believe that

2578
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:38,000
exactly but

2579
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,159
um

2580
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:44,320
for me it was it was very difficult to

2581
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,320
not believe that there were like this

2582
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,760
sort of all or nothing thinking about

2583
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,440
free will and then going with the

2584
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,400
nothing

2585
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,080
um

2586
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,360
dennett actually rescued me from that

2587
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,840
with freedom evolves that his book but

2588
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,000
uh there was a long time where it

2589
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,360
seriously

2590
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,960
bothered me and it had

2591
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,600
real negative consequences in my life

2592
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,040
um

2593
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,880
the and i'm not alone in this i've

2594
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,560
talked to others and they also feel that

2595
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,880
way and um part of the way this is

2596
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,040
coming up in the present work with um

2597
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,560
psychedelics actually

2598
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,000
is um so there's this study with um i'm

2599
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,120
preparing for with creative

2600
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,480
professionals who are suffering from

2601
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,440
burnout

2602
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,480
and

2603
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,360
one

2604
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,679
thing i'm wondering in terms of like

2605
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,120
people can get burnt out from you know

2606
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,639
multiple reasons

2607
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:29,600
but

2608
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,600
to the extent that this is continuous

2609
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,480
with

2610
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,159
burnout is continuous with

2611
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:35,679
uh

2612
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:37,760
depression or like feeling like you

2613
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,199
don't have agency

2614
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:41,600
in context where you want to have agency

2615
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,440
um or or feeling like you don't have

2616
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,120
that you know adequate control

2617
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:45,920
uh

2618
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,040
for something where it really matters

2619
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,239
that you do

2620
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,679
um

2621
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:50,960
that seems like a good recipe for

2622
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,639
burnout and it seems also like a decent

2623
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:55,360
model for some forms of depression where

2624
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,520
uh if you view yourself as not being

2625
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,600
able to be a cause in the world if

2626
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,120
you're not able to meaningfully work

2627
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,560
towards your values

2628
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,560
that could be very distressing i mean it

2629
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,840
could also be a state of like a

2630
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,840
quasi-buddhistic like blissful surrender

2631
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:10,639
but

2632
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:11,760
um

2633
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,040
you know there's a question are we

2634
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,400
flirting with nihilism there this

2635
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,679
question uh and the other question is uh

2636
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:19,840
you know is it even legitimate though to

2637
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,560
be an eliminativist

2638
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,800
on the self and on volition

2639
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,040
and then just to say it's okay you're

2640
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,719
not real your vision isn't real anyways

2641
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,320
don't worry about it was that even a

2642
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,600
legitimate intellectual move to begin

2643
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,199
with i would argue it wasn't

2644
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:34,639
um

2645
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:37,199
so yeah i think this is the stakes here

2646
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:40,800
for people sense of themselves

2647
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,320
i believe they really matter and i

2648
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:43,920
believe they have both social and

2649
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,040
clinical

2650
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,360
and social consequences existential

2651
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,760
consequences for people

2652
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,080
and i'm glad that uh there's this like

2653
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,679
growing community of people in the

2654
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:55,840
neural philosophy of free will who have

2655
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,440
been doing a really great job pushing

2656
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,679
against like some of these i believe

2657
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:02,880
excessively inflationary views

2658
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,120
and i believe that active inference

2659
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:06,080
might be

2660
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,920
a really valuable contribution to these

2661
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,159
efforts in terms of providing formal

2662
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:12,320
models and models that can go across

2663
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,880
this marian neurophenomological stack

2664
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,920
um or computational phenomenological

2665
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,880
setup

2666
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,800
and actually address these phenomena in

2667
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,199
enough detail where not only do we feel

2668
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:24,719
like

2669
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,159
meaningfully satisfied where we

2670
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:27,760
understand our own agency that we could

2671
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,120
we could intervene

2672
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,400
um and hopefully for the better

2673
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,800
yeah just just some last thoughts on

2674
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,880
that that's very

2675
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,199
powerful and the

2676
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:41,280
the mutual constraints and the

2677
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,719
interdependencies of the different

2678
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,960
levels like

2679
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,280
it may come down to someone's genetic

2680
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:51,440
sequence of a receptor or um some kind

2681
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,560
of

2682
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,440
binding affinity with a molecule but

2683
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,679
then it could also be integrated in kind

2684
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:59,600
of a full stack way

2685
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,480
with

2686
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:00,770
um

2687
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:03,280
[Music]

2688
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,080
talk or action or

2689
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,679
changes to the niche

2690
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,000
so it gives like a full stack yes and

2691
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,480
way that's not

2692
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,719
uh i think

2693
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:16,960
a dead end it's more like a starting

2694
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,480
state like if the computer weren't

2695
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,920
working and then there was like the

2696
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,760
hardware and there's the software but

2697
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:22,800
then

2698
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:27,040
moving beyond just that type of analogy

2699
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,120
just very

2700
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,520
powerful about burnout and about the

2701
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,120
different cognitive ways that we might

2702
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,440
get there and get into it and get out of

2703
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,000
it and so it's like stoicism or whatever

2704
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,600
plus preferences

2705
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,719
because

2706
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,719
it's not just the neutral stance it's

2707
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,480
not just a descriptive stance on burnout

2708
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,679
there's like a preference there so adam

2709
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:49,520
if you have any other thoughts please

2710
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,000
feel free

2711
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,880
i guess a

2712
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:57,759
quick thought

2713
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,920
is if we're looking and this is like to

2714
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,840
follow up on the um commentary saying

2715
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,119
like these somewhat

2716
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:08,719
buddhistic eliminativist framings of

2717
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:11,119
um agency and i said like are they even

2718
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:14,239
legitimate uh i i'm gonna argue um no

2719
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:17,440
they're not uh and specifically um if

2720
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,440
we're thinking of something like

2721
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,639
modeling

2722
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:21,840
the self

2723
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,280
through time

2724
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,840
as a high level controller

2725
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,239
if you um engage in some sort of

2726
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,239
practice whether it's discipline

2727
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,480
meditation for a long period of times or

2728
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,080
you've taken like a very high dose of

2729
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,639
psychedelics and you've basically

2730
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,760
collapsed the depth of your the temporal

2731
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,960
depth and counterfactual richness of

2732
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,560
your generative modeling

2733
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,400
you will not find yourself there you

2734
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,400
will be gone there will be no like you

2735
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,440
to talk about and you might call this

2736
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,199
something like hugo death

2737
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,600
but then to say that there never was

2738
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,560
a you process to begin with um i believe

2739
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,560
that is actually illegitimate you've

2740
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,360
basically used a search strategy

2741
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,679
um that a priori should not have been

2742
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,440
able to find the self

2743
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,600
and then using that search strategy you

2744
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,320
then concluded it didn't exist and um i

2745
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,639
think that just doesn't work

2746
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:11,440
so

2747
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,360
um in this case

2748
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,320
uh

2749
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,960
you know the quote down and again uh

2750
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,800
you know individuals

2751
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,280
their narratives their persons

2752
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,520
you know they're real patterns

2753
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,840
and um

2754
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,159
but they're also there's a reflexiveness

2755
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:29,199
to it where

2756
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,679
their own belief and their own reality

2757
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,199
is an important part of their causal

2758
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,839
significance

2759
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:37,199
and so

2760
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:40,239
um you know i think uh it would be good

2761
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,920
to have some some nice debates with like

2762
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:42,880
different members of the active

2763
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,880
inference community who are more

2764
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,920
deflationary on things like selves self

2765
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,119
processes and agency

2766
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,480
because ultimately i think this is a

2767
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,320
thing where it's going to be like well

2768
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,760
we should you know be respectful and

2769
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,760
disagreements um

2770
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,040
i think it really matters we get it

2771
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,080
right to the extent we can

2772
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,440
thank you adam for the excellent

2773
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,719
presentation apologies for any internet

2774
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:11,199
glitches that might have happened

2775
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:13,520
we are a strange loop and this has been

2776
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,560
a strange live stream

2777
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:21,320
always good talking to you daniel

2778
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,360
you
