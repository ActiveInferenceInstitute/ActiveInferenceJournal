00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,542
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,344
It's April 25th.

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,179
20, 22.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:17,317
We're here with Adam Safron, and today
we're going to be having a guest stream

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,121
the radically embodied,
conscious cybernetic Bayesian brain

6
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,457
from free energy
to freewill and back again.

7
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:28,228
So, Adam,
thanks a ton for joining us on this day.

8
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,397
Really looking forward
to your presentations.

9
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,898
And thanks again, Adam.

10
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,799
Take it away.

11
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,305
Thank you for inviting me and

12
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,110
letting me come to talk with you
and to present some.

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:49,182
Ideas from a recent manuscript
in Entropy called

14
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:53,920
the Radically Embodied Conscious
Cybernetic Bayesian Brain and Free Will.

15
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,689
From free energy
to free will and back again.

16
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,892
And After that.

17
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,262
Looking forward to discussing
similar ideas with all of you and

18
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,330
hopefully this is a beginning of.

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,933
An ongoing. Conversation.

20
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,468
So what I tried to.

21
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,337
Do with this manuscript was basically.

22
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,474
Marry.

23
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:18,645
Good old fashioned cognitive science
with a more an activist perspective,

24
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:22,148
trying to find a middle way
between these ways of doing things and

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,485
this is a view that I've come to over
a number of years where.

26
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,755
The idea. Being that embodiment like.

27
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:29,489
You have.

28
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,925
At this point, you know, it's not news
that the mind is embodied.

29
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,693
But the.

30
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:38,064
Claim is that it is very, very embodied,
some would say radically.

31
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,065
Embodied.

32
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,901
I'm not sure if that made the most sense
to use that term,

33
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,871
because the term radical
with respect to embodiment

34
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:49,843
is usually pointing
to a perspective or radical and activism.

35
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,778
That avoids.

36
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,348
Talking about representations or models
and instead is saying,

37
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,485
you know, what's really going on
is these couplings with the world.

38
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,888
And maybe you can say
there's like an implicit information

39
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,324
processing or intelligence
even that might be objected to.

40
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,559
But these talk of.

41
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:11,030
Representations and symbols
and models from cognitive science.

42
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:15,001
That's those are not things.

43
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,772
And so this paper goes
through a perspective in which basically.

44
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,575
We do have.

45
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,545
Representations and models,
and we also have

46
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,214
these sort of inactive couplings.

47
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,415
With the world.

48
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,416
And as.

49
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:35,522
I say, it's radical in that nearly
every mental process you care to talk.

50
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,256
About.

51
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,760
The way you have to understand it,
according to this view, would be first

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,497
and fundamentally and foremost
in terms of its embodied character.

53
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,734
So I move.

54
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,936
On as a everything coming across clearly.

55
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,973
Just around the.

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,846
Yeah, I did disable my video because due
to some incredible consequences

57
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,116
of different situations,
I'm using a hotspot but it's all good.

58
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,522
OK, when you're on the run

59
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,227
I thought, hmm.

60
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,131
So review a little background.

61
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,065
I mean, a lot of this

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,102
people who were watching this.

63
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:23,603
With.

64
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,539
Or our view,
some background on predictive processing

65
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,475
and active inference,

66
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,077
maybe some of. Our.

67
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,845
Present is somewhat heterodox to.

68
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,681
All of that's.

69
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,916
Also something to. Discuss.

70
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,252
So a basic account of predictive coding,

71
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,556
you have these deep pyramidal neurons

72
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,192
and you have these superficial parameter
variants.

73
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,227
Where.

74
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,030
They're deep with respect to cortex
as having this layered structure.

75
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,066
Of. Roughly six layers

76
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,201
with some variations on the theme
depending on where you look.

77
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,270
And the idea is that.

78
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,039
The cortex as a whole is engaging in

79
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,043
what's sometimes called hierarchical
or what's often called hierarchical

80
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:07,880
predictive coding
or potentially predictive processing,

81
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,950
because there might be some assumptions
with saying predictive coding

82
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,052
that not everyone would
sign up for, such as that

83
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,489
you are only suppressing

84
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,726
and explaining away information
as opposed to

85
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,629
sometimes enhancing it.

86
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,964
And there's other nuances
that could make people object

87
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,800
to syncretic coding
instead of getting into those weeds.

88
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,738
The idea would be
that you have this hierarchy.

89
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,640
Of beliefs.

90
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,777
Implicit in neuronal organization,
the nature of these beliefs,

91
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:42,115
and this gets into these debates
about representation and and activism.

92
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,450
But this idea that.

93
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,886
I. Can say there's an implicit belief

94
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,756
at each neuron and set of neurons

95
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,192
about what they expect,
what patterns they expect to encounter.

96
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,030
And according to this predictive
processing you, through their activity,

97
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,799
they're trying to. Predict.

98
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:04,470
This incoming activity and suppress it
or explain it away.

99
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:10,443
To minimize overall activity,
and that you only update these beliefs

100
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,745
where you got it
wrong via a prediction error.

101
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,048
And this is. Under.

102
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:15,782
Certain assumptions.

103
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,784
If you have a good model
and events in the.

104
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,118
World are.

105
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,055
Relatively slow relative
to your internal signaling units,

106
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:26,292
you can have substantial
energetic savings or an organ of about

107
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,162
2% of your body
mass and 20% of your metabolism

108
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,898
seems like the kind of thing
natural selection would do.

109
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,533
And some decent evidence for. This

110
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,036
So this.

111
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:42,041
So the basics of moral architecture here
for Cortex is viewing it as a predictive

112
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,445
processing hierarchy or a hierarchy
and that each of your.

113
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,013
Models would.

114
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,682
Be a different belief hierarchy,
and they would. All.

115
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,553
Come together and exchange information
for a joint belief

116
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,589
across all your modalities
in terms of what you think

117
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,026
should be in your sensorium
as it moves through the world,

118
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,062
whether it's the world you're in
right now or some sort of

119
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,099
counterfactual world
in the present or future.

120
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,870
So that's predictive
processing in a nutshell.

121
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,473
And so in this account,
the goal was to use

122
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,911
predictive processing
to try to get into the micro mechanics

123
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,181
of goal oriented behavior and agency

124
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,151
And so what I suggested is that

125
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,521
work has been
done within act of inference.

126
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,391
On this sort of.

127
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,192
Imaginative. Plan.

128
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,795
Pursuing the. Goals on the.

129
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,331
Work to refer to
would be unsophisticated inference

130
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,834
or sophisticated affective inference,
which is.

131
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,202
Thinking about.

132
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:47,340
Basically planning into the future
as this tree search of possibility,

133
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,910
scrambling on different
branches of these possibilities.

134
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,147
And then picking the ones either
in imagination

135
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,682
or in reality
that would correspond to you

136
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,453
minimizing your prediction
or the best or realizing value the best.

137
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,957
But this exploration
of a tree of possibilities

138
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,893
and going down different branches.

139
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,562
And so this would be,
I suppose, a particular flavor of this.

140
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,931
And the idea being that.

141
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,498
A lot of it.

142
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:16,969
Would be pulling along this stream
of consciousness of imaginings.

143
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:18,504
Would.

144
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:22,074
Be this iterative comparison
between sensed

145
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,777
and imagined states
or between various goals states.

146
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,346
So here. I.

147
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,916
Have this comic book
that a friend helped me make.

148
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,552
And I have multiple.

149
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,286
Comics throughout.

150
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,788
I tend to view comics as being.

151
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,824
Really.

152
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:42,361
Highly expressive in a way that I think
we should probably use them more in terms

153
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:46,399
of being able to capture the joints
and experience space

154
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,167
with sufficient richness and detail.

155
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,003
And there could even be something
like comic book ask

156
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,073
about the stream of experience,
which could be part of the reason

157
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,441
that they're so effective.

158
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,109
But for sure, in this.

159
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:57,510
Comic.

160
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,379
Or a modal frame sequence,
as I sometimes call it,

161
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,485
you see in the bottom here,
this is the actual pose of the agents

162
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,187
and up top,
what's going through the mind's eye,

163
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,891
whether we're talking about
and imagination or perception.

164
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,661
And so here it's just a simple
contrasting of what you're perceiving

165
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,897
at each given moment
and then what you're imagining.

166
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,734
So you're sitting you want t you

167
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,203
then look and you say,
I am not talking to you.

168
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,405
I'm at my computer
and there is a laptop in front of me.

169
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,042
You look down and you're imagining

170
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,212
having tea in your cup, but then you look
and there is indeed no tea.

171
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,581
And then you imagine a next step.

172
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,551
And so what's, what's happening here
is you're doing this contrasts.

173
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,488
And what I propose is that in contrasting
between these states,

174
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,826
they're arranging
they're basically setting up prediction

175
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:50,062
errors for each other
where what doesn't match

176
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,165
with potentially

177
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,602
get you a natural prioritization. Of.

178
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,073
What features are unaligned
and then from those

179
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,110
you use that to retrieve
some sort of relevant affordance

180
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,713
to help you bridge this gap
between your imagination and reality.

181
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,816
And there's a lot of devils in details
of the ways this could work, but

182
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,353
that some sort of iterative
contrasting of

183
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,657
goals, states and a goal hierarchy
where it's like

184
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,827
you might have an ultimate goal
but to achieve that goal, you have to now

185
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:22,662
go and think of

186
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,631
what are all of the sub steps
and the subgoals that would be needed

187
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,134
to actually get the T in my. Hand.

188
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,436
You're going to have to

189
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,873
ambulate to the kitchen,
make the tea, et cetera, et cetera.

190
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,443
And as you're going back and forth,
at some point, at some point,

191
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,614
you either have a plan that's compelling
enough or the next action is close

192
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:46,185
enough to your present post that you're
just find yourself launching into action,

193
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,488
sometimes accompanied
by a feeling of having decided.

194
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,224
Sometimes you just find yourself moving.

195
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,261
But that's the basic account here that

196
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,298
the stream
of consciousness is being pulled along

197
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:03,903
in this goal oriented fashion,
this value driven fashion,

198
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,506
sometimes more freely wandering,
but sometimes but but usually

199
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,677
there's an interest
and you're as an act of inference

200
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,780
and predictive
processing your preferences

201
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,516
or your attract insights attractors
that you'll find them as a system

202
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,286
which you're attracted
to takes the form of predictions.

203
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,822
And so the things in your mind
that you're imagining.

204
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:23,923
That.

205
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,960
They become the goal, they become
the state of the world that you prefer

206
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,197
in that instance or in general,
if it's a regular kind of imagining

207
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,601
and this now becomes the attracting state
that your system self organizes.

208
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,769
And you.

209
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,238
Engage
in action selection of different kinds to

210
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,907
minimize that difference
between what you're imagining.

211
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,677
And what you.
Are estimating for the. World

212
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,180
so I go.

213
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,916
Into some discussion. Of.

214
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,419
Neural architecture and different aspects

215
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,889
that might be more or less relevant
for different.

216
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,958
Aspects of.

217
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,526
This kind of stuff.

218
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,028
And I probably.

219
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,697
Should have just thrown this
on top of a picture of a brain.

220
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,766
But I didn't.

221
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,168
But in some ways
it might be a good thing.

222
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,771
And I wonder whether

223
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,374
this account
of having a dual tier system,

224
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,078
something like a system on in
a System two,

225
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,781
is a broader story than just brains.

226
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,749
And so, you know, I have we're not here.

227
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,318
Like here would be neural substrates
that would enable you to do this.

228
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,588
But well, it. Could be across brains.

229
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,691
You might have similar processes
happening

230
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,860
within, let's say, like an insect
nervous system by different means.

231
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,797
Like instead of the basal ganglia,
you might be using the mushroom.

232
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,197
Bodies.

233
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,667
For talking more like an ant colony,
for instance.

234
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,670
It's possible you have a different
like a tracking states of the colony

235
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,571
where some are

236
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,808
taking this role of like a higher level
controller and a lower level controller.

237
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,945
But the basic idea here
is that you have an upper level

238
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,549
controller that's capable of aggregate
information across different.

239
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,086
So you have this lower level process
and this control where the lower.

240
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:00,786
Level.

241
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,823
Is taking care
of your immediate couplings

242
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,626
with the world
this would be the more inactive portion.

243
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,130
If we're talking about the brain,
it would be something like

244
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,499
so loosely assembled. A.

245
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,901
Constellation. Of.

246
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,405
Cortical reactive dispositions,
maybe orchestrated

247
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,142
by the cerebellar system of
what would be called amortized inference

248
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:27,179
and would be largely unconscious
and automatic phenomena.

249
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,815
Ologists
would talk about just like things being.

250
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,052
Ready at hand.

251
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,987
As opposed to being present to hand.

252
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,691
You're just effortless engagement
and effortless mastery with the world.

253
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,060
But on top of this,

254
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,798
you have a slower process in this case,
I'm saying it's more involving conscious

255
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,235
processing, something more system
to like to use Kahneman's language.

256
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:50,803
Where.

257
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,440
It's involved in more deliberate
potentially effortful.

258
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:55,374
Modes.

259
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,277
Of cognition,
which would be a higher level.

260
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,312
Of control over this.

261
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,350
Faster, smooth coupling system.

262
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,054
So go into some details
of neural architecture.

263
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,158
Potentially this might be just.

264
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,292
What you.

265
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,928
Need for a lot of active
inferential agents,

266
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:20,132
something like this across whether or not
we're talking about neurons.

267
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,803
This this might be a broader story
for active inferential agents.

268
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,071
So to return.

269
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,341
To the example. Of. Making t

270
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,945
go into it some more single.

271
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,515
So we're back to the mappings

272
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,386
here in the in.

273
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,021
Areas associated with.

274
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:42,321
Mental.

275
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,691
Imagery, maybe even physical
and computational substrates of

276
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,096
mental imagery phenomenon
phenomenology itself like the Junius

277
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:55,167
for instance, involved in imagination
have heavily implicated.

278
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,937
Multiple. Reasons
to think why this was the case.

279
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,737
But, you know,

280
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:01,807
I have this little Cartesian theater here
with the different imaginings.

281
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,909
And down.

282
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:09,715
Below the idea is you are iterating
through different imaginings, imaginings,

283
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,985
largely via large scale

284
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,654
orchestration by the hippocampal complex.

285
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,391
And it's a capacities to couple

286
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,061
with the rest of the cortex
to guide these.

287
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,195
High.

288
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,763
Level tracking states

289
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:28,634
where some portions of which would be
your experience and so the reason you

290
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:34,807
bring up the hippocampus then here is
it seems to be a specialized subsystem

291
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,843
for sequential predictive modeling.

292
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,013
You can say that for cortex as a whole,
technically hippocampus

293
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,650
is a kind of cortex,
archaic cortex of old vintage,

294
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,588
but that basically so
Damasio will talk about this in terms

295
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,424
of a convergence divergence zone
where many things will funnel in

296
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,760
and then funnel
back with high centrality.

297
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,197
Of. Fresh
read his name, he said Waterloo,

298
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,467
the spawn architecture.

299
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,702
But he'll talk. About semantic pointers.

300
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,105
But there's different ways
of viewing this.

301
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,908
The high centrally set campus
as it basically

302
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:14,313
will predict this trajectory
of the overall organism through space.

303
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,083
You can both encode memories

304
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,887
what was happening in my story
and whether in reality or imagination.

305
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,088
At each point,

306
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:27,760
as I was moving through space and time
and you could also use it

307
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,796
for replay, including
in counterfactual circumstances.

308
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,298
And so I have.

309
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,900
Some diagrams here of the neural systems
involved.

310
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,070
And right here you would have the idea.

311
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,071
I think that's good for now.

312
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,574
So I wants to know more details
about that later.

313
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,375
We could.

314
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,112
So to a turn to.

315
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,317
Trying to go more phenomenological.

316
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,987
So these modal frame sequences or comics,
ultimately I'm trying to build up

317
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,325
to is a sufficiently detailed account
of neural architecture

318
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,929
and a sufficiently detailed account
of phenomenology that we can talk.

319
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,530
About.

320
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,100
So that we can basically talk about
something as highfalutin as free will

321
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,702
and have some purchase.

322
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,671
So in this.

323
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,108
Formal complex model sense,
once you have that up top.

324
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,378
An imagining.

325
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,879
Row below.

326
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,282
That, you have
what's actually in your perception.

327
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,651
Below that, you have your pose
and your proprioceptive

328
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:27,920
inference.

329
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,122
And then below that you have
your intercept of inference.

330
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,926
And so as.

331
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,962
You're stepping through,
the stream of consciousness is evolving

332
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:40,699
through space
and time encoded or orchestrated.

333
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,101
By the.

334
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,904
Hippocampal system at this high,
potentially most integrative

335
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:51,744
high level of action
selection, you are having different.

336
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,047
Walls in your body.

337
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,350
Corresponding
to the intercept of concomitant.

338
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,718
Of or.

339
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,722
The intercept of aspects of what it means
to be in different situations.

340
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,760
So for instance, like a hunger situation
here, you're getting prediction, error

341
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,997
intercept, a prediction that would be
roughly vaguely, vaguely localized.

342
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,600
Here is like a cool sensation

343
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,704
around your gut and mouth
or thirst or hunger, something like this.

344
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,774
And now as you're going into movement,
you might have here like

345
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,477
you're
still having this intercept of code.

346
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:26,578
Of hot.

347
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,680
And cold
say it's pleasant and unpleasant,

348
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:33,018
but it's kind of getting infused
into other modalities

349
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,155
where your proprioception,
some of the phenomenology of like

350
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,890
feeling like an urge in your body.

351
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,627
It's one of the claims I make
is that you have this kind of quasi

352
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:46,098
synesthetic cross mapping
which in intercepting signals signals

353
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,901
and the receptive and receptive

354
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,637
associates.

355
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,704
Are part.

356
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,940
Of the reason I claim this
and say that this is both part

357
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,343
of the phenomenology of will
and maybe part of the mechanism also

358
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:03,215
is that intercepts of signals
are purely localize able

359
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,985
in space and time that you tend
to have pretty low resolution for them.

360
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,321
And so they

361
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,758
may drift free from their sources
and as a kind of anomalous inference.

362
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:17,563
But an adaptively anomalous inference,
they may get infused into.

363
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,732
The. Relevant effector and sensory

364
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,869
systems and objects in the worlds
for which they would be relevant.

365
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:26,505
You know.

366
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:30,676
I make a lot of different claims in this
work from a number of years of study,

367
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,912
and a lot of it can be taken
la carte, like you can find

368
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,482
some things to be more compelling
some things to be less compelling.

369
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,219
But I do think you get a whole it's
greater than the sum of its parts, but

370
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,387
it can also be taken
in a piecemeal fashion.

371
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:46,725
So you might not be particularly
compelled by this account of interception

372
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,895
as being synesthetic in nature, but

373
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,364
nothing really.

374
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,866
Not too much will right on that.

375
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,567
But it nothing, none.

376
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,603
Of that much, much of what will follow
will right on that.

377
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,904
But it could end up being important.

378
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,173
So I'm putting it in there. OK.

379
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:03,542
And so

380
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,613
across all of this, this is happening
within a perspective

381
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,550
of computational neuro
phenomenology, as Neil Seth calls it.

382
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,652
I call it Marianne Neural Phenomenology.

383
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,655
And the reason I call it
Marianne is specifically

384
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,093
his account
of multiple levels of analysis, which

385
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,795
I guess supervision on each other.

386
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,533
And you can do two things
because things have these multiple levels

387
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,334
that they can be engaged with.

388
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,338
You can either engage with them ala carte
because of let's say, for instance,

389
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,208
you want to do cognitive science, but
you have no idea of how the brain works.

390
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,610
And then for many years we haven't.

391
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,611
And there's a lot of mystery.

392
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,747
So you can kind of bracket.

393
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,347
Like.

394
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,650
Here's this big set of unknowns,
but it's at a different level.

395
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,351
But we're looking at this other level.

396
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,521
We can obtain knowledge even though we
might be ignorant to these other levels.

397
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,425
And that would be, you know,
functionalism and cognitive science.

398
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,563
But for me, what's more exciting
about this, actually, this Marianne Stack

399
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,500
is the capacity not for independence
but interdependence

400
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,504
and mutual constraints
using the implementation level

401
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:09,241
or the mechanistic level as a constraint
of what's a likely set of algorithms,

402
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,078
using a likely set of algorithms
to test hypotheses

403
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,315
on the implementation level,
using what you think.

404
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,518
The emotions.

405
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,488
And things like neuropsychiatric
literature to constraint and then imaging

406
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,692
literature to constrain algorithm
and thereby implementation.

407
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,861
So the the idea of what excites me
is like filling in this

408
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,297
crossword puzzle strengths

409
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,068
and then cross-referencing them
with the phenomenon.

410
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,803
So that.

411
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,804
As a.

412
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,840
General of all.

413
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,510
I'm using basically machine
learning as the person principle,

414
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,848
particularly onto the basis of this idea
that a lot of cortex could be understood

415
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,217
terms the. Oracle pretty good.

416
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,188
But also evoking some additional machine
learning principles.

417
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,490
But that's the overall scope of it.

418
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,861
In terms of. The.

419
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,062
All the body parts and faces.

420
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:08,300
This is part of the radical embodiment
idea is that instead of like the cortex

421
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,070
being this like grab bag of associations
with areas.

422
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:17,542
And the why, the idea is once you.

423
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,977
Really place it

424
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,712
front and center
as a cybernetic controller

425
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,649
for an embodied embedded agent, but
you place embodiment front and center.

426
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:28,487
Or the front, and they left

427
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,255
this.

428
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,359
Area right around here.

429
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,761
So something like.

430
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,697
A seven to

431
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:42,934
but then you're like.

432
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,069
Wait a second,

433
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,772
that's not too many steps removed
from where the ears first pipe them.

434
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,375
So the idea that something like,
you know, going from.

435
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,111
Phonemes or you know.

436
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,181
From sound patterns
undifferentiated to phonemes and.

437
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:01,753
It's the steps.

438
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,558
It ends up making cortex its functions,
in my opinion, a lot more applicable.

439
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,961
It becomes somewhat like location,
location, location and location

440
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,098
relative to the modalities
that ends up explaining a lot of things.

441
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,167
That similar story for Broca's area.

442
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:15,400
What a.

443
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,370
Coincidence that it's not a hop skip
and a jump away from.

444
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,472
What might move your mouth. That's

445
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:22,741
there's devil's.

446
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,542
In details here.

447
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,711
I don't to be glib
and underestimate the complexity.

448
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:26,912
But the.

449
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,548
Claim is that actually once
you place embodiment in the center,

450
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,185
an elegance kind of falls out and becomes
a lot easier to keep track of things.

451
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:37,322
If you're thinking of cortex as this
control cybernetic control hierarchy

452
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,992
over to basically help a body move
through the world

453
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:44,062
and model
the world as it moves through it.

454
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,631
So we are ready,
I think, to get to free will

455
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,136
and so taking these model frame sequences

456
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,573
and here is doing one
for this experience of standing.

457
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,043
In. To make tea.

458
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,779
And then taking that model.

459
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,280
And then porting, it's
all about experience.

460
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,950
So what was all about paradigm?

461
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,652
So some people say today,
some people say, look back.

462
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,489
I think look that said, look at.

463
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,823
But I will. Continue to say.

464
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,326
What they more common and I just will

465
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,363
that is that you're there and.

466
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,967
You want to see do people
or don't they have something like

467
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,270
meaningful
conscious control over their actions.

468
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,674
And so the idea is, OK, let's
strip this down and take like the most

469
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,911
insignificant of all actions, like, well,
surely we need to have control.

470
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,879
There.

471
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,047
If we're gonna say
we have control anymore.

472
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,817
And so the decision to just move
your hand

473
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,254
based on feeling like you want to do so

474
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:46,291
and this coming from basically it's
endogenous.

475
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,427
You're not being something
decided from without, but

476
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,663
you do something
based on something internal to you.

477
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,634
And what was found with these.

478
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,037
Studies or Bay,

479
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,841
is that you get this ramping activity

480
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,810
preceding.

481
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,480
The. Decision to move your hand.

482
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,882
One. Of these, OK,
you have this clock, right?

483
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:14,820
And there is it's a big clock
that you're looking at. And.

484
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,456
That might be a or a big hand
moving in a circle

485
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,992
and the reason you have
this is basically so that you can

486
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:25,230
estimate the time when it was that
you said, I will move my hand.

487
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,998
When did you decide

488
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:30,602
and you then say, OK, when you made that
decision, what were you looking at?

489
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:34,439
Where was this dot
as it moved around in a circle?

490
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:38,243
And this can get you very fine
resolution subset and resolution,

491
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,245
because if it's a big clock, it's

492
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,914
because then the DOT will be moving
slowly and you say, OK, right there.

493
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:44,983
But what's.

494
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:50,055
Observed is that you're getting this
ramping activity, which is predictive.

495
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,824
Of. The action called the readiness
potential.

496
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,393
And it will peak, you know.

497
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,797
A good 200 milliseconds
before you reporting.

498
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:03,602
It varies, but it'll peak substantially
before you saying, I've decided.

499
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,837
And so if.

500
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,441
And so the claim is, well,
if this potential as predictive

501
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,143
information of your action
and is the cause of your action

502
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,413
and it's happening prior
to your conscious

503
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,850
decision, your decision cannot be
the thing that caused the.

504
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,584
Action

505
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:21,887
there's a.

506
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:25,524
There's a problem right away
with this in that with your methods,

507
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,693
you're actually averaging over many,
many trials

508
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,930
to get these waveforms because you're
measuring from the outside of the brain.

509
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,301
It's like trying to detect like events
inside a stadium while measuring

510
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,337
like listening to the roar of the crowd
on the outside and you're

511
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,171
limiting what you can do.

512
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:44,042
So you have to average together
a lot of different episodes

513
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,379
and then you get these event
related potentials or ERPs. And

514
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:48,747
so you.

515
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,449
Get predictive information
from this of when people moved.

516
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,853
But the idea that a readiness
potential is causal or deterministic

517
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,122
in some fashion,
there's some debate about that.

518
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,757
Whether you can infer that.

519
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,026
I'm. Going to say
that the readiness potential is

520
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:06,631
in fact reflecting a causal process
and it's reflecting a conscious

521
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:10,068
causal process
even that is contributing to the action.

522
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,271
Upstream of.

523
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:17,275
The decision itself,
where the decision could have some.

524
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,209
More.

525
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,212
You know, it depends and I don't know
if there's one account, but it could have

526
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,215
some phenomenal aspects to it
in that the decision

527
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,352
is not necessarily the thing.

528
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,455
It's not the only difference maker there.

529
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,124
But the idea is that this.

530
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,594
Is a function.

531
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,697
Of mental imagery where you.

532
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,299
Are imagining will.

533
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,901
When you're.

534
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,836
Rehearsing moving your hand,

535
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,006
you're having different friends
associated with it.

536
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,976
And that building up.

537
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,446
Of that recurrent building up of activity
in these body maps,

538
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,514
whether we're talking about.

539
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,749
The getting.

540
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:01,386
Ready to actually change your purpose
of this pose as you're imagining

541
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,623
starting to move closer to a threshold
where you're going to get robust

542
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,826
enough activity that is actually going
to drive your muscles and your effector.

543
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,893
Systems or.

544
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,631
Building with activity
in your intercept of no doubt,

545
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,567
it seems like you're insular and singular
hierarchies and maybe they're crossed,

546
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,870
maybe they're synesthetic like
cross couplings with other modalities

547
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,138
that that building up

548
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,975
of a feeling of urge is itself
consciousness leading to the stream.

549
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,846
The causal stream of action.

550
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,348
So that I.

551
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,750
Would say so, yeah.

552
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,387
The and then on top of all the different
imaginings would be orchestrated by

553
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:39,624
the temple system
would be the basic model. So

554
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,363
currently and.

555
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,631
So and

556
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,468
so currently I am working on

557
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:55,473
expanding this to sing
with different states of consciousness.

558
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,643
And. The ways
in which they could impact these sorts

559
00:27:58,643 --> 00:27:59,944
of phenomena.

560
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,481
In terms

561
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,352
of changing your awareness
of this rehearsal process

562
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,389
or changing

563
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,259
that would be one of the primary
things of interest.

564
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:19,330
So and also whether differences
in the mechanisms of agency

565
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,434
could potentially contribute
to the phenomenology of psychedelics.

566
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,402
I'll try to explain what I mean.

567
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:28,473
So here would be someone relatively
unaltered engaging in mental rehearsal.

568
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,608
Your mind's
sort of wandering off to nature.

569
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:31,843
They're seeing a tree.

570
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,880
Here's imagination, here's perception
here more vivid than imagination.

571
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,318
And they're just sort of imagining
things, imagining will I move on to move?

572
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:45,223
And then in a certain point,
the imagination becomes vivid enough.

573
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,826
That they. Can really see it happening.

574
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,161
And at a certain point. Of.

575
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,864
Vividness of a map,

576
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,600
things as a function of this rehearsal.

577
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,937
Of Will I move on, I move, you get enough
build up of.

578
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,272
Whether we're on the implementation
level, we might talk

579
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,075
or mechanistic level,
we might talk about recurrent activity

580
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,643
in terms of active inference.

581
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,779
On the functional level,
we might talk about model.

582
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,981
Evidence but.

583
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:14,686
At a certain point you cross a certain
threshold leading to model selection

584
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,723
of you altering your purpose at the pose,
and this becoming

585
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,626
a self-fulfilling prophecy
through act of inference.

586
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:26,598
You then minimize the prediction error
between your imagination, a moving

587
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,001
and the and the action
through reflex arcs the way that.

588
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:31,836
Basically.

589
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,639
Motor control is thought or
is thought to work in act of inference.

590
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,142
And predictive processing.

591
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,711
So the psychedelic angle would be as

592
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,915
someone was dosing with these compounds,
their imagination becomes more.

593
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:44,682
Vivid.

594
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,285
And they might show stronger
ramping at first.

595
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,922
And maybe greater awareness
of the patterns of mental stimulation

596
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,491
leading up to the action.

597
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:57,729
It might get stronger
still as you dose more.

598
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,129
And more

599
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,232
and also.

600
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,968
Greater coupling between and tear
receptive and proper receptive.

601
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,337
O'Dowd is increasing the gain
on this positive feedback

602
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,406
between mental imagery
and feelings of urge.

603
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,509
And so in a way,
this would be an enhancement.

604
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,711
Of willing.

605
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:18,183
The willing aspect of agency
as you move up the dose response curve.

606
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,285
But then you get to a certain level
and you start to go

607
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,320
into this psychedelic regime
where your thought becomes

608
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:28,326
highly creative and then you're directed
willing to start to.

609
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,694
Go down.

610
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,230
Potentially. The idea is you might.

611
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,597
Find.

612
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,568
Other things competing
for your awareness, different creative

613
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,102
possibilities.

614
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,171
So you're
now imagining nature very vividly.

615
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:44,909
And this is competing with you
rehearsing, Will I move or won't I move?

616
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,846
And in

617
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,416
and let's again.

618
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,051
Predicting I'm.

619
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,920
About to move up with the dance.

620
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,723
This is in first is

621
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:04,028
the new You erecting a

622
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,832
move might become lots.

623
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:11,703
And lots of extremely high doses
you might get and compromise

624
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,974
of these mechanisms of agency
of this conjoining of your intercepted

625
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,010
and your receptive predictions
of your basically

626
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,113
of your stream of consciousness
being pulled.

627
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:22,981
Along.

628
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:27,085
By value driven policies selection via
sophisticated effect of inference.

629
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,788
So I think so.

630
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,991
The reverse direction is this in terms of

631
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,961
this paradigm,
potentially informing psychedelics

632
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,998
could be the one source of hallucinations

633
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,901
or delusions or atypical.

634
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,302
Altered.

635
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,439
Consciousness and cognition would be
that if you take the basic mechanism,

636
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,910
micro mechanics of agency. And.

637
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,012
And you compromise that.

638
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,680
So, you know, as you're

639
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,117
you're beginning to somewhat
imagine action, but it's not

640
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,219
well integrated
into some causal unfolding,

641
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,621
you could come to this
anomalous inferences.

642
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,125
About what's. Causing these basically.

643
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,228
The different.

644
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,598
Endogenous activity,
your brain, the different.

645
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,098
Events.

646
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:18,202
That could lead to motor to motor actions
if these aren't being integrated

647
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,472
into a self-consistent coherent
causal unfolding.

648
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,343
One of the ways
that you could try to make sense of this

649
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:28,546
would be a confabulation
of something like a hallucination and

650
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,550
so this could potentially also explain
some of psychedelic phenomenology.

651
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,019
And. Potentially.

652
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:35,820
A clinical.

653
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,289
Neuropsychiatric terminology
with things like schizophrenia

654
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,560
as potentially being a function
of disrupted agency mechanisms.

655
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,663
So that's currently the area of focus.

656
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:49,067
And there's going to be a preprint
just came.

657
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,235
Out on that called.

658
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,973
On the degrees of freedom worth
having psychedelics

659
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,142
as a window for understanding
and expanding.

660
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,311
Of free will.

661
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,180
I believe that's what I called it.

662
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,649
And so that would be a little bit.

663
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,317
Also of

664
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,721
apologies
if there's any strange stream hiccups,

665
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:14,125
but could you maybe unpack what
the alien or extraterrestrial was doing?

666
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,762
And how does the confabulation relate
to a narrative

667
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,999
understanding of action.

668
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,203
So. In this one,

669
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,872
so we're showing out

670
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,641
just like imagining your hand moving
or imagining being a nature

671
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,244
and then Sam Harris.

672
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,579
Just goes up.

673
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,081
And it goes up
and you might start to get some more

674
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,752
intense intercepted sensation sensations.

675
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:45,123
The. Five H-2A receptors,
which heavily mediate

676
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,258
the effects of classic psychedelics.

677
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,260
There.
They're highly expressed in the interior.

678
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,697
And so the top
of the intercept of hierarchy.

679
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,932
And so keep going up

680
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,403
comes the sensations become more intense.

681
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,506
Imagination moves closer to reality.

682
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,674
And so here. Like what.

683
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,310
I'm calling the heroic dose
in this extreme dose regimes,

684
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,048
you're starting to get, for instance,

685
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,152
like your ownership of the actions
are starting to get undermined.

686
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:18,122
So here I'm depicting
like you find your hand moving,

687
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:22,160
but you're not accounting
for you're willing of the move

688
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:26,564
being the thing you're not saying, Oh,
I was rehearsing it and it felt this way.

689
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,267
And that was part of the causal feeling
to action.

690
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,102
You just found yourself moving.

691
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,838
And so one way you could make sense
of this or confabulate around

692
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,208
this here is a hand
like it's a feeling of the hand

693
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,278
pushing down on your hand
from without just an example of

694
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,548
a potential confabulation
or hallucination someone might have.

695
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:48,753
And this one here, it's expanded
and it's this basically

696
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,457
someone it's not even your hand anymore
pressing it, but an alien pressing.

697
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,327
It's just an example, for instance,
so psychedelics,

698
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:00,264
they the classic psychedelics
will act in these five H2O receptors.

699
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:05,803
They are heavily expressed on these deep
pyramidal neurons. Of.

700
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:06,871
Texas.

701
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,339
Six layers

702
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:13,111
the layer five will basically they're
big neurons that loop with the thalamus

703
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,647
and they let you form these broad
synchronous complexes,

704
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,383
which in predictive processing
are thought to encode your beliefs,

705
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,019
some subset of
which would be your experience.

706
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,156
And so if you increase the gain

707
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:29,627
on these, the ideas that you might have
enhanced perceptual vividness,

708
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,499
but because you've
done a radical alteration to

709
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,669
multiple
kinds tudes like the normal regime. Of.

710
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,372
Processing in your mind,
the normal ways you would model,

711
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,275
even though you're experiencing things
intensely,

712
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:48,746
this would actually be
of an atypical variety of experience.

713
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,749
And so here is the intense experience

714
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:55,720
and the intense perception
apperception of the alien.

715
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,421
It's a counterfactual alien.

716
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,790
It's not actually an alien, but

717
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,528
that would that would be an example
of an anomalous inference you might make.

718
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,630
And it has. Some.

719
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,733
Relation to what's happening
and the fact that maybe

720
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:13,037
there was some motor rehearsal going on,
but you're not able to keep track of it.

721
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,941
And so and here this is
you're actually having phenomenal

722
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:21,279
consciousness in each of these moments,
but you don't have conscious access

723
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,115
unless in these iterative
moments of experience,

724
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,951
you can somehow get callbacks.

725
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,019
Where.

726
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,689
Things can be contextualized
within some sort of causal unfolding.

727
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,759
The claim would be that basically
this would be a way of separating

728
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,495
out phenomenal consciousness
from conscious access,

729
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,132
that there's things that can happen
as you're generating these Quayle states,

730
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,468
as estimates of what's
happening of system, world,

731
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:47,805
system, world, system, world
specifically your sensorium

732
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,607
as you think it is

733
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,476
based on your current engagement
or in counterfactual circumstances,

734
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,012
and that that's
a stream of consciousness,

735
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,682
but that not all of the frames
of experience.

736
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,318
Are. Accessible or memorable.

737
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:04,422
And so in this case here, you know,
maybe there was some rehearsal,

738
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,324
but you're not keeping track of it.

739
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,826
And then the, the, the.

740
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,996
The, the best causal account
you're able to come. Up with.

741
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,365
Was that an alien made you do it.

742
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,800
And you might have even forgotten

743
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,401
that this was you,
or maybe you do remember it,

744
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,171
but would need probably
some more contextualization or not.

745
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,372
It's unclear, but.

746
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,209
So that would be the basic ideas
that psychedelics

747
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:28,312
would be increasing consciousness level
or the vividness of your.

748
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,814
Experience.

749
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:34,685
But potentially undermining the coherence
in terms of causal unfolding

750
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,989
or your usual priors
by which you structure the world.

751
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:43,394
In the spirit of Robin Harris and Carl
Fishman's rebus model, which I'm

752
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,498
currently discussing in the context
of a broader framework that I call Alvis.

753
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,502
But yeah, that help it all are.

754
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,205
Like an alias. Like, yeah.

755
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:58,342
It also it reminded me of what you said
about the different levels

756
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,645
and their interdependence
and mutual constraints.

757
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,781
So it's like a sound is heard
and potentially

758
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,450
in one state of consciousness
or mind your brain,

759
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,720
it's 98% likely to be one thing

760
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,057
and option B and C are 1% likelihood.

761
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,161
And so just goes forward with
as if option A like as if I'm in control.

762
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:22,233
But then some things might happen
where like that

763
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:27,405
1% chance that it is an alien
gets accepted and sort of passed forward.

764
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,409
And then that might lead
to the experience

765
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,679
through the generative
model of something that like

766
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,349
was a distribution.

767
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,350
Also, it's like a change

768
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,020
in quantitative distributions
that leads to a qualitative change

769
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,891
and increasingly higher and categorical
and semantic experiential

770
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:47,858
layers

771
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,131
beautifully. So

772
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,202
and it.

773
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,571
Would depend on your cultural priors.

774
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:04,442
So and whether we would call this
like a relaxed belief or a strength

775
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,243
in belief, I'm not sure.

776
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:11,182
But. You know, for instance,
you might not be singing like if you.

777
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,583
Were an.

778
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,720
Indigenous people of South America,
for instance,

779
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,123
in know they might not see an alien.

780
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,660
It might be related to something
having to do with their spirituality

781
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,863
and their whatever available myths
you have.

782
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:27,832
Would.

783
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,968
Then go into basically this

784
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,237
interpretation, your best guess.

785
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,071
Which.

786
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,440
Is always wrong, sometimes useful,

787
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:40,044
but your best guess of what's going on
will be different depending on

788
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:42,780
what they would call the

789
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,915
to set in the setting but also where

790
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,819
the setting is the broader cultural

791
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,155
the and setting are also broader
to the culture.

792
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,358
Not everyone will be.

793
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,061
Not ever will come
to the inference of aliens probably.

794
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:02,032
And actually that's that's been shown
that hallucinations

795
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,368
are culturally specific

796
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:06,937
yeah.

797
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:12,610
With which kinds of extraterrestrial
morphologies are seen in relationship

798
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,214
to which are prevalent in the media
and the stories of a given region.

799
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,551
I don't know all the details
but one can imagine.

800
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,789
Not everyone
I mean, like you could like say like.

801
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,391
A maybe there.

802
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,728
Is something about like gray aliens
which is like a little more archetypal.

803
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,830
I don't if I'd say this, but like.

804
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,567
If. You like the Eigen Dimension,
so like morphological variation

805
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,802
what's relevant to us?

806
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:41,806
Like, you're just like exaggerating
many of the dimensions

807
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,142
that would be relevant for us, engaging
in intersubjective modeling.

808
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,744
Or. Modeling of ourselves.

809
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,412
Even for the sake of control.

810
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,282
So like hands
like bigger hands might be important,

811
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,885
whereas like attentional

812
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,522
inference
like where is this person tending to?

813
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,824
Where am I tending to?

814
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,592
So you don't want to know
the heads in the eyes.

815
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,727
That's going to be really crucial.

816
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,263
And that's a far out story. But

817
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,065
you know, there.

818
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,300
Could be aspects.

819
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,402
Of that
that. Aren't just through the medium.

820
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,270
But it's and it's.

821
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,707
Super interesting and yeah,

822
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,243
not, not to go into alien stream mode,

823
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,446
but thinking about a large headed

824
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,583
archetype with very large

825
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,487
dark eyes and the long fingers
like you're kind of hinting at,

826
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,656
it's like it's all pupil,

827
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,927
it's all cortex it's
it doesn't have the strength,

828
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,830
but it has a lot of nimbleness
with its hands and with its body.

829
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:44,969
And so like that's like one archetype
of, of cognitive action

830
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:46,971
I don't know.

831
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,339
And then what?

832
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,474
Maybe there's a blob and a shadow.

833
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,611
There's like these different archetypes,
different little characters

834
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:57,181
in this comic book of cognition.

835
00:41:59,617 --> 00:41:59,950
Not that.

836
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:04,188
Different from a child's affordances
soon like, they're not

837
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,358
they're not capable of, like,
moving things around much, but it's like

838
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:12,863
their intentional actions are mostly like
hand-eye coordination. Of.

839
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,532
Like, that's their purchase on the world.

840
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,933
That's their grip.

841
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:19,770
For all that's.

842
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,474
So this is the current like, OK,
this is how might psychedelics

843
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,345
inform our understanding
of the micro mechanics of agency

844
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,482
and how might the micro mechanics
of agency

845
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,484
inform our understanding
of what psychedelics do?

846
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,953
And that's currently one of the things
I'm focusing on and.

847
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,955
About to.

848
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:42,159
Do some experiments on at the Center for
Psychedelic and Consciousness Science.

849
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:42,793
I'm working. Out

850
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,063
at Hopkins, but the

851
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:47,431
fundamentally.

852
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:51,769
Upstream of this,
the idea is that these studies

853
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:55,773
which purportedly show
that there is no free will,

854
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,311
they show no such thing, it's
very ambiguous what they're showing.

855
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:04,782
And I believe if you do an active
inferential handling of them,

856
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,519
you'll actually see that there are
several ways in which consciousness

857
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,022
is contributing to causal streams
leading to action,

858
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,293
which would be having some of
the varieties of free will worth having.

859
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:20,731
You know,
is it arbitrary degrees of free will? No.

860
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,534
There's some varieties of free
will worth having that we don't have.

861
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,803
Like, can you just like fly
all of a sudden?

862
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,771
They'll be nice, will be worthwhile.

863
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,106
We can't do that either.

864
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:29,940
But if.

865
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,877
You want your beliefs and desires
to be able to

866
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,981
meaningfully side
to be be able to be said to be.

867
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:39,416
Meaningful.

868
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,786
Efficient core screenings, maybe even
maximally efficient course screenings.

869
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,256
Of. What is happening,
I think we do have that.

870
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,692
And I think you can find this even within

871
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,229
these Lubet paradigms. Of.

872
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,764
If you didn't

873
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,100
I think you still have many
of the varieties of free

874
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,003
will worth having because many people
have criticized saying like,

875
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,772
oh, just moving your hand
without a reason.

876
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,274
That's not really agency
that's not what we want from free will.

877
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,310
We want like meaningful decisions

878
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:08,812
sure.

879
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,916
But I think even though even though
for these even for these studies.

880
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,953
Which people often will.

881
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,055
Trot out and saying, look,

882
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:22,259
my brain made me do it, even then,
I don't think it follows.

883
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,627
That.

884
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,430
They show that we

885
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,067
that our consciousness is ever phenomenal
through and through.

886
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:35,372
And I think active instance basically
shows some of the particular ways

887
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:39,710
that consciousness is indeed causal
even in these circumstances.

888
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,246
And I think that's a very big deal.

889
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,915
I don't know how
well it's surviving the replication

890
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,518
crisis, but,
you know, there's plenty of studies.

891
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:48,752
Showing that.

892
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,423
Some undesirable consequences of people

893
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:56,026
not believing in their own free
will or their own agency

894
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,829
whether or not that works,
that I think there is a kind. Of.

895
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:04,968
This face value kind of this and that
like kind of like Dumbo's magic feather.

896
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,237
It's like this elephant.

897
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:07,471
That.

898
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,307
I'm taking this from Dan Dennett
from his book Freedom of Owls.

899
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,410
But this.

900
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:17,247
Has a feather that the crows told them
will help him fly

901
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:20,784
and get his big ears
and using the fly when he had the feather

902
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,020
boas because he believes.

903
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,188
Whether or not.

904
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:27,858
Believing in free
will gives you free will, not believing

905
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:31,195
you're a meaningful cause,
that becomes true just by believing. It.

906
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,231
So, you know,

907
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,734
I think it's it's quite dangerous

908
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,803
to take basically

909
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,139
something
where we have something precious,

910
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,109
something that basically will empower us
to pursue our values

911
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:49,446
and to say based on the seven studies

912
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,915
and using the authority of science,
telling people.

913
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:52,783
That.

914
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,853
They are not meaningful causes,
I think that's extremely pernicious.

915
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:57,855
And I

916
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:01,125
think act of inference can
there's already great work being done,

917
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,528
like within like neuro philosophy of free
will pushing back against this.

918
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:07,364
And I think active inference can help
showing people

919
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,167
what are the meaningful
degrees of freedom that they have

920
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,704
and how can they be preserved
and expanded.

921
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,708
While very interesting,

922
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,244
do you have any more slides
to go through or

923
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,747
may I ask some questions?

924
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:27,151
No more slides

925
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:28,519
about it.

926
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,388
OK, so

927
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,091
those who are watching live,
please feel free to ask a question.

928
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,795
Otherwise,
I want to pick up near the beginning

929
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,865
when you spoke about finding oneself
in a stream of action.

930
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,571
So what is happening when we find
ourselves in a stream of action

931
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:53,310
and I want to hear what you have to say
and then take this to some questions

932
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,281
about memory and free will,
but when we are suddenly aware,

933
00:46:57,714 --> 00:47:01,118
like, well, I'm on a run, I mean,
I guess I did make prior decisions

934
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,521
about deciding and so on, but like,
whoa, now my leg is moving forward.

935
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,728
So the

936
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,766
I imagine is this varies
a good amount like as a.

937
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,101
And in.

938
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,438
Per an intra individual
difference variable.

939
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:22,906
So like both between

940
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,709
and within people, you're going at a
good amount of variance on this I think.

941
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,278
But the way Heidegger described.

942
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,614
It in terms. Of this difference between.

943
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,184
Describing like hammering and you know.

944
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:39,056
When you're a skilled craftsperson, it's
the hammer is in your hand

945
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,826
and it is ready at hand and you're
you could, your mind could be elsewhere

946
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:46,697
or people might have the phenomenology
of this like on a run or on a drive.

947
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,132
You might just find yourself home.

948
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,101
You can listen to an audiobook
you'll barely know.

949
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,771
You're just you have this effortless
mastery of the task set,

950
00:47:55,305 --> 00:48:00,544
and it's only when something goes wrong
that things are brought into awareness.

951
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:02,880
And so the

952
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:04,848
own only.

953
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,151
And so then you get this motion between
so here's the hammer just in your hand

954
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,954
ready at hand to present to hand.

955
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,723
And now it's in the foreground.

956
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,126
It was initially in the unconscious
or semi-conscious background.

957
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,463
And so like if someone's running
like for instance, they could largely be

958
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:22,833
in a similar state of effortless mastery,
especially because you just

959
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:27,271
natural pendulums motion gets you
like a lot of the control that combined

960
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:31,909
with some spinal pattern generators,
you know, it's a little other tweaks.

961
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:35,979
It's like you barely need to do anything
once you once you've been trained up.

962
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,283
But let's say you're trail running

963
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:43,487
and or let's say you run
and then you step on something

964
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:47,357
the idea would be
that this violation of your expectations

965
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,494
would cause basically prediction error

966
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:54,431
and that this prediction error,
the thing was different.

967
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,501
So OK, so within predictive
process and part of what is.

968
00:48:58,735 --> 00:48:58,936
Like.

969
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,372
Here in phenomenology
where things just become unconscious.

970
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,476
And. You only become conscious
when you're something's wrong,

971
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:10,013
you might well being careful
not to conflate levels of analysis,

972
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,749
you could get a good amount of this
just from

973
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,452
predictive processing
with a dual tier architecture.

974
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:20,691
Like if basically you're really well
trained up,

975
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,961
you can explain things
or you can basically handle things

976
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:28,865
just with these efficient unconscious
couplings, unconscious inference,

977
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:32,703
as in a bunch of reflex arcs
being skillfully deployed,

978
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:36,106
doing most of the things you need to do,

979
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,708
whether you want to call this modeling

980
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,912
or not, as a matter of choice,
I would call it modeling, but

981
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,983
you wouldn't need to become aware of it
unless something was wrong.

982
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,152
And so then the idea is this lower
down, it's not handle.

983
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:49,920
You don't predict

984
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,923
if you don't explain away
the prediction error it makes its way.

985
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,093
Deeper into the brain, into the

986
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,463
it becomes more broadly.

987
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,832
The deeper point is, of course, it's

988
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,336
more lucid.

989
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,637
Modeling and conscious.

990
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:08,672
Modeling

991
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,540
of the.

992
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,942
Processing.

993
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:13,910
Tools.

994
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:20,450
Which will be greater, more capable
of accessing these richly connected sub

995
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:24,321
networks, which could support basically
this larger scale

996
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:27,891
integrative simulation, some aspect of
which would be your experience.

997
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,628
I don't know if that got it wrong at all,
but yeah.

998
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:32,662
Awesome.

999
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:37,634
So we're we're driving back towards
freewill because I really liked

1000
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:40,704
how you approached it
in, in this conversation.

1001
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:44,608
So I want to think about three concepts
memory,

1002
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,210
freewill and experience.

1003
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,748
What are their Venn diagrams like?

1004
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:56,820
Can we of things that we remember, did
we have free will for them

1005
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,190
or not more or less than expected
for things that we experience?

1006
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,892
Do we remember them more or not?

1007
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:02,726
Could there be something

1008
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,563
that you didn't experience
but you remember and had a free will on

1009
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:11,301
and so on, like how our memory free will,
an experience bound together

1010
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,640
oh. I mean, that's a fantastic question.

1011
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,241
I don't.

1012
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,777
So what's coming to mind?

1013
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,779
That's that,
that's a whole other conversation no.

1014
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,281
What was coming
line for me at the moment.

1015
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:28,819
As that.

1016
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,256
There's a partial definitional

1017
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,926
aspect of a connection between

1018
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,896
free will and experience in that
what people

1019
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,933
so people want different things
I wouldn't call free will.

1020
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,067
One thing

1021
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,770
in fact, I actually think there's
a certain wisdom and just like

1022
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:51,441
the language of it, like people want both
like the willing they want the agency

1023
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,744
and they want the degrees of freedom in
terms of they want to be able to pivot.

1024
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:58,148
They want to be able. To.

1025
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,418
Have what they do
be a function of their past

1026
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:04,287
and being constrained by their memories
and their meanings from the past.

1027
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:08,725
But they also want to be able to break
free, whether in the face of something

1028
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:12,095
new or just encountering
something new or to explore.

1029
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:13,497
And so

1030
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:17,400
having that the freedom for exploration

1031
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,670
is all going to be a part of agency,
both within a context and across time.

1032
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,874
But the memory is going to be important
because without the memory,

1033
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,210
that's the constraint based on values,

1034
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,246
based on you.

1035
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:33,083
You. Know, there's many
aspects of the self, for instance,

1036
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,453
some of some of the most essential ones
and maybe some of the

1037
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:41,258
the gold standards of free will,
some Frankfurt mesh theory affairs.

1038
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,794
But it's like this interface of like
you both want things and you want that.

1039
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,297
You want them
where the wanting that you want

1040
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,500
is based on this integrative
and like narrative type self.

1041
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:54,137
And so there would be a way
in which memory with very strongly

1042
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:55,872
we're free will would be a function

1043
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:59,176
both of experience that you want
your experience, your consciousness

1044
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,245
and your experience to be part
of the causal stream leading to action,

1045
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,382
part of your valuing
your affective inference.

1046
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:08,718
You want that to be influencing
both across time and in the moment

1047
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:09,886
and so

1048
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,322
the experience would be essential
like that.

1049
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,492
It's not clear
the many identities argued like that.

1050
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:16,526
The free.

1051
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,529
Will and consciousness
must always be handled together.

1052
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:22,165
But without memory.

1053
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,101
You also, though it's not you either.

1054
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,138
I think there's an interesting thing
though, in terms of like you're you're

1055
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,074
alluding to like basically connections
between causation and memory.

1056
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:34,744
And I believe we are better capable
of remembering things

1057
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,682
when we can take them up into a causal
unfolding

1058
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:42,352
this gives this basically affords
a representation with a more

1059
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:47,524
of a sparse structure of, of salience
of this led to this, led to this.

1060
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,560
And then you hold that causal graph

1061
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,763
in your mind and as basically the core
of your generative model.

1062
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,633
And it seems to be like a highly
efficient way of remembering things.

1063
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,902
It's come up
with a causal account of them

1064
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,405
and so if something is a product
of your agency in a way that's

1065
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:06,910
that is automatically structuring things
in this causal fashion.

1066
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,914
And so there should be a connection
between having agency and free

1067
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,550
will in a circumstance
and being better able to remember things.

1068
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:17,387
I don't know if that's the case,
but it seems like something

1069
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,490
from education theory suggests
like with respect to act of learning.

1070
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:24,227
But I can see that
going a lot of different ways. But

1071
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:26,696
and so that that's a deep question.

1072
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,164
And those that's, that's
what came to mind.

1073
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,166
But like what do you think?

1074
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,571
Wow. Well,
the last piece you brought up about the

1075
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:38,041
the Spa City kind of the sharpness

1076
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,611
on the spa city of the causal story

1077
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,281
and then things that have a sharp

1078
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:48,151
and a sparse causal architecture

1079
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:52,255
as experienced with our very limited
working memory.

1080
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:55,692
They're like predigested
and therefore very apt

1081
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,795
to be able to

1082
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,964
leave certain kinds of traces.

1083
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,800
And then maybe something
could leave a trace that didn't have

1084
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,771
a perceived sparse
causal architecture in the moment.

1085
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:11,207
But that might be like
an example of a memory that's hard

1086
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,277
to recall or that might be like

1087
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:19,416
cleaned up in post-production
and may be very susceptible

1088
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:23,219
to being influenced
because, like, subsequent updates could

1089
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:24,587
try to

1090
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:29,492
draw attention
to part of that uncertainty and like

1091
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:33,229
if there was just a loose memory
of many things happening at a scene,

1092
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,333
asking even a question about part of it

1093
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,736
could start to sharpen that aspect.

1094
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:43,406
And so it's

1095
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,008
it's an interesting question.

1096
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,444
And also kind of like the questions like

1097
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:50,580
what if you had some sort of suffering
but you didn't remember it

1098
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,583
or in between moments
or when you were sleeping,

1099
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,720
you were having some sort
of negative experience

1100
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,357
so just

1101
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:04,394
I mean, what is happening
with the mind in the brain?

1102
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:07,897
The the brain seems to be continuous.

1103
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,969
But then we have these more flashes
and discrete ness

1104
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,473
and shifting of mental attention.

1105
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,412
But they just.

1106
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:23,580
Weren't good.

1107
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,581
I just like.

1108
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,350
The way you're describing. This. Some of

1109
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,954
I feel like it's like you
feel like a really good case in point of

1110
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:34,424
like the answer to do or don't we have
free will should always be.

1111
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:35,792
What do you mean?

1112
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,862
And the answer is always. Like like.

1113
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,064
Like you're like the way like
you're saying these different processes

1114
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,800
can either go together
synergistically or come apart.

1115
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,571
It's like how many meaningful
degrees of freedom do we have

1116
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,940
and what circumstances or
and what senses do we have?

1117
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,175
How much of which of the

1118
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,578
varieties of free will
that we want in different circumstances

1119
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,248
so it's like the answer is
there, isn't there free will?

1120
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:03,086
It seems like like much more interesting
is getting into the details

1121
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,688
and useful is like
getting into the details

1122
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,891
you're talking about right now
with like the different ways

1123
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:12,562
that memory and experience and choice
can all go together

1124
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:16,866
or not,
both within and across time like that's.

1125
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:18,802
And then that.

1126
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,069
Answer is like,

1127
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,439
I guess you could say that's like
that's the real problem of free will.

1128
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,574
And then that that

1129
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:27,143
interesting.

1130
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:27,444
Yeah.

1131
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,513
Like when the experiment of pushing
the button is presented

1132
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:34,050
as being about the exertion of decision
making in the moment,

1133
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:41,691
rather than the memory
or the recalling of something

1134
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:45,161
that might have been different
in the moments,

1135
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,698
those are quite different settings

1136
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:51,167
and it could be
a total different neurophysiology.

1137
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,838
So and also what you said about how

1138
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:58,441
this sort of tension
between having a connection to the past

1139
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:01,911
and the constraints that it provides,
but also the ability to choose,

1140
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:06,182
and I guess that's what's explored
in these varieties papers.

1141
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:10,053
So I wanted to not just ask
like what are the varieties,

1142
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:13,456
but just specifically asking
about the similarities

1143
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:16,159
and differences with bodily action.

1144
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,863
What are the varieties of free will
we might have with respect to bodily

1145
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:24,701
action, like the so-called voluntary
and involuntary bodily processes

1146
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:29,038
and then mental action
where in active inference

1147
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:33,176
we can model regimes of attention
and metacognition

1148
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:37,680
and thought as like action
policies on mental states.

1149
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:42,151
So what kinds of free will
are out there for the body?

1150
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,721
And what

1151
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:47,056
does that say about what might be

1152
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,727
a cognitive degree of freedom or not?

1153
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:54,564
Like,
you know, just choosing what we want.

1154
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:09,345
So in terms of like body.

1155
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,780
Actions

1156
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,084
if we're dealing with something
highly rehearsed.

1157
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,287
Then it.

1158
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,488
Seems like

1159
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,324
that could be an example.

1160
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:24,160
Or or something where it's like

1161
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:31,134
I think the nail on the bottle.

1162
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:35,038
That the predictive processing
hammers strike and the loop is closed

1163
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,807
before it ever even enters the. Brain.

1164
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,010
It's in the, the.

1165
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:44,247
The CNS and the reflex arc
but doesn't even make it up top.

1166
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,982
Where your body. Moves.

1167
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,451
That's just after the fact
that you're aware of it.

1168
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,687
But then if you're doing something like.

1169
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:53,423
And so.

1170
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,157
Then like at this other

1171
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,961
extreme of abstraction,
you might have something like planning.

1172
00:59:59,162 --> 00:59:59,662
Reaching a.

1173
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:02,665
Distal
goal where there's many steps involve

1174
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,668
and you need to come to
some sort of sequence of the steps.

1175
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:09,572
And along the way, I know
it's a bit extreme, but they'll be.

1176
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:11,341
Like.

1177
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,076
There's certain things
that have to happen somewhere.

1178
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,112
So like at the extreme of abstraction,
it might be something like

1179
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,282
going to grad school
or something like that or, you know.

1180
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:23,553
To getting a new job to how it's.

1181
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,690
Like that is
so there's a lot of things that happen

1182
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:28,891
have happened before, other things

1183
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:32,328
and a lot of dependencies
and a lot of multiple relies ability

1184
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,497
there's always multiple route
realize ability.

1185
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,500
Like I go to reach for this glass
I could have reached for like this.

1186
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,602
I could have done a weird thing
and gone. Like this.

1187
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,705
Or like,
you know, I could have pinky out Pinky

1188
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,841
and, you know, prefer Pinky out.

1189
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,043
But like there's all sorts of things

1190
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,745
that could have done
there is mostly realizable,

1191
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,014
but the multiple realize ability
of something like,

1192
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:53,883
you know, going to college
going to grad school, that's even more

1193
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:55,952
so like the number of ways
you can go into it.

1194
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,255
And then I guess I'm thinking
like in this middle regime of something

1195
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:02,025
that's still like very clearly metric

1196
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:06,362
but would be novel and like fine grained
motor control, like I'm learning

1197
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:09,165
for the first time,
like I'm doing a tea ceremony.

1198
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,101
Or I'm learning of.

1199
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:15,405
Calligraphy or I'm just learning to knit
or something like.

1200
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:16,839
There.

1201
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,842
It's the. Fine grained. Things are now.

1202
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:24,714
Being monitored as present at hand.

1203
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:29,352
And you actually need to use
your sophisticated inference machinery

1204
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:32,588
to help scaffold this.

1205
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,023
Basically,

1206
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,793
the acquisition. Of.

1207
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:40,596
Skilled motor abilities of skill,
the capacity

1208
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:45,001
for skill, motor performance,
but I would also, I think, suggest that.

1209
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,338
The. Whole way through, it's always built

1210
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:54,510
experience, one when once it's being
co-opted or controlled and in its control

1211
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:59,015
ability is always modal
in a mature fashion.

1212
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,286
So one of the claims
I make in this paper.

1213
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:06,823
It turns out

1214
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:07,890
that it's called.

1215
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,193
Pre motor theory,
but that basically like.

1216
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:11,527
Through.

1217
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:15,765
Partial expression of a motor command
or a motor prediction,

1218
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:17,200
the utterance

1219
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,604
copy from that the associated sensations
can be used as a means of top down

1220
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:25,641
intentional selection could be used
as a means of attending to memory.

1221
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:29,912
In terms of working
memory, basically you can use these

1222
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,615
partially expressed

1223
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:35,418
motor predictions,
not enough to actually cross threshold,

1224
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:39,689
but use them to basically
as a source of control over dynamics.

1225
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:41,324
Of where.

1226
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:44,494
Your awareness is going and
what's going in or out of your awareness.

1227
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,697
And the claim I make
is actually that this is an exhaustive

1228
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:50,867
like this is the only like lever
you have is basically whatever

1229
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:53,469
is built off of a control hierarchy,
off of skeletal muscle.

1230
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,538
It's a claim.

1231
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:58,741
But the idea would be like even a table,

1232
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:01,811
something as abstract as,

1233
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,080
you know, going to college
or grad school,

1234
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,351
there's still going to be
some has to cash out a certain.

1235
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,320
Amount of modal.

1236
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,990
You're seeing yourself
in the different contexts,

1237
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:17,059
even for the abstracts,
like the mouth, like justice,

1238
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:21,731
you still to experience
it, it's still going to have

1239
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:26,102
some sort of thing that you know,
your hand shares justices scales.

1240
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,238
Here's
the courtroom, here's seeing this memory

1241
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,974
from your past where there is an officer
justice was served.

1242
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:36,379
Here is you feeling this like uneasiness
or this like righteousness.

1243
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:40,149
So and so the idea I.

1244
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,150
Would claim is that like

1245
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,654
any kind of control on any level
will always cow shout metrically.

1246
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,857
But there are meaningful differences
in terms of

1247
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:51,861
whether you're engaging with something
which is involving these immediate

1248
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:56,098
fast feedback loops and might be multiple
realizable but less so. Or.

1249
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,935
Something which. The.

1250
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:01,971
Affordance
structure is more being played out

1251
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:05,641
in terms of your capacity to control
and relate to it in terms of these

1252
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:10,713
even more multiple realizable high level
plans of all the things

1253
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:13,249
situations you might be,
and they'll be related to achieving.

1254
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,218
High level.

1255
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:16,252
Goals or abstract.

1256
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,253
Goals

1257
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,790
I don't know if that makes sense.

1258
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:25,194
11 thought on
that is it's like a jigsaw puzzle.

1259
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:28,731
So there's only one way to assemble it.

1260
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:33,636
And it's kind of like there's
therefore this bundle of trajectories

1261
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:37,440
of different realizations
of how one is going to assemble it

1262
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,742
like there's
sort of what happens on the table,

1263
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,777
all the combinatorics
of the way to assemble it.

1264
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:45,514
And then there's like all of the real
life combinatorics about how many minutes

1265
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:48,584
am I going to spend playing this jigsaw
and then I'm going to go

1266
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:50,186
get up and do other stuff.

1267
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:53,389
And so the multiple
realization of the jigsaw where it does

1268
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,492
all kind of come back to being completed
is one thing.

1269
01:04:56,792 --> 01:05:00,563
And then yeah,
you brought up how when things are even,

1270
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:03,900
the outcomes are unknown
or there's multiple realizations.

1271
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,704
Those are where we start to maybe
think about hierarchical

1272
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:13,442
nesting of models like
we've been discussing in the slam paper

1273
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:16,979
and also the vivid imagining

1274
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,649
of different future states.

1275
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:24,453
What is the regime
of attention that might

1276
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,024
for somebody who wants to be an athlete,

1277
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:34,196
help them make practicing
and being on that path like more natural?

1278
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,867
So what how specific and what modalities
that's kind of what it made me think of.

1279
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:43,306
But I, I kind of want to keep on going on
this mental action route.

1280
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:48,044
Has there been anything like a mental
or a cognitive leap experiment,

1281
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:51,881
like where the instructions would be like
take a couple of breaths

1282
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,582
and just,
you know, get up and walk around

1283
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:55,318
or whatever, just take a couple breaths

1284
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,486
and then identify
the moment on the clock.

1285
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,989
When you chose to think about X

1286
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,263
a pure mental on mental assessment.

1287
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:18,307
So I had the.

1288
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,009
Surface.

1289
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,579
I just before I forget, I actually think
like what you just mentioned,

1290
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:27,483
like the optimal attentional engagement
or something like motor

1291
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:31,153
or something like like a sport
or some performance actually.

1292
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:35,491
And that's like a key example
of like through skilled mental action

1293
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,427
or not through the skill fulness
of your mental actions,

1294
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:41,330
having more or less freedom
where like for instance,

1295
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:43,165
if you're

1296
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,469
choking, for instance, you do it wrong.

1297
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,538
Jun. Tani has a good paper on choking,
an act of inference.

1298
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:52,742
And so if you get that wrong,
they'll be like your free will

1299
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:56,612
being undermined by your mental action.

1300
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,647
Not being well.

1301
01:06:58,647 --> 01:06:59,448
Calibrated in terms

1302
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,451
of where you're positioning
your attentional selection for optimal.

1303
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:03,185
Grip or.

1304
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:06,622
Optimal engagement
with what you're doing.

1305
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,925
The. In terms of this

1306
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,995
purely more purely mental action.

1307
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,398
Lebed And. There's a couple.

1308
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:16,699
There's different.

1309
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,402
Versions of it that have been run.

1310
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,303
Some of. Which I think.

1311
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,706
Would get a little bit.

1312
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,509
More to that.

1313
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,979
And. Kind of what you describe
in terms of

1314
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:34,316
remote mouse has one paper or called them

1315
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:37,920
decisions
like deciding or decisions that matter.

1316
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,590
And so basically
it would be choosing between charities.

1317
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:42,491
And so then you

1318
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:44,827
add in this

1319
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:48,631
charity choice, you actually don't see
this same type of ramping.

1320
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,500
And I think this supports to some degree.

1321
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:53,669
The model.

1322
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:56,972
I'm suggesting and that like
if this ramping is a build up

1323
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,942
of basically activity
and your action oriented body maps

1324
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:04,213
cross coupling
with your intercept of body maps,

1325
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:07,950
I mean, this feeling of urge
and mental stimulation, it makes sense.

1326
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,286
It would have felt something
like pressing a button.

1327
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:12,555
But if it's something like which charity
I'm going to donate to,

1328
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:15,958
you might not get
that same kind of take up in feedback.

1329
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,194
And so I think that's some evidence
in support of that.

1330
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:21,664
But I think the particular thing
you brought up, there's this

1331
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,900
and this is a direction. I'm.

1332
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,036
Looking in beginning to look into.

1333
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:30,873
There's these closely related
wave forms to the readiness potential,

1334
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:35,444
the event related negativity and the.

1335
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:37,379
Spin.

1336
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,984
Stimulus preceding negativity.

1337
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:44,386
And I believe so
some of them would be, for instance.

1338
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,289
Preparing for.

1339
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,658
Information that's coming.

1340
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:50,726
And. Then acting.

1341
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:54,396
I think that would be the earring or
the speech and the stimulus proceedings.

1342
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:55,064
It is

1343
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,167
you're preparing to receive information.

1344
01:08:58,534 --> 01:08:59,401
That's.

1345
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:02,671
Possibly salient,
but there's no action required.

1346
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:06,642
So I think that might be potentially you
could think of all these things, though,

1347
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,980
and actively as having they look

1348
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:15,184
very similar electrophysiological
and I would suggest that they are

1349
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:19,288
all fundamentally similar and that what
they're using, whether we're talking.

1350
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,055
About.

1351
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,026
Patterns of attentional selection
or specifically

1352
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:26,729
orchestrating mental stimulation to.

1353
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:29,932
Act. Or not in terms of an overt action,

1354
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:33,669
then all these cases,
it is grounded in the modalities

1355
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:37,773
and this is basically understood
implementation as recurrent activity

1356
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,643
and different places of control
hierarchy over body maps.

1357
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,445
Or in terms of.

1358
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:47,216
Algorithmically and functionally
an accumulation of model evidence

1359
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:51,020
for shifting your practice of the pose
now before an overt action.

1360
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:56,158
If we're talking mental action,
similar story, but if partially, but. If

1361
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:58,561
you're if.

1362
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:01,030
The model evidence I guess
would be a slightly different model, but.

1363
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,832
It's if.

1364
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,535
What you're imagining is

1365
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,905
your own, you're imagining
your body being in a different state

1366
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:13,242
that would allow you to orient
differently

1367
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:15,644
to bias your sensors differently,
to move your attention

1368
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,780
around differently,
to do different precision weighting.

1369
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:22,952
But you don't imagine it vividly enough
that it will actually drive

1370
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:27,022
your spinal reflex arcs and that
but that this would be

1371
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:31,160
what you would use
even for potential purely mental acts,

1372
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:37,066
it would still be coopting a control
hierarchy off of skeletal muscle.

1373
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:40,502
And the reason I focus on skeletal muscle
is because it's designed

1374
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:46,008
to have basically large gross actions
with low latency and this controllable.

1375
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:50,346
And. The conditions for find
great control are realized

1376
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:55,584
because you can actually direct your
sensors using your effectors

1377
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:59,888
with a large scale meaningful outcome

1378
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:03,559
that can be causally modeled
and tracked and controlled.

1379
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:06,328
And so then the idea is that basically.

1380
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:10,866
So. Vygotsky first expressed an idea
like this, I think with respect,

1381
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:14,737
he thought as inner speech,
where first you learn how to speak

1382
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,740
and then through partially expressing
your speech,

1383
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:22,077
you learn how to co-opt this process
for a stream of thought

1384
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:23,979
as inner speech.

1385
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:26,915
And then whether you want to say that
that exhaust thinking is another thing,

1386
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:30,219
but inner speech would be part
of a significant part of thinking.

1387
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:34,923
But so the idea is
this is all intentional mental

1388
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:38,460
operations, whether we're talking
about shifting around

1389
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:42,665
basically the the fine green
adjustments of an overt skilled motor act

1390
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:46,201
or guiding your mental action
with respect to attention

1391
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:49,905
and mental imagery
and imaginings that in each case.

1392
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,741
You have the.

1393
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:57,246
Initial affordances structure,
the initial control levers

1394
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:03,085
established via these overt we express
behaviors and couplings of world,

1395
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:07,456
which then later, by partially expressing
them, gives you something

1396
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:12,161
you can repurpose for things
like imaginative planning.

1397
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:15,564
Or. Covert attention,

1398
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:19,168
or I would argue, any intentionally
influence mental process,

1399
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,938
maybe ultimately

1400
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,107
have its origins in this co-opting.

1401
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:29,611
Of motor control hmm.

1402
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,014
All claim.

1403
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:39,188
OK, so what could be systems?

1404
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,389
Yes, go ahead.

1405
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:42,958
I just it could be wrong.

1406
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:46,862
Not financial advice,
not not extraterrestrial advice,

1407
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,332
hardly even active advice.

1408
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,534
It's very interesting.

1409
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:55,304
What systems

1410
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,375
rise to this capacity

1411
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,411
and does their embodiments matter?

1412
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,849
So like there are insects
with tremendously reduced

1413
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:09,385
central nervous systems.

1414
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:14,623
One could imagine a computational system
that can engage in counterfactuals,

1415
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:17,926
but it's only affordance
or embodiment is like one,

1416
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,397
you know, Morse code
receiver or something like that.

1417
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:24,199
So what systems

1418
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:27,903
have this capacity and why.

1419
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:33,876
So I.

1420
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,513
Definitely don't know the boundaries,
but if I were to shoot

1421
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:41,850
from the hip on this, the idea would be
the handling would still be of this

1422
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:46,121
computational neuro phenomenology
or marrying the phenomenology.

1423
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:50,526
But instead of drawing brains, we would
drive a different nervous system.

1424
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,495
Or whatever the.

1425
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:56,732
Signaling information
processing system is.

1426
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,101
We would still give it
this kind of handling

1427
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,738
where there would be a mechanism,
there would be a function,

1428
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:07,242
there would be some intermediate
algorithmic mapping across these levels.

1429
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,312
And then you connect this
to phenomenology.

1430
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:14,650
And so if in this phenomenology
you're having basically gold states

1431
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,253
being represented and these and the
representation of these Gulf states.

1432
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,590
Is part is.

1433
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:24,226
At that level,
you're also able to get an account

1434
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:27,896
of the guidance of action selection
to bring them about

1435
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:31,133
then you could say that
you have degrees of freedom.

1436
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:32,401
In that way.

1437
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:35,337
So if we're talking about something
like an insects, the.

1438
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,307
You. Actually
send me a really interesting paper

1439
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,976
recently about dual systems
thinking broadly construed

1440
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:44,112
including for insects.

1441
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,248
Where and this.

1442
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,119
It seems like you would need

1443
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:54,590
at least a

1444
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:56,024
a two tier

1445
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:58,427
hierarchy where this upper level.

1446
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:00,963
Can break.

1447
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:05,734
Free of immediate engagements
with this consortium and where.

1448
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,804
This lower level would allow.

1449
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:14,510
For your couplings with the world
and the orchestration of overt action

1450
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:18,814
selection in terms of actually
like sensory motor coupling to the world

1451
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:23,352
and then a process which can basically

1452
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,954
on top of that hierarchically higher.

1453
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,122
That could.

1454
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:30,392
Infer these transitions,
but without them being expressed.

1455
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:35,364
And if you have that, then you could do
the types of counterfactual processing

1456
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:38,400
that you would need for planning
and constructing causal models.

1457
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,571
It seems possible
that insects might be able to do this

1458
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,674
in terms of, for instance,
like in the paper you sent recently.

1459
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:50,012
Like these like do this.

1460
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:52,881
So the central complex

1461
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,551
has a lot of these properties
of the hippocampal system.

1462
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,620
It's kind of like a hushpuppies,
the hippocampal system

1463
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,423
and the thalamus

1464
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:03,692
at the same time.

1465
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,262
But and it's giving
you like the salience. Map

1466
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,432
used. For both orienting and.

1467
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:11,934
Moving but then.

1468
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:14,736
You also get these mushroom bodies,
which are like the stratum,

1469
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,306
which would be basically helping
with that moment to moment

1470
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:20,642
action selection,
biasing it in a value driven direction.

1471
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:24,446
And so in this paper,
you're getting like this. Some

1472
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:27,282
dual.

1473
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:31,653
Dual systems for control, one
which seems to be more immediate

1474
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:35,524
and reactive, and the other
seems to be governed by slower processes

1475
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:38,327
and so it's possible
that something like this

1476
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,229
so so that it's possible
that this could give you

1477
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,832
the ability to do.

1478
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,001
Sweeps of.

1479
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:50,672
Possibilities of counterfactual inference
where you basically take

1480
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:53,041
the beginning
of expressing the motor command.

1481
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,612
And so the insects thinking
I'm going to locomote in that direction.

1482
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,248
I don't know the evidence
well enough to know if this is the case.

1483
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:03,452
But it could be and then

1484
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:04,920
so so.

1485
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,756
For a robot like a rodent,
you'll see these sweeps

1486
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:11,426
in the hippocampus of like there's a maze
and you'll see like.

1487
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,562
Predictors of whether most schools.

1488
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:14,630
Left or right

1489
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,366
you'll see these place fields
representing different points in space.

1490
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:21,136
And then in anticipation of this, you'll
see these sweeps ahead of activity.

1491
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,773
And then where the sweep is most robust,
that will be the branch that

1492
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:26,508
the animal will go down, will go down.

1493
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:30,912
That's the places in theory, you could do
a similar thing by other means,

1494
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,516
maybe with some homology,
even in the insect nervous system,

1495
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:39,154
maybe you can even do it in an ant colony
if you're getting into a trap

1496
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:42,691
where capable of aggregating across
all these different

1497
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:46,962
finer grained couplings
and engaging in control.

1498
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,731
But so basically, whatever has.

1499
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:51,266
Already.

1500
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,269
I can't say I'm not going to say
sufficient.

1501
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:58,173
The claim I'll make for necessity
would be some sort of

1502
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,576
dual tier architecture
where the lower level

1503
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:04,780
gives you the problems with the world
and the upper level.

1504
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:06,848
Gives you.

1505
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:10,952
Counterfactual,
affordance and integration.

1506
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:14,089
Across.

1507
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,491
These lower level, potentially segregated

1508
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,494
coupling processes.

1509
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,296
Something like that could do it for you.

1510
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:23,865
And so could insects do it now?

1511
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:25,434
Potentially, I don't know.

1512
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:28,136
Could the insect colony do it?

1513
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,072
Maybe the thing.

1514
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:35,610
Where I would place
a potential constraint. Is.

1515
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,247
It seems like we might need
an architecture

1516
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:43,652
to have properties
where it could signal fast enough

1517
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:46,421
where these inferences of quickly enough

1518
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:51,093
that it can stay on top of its evolving
action perception cycles.

1519
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,629
So in terms of its surfing uncertainty,
it's moving into the world as couplings,

1520
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:57,733
the architecture,
whether we're talking about a brain

1521
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:02,671
or some set of signaling across
multiple individuals and like a hive mind

1522
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,241
we want it to be fast enough

1523
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,610
to how the estimates correspond

1524
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,446
to this first graph.

1525
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:15,016
What Benji would call
I think in the control factors of the.

1526
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:17,519
World and

1527
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:18,520
it in.

1528
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:20,822
A. Causal world.

1529
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:24,826
Model where you are an agent within
it seems like you would need to have

1530
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:29,030
the ability to model
independently control the factors.

1531
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:32,634
And so you need to signal
a signaling system that's fast enough

1532
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:34,503
to pull this off.

1533
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,938
And so some sort of small world
network architecture

1534
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:40,375
would be likely required
where you have a combination. Of.

1535
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:45,413
Local modularity but then synergy
through having some central hub.

1536
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:48,383
And so if this could be pulled off
by the hive mind

1537
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:52,754
and if this can orchestrate
the overall swarm to do things quickly

1538
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:56,858
enough to basically have purchase,
have the right grips on the world

1539
01:19:57,192 --> 01:20:01,029
that it can both inform and be informed
by its action perception cycles,

1540
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:04,666
then you could have an agency
architecture,

1541
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,869
which by some dimensions
we might describe in terms of free will.

1542
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,707
That dodge the question.

1543
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:14,876
Of why respond?

1544
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:16,945
What about just the computational one?

1545
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:20,615
What if it was a computational one
and it was it was instantiating

1546
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:24,519
a digital twin,
a limited or comprehensive digital

1547
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,254
twin of itself.

1548
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:28,857
Yeah.

1549
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:32,227
I mean, I personally think. The.

1550
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:37,732
Like like an integral information
theorist would say absolutely not.

1551
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,601
Some people

1552
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,670
within like active inference

1553
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:45,073
communities would say, no,
it has to be physically realized.

1554
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,376
But I think something like a digital twin
or some sort of emulation,

1555
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:50,512
the important thing for me is.

1556
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,546
That the.

1557
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:55,383
There is a set of dependencies. Of.

1558
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:59,921
Effective connectivity
that could be involving virtual processes

1559
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:04,259
and that if you trace out the patterns
of effective connectivity, of.

1560
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,026
Kinds.

1561
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:08,864
Not necessarily physical,
then necessarily like made of matter.

1562
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:10,098
That.

1563
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:10,966
If that is

1564
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:14,769
entailing the modeling of a system
and its relationships with the world

1565
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:19,641
and where within that system world model,
it has this kind of agent like a force

1566
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:21,943
for me that counts.

1567
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:23,612
But a
lot of people would disagree on that.

1568
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:28,383
But for me, I think you're trying to find
the maximally

1569
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,986
explanatory course screening
and sometimes that might be fine

1570
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:35,156
at the level of the virtual machine and
not in terms of the physical realization.

1571
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,392
And then that's
actually the most meaningful cause.

1572
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:40,262
And then if you trace it out there,
that's where you would look for it.

1573
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:43,632
And so that could be in the digital twin
or emulation,

1574
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,234
but a lot of people
would disagree with that. Hmm.

1575
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:50,338
So when you were talking
about applying this to the colony level,

1576
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:53,341
I thought about
like the foraging behavior

1577
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:56,611
that's like reaching out of the ground
and grabbing a seed.

1578
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,881
And so that's like
the enacted foraging trip.

1579
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,852
And then is there a counterfactual

1580
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:07,889
I could be foraging or we could be
foraging at some different scale

1581
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,159
underground
on the other side of the Marcott

1582
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,862
blanket of the nest entrance.

1583
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:19,501
And then what if somebody were going
to be tracking the elevation of a forager

1584
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:23,238
and they'd be like, well,
they go up and down in the nest.

1585
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:26,641
But on the times
where they make that decision to forage,

1586
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:30,345
they always go up
200 milliseconds before foraging.

1587
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:34,983
It's like, Well, yeah,
that's where the nest entrance is.

1588
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:38,486
So without going into whether they have

1589
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:42,857
will or not, it's like it's
some kind of cognitive motor

1590
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:47,329
or integration
when the person hits the button.

1591
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:52,067
So then the way that you frame this
as being like not a trivial artifact,

1592
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:57,038
in fact,
an interesting outcome of aggregation

1593
01:22:57,038 --> 01:23:00,275
of ERPs across trials,

1594
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:02,610
it's like

1595
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:06,514
OK, wouldn't there be

1596
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:09,985
a coherence preamble now?

1597
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:10,652
I guess it doesn't.

1598
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:15,123
If we're here for 30 seconds long,
that would be a different setting.

1599
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:20,595
But then when we connect it
to the specific mechanisms by which

1600
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:24,366
the do have to come together in order

1601
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,569
for there to be a coherent motor action

1602
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,673
it's it's quite an interesting view

1603
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:35,276
and I wonder how those who

1604
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:37,712
have interpreted it

1605
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,982
in a very different way feel.

1606
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:44,786
Have you spoken or asked to anyone
who has a very clear and

1607
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,356
different interpretation

1608
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,226
of what this potential means.

1609
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:53,161
I've been discussing it

1610
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:55,930
some with other or I forget.

1611
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:58,566
I've been discussing some of them.

1612
01:23:58,566 --> 01:23:59,601
Or a good amount with them.

1613
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,636
Are emails and Aaron Sugar.

1614
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,639
Aaron. Sugar has.

1615
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:07,475
A he has multiple.

1616
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:12,013
Views but some of them do disagree
and so one of them

1617
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:15,283
is you in theory because you're averaging
across multiple trials,

1618
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:19,454
there is an interpretation of hardiness
potentials as artifactual

1619
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:21,423
and it's possible that

1620
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:25,393
sometimes you are dealing
with an artifact of measurement.

1621
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,263
And this is an open question.

1622
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:31,299
But he's also, for instance, a

1623
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:35,270
very like he's, he's testing out
like the mental simulation view.

1624
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,838
Also,

1625
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:40,008
another interesting hypothesis
he has is actually some of the evidence

1626
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:45,613
accumulation is actually fast
feedback loops with muscle spindles.

1627
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,483
And actually you're getting basically.

1628
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:52,020
The. Urge actually a lot of it
is actually in the body itself.

1629
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:56,458
But one interesting thing for
I forget is that these.

1630
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,327
Are like build up.

1631
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,062
And then threshold crossing,

1632
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:03,765
I believe this
you'll see across all nervous systems

1633
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,400
where you get action selection.

1634
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,603
And I would wonder
whether this similarly,

1635
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,240
similarly to me saying like, you know,
this isn't just like a brain story.

1636
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:16,911
Might we see
basically something like this

1637
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:19,614
if we're looking at
I think in your activity paper,

1638
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:24,152
you talk about like stigma, coherence,
but through some sort of like

1639
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,187
forgive me if I'm

1640
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:30,291
butchering it for like some sort of
like measure of the kind, you might see

1641
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:34,662
something like generalized action
potentials for large scale changes in

1642
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,733
switching modes of the hive
mind of the colony.

1643
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:44,239
And I'm just speculating actually
also in terms of multi stage hierarchies.

1644
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,541
I'm actually. Wonder.

1645
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,042
Whether the.

1646
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,545
Brains like for instance,
the resting state networks of the brain,

1647
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:53,848
maybe not like there's different
like granularity and stations,

1648
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:56,417
it can be as much as 17 or more
if you wanted.

1649
01:25:56,417 --> 01:26:00,321
But there there's some solutions
that are like maybe, you know, so

1650
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:03,625
seven networks are most well known but
there's also like five network solutions.

1651
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:05,160
And I'm wondering

1652
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:09,063
if they're actually universality classes
for active inferential agents

1653
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:12,800
that you'll actually get something
like Humalog of different rest

1654
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,503
and say networks in their patterns
of effective connectivity

1655
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:19,440
so generalized
resting state networks, generalized

1656
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,411
phenomenon to like things like readiness
potentials.

1657
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:26,080
Are very.

1658
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:28,650
Very. Speculative.

1659
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:31,319
But that's that's I think we might.

1660
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:37,292
A few interesting things

1661
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:42,263
that makes me think of
and are we making cognitive science

1662
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,899
a creation in our own image

1663
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:48,303
if we talk about the generalized
hippocampus and the general.

1664
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,271
And so

1665
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:53,441
to what extent are we or can we must we

1666
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:56,578
generalize from our own action
perception loop

1667
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:02,217
is putting another umbrella

1668
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:06,321
which the human mind is
just a realization of and saying, well,

1669
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:10,158
the cognitive
domain is bigger than the human brain

1670
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:13,995
because it includes the brain body
and the extended niche,

1671
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:18,132
but also includes non-human systems,
like if we want to cognitive science

1672
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:21,336
that includes a thermometer
or something like that, like a thermostat

1673
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,072
is that a

1674
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:27,342
is that a cope?

1675
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:30,878
Because actually that is still

1676
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:34,983
the water that that model swims in
is still human

1677
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:38,553
and cognitive like I don't know.

1678
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:41,522
But these are interesting pieces.

1679
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:42,123
I mean,

1680
01:27:42,523 --> 01:27:46,527
it seems like it seems like surely what
you're describing has to be the case.

1681
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:50,765
And it's like OK.

1682
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:52,867
And that's like a both a good thing

1683
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:56,771
and a bad thing where it's like
we need to be able to draw.

1684
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:57,905
On an.

1685
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:59,941
Analogy with something we understand

1686
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:04,479
like we're always like
where we we're usually making

1687
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,180
sense of things in terms of other things.

1688
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:08,650
And so like our own experience
as a space domain

1689
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:11,219
in order to give us some purchase, like

1690
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,554
can we do it without it?
You could say like

1691
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:15,690
first principles thinking,
but like which first principles?

1692
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:19,661
But then there's like all of the like.

1693
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:20,295
The baggage

1694
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,965
that could come like the distance
with like if you're if it seems like

1695
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:28,670
we can't avoid doing that,
maybe we could, but if we want to

1696
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:31,639
but then like we really need
to be careful to track the dis analogies.

1697
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:36,444
Like if we're saying generalized
hippocampus, like, OK, wait, wait, wait.

1698
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:38,012
What are the gist analogies here?

1699
01:28:38,012 --> 01:28:38,713
What are the proper

1700
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:42,717
unique properties that are present
in the target domain and off the base?

1701
01:28:42,717 --> 01:28:46,020
Tomatoes like the map, that analogical
mapping you're doing or vice versa

1702
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,290
yes. Yeah.

1703
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:52,160
That's from what you're describing.

1704
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:52,994
Yeah.

1705
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,533
Well,
I think you're kind of closing area.

1706
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:01,035
Just one point that I want to pick up on.

1707
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:04,238
I thought it was really powerful
what you said

1708
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,676
about really the social consequences
and the personal consequences of

1709
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:12,413
interpretation of neurosciences.

1710
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:17,251
And in some ways, even science
communication around empirical results,

1711
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:21,823
like the idea that we could opt out
to free will

1712
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,960
and that in a world
where there's limited degrees of freedom,

1713
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:29,964
you might be coerced into thinking
you had free will or not.

1714
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:33,835
But if there's any glimmer of free will,

1715
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:38,773
it can be used to deny
and deceive itself.

1716
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:45,113
So that puts research in this area in

1717
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,449
a different reflexive position

1718
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:51,819
than research on other systems.

1719
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:55,990
So I guess just
how do we move forward here

1720
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:58,159
while drawing on the specifics

1721
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:02,663
and being respectful
of basically the past,

1722
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,832
the present and the future

1723
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:10,471
I mean.

1724
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:13,441
For me, I definitely have a lot of

1725
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:14,609
soul soul in the.

1726
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:15,743
Game and that.

1727
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,379
This is actually
maybe the biggest thing. The

1728
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:21,549
couple of things with this
might have been one of the biggest things

1729
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:26,087
that got me into cognitive
science was a very long extended.

1730
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:27,955
Freak out about.

1731
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:30,057
Free will
when I was younger, where I was just

1732
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,226
I couldn't feel anything to be mean.

1733
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:34,262
I couldn't see how anything
could be meaningful without it.

1734
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:39,567
I don't know if I still believe
that exactly. But

1735
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:43,838
for. Me it was it was very difficult. To.

1736
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:47,442
Not believe that
there were like a sort of all or nothing

1737
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,044
thinking about free will
and then going with the nothing.

1738
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:52,413
Done.

1739
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:55,683
It actually rescued me from that
with Freedom Evolves that has book, but

1740
01:30:56,350 --> 01:31:00,021
there was a long time
where it seriously bothered me

1741
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:03,090
and it had real negative
consequences on my life.

1742
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:06,327
The and I'm.

1743
01:31:06,327 --> 01:31:06,928
Not alone in this.

1744
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:08,830
I've talked to others
and they also feel that way.

1745
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,465
And part of.

1746
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:15,002
The way this is coming up in the present
work with psychedelics actually is

1747
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:18,039
so there's this study with

1748
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:20,608
I'm preparing for with creative
professionals who are suffering from.

1749
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:21,542
Burnout.

1750
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:24,111
And one thing I'm.

1751
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:28,082
Wondering in terms of like people
who have burnt out for multiple reasons,

1752
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:32,053
but to the extent
that this is continuous with

1753
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:35,823
burnout is continuous with. A.

1754
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:37,625
Depression or like feeling

1755
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:41,229
like you don't have agency in context
where you want to have agency

1756
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:45,766
or feeling
like you don't have adequate control. Of.

1757
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:49,337
Something,
where it really matters that you do

1758
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:51,506
that seems like a good recipe
for burnout.

1759
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:55,243
And it seems also like a decent model
for some forms of depression, where

1760
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:59,247
if you view yourself as not being able
to be a cause in the world,

1761
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:02,216
if you're not able to meaningfully work
towards your values,

1762
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,385
that could be very distressing.

1763
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:05,653
Maybe it could also be a state

1764
01:32:05,653 --> 01:32:10,291
of like a quasi Buddhist
sick, like blissful surrender. But,

1765
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:12,960
you know, there's the question.

1766
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,630
Are we flirting with nihilism?
There is a question.

1767
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,765
And the other question is.

1768
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:18,566
You know, is.

1769
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:21,669
It even legitimate, though,
to be an element to this

1770
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,939
on the self and on volition?

1771
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:27,842
And then just to say it's OK,
you're not real.

1772
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:29,911
Your volition isn't real
anyways, don't worry about it.

1773
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:31,946
Was that even a legitimate intellectual
move to begin with?

1774
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:33,614
I would argue it wasn't

1775
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:35,149
so yeah.

1776
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:39,220
I think this is the stakes here
for people's sense of themselves.

1777
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:44,025
I believe they really matter,
and I believe they have both social and.

1778
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:45,192
Clinical.

1779
01:32:45,192 --> 01:32:48,696
And social consequences,
existential consequences for people.

1780
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:54,135
And I'm glad that there's this like
growing community of people in the neuro

1781
01:32:54,135 --> 01:32:57,572
philosophy of free will who have been
doing a really great job pushing

1782
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:01,576
against like some of these, I believe,
excessively inflationary views.

1783
01:33:02,977 --> 01:33:04,412
And I believe

1784
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:08,549
that active inference might be a really
valuable contribution to these efforts

1785
01:33:08,549 --> 01:33:12,720
in terms of providing formal models
and models that can go across this.

1786
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,357
Marianne Neuro Phenomenological SAC
or computational nerve

1787
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:20,461
phenomenological setup
and actually address these phenomena

1788
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:23,598
in enough detail where not only can
we feel like

1789
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:27,435
meaningfully satisfied,
where we understand our own agency,

1790
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:30,538
but we could we could intervene
and hopefully for the better

1791
01:33:32,473 --> 01:33:32,773
yeah.

1792
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:35,142
Just just some last thoughts on that.

1793
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:37,745
That's very powerful.

1794
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:41,182
And the the mutual constraints

1795
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:43,718
and the interdependencies
of the different levels, like

1796
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:46,921
it may come down to someone's

1797
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:49,557
genetic sequence of a receptor or

1798
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:52,593
some kind of

1799
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:56,297
binding affinity with a molecule,
but then it could

1800
01:33:56,297 --> 01:34:00,301
also be integrated
in kind of a full stack way with

1801
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:07,375
talk or action or changes to the niche.

1802
01:34:07,742 --> 01:34:09,410
So it gives like a full stack.

1803
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:12,947
Yes. And way that's not

1804
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:14,281
I think

1805
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:15,549
a dead end.

1806
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:19,186
It's more like a starting state,
like if the computer weren't working

1807
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:21,422
and then there was like the hardware
and there's the software.

1808
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:25,292
But then moving beyond
just that type of analogy,

1809
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,629
which is very

1810
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:32,767
powerful about burnout
and about the different cognitive ways

1811
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:35,703
that we might get there and get into it
and get out of it.

1812
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:40,374
And so it's like stoicism or whatever
plus preferences because

1813
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:44,679
it's not just the neutral stance, it's
not just a descriptive stance on burnout.

1814
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,581
There's like a preference there so Adam,

1815
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:50,251
if you have any other thoughts,
please feel free.

1816
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:54,088
I think it's a.

1817
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:56,057
Quick thought

1818
01:34:59,226 --> 01:35:00,361
is if.

1819
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:03,998
We're looking and this is like
to follow up on the comment or saying

1820
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:09,970
like he's someone who just stick a limit
this framings of agency.

1821
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:12,406
And I said like,
are they even legitimate?

1822
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:14,842
I'm going to argue. No, they're not.

1823
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:18,112
And specifically if we're thinking.

1824
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:20,181
Of something like modeling.

1825
01:35:20,748 --> 01:35:22,883
The self through time

1826
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:25,953
as a high level controller,

1827
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:30,991
if you engage in some sort of practice,
whether it's discipline, meditation

1828
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:32,493
for a long period times,

1829
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:36,464
or you've taken like a very high dose
of psychedelics and you've basically.

1830
01:35:36,764 --> 01:35:39,066
Collapsed the depth of your.

1831
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,569
Temporal depth and counterfactual
reactions to your generative.

1832
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:45,206
Model, you will not find yourself,
you will be gone.

1833
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:45,840
There will be.

1834
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,075
No like you to talk about
and you might call this.

1835
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:49,009
Ego death.

1836
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,746
But then to say that there never was.

1837
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,447
A due process to begin with.

1838
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:55,683
I believe that is actually

1839
01:35:55,683 --> 01:35:59,019
illegitimate
you basically use the search strategy.

1840
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,421
That.

1841
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:03,023
Apriori should not have been able
to find the self.

1842
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:07,128
And then using that search strategy,
you then concluded didn't exist.

1843
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:10,231
And I think that just doesn't work.

1844
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:12,333
So in.

1845
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:13,701
This case.

1846
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:17,605
You know, to quote it again.

1847
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:20,741
Individuals, their narratives,
their persons.

1848
01:36:21,475 --> 01:36:21,942
You know.

1849
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:24,245
Their real patterns. And

1850
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:26,313
but they're.

1851
01:36:26,313 --> 01:36:31,786
Also there's a reflexive ness to where
their own belief and their own reality

1852
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:34,054
is an important part
of their causal significance.

1853
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:37,691
And so,

1854
01:36:38,192 --> 01:36:40,094
you know, I think it.

1855
01:36:40,094 --> 01:36:41,729
Would be good
to have some some nice debates

1856
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:45,032
with like different members of the active
inference community who are more

1857
01:36:45,032 --> 01:36:48,068
deflation
theory on things like cells, self

1858
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:50,671
processes and agency

1859
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:53,374
because ultimately,
I think this is a thing where

1860
01:36:53,374 --> 01:36:56,644
it's going to be like, well, we should be
respectful and disagreements.

1861
01:36:57,978 --> 01:36:58,846
I think it really matters.

1862
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:01,715
We get it right to the extent we can.

1863
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:06,420
Thank you, Adam,
for the excellent presentation.

1864
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:10,257
Apologies for any Internet glitches
that might have happened

1865
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:13,561
we are a strange loop and this has been

1866
01:37:13,727 --> 01:37:15,663
a strange livestream.

1867
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:18,432
Always good talking to.

1868
01:37:18,432 --> 01:37:18,799
You, Daniel.
