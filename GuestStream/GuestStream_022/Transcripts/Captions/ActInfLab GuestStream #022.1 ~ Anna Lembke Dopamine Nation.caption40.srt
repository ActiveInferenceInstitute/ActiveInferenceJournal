1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:00,866
The

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,200
Hello and welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,100
This is active live guest stream

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,566
number 22.1.

5
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:14,966
I'm here with Dr.

6
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:15,900
Anna Lembke

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,933
and we are here to discuss

8
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:20,333
"dopamine and beyond" and

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,500
really looking forward

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,466
to this conversation.

11
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:23,833
And appreciate the time.

12
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:27,600
So to you for any introductory context

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,866
and then really looking forward

14
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,366
to this discussion.

15
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:31,500
Yeah.

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:31,766
Well,

17
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,900
thank you so much for having me, Daniel.

18
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,066
You know, I've

19
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,766
been, you know,

20
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:39,100
interested in you

21
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,600
and your work for many years now.

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,833
And so I'm really excited

23
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,233
to have an excuse to reconnect.

24
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,900
I'm just excited to be here.

25
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,933
And you asked me

26
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,300
to start by introducing myself,

27
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,266
so I'm I'm a professor of psychiatry

28
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:56,500
and behavioral sciences

29
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,666
and also addiction medicine

30
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,966
at Stanford University

31
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:01,600
School of Medicine.

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,866
I'm also author of the book

33
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,833
Dopamine Nation

34
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:05,733
Finding Balance

35
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:06,733
in the Age of Indulgence.

36
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,033
And that's what we were talking about,

37
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,033
which I and Daniel's quoted in there.

38
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,500
I would have actually included

39
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,866
Daniel more in there

40
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,466
if I had if I were smart enough

41
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,733
to actually understand the

42
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:17,966
work that he does.

43
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,766
Thanks.

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,333
We'll get there with the ants

45
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,300
and the dopamine.

46
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,533
But really, just

47
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,566
what is dopamine nation about?

48
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:31,000
And what motivated you to write it?

49
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,300
So Dope Nation is kind

50
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,533
of a blend of neuroscience made simple

51
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,533
combined with practical advice

52
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:45,200
for how to live in a dopamine

53
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,066
overloaded world,

54
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,766
holding up people in recovery

55
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:50,033
from severe addictions

56
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:52,066
as modern day profits

57
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:53,133
for the rest of us.

58
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:55,200
Because all the neuroscience

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,133
in the world, as valuable as it is,

60
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:59,000
can't make up

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,100
for the experience of people

62
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,800
who have gotten into recovery

63
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,233
from addiction,

64
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:05,433
doesn't mean that

65
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:09,300
they should also posits a kind of global

66
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,000
hypothesis, tentatively posits

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,500
the hypothesis

68
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,666
that the growing rates

69
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,766
of anxiety, depression, suicide

70
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:18,000
and other mental health

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,966
disorders across the world

72
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,000
are caused, at least in part,

73
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,900
by the problem of over abundance

74
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,566
and the kind of lack of

75
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,533
appropriate friction in our lives.

76
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,766
In other words, the ways

77
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,033
in which our lives are maybe too easy

78
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,066
and the way that our primitive wiring

79
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,466
is mismatched

80
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:38,233
for this modern

81
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:41,133
ecosystem of overwhelming over abundance

82
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:44,766
OK.

83
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,600
One dopamine question,

84
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,933
and then I think we'll start

85
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,133
to see some areas of overlap

86
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:53,933
with active inference.

87
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:54,933
What could you say

88
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,766
to the role of dopamine

89
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:59,333
in reward and motivation

90
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,633
signaling like in wanting and liking?

91
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,800
And how does dopamine play a role

92
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,066
in behavioral selection?

93
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,433
OK, so dopamine is essential

94
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,400
for the experience

95
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,800
and motivation, reward and pleasure.

96
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,900
It may be even more important

97
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,933
for motivation than it is

98
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,833
for the experience of pleasure.

99
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,266
And I base this

100
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:23,266
on the work of my amazing

101
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,133
neuroscience colleagues

102
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,833
who have done experiments, for example,

103
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,800
where they engineer

104
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,666
a rat's brain to be

105
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,700
made with new receptors and discover

106
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,700
that if they give that rat food,

107
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,966
it will eat the food and seem

108
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,066
to take pleasure in the food.

109
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,866
But if they put the food

110
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:38,966
some distance away,

111
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:40,700
the rat will starve to death,

112
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,433
meaning that the absence of dopamine in

113
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,200
these key reward circuits

114
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,100
make it

115
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,533
such that that animal

116
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,700
is no longer

117
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,733
motivated to do the work that it takes

118
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,666
to get their reward.

119
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,666
And my neuroscience colleagues

120
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,800
like Rob Malanga

121
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,033
have said that for him,

122
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,166
the definition of addiction

123
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,133
is how

124
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,533
hard an animal is willing

125
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:06,033
to work to get their reward,

126
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,133
and that has direct application

127
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,266
to the clinical work that I do.

128
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:11,233
You know,

129
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,200
we all like what we like

130
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,666
and once we experience

131
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,600
the thing that we like,

132
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,733
of course we want to repeat it.

133
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:20,266
But the kind of fundamental

134
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,433
difference between

135
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,533
those who go on to develop addiction

136
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:24,633
and those who don't

137
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,733
is that those who develop addiction

138
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,033
are willing to work

139
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,600
very, very hard

140
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,433
to get their drug of choice

141
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:32,633
and are willing to give up

142
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,800
a lot of other things,

143
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,100
even when that pursuit causes an

144
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:40,266
enormous amount of personal cost.

145
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,233
Thank you for that.

146
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,500
That's really powerful

147
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,200
with professional thinkers

148
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
definition of how hard

149
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,900
they work to get it,

150
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,166
because it's like an action

151
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,000
oriented definition

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,266
that could be measured in

153
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:58,533
or proxy by different things,

154
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,000
especially clinically

155
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,366
as opposed to like in inference

156
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,866
or a purely cognitive

157
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,000
based report, like a survey.

158
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,633
How often do you think about

159
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,100
something like that?

160
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,200
And that's very interesting.

161
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,833
And that's I think

162
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,633
one of the themes that we'll pick up

163
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:15,666
on, which is action.

164
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,700
And for active inference,

165
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,566
it's right there in the title.

166
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,233
It's like

167
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,100
there's always going to be

168
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,600
a minimum of two.

169
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,500
And when we're talking

170
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,900
about behavior and cognition,

171
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,700
they're inseparable whole.

172
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,633
And then that plays out

173
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:28,800
in a lot of different ways,

174
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,633
like partially with the embodiment

175
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:32,600
and the inactive perspectives

176
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,800
that come to view.

177
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,133
But also just like,

178
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:35,533
as you

179
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,466
said, it's pragmatic too,

180
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:39,366
because it's relevant

181
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,366
to always be thinking

182
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:42,666
about action and cognition

183
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,900
as like a dyad in the context

184
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,966
rather than trying to separate them

185
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:49,200
and then find a correlation across.

186
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,666
Love it. Love it.

187
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,833
So I've been a psychiatrist for

188
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,966
going on 30, 25 years

189
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:59,366
and I would say the first half

190
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:03,133
of my training and life experience

191
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:03,900
and education

192
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400
was really focused

193
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,900
on changing people's cognitions.

194
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,666
So focusing on people's

195
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,000
thoughts and emotions

196
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,133
and using language as a tool

197
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,166
to talk about those, to change those.

198
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:18,766
But as my career went on, I became more

199
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:20,266
and more skeptical

200
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,700
of this as a solitary pursuit

201
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,200
and more and more convinced that

202
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
what we need to do

203
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,866
is focus on changing behavior.

204
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,933
And when I'm dealing with patients

205
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:31,800
with addiction,

206
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,766
that is in fact now

207
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,666
my first intervention,

208
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,566
I will say

209
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:38,766
let us first change the behavior.

210
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,833
And in doing that experiment,

211
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,300
and then what I mean is abstain

212
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,100
from your drug of choice,

213
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,933
see what happens, and then let's make

214
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,533
certain inferences

215
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,500
based on what that experience was like.

216
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,066
For you.

217
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,766
And that's really atypical

218
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:54,200
in psychiatry today.

219
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,900
What we do

220
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,766
instead is we talk

221
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:56,266
and we talk

222
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,466
and we talk about

223
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,466
why the behaviors are happening

224
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,900
without really focusing

225
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,700
on changing the behaviors.

226
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,166
And I think we really that

227
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,400
that's not good

228
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,566
because, for example,

229
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,500
my patients will come in,

230
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,166
they'll be addicted,

231
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,066
and they'll say, I'm addicted

232
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:10,200
because I'm depressed.

233
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,000
Or because I have this trauma.

234
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,033
All of that may be true,

235
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,900
but we can't talk about the trauma

236
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,366
till the cows come home.

237
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:19,466
You have to change the behavior

238
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,833
and you have to do it

239
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,766
before you feel like it.

240
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,100
So that's really interesting, too.

241
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,200
Like patients will say, well,

242
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:26,800
you know,

243
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,066
I'm just not

244
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:30,600
I don't I'm not motivated to do

245
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,433
X, Y or Z.

246
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,000
So this is an early where I don't feel

247
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,133
I said, you know what, if you wait

248
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,466
till you feel like doing it,

249
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:38,966
you will never do it.

250
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:39,900
What you need to do

251
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,533
is change the behavior, experience

252
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,700
the impact on your feeling

253
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,433
by changing the behavior

254
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,766
and then take it from there.

255
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:52,200
So I totally agree with you.

256
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,400
It's this intense

257
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,200
narrative of the and emotion

258
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,166
and the actual actions.

259
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,233
And we almost always are focused

260
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:00,200
on, you know,

261
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,066
the cognitions and emotions.

262
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:04,233
And we don't get people to do enough of

263
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,766
just focusing on changing behavior.

264
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:11,833
OK, so I think that's our first theme,

265
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,033
which is this action orientation,

266
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:16,133
and that plays into the embodiment

267
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,400
and the inactive aspects.

268
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,000
But also

269
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
it has a kind of corollary,

270
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,500
this like, OK, first principle,

271
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,500
and that helps us perturb

272
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,100
the causal structure

273
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,033
by just looking at the end equals

274
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:29,500
one observational experiments.

275
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:30,833
Well,

276
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,233
your consumption will be correlated with

277
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,400
the price of oranges.

278
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,033
And then how do you actually get

279
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,733
at something deeper in the world?

280
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,666
And that's sort of a relevant

281
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,533
type of intervention.

282
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:42,366
So action

283
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,200
and also action first is pretty cool.

284
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,033
Any other thoughts on that?

285
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:49,066
Or we can go in a different direction?

286
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,400
Well, I would also say that this brings

287
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
to mind,

288
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,633
you know, you asked about surveys

289
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:55,133
and things like that.

290
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,933
Like I don't really like

291
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,366
just personally like I don't really

292
00:08:59,666 --> 00:08:59,933
I mean,

293
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,666
I think there's value for, for,

294
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,600
for like survey studies.

295
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,400
But the problem is

296
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,933
what you really end up picking up

297
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,666
there is more about what

298
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,500
the dominant cultural narrative

299
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,933
is that explains

300
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,333
why people do X, Y or Z.

301
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,133
And you're not really tapping into

302
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:16,366
why they really do X, Y or Z

303
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,133
the other thing I would say that,

304
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,000
you know,

305
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,000
the way that we think about science

306
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,766
is that

307
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,000
it's not

308
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,033
a single person's life narrative

309
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,433
but I really believe that that

310
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:29,900
that there's science.

311
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,033
When you

312
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,700
see a series of individuals

313
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,500
over and over again,

314
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,300
you hear their stories

315
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,466
and you can recognize

316
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,166
very similar patterns.

317
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,733
And then you do an intervention

318
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,800
and you see the results,

319
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,900
and you do that repeatedly

320
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,266
with many people over time.

321
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,600
It's not like your classic,

322
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,733
you know, a clinical study,

323
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:49,700
but it feels really true and real to me

324
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,166
in a way

325
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,100
that a lot of times

326
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,500
clinical studies don't or can capture

327
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,633
some of the deeply nuanced

328
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,500
complex aspects of human behavior.

329
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,033
Know,

330
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:04,900
I love the way you think about things.

331
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:05,933
So crazy.

332
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,666
I know that now you're like, OK.

333
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,566
I didn't know what was going to

334
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:13,366
come next. So yeah.

335
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:13,900
All right.

336
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,400
So back to the book

337
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,533
and also to connect this to an active

338
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,166
inference theme.

339
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,900
So decision making in active inference,

340
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,333
like policy selection, the PI variable,

341
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,566
the way that different possibilities are

342
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:31,400
ranked is not just by their reward

343
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,166
or their expected like value or utility,

344
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,533
which would be common

345
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,900
in a kind of reinforcement

346
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,266
learning or a reward

347
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:39,700
maximization framework.

348
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
But there's like two components

349
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,933
that go into that policy selection.

350
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:47,533
There's a epistemic knowledge oriented

351
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,400
like learning and curiosity

352
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,933
intrinsic motivation,

353
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,600
and then there's a pragmatic.

354
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,566
So there is a utility element

355
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,600
and the ability to dial in on utility,

356
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,466
but also there's the ability

357
00:10:58,466 --> 00:10:59,566
to kind of pull back.

358
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:01,666
And when you were describing

359
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,333
your book structure,

360
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,833
certainly while reading it

361
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,866
and as you described it,

362
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,033
there was like an epistemic component

363
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
neuroscience made accessible

364
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,933
for those who might not have

365
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,400
the molecular background,

366
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,600
but also like on page 48

367
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,933
with a baseball game, it's

368
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:18,700
just fun

369
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,666
for even those who might have seen it

370
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,466
in a different way.

371
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:24,800
And then there's the pragmatic part

372
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,166
which uses the stories

373
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,866
to kind of connect to useful tips.

374
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,866
So where do you think

375
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,766
epistemic and pragmatic value

376
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,700
come into play

377
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,700
in how you're thinking about this

378
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,800
so.

379
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,633
So epistemic is interesting,

380
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,833
and thank you for showing the examples

381
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,600
related to my book.

382
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,366
Because that helps me also understand

383
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,466
what you mean by those terms.

384
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:53,633
So what I find really interesting

385
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,666
about

386
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,600
how to intrinsically motivate

387
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,066
people with addiction

388
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,333
is that if they have a framework

389
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,100
in which understand their behavior,

390
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
it really does help

391
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,233
people change their behavior.

392
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,500
It's really a framework.

393
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,133
And what's fascinating to me

394
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,800
is that neuroscience talks

395
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:20,366
and everything else works.

396
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,566
And by that I mean

397
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:23,100
when I

398
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,633
explain people,

399
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:25,466
their behavior

400
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,666
with a neuroscience

401
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,333
framework, it carries a lot of currency

402
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,933
for people. It feels real.

403
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:32,333
You know,

404
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,300
it feels like it's almost like

405
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,600
let me just throw it out there

406
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,233
like a modern day religion.

407
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,166
Like you could

408
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,366
you could use

409
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:40,966
a very different framework,

410
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:42,633
like you could use a moral framework,

411
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:45,233
you could use a philosophical framework.

412
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,366
People don't resonate with that

413
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,466
the same way they resonate

414
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,300
in neuroscience,

415
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,800
which is why

416
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,600
I use the neuroscience framework.

417
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
So I think and

418
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,566
people carry it around with them.

419
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,400
So for example,

420
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,233
I use this extended metaphor

421
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,400
of a balance, pleasure,

422
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,600
pain, balance and gremlins

423
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,400
represent neuro adaptation,

424
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,200
and they hop on the pain side of balance

425
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,800
and for example,

426
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,500
I had a reader write me and say,

427
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:06,866
you know,

428
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:07,666
really tried

429
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,166
really hard to quit smoking.

430
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,066
So whenever I have an urge

431
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:11,933
to smoke a cigaret,

432
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,933
I just imagine those little gremlins

433
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:15,966
going right up to popping up and down

434
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:16,766
the road.

435
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:18,566
I'm not going you're not going to win.

436
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:21,333
You know, I'm going to outlast you.

437
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,366
So that's really interesting.

438
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,200
People will, you know, it's like a free

439
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,633
we need those epistemological frameworks

440
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,333
that we project on to the world

441
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,100
to help us cope, make decisions

442
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,300
last in difficult situations.

443
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,066
I thinks

444
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:44,600
maybe even one where that that person is

445
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:48,133
experiencing their experience

446
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,033
the way that they're thinking

447
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:51,666
about their behavior and inference.

448
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,533
It's like the the metaphor

449
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,500
that you're

450
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,566
bringing the baseball game for,

451
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,333
the neurotransmitter synapse,

452
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,433
the gremlins,

453
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,633
even some of the more flowcharts,

454
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,066
like how different stages

455
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:06,966
are related to each other.

456
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:09,266
There's always like a person's form

457
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,766
moving through it,

458
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,333
and then that provides

459
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,400
a lot of accessibility

460
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,000
to enter into that space

461
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,533
and like kind of

462
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,300
imagine counterfactual ways,

463
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,000
which is our

464
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,566
human cognitive expertize in a sense,

465
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,600
is not to memorize 11 digit numbers

466
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:31,200
even outside of ultra specific training.

467
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,500
It's to like, OK,

468
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:34,900
if the neurotransmitter

469
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,633
like when I looked at that example,

470
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,966
I thought, well, where are the glia?

471
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,733
Are they the crowd?

472
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,566
Are they like, what are they doing?

473
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:44,933
Are they supporting this pitch?

474
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,366
And then there's that time scale.

475
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,066
Then it already opens the door

476
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:48,700
to questions

477
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,533
that the molecular representations

478
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:50,833
like, Oh,

479
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,033
well then it's a done deal, right?

480
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:54,200
With the pre and post synaptic.

481
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,133
Huh? Yeah, right.

482
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:57,666
And I think you know,

483
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,100
obviously these metaphors

484
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,500
are like

485
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,266
a gross oversimplification and things,

486
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,900
you know,

487
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,000
can't explain all of the phenomena

488
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,200
but as you say,

489
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,166
if we try to explain it all

490
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,800
and we get too complicated,

491
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,000
then it feels to people

492
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,233
like memorizing a list of numbers.

493
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,833
So it has to be true

494
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,800
enough to represent the real science,

495
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,500
but not so complex

496
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,566
that people can't take it with them

497
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
and apply it in their

498
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,733
everyday, everyday lives.

499
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,500
And it also it takes it out of that,

500
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,300
the kind of uncanny valley and example

501
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,033
there would be like the ribosome.

502
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,466
It's a purple blob, right?

503
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,133
Well, it's really not,

504
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,666
but it's represented so commonly

505
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,600
and then that locks in.

506
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,566
But then at the baseball game,

507
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:45,666
we know it's not so different scale

508
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,133
roads, approachable.

509
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,166
And then anyone

510
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,966
who wants to look into the receptor

511
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,633
slash glove.

512
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,100
Yes. Yeah. So

513
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:55,966
what's.

514
00:15:58,566 --> 00:15:59,466
OK?

515
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,400
That was kind of exploring

516
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,033
what was the second area,

517
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,266
which was like the epistemic

518
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,700
and the pragmatic, like always

519
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,733
pairing the knowledge,

520
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:10,533
gaining with the useful

521
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,933
and then recognizing that there's a time

522
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,833
for the more knowledge oriented.

523
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,600
Maybe there's a building on campus

524
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,700
that's more knowledge oriented.

525
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,600
And then also there's a time and a place

526
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,300
for what's useful.

527
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,500
And maybe

528
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,633
that's part of the conversation that

529
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
do you want to see or

530
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,166
how do you want to see it

531
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,233
with applied neuroscience?

532
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:34,666
Can you can you say what

533
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,700
you mean a little bit more?

534
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,366
I didn't quite get that.

535
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:39,300
Like connecting the epistemic

536
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,500
and the pragmatic,

537
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,966
the learning and research oriented work

538
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,566
with the practical tips

539
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,500
is, Oh,

540
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,300
you can act, how could it be,

541
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,400
how should it be?

542
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,533
How do we make that connect?

543
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,966
And like flexible and and work

544
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,866
yeah.

545
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:57,333
I mean, there's

546
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,666
obviously, you know, a huge disconnect

547
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,333
like this is this is the problem.

548
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,966
We're sort of in this ivory tower

549
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,900
where we're learning this stuff.

550
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,733
We're acquiring this knowledge

551
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,900
work where, you know, people,

552
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,233
you know,

553
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,566
neuroscientists like you actually

554
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,333
adding new knowledge.

555
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:14,966
But yeah, then

556
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:15,566
the question is

557
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:18,000
how do we get that to people

558
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,566
to actually benefit them,

559
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,700
you know, in their everyday lives

560
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,900
and also get it getting it to

561
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,000
to students

562
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,566
to give them a sense of meaning

563
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,433
and purpose in their work.

564
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:31,433
So it doesn't feel

565
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,700
so incredibly disembodied

566
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,833
from the world that we live in

567
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,966
and the reasons behind

568
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,100
for why we do

569
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,300
I mean,

570
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,200
why do we want to

571
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,866
acquire this knowledge?

572
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:42,466
I mean, you know, there's

573
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:43,600
there's there's not just

574
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,066
I mean,

575
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,900
maybe it is knowledge for its own sake,

576
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,000
but I think deeply people want to feel

577
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,266
they're contributing,

578
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:51,133
making the world a better place,

579
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:51,800
you know?

580
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,500
So I think

581
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,466
it's really important to to to

582
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,900
we need to do more to bring those

583
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,566
things together.

584
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:00,033
I feel

585
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,966
like, you know, medical education,

586
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,200
the so there's the pre clinical years

587
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,500
and then there's the clinical years.

588
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,733
And I know for me personally,

589
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,633
like those clinical years

590
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,533
where where I first sort of felt like,

591
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,366
oh, things goodness,

592
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:15,800
you know, here

593
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
I am interacting

594
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,933
with like real human beings

595
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,000
and trying to take this knowledge.

596
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,700
And also, I'm impatient.

597
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,233
I'm very impatient.

598
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,400
So I feel like the human interaction

599
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:29,033
I could see more quickly

600
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,533
that I was making a difference.

601
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:32,066
I didn't have the kind of patience

602
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:34,166
that it takes to be a scientist

603
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:35,400
in the sense

604
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,033
that you are

605
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,566
where you really have to have

606
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:39,600
deep, deep data.

607
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,400
So what you're doing matters

608
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,466
and that down the road

609
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:43,466
you will see it's

610
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:46,000
you know, it's it's application

611
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,300
unless you unless it's

612
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,933
just the beauty of it,

613
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,833
you know, for its own sake compels

614
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:51,666
you will in.

615
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,033
But I'm ultimately

616
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,000
a very kind of pragmatic person.

617
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,133
And so and I'm also impatient.

618
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,666
So I need to see that a lot

619
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,766
a lot sooner.

620
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:00,566
But how about you?

621
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,333
I'm sure you have any thoughts on this.

622
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,166
I'd love to able

623
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,266
Well.

624
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:08,100
Yes, very interesting.

625
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,433
And as

626
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,166
we were kind of joking about

627
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,266
before, like

628
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:14,366
everyone especially in an age

629
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,100
of specialization, abundance

630
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,700
of specialisms,

631
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,133
that being able to, like,

632
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,800
connect across them is really important.

633
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,566
Like having not had firsthand experience

634
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,566
in, for example,

635
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:27,366
any of the stories presented.

636
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,000
And that's like the microcosm

637
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,700
of the discussion with frameworks

638
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,600
and people's lives

639
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,666
kind of meeting from the ground up.

640
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,633
So patients,

641
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:39,900
that's an interesting thing.

642
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,566
And you point out

643
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,933
to like how different people

644
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,800
seemingly display behaviorally

645
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,033
different amounts of patients

646
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:47,200
and they probably experience

647
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
it differently too.

648
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
But also it's patients

649
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,400
for different things. Right?

650
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:54,400
Intermittent fasting of this many hours

651
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,933
of this many days,

652
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,200
all the things might align

653
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,766
for one person at one time

654
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:01,066
and it very easy to be patient

655
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,066
behaviorally versus

656
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,600
not versus some other strategy.

657
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,133
And so

658
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,266
trying to think about that in an active

659
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:09,833
inference way,

660
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,800
it's like

661
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,666
in active inference,

662
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,866
the question is always about

663
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:15,166
what is the decision right now

664
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,700
or inference and action.

665
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,533
So how should I be perceiving

666
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:22,300
and learning and acting in the moment?

667
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,066
Given the

668
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:28,200
long horizon or the stated horizon?

669
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,900
So what is going to be the best move

670
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
in this chess move?

671
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,166
Given the kind of uncertainty

672
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,166
about the future of the game includes

673
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,233
including like the uncertainty

674
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:39,133
about what

675
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:40,333
the other side will do

676
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:40,700
or something

677
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,033
like that,

678
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,066
or even uncertainty over

679
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,166
one's own actions

680
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,300
and then patience is like, Well,

681
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,900
what is happening when the best action

682
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,366
selection is to

683
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,566
not engage with something?

684
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,066
So what is it that actually values

685
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,366
for something that is valuable?

686
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:02,333
Like, it's easy to be patient

687
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:02,766
for something

688
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,566
that's just a purely negative

689
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:06,100
experience, right?

690
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,366
Or just a hold off, not interested,

691
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,800
but being patient, we kind of

692
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
are applying to something

693
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,466
where it's like, I do want to

694
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,500
call this person before the time

695
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,400
I said I would call them,

696
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,766
but I'm getting impatient or like,

697
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,933
I want this research project to be over.

698
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:24,100
I wish that this was faster,

699
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,666
which everyone involved in research

700
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,100
or maybe analogously like

701
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,433
it would be awesome if myself

702
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,100
or if this patients were

703
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,233
seemingly on

704
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:36,500
their recovery faster or something.

705
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,033
So how, how does it come to be that

706
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:43,033
sometimes we wait in the moment

707
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,666
and other, other times we don't

708
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,033
and like,

709
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:50,600
is it OK or when should we do stuff?

710
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,900
Yeah, oh

711
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:55,466
gosh. So much there.

712
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:56,766
So let's start with your question.

713
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,700
How how does it come to be?

714
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,266
How how do we I mean, you know,

715
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,933
I quote you in the book

716
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,333
saying that the world is

717
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,700
sensory rich and causal poor.

718
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,966
And I just love that quote

719
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:12,033
because it wraps up in this nice,

720
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,800
nice little package

721
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:17,266
that the problem

722
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:18,866
with highly reinforcing

723
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:20,466
drugs and behaviors,

724
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:22,500
which is that in the moment,

725
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
they feel like the right thing

726
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,733
and they feel good.

727
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:26,700
But the long term

728
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,233
consequences of repeated use

729
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:29,633
is to get us to a

730
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,400
potentially very dark place.

731
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,133
But we don't

732
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,766
necessarily see the connection

733
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:36,766
between those two things. Right.

734
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,400
So how is it

735
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,033
that we come to see that connection?

736
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,933
And I think as a psychiatrist, having

737
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:46,566
listened to thousands

738
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:48,600
and thousands of people's narrative

739
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,533
life stories over time,

740
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:52,766
that one of the ways that we get

741
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:53,033
there

742
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:54,400
is actually

743
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,966
the autobiographical self narrative

744
00:22:57,533 --> 00:23:00,000
that that that words are tools

745
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
and that those tools are a way

746
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,300
not just to organize past experience,

747
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,200
but actually create roadmaps

748
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,500
for the future.

749
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,100
So it's not just, you know,

750
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,500
the way that we tell our stories

751
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,600
about our lives are very,

752
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
very impactful.

753
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,966
I think Lucho or somebody like that

754
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,000
said said that

755
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,966
then autobiographical narrative

756
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,066
is the only way

757
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:26,233
that we have to document live time,

758
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,300
which is really, really interesting.

759
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,633
Like for all of the cool technology

760
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:31,500
that we have

761
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,333
the only thing

762
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,100
that documents

763
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,366
live time is storytelling.

764
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:37,933
So and I've seen this again and again

765
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,300
when my patients come in

766
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,866
and they tell

767
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,366
an autobiographical narrative

768
00:23:41,366 --> 00:23:42,233
in which

769
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:43,433
they are constantly

770
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:45,033
the victim of the world

771
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,233
and other people,

772
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:48,166
and that's why they're addicted.

773
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,433
Those people are not going

774
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:50,800
to get better.

775
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:53,600
And part of what I need to do over time

776
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,066
is to move them toward what I consider

777
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:58,100
to be a more truthful narrative,

778
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:58,933
which is that

779
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:00,066
there's always something

780
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:02,233
that we have contribute to the problem.

781
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:02,500
You know,

782
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,800
maybe we just showed up

783
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,733
and that was our contribution,

784
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:07,333
but it's never

785
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,466
always entirely somebody else's fault.

786
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,700
And for people who get into sustained

787
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,333
and robust recovery,

788
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,033
you can hear the difference

789
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:17,500
in their autobiographical narratives,

790
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,066
and one of the front

791
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,333
of the narrative differences are able

792
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,666
to tolerate the shame

793
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:24,766
that comes

794
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:25,866
with acknowledging

795
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,300
their character defects

796
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,366
and the mistakes that they made

797
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:30,766
and what they're contributing

798
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,000
to their messed up situation,

799
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,333
which is just basically

800
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,100
closer to the truth.

801
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,833
So telling

802
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,766
the truth is really important.

803
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:40,233
Telling truthful stories

804
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:41,100
is really important.

805
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,200
And I think

806
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
that those stories

807
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,666
actually become the tool

808
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:50,066
by which we are able to remain patient

809
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
in the face of,

810
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,300
you know, delayed gratification.

811
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,900
That's what keeps us able

812
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,166
to not to do something

813
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,433
that we should do in the moment.

814
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:02,100
We don't feel like doing or to abstain

815
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,866
from doing something

816
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:04,866
that we feel like doing in the moment

817
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:06,733
but shouldn't do.

818
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:07,466
And, you know,

819
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,966
whether that story takes or framework

820
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,766
based on neuroscience or whether there's

821
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,066
a religious

822
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:16,500
or spiritual framework, like,

823
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:16,800
you know,

824
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,466
my reward will come in another life.

825
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:21,733
There are many different ways

826
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:24,300
to build that story,

827
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,866
but that story has got to be

828
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:26,200
the thing

829
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,100
that allows that person

830
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,333
to kind of you know, delay

831
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:32,233
this gratification in the service of,

832
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:33,666
you know,

833
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,833
living a

834
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,166
more flourishing life.

835
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,000
I'd like to ask

836
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,033
a follow up question from the Adam

837
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:44,033
giving remark

838
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:47,033
where a pixel nice screen name asks,

839
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:49,400
How can we learn to build patience

840
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,666
for healthy habits?

841
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,866
OK, how can we learn to build?

842
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:56,866
That's so, so good.

843
00:25:56,866 --> 00:26:00,000
So I think there are a couple

844
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,366
there are a couple stages

845
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:04,600
First

846
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,066
it's to recognize that

847
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,800
when you first stop doing a bad habit,

848
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:15,866
you will suffer more, that the initial

849
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,233
or your initial experience

850
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:21,033
will be increased pain, not

851
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:22,866
like immediate reward

852
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:24,800
from stopping that bad habit.

853
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,466
So I think so

854
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:26,233
that like setting up

855
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:28,266
expectations in that way,

856
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:30,000
but that the longer you can go

857
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,033
abstaining from that bad habit,

858
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,366
the faster you will get to that place

859
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,766
where you

860
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:39,966
begin to feel better

861
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,133
and you don't miss that bad habit.

862
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:42,600
In fact,

863
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,133
you start to reap the benefits

864
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:44,366
from that.

865
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:46,033
You have to know it's going to get worse

866
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:47,000
before it gets better.

867
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:49,300
Everybody talks about

868
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,400
practicing mindfulness

869
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,266
and what that is,

870
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:52,233
but actually there's

871
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:53,566
almost no better opportunity

872
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:54,866
for practicing mindfulness

873
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:56,300
than to give up something

874
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,100
that's bad for you,

875
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,800
that you really like a bad habit.

876
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,000
Because what will happen

877
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,400
is it'll stir up all kinds.

878
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,066
It's very disruptive.

879
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:03,666
And I think

880
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,666
and the ability to learn

881
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,166
that you are not your

882
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,133
thoughts and emotions,

883
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,200
but that you can stand

884
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,000
some distance from that

885
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and not respond to that.

886
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,566
But just objectively observe

887
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:18,733
those things is is really important.

888
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,533
I think

889
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,766
giving up a bad habit,

890
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,766
bad habit with other people

891
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:25,800
so that you're not doing

892
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,133
it alone is really important

893
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:29,766
because you can then,

894
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:30,233
you know,

895
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,333
go to other people

896
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,733
and sort of suffer together

897
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:35,366
and then I think meaning making

898
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:36,600
is really important.

899
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,400
So to give up the bad habit

900
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,500
so that you yourself can feel better,

901
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,633
but also what is the what is the greater

902
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:48,533
meaning of abstaining from that thing?

903
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,300
And often it's

904
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,400
a consumptive process and,

905
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,700
you know,

906
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,066
a greater

907
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:53,066
meaning could be

908
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:54,300
saving the planet, right?

909
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,700
I'm doing this for me,

910
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,500
but it's also good for the world.

911
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,666
Thanks for the answer.

912
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02,700
So, yeah,

913
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,866
one of those words

914
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:06,000
you mentioned was expectations,

915
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,333
which is a poor idea

916
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,633
in Bayesian statistics

917
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,300
and a long history

918
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
of like Bayesian brain

919
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,333
predictive coding,

920
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:16,933
predictive processing,

921
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:18,400
many different approaches

922
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,466
to neuroscience behavior and so on.

923
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,933
And active inference does

924
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:23,566
build on

925
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:26,966
that and uses the idea of expectations

926
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,700
as far as expected futures

927
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,366
and things like that a lot.

928
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:32,400
And so it's interesting

929
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,033
to think about the role of dopamine

930
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:38,200
and like you said, set up for this

931
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,800
because then it'll basically go that way

932
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,300
and you'll stay on track.

933
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,100
Whereas if you expect

934
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,566
to go faster or different,

935
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:46,200
you're going to feel like worse

936
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,466
or anxious or uncertain

937
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:48,900
about how to proceed.

938
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,800
And it's totally modeled

939
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,733
in an active inference way

940
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,300
by thinking about like

941
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,566
the estimate is not how many points,

942
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:57,300
how many are

943
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,666
am I getting, it's

944
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,033
how many points relative

945
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:02,333
to how many points I expect. Right.

946
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,666
And one can be doing better

947
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:06,100
or worse or as expected.

948
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,333
And if things are going

949
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,600
well, there's positive valence.

950
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,200
If things are going as expected,

951
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,033
it's like neutral valence,

952
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:14,200
and then you're going poor.

953
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,300
There's like anxiety

954
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,100
and negative valence, right?

955
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,800
So that is one way

956
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,833
where moving from like a reward

957
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,333
only perspective to be like,

958
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:22,833
well, yes,

959
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,033
there's an expectation of reward

960
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,100
and precision along that path.

961
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,633
Will be pleasurable or neutral,

962
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:31,833
but it's not going to be like

963
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,166
winning, winning, winning.

964
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,000
It'll be like

965
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,033
neutral with oscillation around

966
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:38,400
neutral right?

967
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,966
Yeah.

968
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:40,100
And I can tell you,

969
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,766
you know,

970
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:41,600
in the

971
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,200
like the lived experience

972
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,100
of treating patients,

973
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,133
this is absolutely key.

974
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:48,600
So one of the things that we do

975
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,533
in our clinic is to help people

976
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:54,900
get off of chronic opioids

977
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,733
like, you know,

978
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:57,800
OxyContin or Vicodin or Norco

979
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,500
or chronic benzodiazepines like Xanax,

980
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,433
Valium out of them. And,

981
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,366
you know,

982
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:06,300
you would think

983
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,166
this it's not that complicated,

984
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:11,066
but actually a lot of patients

985
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,966
are looking for help with this

986
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:14,466
and can't find it.

987
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:16,366
And they find it in our clinic.

988
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,866
And the one thing that I would say

989
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,566
we provide, which is the real value,

990
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,666
is to establish appropriate expectations

991
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:28,766
because what happens

992
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:30,233
is they'll both see a doctor

993
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:30,600
and they'll say,

994
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,100
I need to get off of Xanax

995
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,900
or I really want to get off the Xanax.

996
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,166
And the doctor said, oh, that's easy.

997
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:35,400
You know,

998
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,533
just go down by you know, you know, 50%

999
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:39,833
of your starting dose

1000
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,733
over the next week and you'll be fine.

1001
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:43,200
And the patients

1002
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,833
do that

1003
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,100
or same thing with therapy, opioid,

1004
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,833
they do that

1005
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:48,733
and they're in horrific psychological

1006
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:49,600
and physical pain

1007
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
because they're in withdrawal,

1008
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,066
or maybe they even have a seizure,

1009
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:52,800
right?

1010
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:57,166
So their experience is totally worse

1011
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,633
or much worse

1012
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,500
than what their doctor predicted.

1013
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:00,833
And first,

1014
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,133
the doctor is like

1015
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,533
the respected authority.

1016
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,333
So then they feel angry.

1017
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,900
They also feel betrayed.

1018
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,633
They also feel like they're weird,

1019
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,833
like why? Why am they come to us?

1020
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,100
And my patients told me again

1021
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,600
and again,

1022
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,066
Doctor, aren't you

1023
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:14,700
the most important thing

1024
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,766
you said to me

1025
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:17,600
when we went down by my opioid

1026
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,066
or my benzo by a little bit

1027
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:20,400
and we go very slowly,

1028
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,833
is that I would feel worse

1029
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,766
before I feel better.

1030
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:25,566
And I really do

1031
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:27,466
I way emphasize that

1032
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:28,933
so that if they go

1033
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,300
and they taper and it's not even

1034
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,166
it's not as bad as what I

1035
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,766
then they're like happy.

1036
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:35,533
It's like you know,

1037
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:36,200
what you told me

1038
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,733
was going to be bad for a while

1039
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,400
until my body would really refill.

1040
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,000
But we equilibrated

1041
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,733
and it was bad,

1042
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,266
but it wasn't like I could do

1043
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:43,833
it, you know,

1044
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,266
so that setting expectations

1045
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:47,400
is it's really, really important.

1046
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,066
Like in the real world.

1047
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,133
It's almost like there's a wanting

1048
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:56,333
for reduction or sobriety,

1049
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,533
but actually they don't like it

1050
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,966
behaviorally, not on the psychological

1051
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:01,833
what are they thinking?

1052
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,500
What does the survey say?

1053
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,933
But actually like, well,

1054
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,966
you don't like the green room

1055
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,000
if you aren't spending your time in it.

1056
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,400
It's how we would say it

1057
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,200
about the other kinds of animals.

1058
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
So it's kind of like interesting,

1059
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,066
like where do we like

1060
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,833
something but not want it?

1061
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:17,733
What is dopamine

1062
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:20,266
and other neurotransmitters? Doing then?

1063
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:21,033
How about

1064
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:24,133
situations where we do or don't

1065
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:24,966
have patients?

1066
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:27,500
Like they are such great

1067
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,533
questions

1068
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,400
and entry points for our own life

1069
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
and for research.

1070
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,566
And that's like kind of the bridge is

1071
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:36,500
the introduction of the paper

1072
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
or the context for

1073
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,333
the grant is like kind of

1074
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,333
could be that bridge.

1075
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,933
But then sometimes it

1076
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,366
is more about how it appears

1077
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:46,200
rather than how it is.

1078
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,533
Yeah.

1079
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:46,966
And I think

1080
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:50,166
the variable of time is so important

1081
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,366
for all of these things.

1082
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:53,466
Like if I'm going to,

1083
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:53,800
you know,

1084
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,466
we can sign up for a lot of suffering

1085
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,300
if we know it's time limited right?

1086
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,233
Like, OK, I can do this

1087
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:01,966
because Doctor

1088
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:03,300
Lin said I would feel like crap

1089
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:03,833
for two weeks

1090
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,333
and I would start to feel better.

1091
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,066
And so, you know, you can hang in there

1092
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:09,300
for that or whatever or you know,

1093
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:10,833
the intervention is that that

1094
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,133
makes a difference.

1095
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:17,700
So returning to the quote on

1096
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,733
page 75

1097
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,600
about the world is sensory

1098
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,800
rich and causal for you know

1099
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:28,466
personal communication when 2018

1100
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,400
because I think there's

1101
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,433
a very interesting difference

1102
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:30,833
or something

1103
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,400
and I'm thinking about it now.

1104
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Oh interesting.

1105
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,266
OK, I'd love to hear that.

1106
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:37,133
So I think that was

1107
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:38,400
when I was just beginning

1108
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,766
to learn

1109
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,533
about active inference and free energy

1110
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:42,066
principle and Bayesian brain.

1111
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:42,833
And I was thinking

1112
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,633
well wow it's not just like

1113
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:45,600
signal detection

1114
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,900
on the pixels or whatever

1115
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:50,500
there's the causal inference

1116
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,133
and then that's like you followed up

1117
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,133
like we know that donut

1118
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,033
tastes good in the moment,

1119
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,000
but we are less aware

1120
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,733
that eating a donut

1121
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:56,700
every day for a month

1122
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,300
adds £5 to our waistline.

1123
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,000
We, we get that understanding

1124
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,833
through personal experience,

1125
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:06,333
relationships, science, research.

1126
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:08,300
We build that understanding,

1127
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,133
that expectation of cause in

1128
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,066
and then all of a sudden

1129
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,700
our behavior is like more natural

1130
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,966
to switch in the moment.

1131
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:17,500
So I was thinking, you know, starry eyed

1132
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,766
graduate student,

1133
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,233
sensory rich and causal for

1134
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:22,466
I think now I might say

1135
00:34:22,466 --> 00:34:24,666
sensory poor and causal poor

1136
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,366
because the sensory part

1137
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,400
is of extremely limited

1138
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:33,833
frequency, only some

1139
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:35,600
chemicals that we can detect,

1140
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,800
only some sounds that we hear

1141
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,400
even within a domain

1142
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,666
we're not always paying attention to.

1143
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,400
Our blind spot

1144
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,333
is evidence

1145
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:45,766
that we're

1146
00:34:45,766 --> 00:34:47,966
in a generative model of vision

1147
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:49,700
because the sensory data

1148
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,200
is sparse and noisy and early.

1149
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,966
So it's like in the world

1150
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:57,333
that sensory poor and causal poor,

1151
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:59,566
you can finally disengage from this,

1152
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:02,500
like watching a movie

1153
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,566
perspective.

1154
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:05,333
And it's like it's so generative, it's

1155
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,766
so much about our expectations as well.

1156
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:08,966
It's the cause.

1157
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:09,900
And also

1158
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,133
we're not just watching a movie,

1159
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,100
a vision,

1160
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,333
and we're expecting a big thing

1161
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:16,833
and generating even that most

1162
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:20,033
yeah.

1163
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:21,000
So powerful.

1164
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,833
I think this is really why

1165
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:23,766
I think there's

1166
00:35:23,766 --> 00:35:27,466
so much power in our self narratives

1167
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,166
because I think those self narratives

1168
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,333
that we project on to the world

1169
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:36,633
absolutely impact what we perceive

1170
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,533
I just yesterday

1171
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:41,066
I was meeting with a very beloved

1172
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:42,866
patient of mine

1173
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:46,333
who happens to be, you know, a, a

1174
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,366
graduate student

1175
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,033
who has had

1176
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:53,366
a really mixed experience in his lab

1177
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:56,533
and feels like

1178
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:58,133
he hasn't made any friends.

1179
00:35:58,133 --> 00:35:59,966
Nobody likes him

1180
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:02,433
and also feels like

1181
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,266
like they're all jerks

1182
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:07,433
and they're kind of out to get him.

1183
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,600
And what I tried to get him to see

1184
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:15,233
is that he has a narrative

1185
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:17,300
and a vision that he

1186
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,500
superimposes on the world

1187
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,433
such that all

1188
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,466
he remembers

1189
00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:21,466
or appreciates

1190
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:23,633
is like the slights, right?

1191
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:24,866
And he doesn't

1192
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:26,066
he doesn't have access

1193
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:26,833
to the other things

1194
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,666
because he's so entrenched

1195
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,466
in this particular version of the world.

1196
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,600
Just to give like a personal example,

1197
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,066
I talked about in the book

1198
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,900
my very complicated relationship

1199
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,400
with my mom

1200
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,766
and how part of the healing for

1201
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:45,000
my relationship

1202
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,733
was to get out of this place

1203
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:48,366
where I'm always saying

1204
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:50,566
how terrible she is,

1205
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,866
and instead

1206
00:36:51,866 --> 00:36:53,333
appreciating really

1207
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,533
the great things about her,

1208
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:55,666
which are many

1209
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:56,966
and also

1210
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,933
what I've contributed to the problem.

1211
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:01,333
But before I could do that,

1212
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,133
I was engaging in behaviors

1213
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:04,933
that just reinforced my worldview

1214
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:05,400
and I'll give you

1215
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,100
a very tangible example

1216
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:09,966
you know,

1217
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,500
one of

1218
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,300
the things that that

1219
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,500
had bothered me about her

1220
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,700
was that I would email

1221
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,266
and she wouldn't

1222
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,166
respond to my email

1223
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,200
in a timely or what

1224
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,400
I felt was appropriate action.

1225
00:37:21,566 --> 00:37:23,400
And this came up at one point

1226
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,466
where I, you know, did

1227
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:25,800
something that was really important.

1228
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
I felt it was really important.

1229
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
And she didn't respond

1230
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,333
and I gave her a week

1231
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,333
and I gave her a month

1232
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,833
and I gave her three months.

1233
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:32,966
And I got angrier

1234
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:34,733
and angrier as time went on and,

1235
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:35,000
you know,

1236
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,200
railed about it to my husband,

1237
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,733
say, see,

1238
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:39,100
this is exactly what I'm talking about.

1239
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,900
And then I was eventually

1240
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,300
just able to just forget about it

1241
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,866
and whatever move on.

1242
00:37:43,866 --> 00:37:45,600
And then I was on email

1243
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,266
and kind of looking through it

1244
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,300
all kind of cleaning on my

1245
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,600
and discovered

1246
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,400
that my original email

1247
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,033
that I had sent to her

1248
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,166
that I was so angry

1249
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,133
that she hadn't responded

1250
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:57,566
to was actually in my draft box.

1251
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,900
It had never been sent.

1252
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,500
And I think there are so many ways

1253
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,666
in which we do that

1254
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,566
where where

1255
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:04,800
we don't even get the opportunity

1256
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,433
to see it like it was just

1257
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:07,066
in this case,

1258
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:07,900
I did

1259
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,133
but we, we sort of

1260
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,000
do these things to sort of,

1261
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,700
you know,

1262
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,833
hold on to this worldview,

1263
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,966
which typically has other people

1264
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:17,433
being the bad actors

1265
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:18,900
and it doesn't force us

1266
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,000
to look at ourselves.

1267
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:21,766
Thanks.

1268
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,166
So one

1269
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,833
interesting piece there is like

1270
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,100
we won't be totally on board for

1271
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,766
the past

1272
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,833
being a reconstruction in the present,

1273
00:38:31,866 --> 00:38:33,800
the generative aspect of memory.

1274
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,266
And then it's also easy to believe

1275
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:37,066
in the generative aspect of the future.

1276
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,266
It hasn't happened yet.

1277
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:38,900
We don't know about it.

1278
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,600
And then

1279
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:42,366
as per that predictive coding

1280
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:45,100
type of like sensory generative model,

1281
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,266
we're also now casting.

1282
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:48,766
So it's like the past, the present,

1283
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:49,466
the future, you know,

1284
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:51,833
the three areas that we know about,

1285
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,700
they're all generative.

1286
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,800
So there is reception of signals

1287
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,233
but also like

1288
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:58,600
all of those are generative.

1289
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,500
And then you pointed to like this idea

1290
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,900
of kind of a cognitive degree of freedom

1291
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,833
in our narrative.

1292
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,133
And so we might even model

1293
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:06,766
that as like

1294
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:08,700
an action or a movements

1295
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,500
in a narrative space.

1296
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,333
And so

1297
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,433
how do we make appropriate actions

1298
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:15,233
in narrative space?

1299
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:17,333
Because do we just say,

1300
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,233
OK, graduate student, no,

1301
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,000
they're awesome,

1302
00:39:20,966 --> 00:39:23,700
or how do we know

1303
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,666
what to say and how.

1304
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,133
To do it or not?

1305
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:27,700
Yeah, so

1306
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,933
so this is a student of mine

1307
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,066
that I mentioned, this patient of mine

1308
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:30,366
who just

1309
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:31,733
happens to be a graduate student.

1310
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:32,700
So he's about to,

1311
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,666
you know, finish up

1312
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:35,366
and go on to a post-doc

1313
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:37,800
and I actually suggested that to him

1314
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,966
as sort of as an experiment

1315
00:39:39,966 --> 00:39:40,900
because I often talk about this

1316
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,200
as inspiration, you know,

1317
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
as you move on to your next lab.

1318
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,533
Why don't you try an experiment

1319
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:47,933
where you just

1320
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:51,766
take as like an a priori supposition

1321
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,533
that everybody in the lab loved you

1322
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,200
that that

1323
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,933
that they want the best for you,

1324
00:39:57,933 --> 00:40:00,233
that they are your friends.

1325
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,933
And any time you have like a paranoid

1326
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,300
thought or a negative thought,

1327
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,000
about them

1328
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,866
really critically, appraise

1329
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,500
that and you can doubt that and fact

1330
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,633
check it or reality

1331
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:13,400
test it with somebody else

1332
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,566
that you know, and I think through that,

1333
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:17,800
he might be able through

1334
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,100
iterative processes

1335
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,700
because it's such a feedforward cycle.

1336
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,533
The problem is when we're paranoid

1337
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:24,266
or suspicious of other people

1338
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:26,600
they sense it and they way back off.

1339
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,200
And then as soon as they back off,

1340
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,900
we get more paranoid as we should

1341
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,200
because they've given us the signal

1342
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,133
that they back up

1343
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:34,300
and that it's reinforcing cycle.

1344
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,866
So if we kind of discard

1345
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,333
that primary narrative

1346
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,900
and then act in the world

1347
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,933
as if right not and not in a fake way,

1348
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,200
but as if certain things were true

1349
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,666
that we didn't

1350
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:48,833
necessarily believe upfront.

1351
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,300
And I often ask my patients to do this

1352
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:50,766
all the time,

1353
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:51,900
especially with my patients

1354
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,266
who are addicted

1355
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,100
and whose lives are being destroyed

1356
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,666
by their addiction.

1357
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:57,400
I say to them,

1358
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,500
you have to imagine

1359
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,533
and essentially have faith

1360
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:04,166
that giving up your drug of choice

1361
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,333
will lead to a better life.

1362
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:06,900
Right now,

1363
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,333
what you see is two choices

1364
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,100
you see continuing to use and

1365
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,933
or stop using and being miserable.

1366
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,866
And I'm holding out to you

1367
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:17,633
the possibility of stop using

1368
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:19,000
and being

1369
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:21,766
happy or being happier than you are

1370
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,000
while you're using

1371
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,766
but it is a leap of faith

1372
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:26,700
because you have to are going to have to

1373
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,200
wait a long time

1374
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,266
and do a lot of things

1375
00:41:29,266 --> 00:41:31,500
where really you don't feel that at all.

1376
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:33,433
You just have to believe that

1377
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:35,500
it's true and approach every day

1378
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,200
as if that is true.

1379
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,466
The other thing I talk about in my book,

1380
00:41:39,466 --> 00:41:41,466
which is maybe a little bit of a paradox

1381
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:42,766
given what I just said,

1382
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,833
is this idea of radical honesty

1383
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,800
and how important truth telling

1384
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,966
is to this process.

1385
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:48,300
Again,

1386
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,933
because truth telling is important

1387
00:41:49,933 --> 00:41:51,266
to build true narratives

1388
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:52,500
and true narratives

1389
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,200
are important

1390
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,900
to be able to know how to make decisions

1391
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,933
going forward in our lives.

1392
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,466
And it's a small thing, but,

1393
00:42:00,466 --> 00:42:01,033
you know, my

1394
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:02,100
my patients will say

1395
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,900
and patients in recovery will say,

1396
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,300
I can't lie about anything.

1397
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,800
When I was using,

1398
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,233
I, of course, lied about my drug use,

1399
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:09,400
but I also lied about stuff

1400
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,700
that it didn't even matter.

1401
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,166
And my favorite anecdote is my patient

1402
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,566
who's now in really sustained recovery,

1403
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:14,300
doing great.

1404
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,200
He says, you know, when I was using,

1405
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,300
I was in the lying habit.

1406
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,933
If I if I was in McDonald's

1407
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:19,866
and a patient called and said,

1408
00:42:19,866 --> 00:42:20,400
hey, where are you?

1409
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,100
I'd say, hey, I'm a Burger King.

1410
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,800
If I was a Burger King, my patient,

1411
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,733
my friend would call and say,

1412
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:26,066
Yeah, I'm at McDonald's.

1413
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,366
So it got to be like this

1414
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:29,333
where like I like lies about everything.

1415
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,566
So part of his recovery

1416
00:42:30,566 --> 00:42:31,333
and this is what I actually

1417
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,766
prescribe to patients

1418
00:42:32,766 --> 00:42:33,800
is radical truth telling.

1419
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,633
Like you cannot

1420
00:42:34,633 --> 00:42:37,000
tell a lie about anything

1421
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:39,766
because that's telling the truth,

1422
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,733
I think helps us

1423
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:42,900
first of all, it's it's

1424
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,566
cognitively effortful.

1425
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:47,033
But secondly, it really grounds us in

1426
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:49,100
what is true and real

1427
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,766
and helps us in an iterative fashion.

1428
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:53,433
Stay closer to that

1429
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,766
to build these truthful narratives,

1430
00:42:55,766 --> 00:42:57,166
which I think are really important.

1431
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,466
So so there's a bit of a paradox there

1432
00:42:58,466 --> 00:42:59,400
because I'm saying on the one

1433
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,133
hand,

1434
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:01,333
pretend stuff

1435
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,200
that you don't feel is true,

1436
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
but which might be true,

1437
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,400
which you can't see,

1438
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,366
but at the same time

1439
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:08,266
be really honest about

1440
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:10,233
like your daily actions

1441
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,333
nice.

1442
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,466
Here are some of the

1443
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,500
active themes

1444
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,366
that I kind of heard their

1445
00:43:17,366 --> 00:43:20,066
action as a self-fulfilling prophecy

1446
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,933
and action as being in the business of

1447
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:24,633
acquiring evidence

1448
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:26,433
for a given generative model.

1449
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:27,800
That's a big theme.

1450
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,800
And also

1451
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,066
in order to switch action policies,

1452
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,666
there has to be

1453
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:34,000
a transient suppression

1454
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,200
of precision on the policy.

1455
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,366
Like if we're sitting down,

1456
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:39,966
we have to transiently implicitly

1457
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:41,166
or explicitly believe

1458
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,633
that it could be a different way.

1459
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:43,800
Otherwise we'll just continue

1460
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,600
to get evidence that we're sitting down

1461
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,933
and then

1462
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:51,333
it's a very active way

1463
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:54,266
to kind of escape that Gaslight paradox.

1464
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,533
So you we're talking

1465
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:59,600
about setting a competent prior

1466
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,766
for the next epoch

1467
00:44:01,766 --> 00:44:05,300
and so that just today you're low

1468
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,933
on how you believe others

1469
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:08,433
think of you and uncertain

1470
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:10,600
or your low and precise but

1471
00:44:11,366 --> 00:44:12,833
it's actually all in the past

1472
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,133
now behaviorally

1473
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:16,366
and then in your next endeavor

1474
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,833
you could just try

1475
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:21,366
starting higher in an unknown future

1476
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,733
if you just peg it

1477
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:24,866
higher and try to be more precise,

1478
00:44:24,866 --> 00:44:26,966
which is going to look like

1479
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:28,200
being more skeptical

1480
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,600
looking for evidence on the upside.

1481
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,533
And so it's like

1482
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:33,566
instead of focusing

1483
00:44:33,566 --> 00:44:34,100
on the

1484
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,800
past and trying to re narrative

1485
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,366
ize the past,

1486
00:44:37,366 --> 00:44:39,266
we can include the behavior of the past,

1487
00:44:39,266 --> 00:44:41,300
which for sure is in alterable

1488
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,333
into a prospective narrative

1489
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:43,833
of the future

1490
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,166
that makes actions

1491
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:49,000
like patients maybe more plausible yeah.

1492
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,066
Love it.

1493
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:51,900
I mean, of this, like love that science

1494
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,200
speak, it's so exciting

1495
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
and it maps so well to like,

1496
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,500
you know, these kinds of aphorisms

1497
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,266
or sort of the approach that we take

1498
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:02,400
in psychiatry and psychotherapy

1499
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,600
by using very different language.

1500
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,133
And that's always really exciting.

1501
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:07,333
And it just reminds me so much of,

1502
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:07,600
you know,

1503
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,233
the Alcoholics Anonymous saying

1504
00:45:09,233 --> 00:45:11,133
I'm taking it one day at a time,

1505
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:12,933
which is so fundamental

1506
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:14,333
for this whole process,

1507
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:15,633
because what happens when we take it

1508
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:16,733
one day at a time,

1509
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:18,033
it means that we wake up

1510
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:20,533
and we say the past is the past.

1511
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,400
The future is the future.

1512
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,766
All I need to do today is focus

1513
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:31,233
on what I can do today to make my life

1514
00:45:31,533 --> 00:45:33,300
and your life and our lives

1515
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,800
a little bit better

1516
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,133
without putting too heavy on me.

1517
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,033
Like I'm an

1518
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:38,900
I'm not going to go

1519
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,300
and like

1520
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,400
save people in Ukraine, obviously,

1521
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:43,633
but what are the things that I can do?

1522
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:45,733
I can pick up that piece of garbage.

1523
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:48,433
So it kind of narrows the time scope.

1524
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,300
It forces us to be in the here and now,

1525
00:45:51,466 --> 00:45:53,866
which also expands our senses

1526
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,666
so that we can take in more actual data

1527
00:45:56,866 --> 00:45:58,566
so that I'm not like ruminating

1528
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:00,300
and cogitating on my own,

1529
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,200
you know, sort of self-involved,

1530
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,400
you know, problems,

1531
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,733
which is where like,

1532
00:46:04,733 --> 00:46:05,466
you know, most of us

1533
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:06,766
spend a lot of our headspace.

1534
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:08,500
How do we do that? But we do.

1535
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,466
But instead,

1536
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,000
I notice that there's like

1537
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,100
peanut butter cup wrapper on the ground.

1538
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,066
I could pick that up, right?

1539
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:16,766
That's one thing

1540
00:46:16,766 --> 00:46:18,833
that I could notice

1541
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,500
that I have the urge to lie about

1542
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,400
why I'm late for this meeting,

1543
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,366
but I could not

1544
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:25,333
I could choose not to do that.

1545
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,400
I can choose that today.

1546
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,533
That's kind of exciting to me.

1547
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:31,500
That sort of opens up

1548
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,133
all kinds of possibilities

1549
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:33,500
because I'm

1550
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,400
not a future catastrophizing.

1551
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,566
I'm also not future grandiose thing,

1552
00:46:37,566 --> 00:46:37,766
you know,

1553
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:39,700
we're like, Oh, I have to do this.

1554
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,466
I have to do that,

1555
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:41,733
or I'm not going to be good enough.

1556
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:43,466
I'm not ruminating on my past.

1557
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:44,600
I'm saying, You know what?

1558
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,500
Today is the only unit of time

1559
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,466
that I really need to focus on.

1560
00:46:49,466 --> 00:46:51,600
And string, I would say, is my patients.

1561
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,366
A string of good days

1562
00:46:53,366 --> 00:46:54,833
makes a string of good weeks

1563
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,366
and a string of good weeks

1564
00:46:56,366 --> 00:46:57,733
is a string of good months.

1565
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:58,700
And before you know it,

1566
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,600
you've got a couple of good decades,

1567
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,966
and that's a lifetime.

1568
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:03,366
And that's a life well lived,

1569
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:04,866
which is what we all want.

1570
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:09,266
And to

1571
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:11,333
even bring in one other active

1572
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,133
term, the Affordance,

1573
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:15,266
which is the capacity for action

1574
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,066
which comes from

1575
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,500
the ecological psychology field,

1576
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:20,933
the affordances, relational.

1577
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:23,166
And so it's about like the motivation

1578
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:24,966
by that entity

1579
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:26,466
and the agency that they feel

1580
00:47:26,466 --> 00:47:27,300
they do or don't have

1581
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,500
from a narrative perspective

1582
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,800
and the affordances

1583
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,266
that the niche

1584
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:33,600
scaffolds and provides for them or not.

1585
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,966
And also the narratives

1586
00:47:34,966 --> 00:47:37,100
that the niche provides or not.

1587
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,600
And then the that

1588
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,433
is what is going to be engaged

1589
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:41,766
in that

1590
00:47:41,766 --> 00:47:43,833
behavioral decision in the moment.

1591
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:44,833
And then you also talk

1592
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,133
about like adding friction

1593
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:48,300
as like a pragmatic strategy

1594
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,466
that I'm sure everyone has experimented

1595
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:52,966
with variously on different facets.

1596
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:54,033
But it's like it's an example

1597
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:57,366
about the pragmatic tips,

1598
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,566
but also they're connected to behavioral

1599
00:48:00,566 --> 00:48:01,200
and cognitive

1600
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,300
modeling in this

1601
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,566
perhaps even formal way.

1602
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:07,400
Yeah, exactly.

1603
00:48:09,233 --> 00:48:10,000
Well,

1604
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,166
we covered many fun topics,

1605
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:13,933
like just a few

1606
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:14,933
that I kind of wrote down

1607
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,900
where patients,

1608
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,133
I guess the patients

1609
00:48:18,133 --> 00:48:19,433
who you clinically see

1610
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,033
and having patients in the moment

1611
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:25,066
and then expectations action

1612
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,900
and taking action

1613
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,566
as a first perturbation,

1614
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:30,166
then the dopamine

1615
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,300
as a reward

1616
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,000
and epistemic and pragmatic value.

1617
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,466
And there's a lot of interesting

1618
00:48:35,466 --> 00:48:36,933
research on active inference

1619
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:38,666
and dopamine signaling

1620
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,066
and then a lot of active terms

1621
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:42,266
like action

1622
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:44,700
priors, confidence, precision,

1623
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,100
narrative information,

1624
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,700
like all the amazing terms

1625
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,766
and just very fun and also powerful book

1626
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:57,000
and a lot of great material.

1627
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,733
Thank you, Daniel.

1628
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:58,800
This has been

1629
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,900
really fun

1630
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,600
as I knew

1631
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,533
it would be as talking to you as always,

1632
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:07,000
illuminating and

1633
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,900
surprising in fine and positive way.

1634
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,500
I always learn that I have

1635
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,366
so much

1636
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:16,900
respect for your,

1637
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,433
you know, intelligence and creativity.

1638
00:49:19,433 --> 00:49:22,733
It's always exciting

1639
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:23,700
thank you.

1640
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,200
And hope to talk to you

1641
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,133
and the others

1642
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,500
from the farm in the future.

1643
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,600
Sounds great.

1644
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:31,633
I see you.
