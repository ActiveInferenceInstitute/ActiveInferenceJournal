1
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,599
hello and welcome everyone this is

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,599
active lab guest stream number 22.1

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,560
i'm here with dr anna lumke and we are

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,920
here to discuss

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,800
dopamine and beyond and

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,760
really looking forward to this

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,480
conversation and appreciate the time so

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,760
to you for

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,320
any introductory context and then really

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,039
looking forward to this discussion

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,040
yeah well thank you so much for having

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,760
me daniel you know i've uh

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,200
been uh you know interested in you and

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,079
your work for many years now and so i'm

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,760
really excited to have

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,640
an excuse to reconnect

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,600
um and just excited to be here and you

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,280
asked me to start by introducing myself

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,360
so i'm i'm a professor of psychiatry and

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,440
behavioral sciences and also addiction

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,640
medicine

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,520
at lanford university school of medicine

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,400
i'm also author of the book dopamine

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
nation finding balance in the age of

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,200
indulgence and that's what we're going

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
to talk about which i and daniel's

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,119
quoted in there and i would have

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,840
actually included daniel moore in there

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,600
if i had if i were smart enough to

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
actually understand the work that he

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,759
does

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,400
thanks um

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
we'll get there with the ants and the

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,520
dopamine but yeah just what is dopamine

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
nation about and what motivated you to

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,079
write it

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,520
so dopamination is kind of a blend of

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
neuroscience made simple

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,960
combined with

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,479
practical advice for how to live in a

41
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,040
dopamine overloaded world

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
holding up people in recovery from

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,000
severe addictions as modern day profits

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,479
for the rest of us because all the

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,640
neuroscience in the world as valuable as

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,600
it is

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
um can't make up for the whole

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,079
experience of people who have gotten

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,479
into recovery from addiction

50
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,880
um dopamine nation also

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
posits a kind of global hypothesis you

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,440
know tentatively posits the hypothesis

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
that the growing rates of anxiety

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
depression suicide and other mental

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
health disorders across the world

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
are caused at least in part

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,680
by the problem of overabundance uh and

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,440
the kind of lack of appropriate friction

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,760
in our lives in other words the ways in

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,400
which our lives are maybe too easy and

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,239
the way that our primitive wiring is

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,519
mismatched for this modern ecosystem of

63
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,040
overwhelming over abundance

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,160
okay

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,280
one dopamine question and then i think

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,160
we'll start to see some areas of overlap

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
with active inference

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
what could you say to the role of

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
dopamine in reward and motivation

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
signaling like in wanting and liking and

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,360
how does dopamine play a role

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
in behavioral selection

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,720
okay so dopamine is essential for the

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
experience of motivation reward and

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,239
pleasure

76
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,080
it may be even more important for

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800
motivation than it is uh for the

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,280
experience of pleasure and i base this

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,000
on the work of my amazing neuroscience

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
colleagues who have done experiments for

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,159
example where they engineer a rat's

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,879
brain to do completed dopamine receptors

83
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,360
and discover that if they give that rat

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
food it will eat the food and seem to

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,799
take pleasure in the food but if they

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,879
put the food you know some distance away

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
the rat will starve to death meaning

88
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,720
that the absence of dopamine in these

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,840
key reward circuits

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,879
um make it such that that animal is no

91
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,760
longer

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,120
motivated to do the work that it takes

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
uh to get their reward and

94
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,360
my neuroscience colleagues like rob

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,720
malenka

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
had said that for him the definition of

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
addiction is how hard an animal is

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
willing to work to get their reward

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,640
and that has direct application to the

100
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,560
clinical work that i do

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,360
um you know we all like what we like and

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,200
once we experience the thing that we

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,079
like of course we want to repeat it but

104
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,478
the kind of fundamental

105
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,479
difference between those who go on to

106
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,800
develop addiction and those who don't is

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
that those who develop addiction are

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,919
willing to work very very hard to get

109
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
their drug of choice and are willing to

110
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,800
give up a lot of other things

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
even when that pursuit causes enormous

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
amount of

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,759
you know personal costs

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,840
thank you for that that's really

115
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
powerful with professor malenka's

116
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
definition of how hard they work to get

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,199
it because it's like an action-oriented

118
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,479
definition that could be measured in or

119
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,040
proxied by different things especially

120
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,840
clinically as opposed to like in

121
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,639
inference or a purely cognitive based

122
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,880
report like a survey how often do you

123
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
think about something like that

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,280
and uh that's very interesting and

125
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,639
that's i think one of the themes that

126
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,880
we'll pick up on which is

127
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,919
action and for active inference it's

128
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,160
right there in the title it's like

129
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,919
there's always going to be a minimum of

130
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,759
two and when we're talking about

131
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,199
behavior and cognition they're an

132
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
inseparable whole and then that plays

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,039
out in a lot of different ways like

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,800
partially with the embodiment and the

135
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,759
inactive perspectives that come to view

136
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,560
but also just like as you said it's

137
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,520
pragmatic too because it's relevant to

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,199
always be thinking about

139
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,759
action and cognition as like a dyad in

140
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,080
the context rather than trying to

141
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
separate them and then find a

142
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,360
correlation across

143
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
love it love it so

144
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,080
i've been a psychiatrist for

145
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,440
uh going on 30 25 years

146
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,319
and i would say the first half of my

147
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
training and

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,479
life experience and education was really

149
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,319
focused on changing people's cognitions

150
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,240
so focusing on people's thoughts and

151
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
emotions and using language as a tool to

152
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,080
talk about those to change those but as

153
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,120
my career went on i became more and more

154
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,960
skeptical of this as a solitary pursuit

155
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,520
and more and more convinced that what we

156
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,199
need to do is focus on changing behavior

157
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,039
and when i'm dealing with patients with

158
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,280
addiction that is in fact now my first

159
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,639
intervention

160
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,840
i will say let us first change the

161
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,199
behavior

162
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,280
and in doing that experiment and what i

163
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,160
mean is abstain from your drug of choice

164
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,960
see what happens and then let's make

165
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,599
certain inferences based on what that

166
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,440
experience was like for you and that's

167
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
really a typical in psychiatry today

168
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,919
what we do instead is we talk and we

169
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
talk and we talk about why the behaviors

170
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
are happening without really focusing on

171
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,199
changing the behaviors and i think we

172
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,080
really that that's not good like because

173
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,440
for example my patients will come in

174
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,639
they'll be addicted and they'll say i'm

175
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,240
addicted because i'm depressed or

176
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,639
because i have this trauma all of that

177
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,000
may be true

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,080
but we can talk about the trauma till

179
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,720
the cows come home you have to change

180
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
the behavior and you have to do it

181
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,280
before you feel like it so that's really

182
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,880
interesting too like patients will say

183
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
well

184
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,360
you know i'm just not i don't i'm not

185
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,840
motivated to do x y or z so this is an

186
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,280
earlier like i don't feel i said you

187
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,759
know what if you wait

188
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
till you feel like doing it you will

189
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,639
never do it what you need to do is

190
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
change the behavior

191
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,000
experience the impact on your

192
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,639
feeling by changing the behavior and

193
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,720
then take it from there

194
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
so i totally agree with you it's this

195
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,199
intense marriage of cognition emotion

196
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,080
and the actual actions and we almost

197
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,240
always are focused on you know the

198
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,000
cognitions and emotions

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
and we don't get people to do enough of

200
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,639
just focusing on changing behavior

201
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,680
okay so i think that's our first theme

202
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,080
which is this action orientation and

203
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,319
that plays into the embodiment and the

204
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,479
inactive aspects but also it has a kind

205
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,800
of corollary this like act first

206
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,840
principle

207
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,080
and that helps us perturb the causal

208
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,240
structure because if you're just looking

209
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
at the n equals one

210
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,080
observational experiment

211
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,880
well your consumption will be correlated

212
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,000
with

213
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,159
the price of oranges and then how do you

214
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,240
actually get at something deeper in the

215
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
world and that's sort of a relevant type

216
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
of intervention so action and also

217
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
action first is pretty

218
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,440
cool any other thoughts on that or we

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
can go in a different direction

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,320
well i would also say that this brings

221
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,560
to mind you know you asked about surveys

222
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
and things like that like i don't really

223
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,880
like

224
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
just personally like i don't really i

225
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,320
mean i think there's value for for like

226
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
survey studies but the problem is what

227
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,560
you really end up picking up there is

228
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,880
more about what the dominant cultural

229
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,680
narrative is that explains why people do

230
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,440
x y or z and you're not really tapping

231
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,399
into why they really do x y or z the

232
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,200
other thing i would say that you know

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
the way that we think about science is

234
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,959
that it's not

235
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,959
a single person's

236
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,160
life narrative but i really believe that

237
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,040
that that there's science when you

238
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
see a series of individuals over and

239
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,360
over again you hear their stories and

240
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
you can recognize very similar patterns

241
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,000
and then you do an intervention and you

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,279
see the results and you do that

243
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,200
repeatedly with many people over time

244
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,279
it's not like your classic you know a

245
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,560
clinical study but it feels really true

246
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,720
and real to me in a way that a lot of

247
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
times clinical studies don't or can't

248
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,680
capture some of the deeply nuanced

249
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,399
complex aspects of human behavior

250
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,120
i love the way you think about things

251
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
it's so crazy

252
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,079
now you're like

253
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,040
okay

254
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,560
i didn't know what was gonna

255
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
come next so um yeah

256
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,519
um all right so back to the book and

257
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,519
also to connect this to an active

258
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,959
inference theme so if decision making in

259
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,760
active inference like policy selection

260
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,079
the pi variable

261
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,560
the way that different possibilities are

262
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,839
ranked is not just by their reward or

263
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,320
their expected like value or utility

264
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
which would be common in a kind of

265
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,240
reinforcement learning or a reward

266
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
maximization framework but there's like

267
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,959
two components that go into that policy

268
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,839
selection there's a

269
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,000
epistemic knowledge oriented like

270
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,920
learning and curiosity intrinsic

271
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,560
motivation and then there's a pragmatic

272
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
so there is a utility element and the

273
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,040
ability to dial in on utility but also

274
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,600
there's the ability to kind of pull back

275
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
and when you were describing

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,480
your

277
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
book structure

278
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
certainly while reading it and as you

279
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,399
described it there was like an epistemic

280
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,680
component

281
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,839
neuroscience made accessible for those

282
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,440
who might not have the molecular

283
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,720
background but also like on page 48 with

284
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
a baseball game it's just fun for even

285
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
those who might have seen it in a

286
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,760
different

287
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,800
way and then there's the pragmatic part

288
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,600
which uses the stories um to kind of

289
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,560
connect

290
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
to useful tips so

291
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,800
where do you think epistemic and

292
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,160
pragmatic

293
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,240
value come into play in how you're

294
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
thinking about this

295
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,519
um

296
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,720
so

297
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,600
so epidemic is interesting um

298
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
and thank you for showing the examples

299
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,320
related to my book um because that helps

300
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
me also understand what you mean by

301
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,440
those terms

302
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,079
so what i find really interesting um

303
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,120
about

304
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,399
um

305
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,639
you know how to intrinsically motivate

306
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,839
people

307
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,760
with addiction

308
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,440
is that if they have a framework in

309
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,639
which to understand their behavior

310
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,120
it really does help people change their

311
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
behavior

312
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
it's really a framework and what's

313
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,079
fascinating to me is that neuroscience

314
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,279
talks and everything else walks

315
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,560
and by that i mean when i explain people

316
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,639
their behavior with a neuroscience

317
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,279
framework it carries a lot of currency

318
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,000
to people for people it feels real you

319
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,399
know it feels like it's almost like let

320
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,160
me just throw it out there like a modern

321
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
day religion like you could you could

322
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,360
use

323
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
a very different framework like you

324
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,880
could use a moral framework you could

325
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
use a philosophical framework

326
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
people don't resonate with that the same

327
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,279
way they resonate with the neuroscience

328
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,200
which is why i use the neuroscience

329
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
framework um so i think and

330
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,680
people will carry it around with them so

331
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,160
for example i use this extended metaphor

332
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
of a balance pleasure pain balance and

333
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,399
gremlins represent neuro adaptation and

334
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,240
they hop on the pain side of balance and

335
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
for example i had a reader write me and

336
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,600
say you know i'm trying really trying

337
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,519
really hard to quit smoking and whenever

338
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,959
i have an urge

339
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,639
to smoke a cigarette i just imagine

340
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,160
those little gremlins that was slowing

341
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,920
their adaptation hopping up and down in

342
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,839
the painting south i'm not you're not

343
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,079
gonna win you know i'm going to outlast

344
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,399
you um so that's really interesting

345
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,240
people will you know it's like a frame

346
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,880
we need those

347
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,560
epistemological frameworks that we

348
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,079
project onto the world to help us cope

349
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,680
make decisions

350
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,160
last you know in difficult situations

351
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,360
nice thanks um maybe even one way that

352
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,800
that person is experiencing their

353
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,519
um

354
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
experience the way that they're thinking

355
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,160
about their behavior and inference

356
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,920
it's um like

357
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,079
the the metaphor

358
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,079
that you're bringing the baseball game

359
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,399
the for the neurotransmitter synapse the

360
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,480
gremlins

361
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,880
even some of the more flow charts like

362
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,720
how different stages are related to each

363
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,399
other there's always like a person's

364
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,279
form

365
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,720
moving through it

366
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
and then that provides a lot of

367
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,399
accessibility

368
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,320
to enter into that space and like kind

369
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
of imagine counter factuals

370
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
which is our

371
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,959
human cognitive

372
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,399
expertise in a sense is not to memorize

373
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,279
11 digit numbers even

374
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,600
outside of ultra specific training it's

375
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,320
to

376
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,120
like

377
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
okay if the neurotransmitter like when i

378
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,760
looked at that example i thought well

379
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
where are the glia are they the crowd

380
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,839
are they like

381
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,279
what are they doing are they supporting

382
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,880
this pitch

383
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,399
and then there's that time scale but

384
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,240
then it already opens the door to

385
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,839
questions that the molecular

386
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,199
representation's like oh well then it's

387
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,880
a done deal right with the pre the post

388
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,199
synaptic

389
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,199
yeah right and i think

390
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,720
you know

391
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,320
um

392
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,720
obviously these metaphors are like a

393
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
gross oversimplification and get things

394
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,240
you know can't explain all of the

395
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,040
phenomena but as you say if we try to

396
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
explain it all and we get too

397
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,440
complicated then it feels to people like

398
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,000
memorizing a list of numbers so it has

399
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
to be true enough to represent the real

400
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,959
science but not so complex that people

401
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,519
can't take it with them and apply it in

402
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,680
their everyday everyday lives

403
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,600
and it also it takes it out of the the

404
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
kind of uncanny valley

405
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,279
an example there would be like the

406
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,839
ribosome it's a purple blob

407
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
and right well it's really not but it's

408
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,120
represented so commonly

409
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,959
and then that locks in but then at the

410
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,399
baseball game we know it's not it's a

411
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,839
different scale

412
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,160
so it's approachable and then anyone who

413
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,399
wants to look into the receptor slash

414
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,680
glove

415
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,239
yes yeah so um

416
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,519
okay

417
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,399
um that was kind of exploring

418
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,399
what was the second area which was like

419
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,320
the epistemic and the pragmatic like

420
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,759
always pairing

421
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,480
the knowledge gaining with the useful

422
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
and then recognizing that there's a time

423
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,040
for the more knowledge oriented maybe

424
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,959
there's a building on campus that's more

425
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,320
knowledge oriented and then also there's

426
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
a time and a place for what's useful

427
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
and maybe that's part of the

428
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,000
conversation that

429
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,560
do you want to see or how do you want to

430
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,079
see it with applied neuroscience

431
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,440
um

432
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,040
can you can you say what you mean a

433
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
little bit more i didn't quite get that

434
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,519
like connecting the epistemic and the

435
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,680
pragmatic the learning and research

436
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,440
oriented work

437
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
with the practical

438
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,000
tips

439
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,399
is that disconnect how could it be how

440
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,720
should it be how will we make that

441
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,839
connection like flexible and and work

442
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,480
yeah i mean there's obviously you know a

443
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,800
huge disconnect like this is this is the

444
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
problem we're sort of you know in this

445
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,280
ivory tower we're we're learning this

446
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,679
stuff we're acquiring this knowledge

447
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,160
we're working you know people you know

448
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
neuroscientists like you actually

449
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,039
adding new knowledge but yeah then the

450
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,240
question is how do we get that to people

451
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,119
to actually you know benefit them

452
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,839
um you know in their everyday lives and

453
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,119
also get it getting it to to students to

454
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,360
give them a sense of meaning and purpose

455
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
in their work so it doesn't feel so

456
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
incredibly disembodied from the world

457
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
that we live in

458
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,240
and the reasons behind

459
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,160
why we do i mean why do we want to

460
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
acquire this knowledge i mean you know

461
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,000
there's there's not just that i mean

462
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,840
maybe it is knowledge for its own sake

463
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
but i think deeply people want to feel

464
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,919
they're contributing making the world a

465
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,720
better place uh you know so i think

466
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,960
really important to to do we need to do

467
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,799
more to bring those things

468
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,160
together

469
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,679
um

470
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,440
i feel like you know

471
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,840
medical education

472
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
the so there's the pre-clinical years

473
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,520
and then there's the clinical years and

474
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,679
i know for me personally

475
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,240
like those clinical years were where i

476
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
first sort of felt like oh thank

477
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,720
goodness you know here i am interacting

478
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,440
with like real human beings and trying

479
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
to take this knowledge

480
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,280
and also i'm impatient i'm very

481
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,600
impatient so i feel like the human

482
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
interaction i could see more quickly

483
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,720
that i was making a difference i didn't

484
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,559
have the kind of patience that it takes

485
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,799
to be a scientist

486
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,320
in the sense that you are where you

487
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,679
really have to

488
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,160
have a deep deep faith that what you're

489
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,559
doing matters and that down the road you

490
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,400
will see it's you know it's it's

491
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,679
application

492
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,679
um unless you unless it's just the

493
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,880
beauty of it

494
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
you know for its own sake compels you

495
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
and draws you in but i'm ultimately a

496
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,760
very kind of pragmatic person and so i

497
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,919
and i'm also impatient so i need to see

498
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,240
that a lot a lot sooner but how about

499
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,080
you i'm sure you have many thoughts on

500
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,120
this i'd love to hear them

501
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,440
well yes very

502
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,280
interesting and as we were kind of

503
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,240
joking about before like

504
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,640
everyone especially in an age of

505
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,679
specialization abundance of specialisms

506
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
that being able to like connect across

507
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,760
them is really important like

508
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,840
having not had first-hand experience in

509
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
for example any of the

510
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,919
stories presented

511
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
and that's like the microcosm of the

512
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,919
discussion with

513
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
frameworks and

514
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
people's lives kind of meeting from the

515
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,520
ground up so

516
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,559
patience

517
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,240
that's an interesting thing and you

518
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,960
point into like how different people

519
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
seemingly display behaviorally different

520
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,720
amounts of patience and they probably

521
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
experience it differently too but also

522
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,960
it's patience for different things

523
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,840
right intermittent fasting over this

524
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,919
many hours or this many days

525
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,760
all the things might align for one

526
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,080
person at one time and it very

527
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
easy to be patient behaviorally versus

528
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,120
not versus some other strategy

529
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,919
and so trying to think about that in an

530
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,200
active inference way it's like in active

531
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,880
inference the question is always about

532
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
what is the decision

533
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
right now

534
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,320
or inference and action so how should i

535
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,559
be perceiving and learning

536
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,919
and acting in the moment

537
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,880
given

538
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,520
the long horizon or the the stated

539
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,200
horizon so

540
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,520
what is going to be the best move

541
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
in this chess move

542
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
given the kind of uncertainty about the

543
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
future of the game include including

544
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,520
like the uncertainty about what the

545
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,720
other side will do or something like

546
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,640
that or even uncertainty over one's own

547
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,159
actions

548
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,320
and then patience is like well

549
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,200
what

550
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,919
is happening when the best action

551
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,200
selection

552
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,600
is to

553
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,159
not engage with something

554
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,080
so what is it that actually

555
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,000
values

556
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
for something that is valuable like it's

557
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,960
easy to be patient for something that's

558
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,000
just a purely negative experience right

559
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,640
i'll just i'll hold off not interested

560
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,840
but being patient we kind of are

561
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
applying to something where it's like

562
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,039
i do want to

563
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,640
call this person before the time i said

564
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,080
i would call them but i'm getting

565
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,720
impatient or like i want this research

566
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,280
project to be over i wish that this was

567
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
faster which everyone involved in

568
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,159
research or maybe analogously like it

569
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,080
would be awesome if myself or if this

570
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,320
patients were

571
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,960
seemingly on their recovery

572
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,120
faster or something

573
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,240
so

574
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,600
how does it come to be that sometimes

575
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,760
we wait in the moment

576
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,559
and other other times we don't

577
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,640
and like is it okay or when should we do

578
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
stuff

579
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,760
yeah

580
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
um

581
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,440
gosh so much there

582
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,280
so let's start with your question how

583
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,159
how does it come to be how how do we i

584
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:00,880
mean

585
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,760
you know

586
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,679
i quote you in the book saying that the

587
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,159
world is uh century rich and causal poor

588
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,400
and i i just love that quote because it

589
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,720
wraps up in this night nice little

590
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,919
package

591
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,120
um

592
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,320
the the

593
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,799
the problem with highly reinforcing

594
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,480
drugs and behaviors

595
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,280
which is that in the moment they feel

596
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,679
like the right thing and they feel good

597
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,440
but the long-term consequences of

598
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,600
repeated use is to get us to a

599
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,559
potentially very dark place

600
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,080
but we don't necessarily see the

601
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
connection between those two things

602
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,919
right so how is it that we come to see

603
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,000
that connection

604
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,880
and i think as a psychiatrist having

605
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,280
listened to thousands and thousands of

606
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
people's narrative life stories over

607
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,720
time that one of the ways that we get

608
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,000
there is actually the autobiographical

609
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,520
self narrative

610
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,559
that that that words are tools

611
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,440
and that those tools are a way not just

612
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,919
to organize past experience but actually

613
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,480
create road maps for the future

614
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,400
so it's not just

615
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
um you know

616
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,480
the the way that we tell our stories

617
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,919
about our lives

618
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,039
are very very impactful i think puko or

619
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,600
somebody like that said said that that

620
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
autobiographical narrative is the only

621
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,159
way that we have to document live time

622
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,480
which is really really interesting like

623
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
for all of the cool technology that we

624
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,360
have the only thing that documents live

625
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,840
time is

626
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,440
storytelling so and i've seen this again

627
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
and again when my patients come in and

628
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
they tell an autobiographical narrative

629
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,240
in which they are constantly the victim

630
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,720
of the world and other people and that's

631
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,159
why they're addicted

632
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,880
those people are not going to get better

633
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,919
and part of what i need to do over time

634
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,000
is to move them toward what i consider

635
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,640
to be a more truthful narrative which is

636
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,400
that there's always something that we

637
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
have contributed to the problem you know

638
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,559
maybe we just showed up and that was our

639
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,360
contribution but it's never

640
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
always entirely somebody else's fault

641
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,640
and for people who get into a sustained

642
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
and robust recovery

643
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
you can hear the difference in their

644
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,760
autobiographical narratives and one of

645
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,360
the fundamental differences they're able

646
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
to tolerate the shame

647
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,159
that comes with acknowledging their

648
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,480
character defects and the mistakes that

649
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,120
they made and what they contributed to

650
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,520
their messed up situation which is just

651
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,720
basically closer to the truth so telling

652
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
the truth is really important telling

653
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,279
truthful stories is really important and

654
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,480
i think that those stories actually

655
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,880
become the tool by which

656
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
we are able to

657
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
remain patient in the face of you know

658
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
delayed gratification

659
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,640
that's what keeps us able to

660
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,960
not to do something that we should do in

661
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,039
the moment but don't feel like doing or

662
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,279
to abstain from doing something that we

663
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,200
feel like doing in the moment but

664
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,400
shouldn't do

665
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,279
um and you know whether that story takes

666
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,919
a framework based on neuroscience or

667
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,880
whether there's a religious or spiritual

668
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,159
framework like

669
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,559
um you know my reward will come in

670
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,919
another life

671
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
there are many different ways to you

672
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,200
know build that story uh but that story

673
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
has got to be the thing that allows that

674
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
person to kind of you know delay this

675
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,720
gratification in the service of

676
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,960
um you know

677
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,880
living a more flourishing life

678
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,919
i'd like to ask a follow-up question

679
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,159
from the chat and then give a remark

680
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,440
neuropixel nice screen name asks

681
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,520
how can we learn to build patients for

682
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,400
healthy habits

683
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,679
okay how can we learn to build that's so

684
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,919
so good so i think there are a couple uh

685
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,679
there are a couple

686
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,520
stages

687
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,240
first um

688
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,120
it's to recognize that when you first

689
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,799
stop doing

690
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,559
a bad habit

691
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,400
you will suffer more so that the initial

692
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,120
your initial experience will be

693
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,640
increased pain

694
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,520
not

695
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,760
like immediate reward from stopping that

696
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,760
bad habit so i think so that like

697
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
setting up expectations in that way but

698
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
that the longer you can go abstaining

699
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,799
from that bad habit

700
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,760
the the faster you will get to that

701
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,720
place

702
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
where you

703
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,880
begin to feel better and you don't miss

704
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,279
that bad habit in fact you you start to

705
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,640
reap the benefits remember you have to

706
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,320
know it's going to get worse before it

707
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,240
gets better

708
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,760
everybody talks about practicing

709
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,600
mindfulness and what that is but

710
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,039
actually there's almost no better

711
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,799
opportunity for practicing mindfulness

712
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,960
than to give up something that's bad for

713
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,799
you that you really like a bad habit

714
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,640
because what will happen is it'll stir

715
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,039
up all kinds it's very disruptive

716
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,559
and i think then the ability to learn

717
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,559
that you are not your thoughts and

718
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,480
emotions but that you can stand some

719
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,039
distance from that and not

720
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,120
respond to that but just objectively

721
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,799
observe those things

722
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,360
is is really important

723
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,399
um

724
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,360
i think

725
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,520
do it giving up a bad hat bad habit with

726
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,919
other people so that you're not doing it

727
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,039
alone is really important um because you

728
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,520
can then you know go to other people and

729
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,679
and sort of suffer together

730
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,520
and then i think meaning making is

731
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,760
really important so to give up the bad

732
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,919
habit so that you yourself can feel

733
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,480
better but also what is the

734
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
what is the greater meaning

735
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,799
of abstaining uh from that thing and

736
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,440
often it's a consumpting process and you

737
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
know a greater meeting could be saving

738
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,600
the planet right i'm doing this for me

739
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,439
but it's also good for the world

740
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,720
thanks for the answer so yeah

741
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,880
one of those words you mentioned was

742
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,399
expectations

743
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,200
which is a core idea in

744
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,240
bayesian statistics and a long history

745
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,279
of like bayesian brain predictive coding

746
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,760
predictive processing many different

747
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
approaches to

748
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,679
neuroscience behavior and so on and

749
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,399
active inference does build on that and

750
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,159
uses the idea of expectations

751
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,000
as far as expected futures and things

752
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,320
like that a lot and so it's interesting

753
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,760
to think about the role of dopamine and

754
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,799
like you said set up for this because

755
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,799
then it'll basically go that way and

756
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,720
you'll stay on track whereas if you

757
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,640
expect to go faster or different you're

758
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,880
going to feel like worse or anxious or

759
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,360
uncertain about how to proceed and it's

760
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,840
totally modeled in an active inference

761
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,720
way

762
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,039
by thinking about like the estimate is

763
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,520
not how many points how many are am i

764
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,159
getting it's how many points relative to

765
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,080
how many points i expect

766
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
and then one can be doing better or

767
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,080
worse or as expected

768
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,320
and if things are going well there's

769
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,559
positive valence if things are going as

770
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,039
expected it's like neutral valence and

771
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,640
then things are going poor there's like

772
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,120
anxiety and negative valence right and

773
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
so that is one way where

774
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
moving from like a reward only

775
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,960
perspective to be like well yes there's

776
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,760
an expectation of reward and precision

777
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,520
along that path

778
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,640
will be pleasurable or neutral but it's

779
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
not going to be like winning winning

780
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,039
winning it'll be like neutral with

781
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,039
oscillation around neutral

782
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,480
right

783
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,520
yeah and i can tell you you know in the

784
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
like the lived experience of treating

785
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,440
patients this is absolutely key so one

786
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,600
of the things that we do in our clinic

787
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
um is to help people

788
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,679
get off of chronic opioids like you know

789
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,640
oxycontin or vicodin or norco or chronic

790
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,880
benzodiazepines like xanax

791
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
thallium atom

792
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,480
and

793
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,600
you know

794
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,039
you would think this is not that

795
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,919
complicated but actually

796
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,000
a lot of patients are looking for help

797
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,799
with this and can't find it and they

798
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,000
find it in our clinic and the one thing

799
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,399
that i would say we provide

800
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,399
which is the real value is to

801
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,440
establish appropriate expectations

802
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,760
because what happens is they'll go see a

803
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,440
doctor and they'll say i need to get off

804
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,960
a xanax or i really want to get off the

805
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,120
xanax and the doctor says oh that's easy

806
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,200
you know just go down by you know

807
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,760
uh you know 50 of your starting dose

808
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,679
over the next week and you'll be fine

809
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,200
and the patients

810
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,039
do that or same thing with their opioid

811
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,919
they do that and they're in horrific

812
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,679
psychological and physical pain because

813
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,200
they're in withdrawal or maybe they even

814
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,880
have a seizure right

815
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,679
so

816
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,519
their experience is totally worse or

817
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,000
much worse than what their doctor

818
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,240
predicted for the doctor is like the

819
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,640
respected authority so then they feel

820
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,200
angry they also feel betrayed they also

821
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
feel like they're weird like why why am

822
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,600
i they come to us and my patients have

823
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,279
told me again and again doctor argue the

824
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,000
most important thing you said to me when

825
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,559
we went down by my opioid or my benzo by

826
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,360
a little bit and we go very slowly

827
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,840
is that i would feel worse before i feel

828
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,720
better

829
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,600
and i really do i way emphasize that so

830
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,000
that if they go and they taper and it's

831
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,279
not even

832
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,519
it's not as bad as what i then they're

833
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,080
like happy it's like you know you told

834
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,679
me it was going to be bad for a while

835
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,840
until my body really recruited it

836
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,000
re-equilibrated and it was bad but it

837
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,919
wasn't like i could do it you know so

838
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,399
that setting expectations it's really

839
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,640
really important like in the real world

840
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,679
it's almost like there's a wanting

841
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,799
for

842
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,799
reduction or sobriety

843
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,559
but actually they don't like it

844
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,880
behaviorally not on the psychological

845
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,159
what are they thinking what does the

846
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,440
survey say

847
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,679
but actually like well you don't like

848
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,080
the green room if you aren't spending

849
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,399
your time in it it's how we would say it

850
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,720
about the other kinds of

851
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,240
animals so it's kind of like interesting

852
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,840
like where do we like something but not

853
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,720
want it what is dopamine and other

854
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,559
neurotransmitters doing then how about

855
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,080
the situations where we do or don't

856
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,000
have patience like those are such great

857
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,080
questions and entry points for our own

858
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,440
life and for

859
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,360
research and that's like kind of the

860
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,120
bridge is

861
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,799
the introduction of the paper or the

862
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,360
context for the grant is like kind of

863
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,559
could be

864
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,880
that bridge but then sometimes it

865
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,720
is more about how it appears rather than

866
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,240
how it is

867
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,039
yeah and i think the variable of time is

868
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,320
so important um for all of these things

869
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,120
like if i mean you know we can sign up

870
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,600
for a lot of suffering if you know it's

871
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,559
time limited right like okay i can do

872
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,799
this because dr lemke said i would feel

873
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,000
like crap for two weeks and i would

874
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
start to feel better and so you know you

875
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
can hang in there for that or or

876
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,240
whatever you know the the intervention

877
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,840
is that that makes a huge difference

878
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,799
so

879
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,159
returning to

880
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:16,880
the

881
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,080
quote on

882
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,760
page 75

883
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,320
about uh the world is sensory rich and

884
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,640
causal poor you know

885
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,039
personal communication uh

886
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,600
when 2018 because i think there's a very

887
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,799
interesting difference or something and

888
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,399
how i'm thinking about it now

889
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,399
oh interesting okay i'd love to hear

890
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,279
that

891
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,120
so i think that was

892
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
when i was just beginning to learn about

893
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,480
active inference and free energy

894
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,320
principle and bayesian brain and i was

895
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,640
thinking well wow it's not just like

896
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,559
signal detection on

897
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,640
the pixels or whatever

898
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,720
there's the causal inference and then

899
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,559
that's like you followed up like we know

900
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,159
the donut tastes good in the moment but

901
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,760
we are less aware that eating a donut

902
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,519
every day for a month adds five pounds

903
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,600
to our waistline

904
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,120
we get that understanding through

905
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,799
personal experience

906
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,640
relationships

907
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,720
science research

908
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,480
we build that understanding that

909
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,639
expectation of cause in and then all of

910
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,239
a sudden our behavior is like more

911
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,040
natural to switch in the moment so

912
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,440
i was thinking you know starry eyed

913
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,800
graduate student

914
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
sensory rich in causal poor i think now

915
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,480
i might say

916
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,119
sensory poor and causal poor

917
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,159
because

918
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,000
the sensory part

919
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,960
is

920
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,239
of extremely limited

921
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,560
frequency only some chemicals that we

922
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,839
can detect only some sounds that we hear

923
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,320
even within a domain

924
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,960
we're not always paying attention

925
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,918
our blind spot is evidence that we're in

926
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,639
a generative model of vision because the

927
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,679
sensory data is sparse and noisy and

928
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,960
blurry

929
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,199
and so it's like in the world that

930
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,680
sensory poor and causal poor

931
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,160
we can finally disengage from this like

932
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,480
watching a movie

933
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,560
perspective and it's like it's so

934
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
generative it's so much about our

935
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,000
expectations of the cause and also we're

936
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,400
not just watching a movie a vision and

937
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,359
we're expecting expecting and generating

938
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,839
even that

939
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,320
yeah so powerful i think this is really

940
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,160
why i i think there's so much power in

941
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
our self-narratives

942
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,079
because i think those self-narratives

943
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,800
that we project onto the world

944
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,359
absolutely impact

945
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,359
what we perceive

946
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,839
i just yesterday i was meeting with a

947
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,800
very beloved uh patient of mine

948
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,680
who happens to be you know a a

949
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,000
a a graduate student

950
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,119
um you know who has had a really

951
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,920
mixed experience in his lab

952
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,040
and feels like

953
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,800
he hasn't many friends and nobody likes

954
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,079
him

955
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,119
and

956
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,839
also feels like um

957
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,680
like they're all jerks and they're kind

958
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,520
of out to get him

959
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,440
and what i tried to get him to see

960
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,119
is that

961
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,280
he has a narrative and a vision that he

962
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,359
superimposes on the world such that all

963
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,240
he remembers or appreciates is like the

964
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,200
slights right and he doesn't he doesn't

965
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,040
have access to the other things because

966
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,800
he's so entrenched

967
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,920
in this particular version of the world

968
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,359
um

969
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,160
just to give like a personal example

970
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,240
um you know i talk about in the book my

971
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,000
comp very complicated relationship with

972
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,359
my mom

973
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,920
and how part of the healing for my

974
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,400
relationship was to get out of this

975
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,280
place where i'm always saying how how

976
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,960
terrible she is

977
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
and instead appreciating really the

978
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,599
great things about her which are many

979
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,760
and also you know what i've contributed

980
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,240
to the problem but before i could do

981
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,359
that

982
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,520
i was engaging in behaviors that just

983
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,280
reinforced my worldview and i'll give

984
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,200
you a very tangible example um

985
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,240
you know

986
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,400
one of the things that that you know had

987
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,160
bothered me about her was that i would

988
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,720
email her and she wouldn't respond to my

989
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,640
email in a timely or what i felt was

990
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,599
appropriate fashion

991
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,520
and this came up at one point where i

992
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,800
emailed about her about something that

993
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,320
was really important i felt it was

994
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
really important and she didn't respond

995
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,680
and i gave her a week and then i gave

996
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,760
her a month and i gave her three months

997
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,000
and i got angrier and angrier as time

998
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,760
went on and you know railed about it to

999
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,599
my husband say see this is exactly what

1000
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,119
i'm talking about

1001
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,119
and then you know i was eventually just

1002
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,400
able to just forget about it and

1003
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,839
whatever move on

1004
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,920
and then i was on email and kind of

1005
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,520
looking through i don't know kind of

1006
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,680
cleaning up my email and discovered that

1007
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,960
my original email that i had sent to her

1008
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,720
that i was so angry that she hadn't

1009
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,960
responded to was actually in my draft

1010
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,839
box it had never been sent

1011
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,520
and i think there are so many ways in

1012
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,839
which we do that where where we don't

1013
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,520
even get the opportunity to see it like

1014
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,800
it was just in this case i did but we we

1015
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
sort of do these things to sort of you

1016
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,160
know hold on to this world new which

1017
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,560
typically has other people being the bad

1018
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,200
actors and it doesn't force us to look

1019
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,440
at ourselves

1020
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,640
thanks so

1021
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,160
one

1022
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,720
interesting piece there is like

1023
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,040
we might be totally on board for

1024
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,359
the past being a reconstruction in the

1025
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,760
present the generative aspect of memory

1026
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,359
and then it's also easy to believe in

1027
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,359
the generative aspect of the future it

1028
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,720
hasn't happened yet we don't know about

1029
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,079
it and then

1030
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,280
as per that predictive coding type of

1031
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,520
like sensory generative model

1032
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,000
we're also now casting so it's like the

1033
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,599
past the present the future you know the

1034
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,640
three

1035
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,800
areas that we know about they're all

1036
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,119
generative so there is reception of

1037
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,320
signals

1038
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,680
but also like all of those are

1039
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,839
generative and then you pointed to like

1040
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,160
this idea of kind of a cognitive degree

1041
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,280
of freedom

1042
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,800
in our narrative

1043
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,720
and so we might even model that as like

1044
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,359
an action or a movement in a narrative

1045
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,480
space

1046
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,359
and so

1047
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,240
how

1048
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,400
do we make appropriate actions in

1049
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,280
narrative space because do we just say

1050
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,200
okay graduate student no

1051
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
they're awesome

1052
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,760
or how do we know

1053
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,119
what to say and how to actually

1054
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,880
yeah so so this is a student of mine

1055
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,000
that i mentioned this patient of mine

1056
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,760
who happens to be a graduate student so

1057
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,920
he's about to you know finish up and go

1058
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,119
on to a postdoc and i actually suggested

1059
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,040
that to him as sort of a as an

1060
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,560
experiment right because i often talk

1061
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,599
about this as an experiment i said you

1062
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,560
know as you move on to your next lab why

1063
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,960
don't you try an experiment where you

1064
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,000
just

1065
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,359
take as

1066
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,240
like an a priori supposition that

1067
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,599
everybody in the lab loves you

1068
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,599
that that that they want the best for

1069
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,240
you that they are your friends

1070
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,880
and anytime you have like a paranoid

1071
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,079
thought or a negative thought about them

1072
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,400
really critically appraise that and

1073
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,880
really even doubt that and fact check it

1074
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,359
or reality test it with somebody else

1075
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,040
that you know

1076
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,200
and i think through that he might be

1077
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
able through iterative processes because

1078
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,800
it's such a feed-forward cycle the

1079
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,720
problem is when we're paranoid or

1080
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,359
suspicious of other people they sense it

1081
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,040
and they weigh back off and then as soon

1082
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,440
as they back off we get more paranoid as

1083
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,800
we should because they've given us the

1084
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,319
signal that they've backed up and then

1085
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,560
that you know it's a reinforcing cycle

1086
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,520
so if we kind of discard that primary

1087
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,319
narrative and then act in the world as

1088
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,920
if right

1089
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,880
not and not in a fake way but as if

1090
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,640
certain things were true that we didn't

1091
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,119
necessarily believe up front and i have

1092
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,400
to ask my patients to do this all the

1093
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,079
time especially when my patients who are

1094
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,280
addicted

1095
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,200
and whose lives are being destroyed by

1096
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,560
their addiction

1097
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,680
i say to them you have to imagine and

1098
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,520
essentially have faith

1099
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,400
that

1100
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,880
giving up your drug of choice will lead

1101
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,400
to a better life

1102
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
right now what you see is two choices

1103
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,680
you see continuing to use and

1104
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,560
or stop using and being miserable and

1105
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
i'm holding out to you the possibility

1106
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,119
of stop using and being

1107
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,760
happy or being happier than you are

1108
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,920
while you're using but it is a leap of

1109
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,800
faith

1110
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,640
because you have to are going to have to

1111
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,200
wait a long time and do a lot of things

1112
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,920
where really you don't feel that at all

1113
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
you just have to believe that it's true

1114
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,240
and approach every day as if that is

1115
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,119
true

1116
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,359
the other thing i talk about in my book

1117
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,359
which is maybe a little bit of a paradox

1118
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,440
given what i just said is this idea of

1119
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,920
radical honesty and how important

1120
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,240
truth-telling is to this process again

1121
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,079
because truth-telling is important to

1122
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,599
build true narratives and true

1123
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,079
narratives are important to be able to

1124
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,280
know how to make decisions going forward

1125
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,960
in our lives

1126
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,200
and it's a small thing but you know my

1127
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,640
patients will say and patients in

1128
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,880
recovery will say i can't lie about

1129
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,280
anything when i was using i of course

1130
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,960
lied about my drug use but i also lied

1131
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,640
about stuff that it didn't even matter

1132
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,079
and my favorite anecdote is my patient

1133
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,520
who's now in really sustained recovery

1134
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
doing great he says you know when i was

1135
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,920
using i was in the lying habit if i was

1136
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,680
at mcdonald's and a patient called and

1137
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,200
said hey where are you i'd say hey i'm a

1138
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
burger king if i was a bird king my

1139
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,800
patient my friend would call it say yeah

1140
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,119
i'm in mcdonald's so it got to be like

1141
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,960
this work like like lies about

1142
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,560
everything so part of his recovery and

1143
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,000
this is what i actually prescribe to

1144
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
patients is radical truth telling like

1145
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,359
you cannot tell a lie about anything

1146
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,400
because that telling the truth i think

1147
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,680
helps us

1148
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,520
first of all it's it's cognitively

1149
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,640
effortful but secondly it really grounds

1150
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,240
us in what is true and real and helps us

1151
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,880
in an iterative fashion stay closer to

1152
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,680
that to build these truthful narratives

1153
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,359
which i think are really important so

1154
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,560
there's a bit of a paradox there because

1155
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,240
i'm saying on the one hand

1156
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,240
pretend stuff that you don't feel is

1157
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,119
true

1158
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,720
but which might be true which you can't

1159
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,040
see but at the same time be really

1160
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,480
honest about like your daily actions

1161
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,119
nice here here were some of the active

1162
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,359
themes that i kind of heard there

1163
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,480
action as a self-fulfilling prophecy and

1164
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,440
action as being in the business of

1165
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,280
acquiring evidence for a given

1166
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,000
generative model that's a big theme and

1167
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,280
also in order to switch action policies

1168
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,560
there has to be

1169
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,040
a transient suppression of precision on

1170
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,440
the policy like if we're sitting down we

1171
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,200
have to transiently

1172
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,359
implicitly or explicitly believe that it

1173
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,200
could be a different way otherwise we'll

1174
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,560
just continue to get evidence that we're

1175
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,640
sitting down

1176
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,920
and then

1177
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,560
um it's a very

1178
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,560
active way to kind of escape that

1179
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,880
gaslight paradox

1180
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,319
so

1181
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,480
you were talking about setting a

1182
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,680
confident prior for the next epoch

1183
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,280
and so that just

1184
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,640
today you're low on how you believe

1185
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,640
others think of you and uncertain or

1186
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,680
you're low and precise but great it's

1187
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,040
actually all in the past now

1188
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,680
behaviorally and then in your next

1189
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,800
endeavor

1190
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,359
you could just try

1191
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,440
starting higher in an unknown future but

1192
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,720
just peg it

1193
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,040
higher and try to be more precise which

1194
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,960
is going to look like

1195
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,720
being more skeptical looking for

1196
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,560
evidence on the upside

1197
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
and so it's like

1198
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,640
instead of focusing on the past and

1199
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,280
trying to re-narrativize the past

1200
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,200
we can include the behavior of the past

1201
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,760
which for sure is inalterable

1202
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,440
into a prospective narrative of the

1203
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,839
future that makes actions like patience

1204
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:46,880
maybe

1205
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,640
more plausible

1206
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,200
yeah love it um i mean dislikes love

1207
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,280
that science speak it's so exciting and

1208
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,680
it maps so well to like you know these

1209
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,520
kinds of aphorisms

1210
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,040
or sort of

1211
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
the approach that we take in psychiatry

1212
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,200
and psychotherapy using very different

1213
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,240
language and that's always really

1214
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,560
exciting and it just reminds me so much

1215
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,280
of

1216
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,119
you know the alcoholics anonymous saying

1217
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,599
of taking it one day at a time which is

1218
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,240
so fundamental for this whole process

1219
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,760
because what happens when we take it one

1220
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,000
day at a time it means that we wake up

1221
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,040
and we say the past is the past

1222
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,440
the future is the future

1223
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,760
all i need to do today

1224
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,760
is focus on what i can do today

1225
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,520
to make my life

1226
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,079
and your life and our lives a little bit

1227
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,119
better without putting too heavy on me

1228
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,280
like i mean i'm not going to go and like

1229
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,160
save people in ukraine obviously but

1230
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,000
what are the things that i can do i can

1231
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,560
pick up that piece of garbage so it kind

1232
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,599
of narrows the time scope it forces us

1233
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,240
to be in the here and now which also

1234
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,280
expands our senses so that we can take

1235
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,920
in more actual data so that i'm not like

1236
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,400
ruminating and cogitating on my own you

1237
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,880
know sort of self-involved you know

1238
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,400
problems which is where

1239
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,079
like you know most of us spend a lot of

1240
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,440
our headspace i don't know why we do

1241
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,480
that but we do but instead i noticed

1242
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,240
that there's like a reese's peanut

1243
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,560
butter cup wrapper on the ground i could

1244
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,880
pick that up right that's one thing that

1245
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,760
or i i could notice that i have the urge

1246
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,440
to lie about why i'm late for this

1247
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,319
meeting

1248
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,640
but i could not i could choose not to do

1249
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,160
that i can choose that today that's kind

1250
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,839
of exciting

1251
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,680
like to me that sort of opens up all

1252
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,599
kinds of possibilities because i'm not

1253
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,079
future catastrophizing i'm also not

1254
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,240
future grandiosing you know where they

1255
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,079
like oh i have to do this i have to do

1256
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,680
that or i'm not going to be good enough

1257
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,599
i'm not ruminating on my pastels i'm

1258
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,560
saying you know what today is the only

1259
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,880
unit of time that i really need to focus

1260
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,880
on and a string i always say to my

1261
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,760
patients a string of good days makes a

1262
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,359
string of good weeks and a string of

1263
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,680
good weeks it's a string of good months

1264
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,119
and before you know it you've got a

1265
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,040
couple good decades and that's a

1266
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,280
lifetime and that's a life well lived

1267
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,800
which is what we all want

1268
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,520
and to even bring in one other active

1269
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,680
term the affordance which is the

1270
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,160
capacity for action which comes from the

1271
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,960
ecological psychology field

1272
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,680
the affordance is relational and so it's

1273
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,960
about like the motivation by that entity

1274
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,800
and the agency that they feel they do or

1275
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,400
don't have from a narrative perspective

1276
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,280
and the affordances that the niche

1277
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,520
scaffolds and provides for them or not

1278
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
and also the narratives that the niche

1279
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,760
provides or not and then like that

1280
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,680
is what is going to be engaged in that

1281
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,920
behavioral decision in the moment and

1282
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,599
then you also talk about like adding

1283
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,640
friction as like a pragmatic strategy

1284
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,400
that i'm sure everyone has experimented

1285
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,400
with variously on different

1286
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,000
facets but it's like it's an example

1287
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,359
about

1288
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,880
the pragmatic

1289
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,839
tips

1290
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,480
but also they're connected to behavioral

1291
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,240
and cognitive modeling

1292
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,280
in this

1293
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,520
perhaps even formal way

1294
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,559
yeah

1295
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,480
exactly

1296
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,720
um well

1297
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,599
we covered many fun topics like just a

1298
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,520
few that i kind of wrote down where

1299
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,880
patients

1300
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,040
i guess the patients who you clinically

1301
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
see and having patience in the moment

1302
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,000
and then

1303
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,480
uh expectations

1304
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,520
action

1305
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,680
and taking action as a first

1306
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,359
perturbation then the dopamine as reward

1307
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,079
and

1308
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,160
epistemic and pragmatic value and

1309
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,079
there's a lot of interesting research on

1310
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,640
active inference and dopamine signaling

1311
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,359
and then a lot of active terms like

1312
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:45,200
action priors confidence precision

1313
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,040
narrative information

1314
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,680
like all the amazing terms and just very

1315
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,559
fun and also powerful book and a lot of

1316
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,960
great material

1317
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,880
thank you daniel this has been

1318
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,680
really fun as i knew it would be as

1319
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,920
talking to you is always

1320
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,040
illuminating and

1321
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,119
surprising in

1322
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,200
fun and positive way

1323
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,960
i always learn

1324
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,880
then i have

1325
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
so much respect for your

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,359
you know intelligence and creativity

1327
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,960
it's always exciting

1328
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,359
thank you and hope to talk to you and

1329
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,559
any others from the farm in the future

1330
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,640
sounds great

1331
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,440
bye see ya
