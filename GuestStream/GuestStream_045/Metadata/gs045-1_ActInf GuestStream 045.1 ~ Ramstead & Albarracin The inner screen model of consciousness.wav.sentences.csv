6570	7614	1	DANIEL FRIEDMAN	0.99868	Hello and welcome.
7732	10718	2	Daniel	0.97277	It's June 19, 2023.
10884	17534	3	Daniel	0.5925	We're going to have a presentation and a discussion with Maxwell Ramstead and Mahault Albarracin here.
17652	21050	4	Daniel	0.99953	So thank you, Maxwell and Mahault, for joining.
21130	26482	5	Daniel	0.99988	Looking forward to your presentation, setting some of the context, and then thank you to all of our guests.
26586	33010	6	Daniel	0.9775	You'll have an opportunity to introduce yourself and give some background when you first give reflections.
33090	35634	7	Daniel	0.584	So on to the slides.
35682	36630	8	Daniel	0.99965	Maxwell.
37130	37762	9	MAXWELL RAMSTEAD	0.93235	Excellent.
37826	44586	10	Maxwell	0.99996	Well, maybe now and I can just briefly reintroduce ourselves for those of us watching at home.
44768	48086	11	Maxwell	0.99765	So, hey, folks, my name is Maxwell Ramstead.
48198	52270	12	Maxwell	1	I am the director of Research versus AI.
52850	60750	13	Maxwell	0.58	I am a scholar in the tradition of active inference and an expert on the Free Energy Principle.
61410	61822	14	Maxwell	0.63964	Yeah.
61876	63194	15	Maxwell	0.51	And Mahault,
63242	64400	16	Maxwell	0.99974	would you please?
65570	66222	17	MAHAULT ALBARRACIN	0.99988	Sure.
66356	67086	18	Mahault	0.97779	So.
67268	68862	19	Mahault	0.99999	My name is Mahault Albarracin.
68926	70686	20	Mahault	1	I work at Versus with Maxwell.
70718	77874	21	Mahault	0.48287	I'm Director of Product for Research and development, but I'm also doing a PhD in cognitive computing.
78002	85206	22	Mahault	1	I worked in social sciences and in artificial intelligence in the artificial intelligence field.
85308	100540	23	Mahault	1	And I've specifically tried to apply active inference to more socially grounded questions and sometimes more abstract and representational questions, diving all the way down to the philosophy that can be attached to it.
103180	104440	24	Maxwell	0.99987	Thank you, Mal.
104880	108076	25	Maxwell	0.9841	So, yeah, I'm very pleased to present this work.
108258	117580	26	Maxwell	0.99995	Today, Mao and I will be discussing our new preprint called the Inner Screen Model of Consciousness.
117660	126240	27	Maxwell	1	And it is about basically an application of the Free Energy Principle to the problem, the conundrum of consciousness.
127460	140890	28	Maxwell	0.92576	So just to give a little bit of background and now I'll just be walking through the slides, if at any point you want to jump in and add complete correct, please feel free to do so.
142220	147944	29	Maxwell	0.99998	This is work that started in late last year and continued throughout the year.
147982	152010	30	Maxwell	0.79248	It's preoccupied us quite a bit, actually, over the last while.
152540	171132	31	Maxwell	0.83954	Mao and I are the lead authors on this, what has now become a series of papers, with one more preprint coming out, hopefully before the end of the month, and another in the works, hopefully before the end of the year, with the same core group of authors.
171276	179300	32	Maxwell	0.9799	So obviously Mao, as well as Adam Saffron, Alex Keefer, Brendan Klein, Chris Fields and Karl Friston.
179640	184128	33	Maxwell	0.63	And the follow up papers include a bunch of other authors.
184224	192230	34	Maxwell	0.55667	So we've been working with some pretty cool folks on this, folks listed here and others.
193240	194036	35	Maxwell	0.58748	Yeah.
194218	204468	36	Maxwell	0.62903	So the overall aim across the two or three papers is to present something like a minimal, unifying model of consciousness premised on the Free Energy Principle.
204564	217680	37	Maxwell	0.99998	In the paper that we're discussing today, we are presenting, as I was intimating a moment ago, a model of consciousness that follows directly from applying the Free Energy Principle to well understood human neurophysiology.
218660	224512	38	Maxwell	1	The take home message of today's talk is that, well, let me take one step back.
224566	233904	39	Maxwell	1	There has been a lot of discussion in the literature over the last decade about whether the Free Energy Principle has anything unique to teach us about consciousness.
234032	237060	40	Maxwell	1	And there have been responses pro and contra.
237960	242224	41	Maxwell	0.97	And I think that the question up until recently was just unsettled.
242352	245930	42	Maxwell	0.97069	We would like to suggest a positive response to that question.
246540	257768	43	Maxwell	0.97	And as such, one of the take home messages is that actually, yes, a model of consciousness can be directly derived from the Free Energy Principle applied to explain known neuroanatomy.
257864	274400	44	Maxwell	0.77	And I guess the kind of technical message, the technical part of the takeaway is that consciousness has or is isomorphic to a nested holographic mathematical structure.
275380	279990	45	Maxwell	0.65185	So this sounds like a mouthful, might sound a little crazy.
280520	283780	46	Maxwell	0.99995	We are going to unpack this presently.
286200	288710	47	Maxwell	0.9012	Now, did you want to add anything to that?
289560	291240	48	Mahault	0.99972	No, all good.
291390	292360	49	Maxwell	0.63052	Excellent.
292860	311560	50	Maxwell	0.50425	So the original paper that we wrote turned into, like a 24,000 word monstrosity of a paper, and it was elephantine both in the sense that it was very large and also in the sense that of the soupy parable of the blind men and the elephant.
311640	322800	51	Maxwell	0.99989	What we're trying to do is in some sense, identify a parsimonious mathematical structure that underwrites the different accounts of consciousness that have been developed based on the Free Energy Principle.
323220	326028	52	Maxwell	0.99726	I'll spare you the original paper structure.
326204	331204	53	Maxwell	1	I said a moment ago that we were developing a minimal unifying model.
331322	340664	54	Maxwell	0.99975	This is a notion that was proposed by our friend and colleague Vanya Visa, I believe, a few years ago now, in 2020.
340702	357624	55	Maxwell	0.91	And Vanya at the time was noticing, well, the field of consciousness studies is replete with a bunch of different models and theories, and there seems to be no end in sight to the multiplication of these theories.
357752	376540	56	Maxwell	0.82	And the idea is maybe what the field needs is not one additional N plus one theory of consciousness, but rather a minimal unifying model by which Vanya means a model that specifies only necessary properties of consciousness.
376620	385590	57	Maxwell	0.99999	So this doesn't come with, like, a strong sufficiency claim, really, like, what are the kind of rudimentary building blocks that are necessary for consciousness in general.
386200	390004	58	Maxwell	1	This model would have determinable descriptions that can be made more specific.
390122	395672	59	Maxwell	0.99999	So it's kind of a base model that can be expanded to cover different varieties of conscious experience.
395806	405980	60	Maxwell	0.97	And finally, that it's minimal and unifying in the sense that it integrates current approaches to consciousness in no small part by highlighting their common assumptions.
406960	413496	61	Maxwell	0.98831	So kind of pointing to a least common denominator of all existing accounts.
413688	430960	62	Maxwell	0.96	And so what we have tried to do in this paper is to well, in this series of papers is to engage in this analysis and this mummy analysis, if you will, for theories of consciousness premised on the Free Energy Principle directly.
431120	434340	63	Maxwell	0.99994	So it's worth quickly discussing the Free Energy Principle.
434680	442090	64	Maxwell	0.99482	I'm almost embarrassed to do this at the Active Inference Institute, but it's always worth going through this very quickly.
442620	449572	65	Maxwell	0.52114	So there's a standard distinction in physics that one can leverage between dynamics, mechanics and principles.
449636	453500	66	Maxwell	1	The Free Energy Principle, as it says on the tin is a principle.
454000	461692	67	Maxwell	0.78172	So principles are kind of the foundation of a hierarchy of theory building in science, as it were.
461746	467600	68	Maxwell	0.99999	Top of the hierarchy are formal descriptions of behavior what are known as dynamics.
468100	476400	69	Maxwell	0.99979	So if you're applying dynamical systems theory to understand the time evolution of some system, you're in the realm of dynamics.
476820	481648	70	Maxwell	0.66849	Arguably, folks like Kepler and Galileo were also in the realm of dynamics.
481744	486740	71	Maxwell	0.7222	So I see some empirical phenomenon and I produce a formal description of that behavior.
487080	504030	72	Maxwell	0.99542	Mechanics comes into play when we move from Kepler and Galileo to Newton, when we move from merely describing some behavior to providing equations of motion that allow us to explain why that behavior has the particular shape that it does.
504720	515200	73	Maxwell	0.95235	So classical mechanics, for example, gives us an account of gravitational force and explains why orbits are shaped the way they do.
515270	531108	74	Maxwell	0.99763	So if galileo and kepler just noticed the shape of orbits and provided a formal description of them, newton explains where that shape comes from in some sense, and principles, in turn, explain where mechanics come from.
531274	547748	75	Maxwell	0.99982	So classical mechanics come from the principle of least action or stationary action, which, very roughly speaking, is the principle according to which no more or no less energy is used than necessary to perform some physical movements.
547844	548644	76	Maxwell	0.83711	That kinetic.
548692	558284	77	Maxwell	1	And potential energies balance out such that the true paths of a system through its state space are those for which that balance equals zero.
558482	564572	78	Maxwell	1	The principle of least action explains where classical mechanics comes from.
564626	565710	79	Maxwell	0.99998	In some sense.
566020	574876	80	Maxwell	1	And similarly, the Free Energy Principle is at the basis of another kind of mechanics that is becoming known as Bayesian mechanics.
574988	583620	81	Maxwell	0.53696	You can think of the Free Energy Principle as having the same relation to Bayesian mechanics as the principle of least action has to classical mechanics.
583960	588576	82	Maxwell	1	And Bayesian mechanics is the physics of probabilistic beliefs.
588768	597210	83	Maxwell	0.99957	So it's a physics that connects the properties of the system that you're considering the physical properties of the system.
597580	620668	84	Maxwell	0.99997	In particular, the information entropy of states of a system to the connects the thermodynamic entropy of the states of a system to the information entropy of the beliefs that a system has about the systems to which it is coupled.
620764	621024	85	Maxwell	0.99999	Here.
621062	628112	86	Maxwell	0.94	A probabilistic belief means a probability density in a very general sense.
628166	633840	87	Maxwell	0.99997	We're not assuming some kind of contentful motion of belief like you might find in philosophy.
634000	634324	88	Maxwell	0.99999	Really.
634362	636576	89	Maxwell	0.99996	This is about kind of a tracking relation.
636688	640260	90	Maxwell	0.99999	But we'll get that to that in actually, just a few slides.
640700	644148	91	Maxwell	0.99991	There are two main formulations of the Free Energy Principle in the literature.
644244	646200	92	Maxwell	1	The classical and the quantum.
646780	650740	93	Maxwell	0.99999	Both rest on this apparatus of the Markov blanket.
650900	656744	94	Maxwell	0.99	The Markov blanket definitionally is the degrees of freedom that separate.
656792	659080	95	Maxwell	0.99991	But couple two systems.
659160	662844	96	Maxwell	0.99988	Or rather, two things within a larger system.
662962	673810	97	Maxwell	0.99983	It's effectively a statistical boundary that allows us to say that, well, given this boundary, the inside is independent of the outside.
674660	678368	98	Maxwell	1	The way that we express the dependencies.
678464	690256	99	Maxwell	0.85044	So taking one step back quickly, this is a dynamic systems approach to cognition, to self organizing systems, and to physical systems more generally.
690448	701992	100	Maxwell	0.89485	It is a dynamical systems approach in the sense that we're using the tools of dynamical systems theory to examine the time evolution of a system, its trajectory in its state space.
702126	712670	101	Maxwell	1	And in this context, a generative model is used to encode the relations of dependence that obtain in the time evolution of the system.
713120	726492	102	Maxwell	0.69007	So this is important and I've been kind of making this point maybe ad nauseam for the last, I guess, half decade.
726636	730390	103	Maxwell	0.99998	But the generative model is not a model that you have in your head.
732520	740740	104	Maxwell	0.99941	It is a statistical model that represents the conditional dependence structure of the entire system that you're considering.
740820	747690	105	Maxwell	0.99938	So this is an environment agent system in the broadest sense.
748300	765230	106	Maxwell	1	And the Free Energy Principle says that if a specific sparseness structure obtains so if things are disconnected in a special way, then it'll look as if the subsets that are disconnected are tracking each other.
765620	771120	107	Maxwell	0.99467	So more technically, we partition our system into particles.
771700	781028	108	Maxwell	0.77657	Particles are basically internal states shrouded behind their Markov blanket, where the Markov blanket is composed of sensory states and active states.
781194	793930	109	Maxwell	0.99939	Sensory states affect internal states but are not affected by internal states and active states affect external states but are not affected by external states.
795740	808860	110	Maxwell	0.98227	This separation of causal dependence and this structure intervening between the two bulk subsets of the system is really critical.
809440	832928	111	Maxwell	0.87	The Free Energy Principle says if my generative model, which encodes all of the dependencies of the system, if my generative model contains a Markov blanket in the sense that we just defined, then we are basically licensed in our interpretation of internal states as basically tracking external states where tracking has a specific mathematical definition.
833024	840884	112	Maxwell	0.61238	In this context, tracking means to encode the parameters of some probabilistic belief about external states.
841002	854140	113	Maxwell	0.99896	So to the extent that we want to call this representation, we should note that this is not a representation in the typical tele semantic sense of having some internal states track some external features.
855840	866288	114	Maxwell	0.99983	What we're saying is that basically if I have a Markov blanket, then my internal states are basically shaping a belief about the external world.
866454	869570	115	Maxwell	0.84	And I think that's really critical to understand.
870980	874224	116	Maxwell	1	And this is where the inference and the modeling bit comes from.
874262	879360	117	Maxwell	0.99987	This kind of tracking relationship, formally speaking, is approximate daisy and inference.
879440	889524	118	Maxwell	0.99669	So basically, in a nutshell, the Free Energy Principle says in our physical universe as we understand it, with the usual mechanics running in the background, right?
889562	902484	119	Maxwell	0.99978	Classical relativistic, quantum and statistical, if boundaries exist in the physical system, then the bulk across the boundary is going to be tracking whatever is beyond the boundary.
902612	906440	120	Maxwell	0.998	So in a nutshell, this is what the Free Energy Principle says.
906510	908616	121	Maxwell	0.9999	Now, I noticed you put some stuff in the chat.
908648	911416	122	Maxwell	0.99993	Would you mind using your voice to compliment.
911608	917490	123	Mahault	0.88368	Yeah, I was just saying that this part that you were just explaining often seems kind of esoteric to people.
918180	926304	124	Mahault	0.99998	But it's critical to understand the sparseness of the coupling because then you kind of start understanding where perspective comes from.
926422	939668	125	Mahault	0.99	And if you have perspective, you also have the capacity to assess causality starting from a point and extending outwards to something else.
939754	944744	126	Mahault	1	And this is true from any so that's what I wanted to add.
944942	945924	127	Maxwell	0.99995	Thank you, Mala.
945972	947960	128	Maxwell	1	I think that's useful addition.
948860	949272	129	Maxwell	0.97992	Yeah.
949326	953260	130	Maxwell	0.99833	So this is the classical formulation of the Free Energy Principle.
953760	973004	131	Maxwell	0.9707	There is a new hip funky formulation that has become available over the last half decade due to Chris Fields, Jim Glazebrook and their colleagues, the so called quantum information theoretic formulation of the FEP.
973132	973888	132	Maxwell	0.99934	Fear not.
973974	976860	133	Maxwell	0.99999	This doesn't appeal directly to quantum mechanics.
976940	990756	134	Maxwell	0.9994	Rather, it appeals to the tools that have been used to extend information theory in the context of quantum mechanics, which allow you to calculate like all sorts of funky wave equations and propagation operators and all that.
990778	992608	135	Maxwell	0.99999	We don't have to get into the details.
992784	995560	136	Maxwell	0.99999	Basically, it's just a way to reframe what I just said.
995710	1003836	137	Maxwell	0.99567	So what I just said is if there's a boundary in my physical system, then the things across the boundary will look as if they're tracking each other.
1004018	1016540	138	Maxwell	0.67462	Another way of saying that is, well, this boundary is a kind of screen green takes on a particular sense in quantum information theory.
1017120	1038576	139	Maxwell	1	We don't necessarily have to get into the details of it, but basically you can think of these degrees of freedom that couple the two systems as a kind of probabilistic surface and you can think of the bulk across either side of the boundary as in alternation reading and writing information onto the blanket.
1038768	1052932	140	Maxwell	0.99845	So any Markov blanket whatsoever can be construed as a classical information channel or a screen and in effect, all of the classical information that you need to describe the way that things across the boundary.
1052996	1059736	141	Maxwell	0.73226	So the so called bulk of the system, couple to one another, is contained on the boundary.
1059848	1065810	142	Maxwell	0.9999	It encodes the classical information that's necessary to describe the couplings within the system.
1068980	1070800	143	Maxwell	0.81708	This is holography.
1072260	1073292	144	Maxwell	0.9966	This is the hologram.
1073356	1075180	145	Maxwell	0.99999	Not in the sense of Holography.
1075260	1087440	146	Maxwell	0.99999	Although we might discuss senses in which these things are intertwined, we're using the word Hologram in the sense of the Holographic principle from physics.
1087600	1095508	147	Maxwell	1	The Holographic principle is a principle that was originally discovered in the context of black hole thermodynamics.
1095604	1101720	148	Maxwell	0.76	And what it basically tells us is necessarily from the point of view of an external observer.
1102240	1110220	149	Maxwell	0.96966	Some bulk in physical space can only contain as much information as can fit onto its surface.
1110720	1114120	150	Maxwell	0.82787	So this echoes what we were just discussing about Markov blanket.
1114200	1129140	151	Maxwell	1	The physical reason is that if a bulk collapses into a black hole and the bulk contained any more information than could be fit onto its boundary then we would basically be losing information.
1129290	1139940	152	Maxwell	1	And that would violate the conservation of classical information also known as the principle of unitarity in quantum mechanics which basically says that information is never lost.
1141080	1145032	153	Maxwell	0.99051	So we're using the word Hologram in that sense.
1145166	1150324	154	Maxwell	0.99988	This is different from the sense of Hologram everyone has seen, like the Hologram of Tupac.
1150372	1154696	155	Maxwell	0.99959	Or does that make me look seem old at the Super Bowl a few years ago?
1154798	1158284	156	Maxwell	1	Or maybe Pokemon cards, maybe that also makes me seem old now.
1158322	1168416	157	Maxwell	1	I don't know what the kids are doing, but you've seen like red baseball cards and stuff like that with different superimposed picture layers that become visible as you move.
1168518	1171116	158	Maxwell	0.96681	That's not the sense of Hologram that's at stake.
1171228	1178428	159	Maxwell	0.90737	Although maybe so we'll get to why, but we'll focus on the Hologram theoretic formulation.
1178604	1200228	160	Maxwell	0.999	So, to summarize, in the Holographic principle version of the Free Energy Principle, the quantum information theoretic version of the principle, all of the classical information that I need as an external observer to characterize the coupling between two subsystems of a larger system exist on the boundary.
1200404	1203310	161	Maxwell	1	And that's a pretty remarkable physical fact.
1204080	1221824	162	Maxwell	0.62	And a few years ago, Chris Fields, Jim Glazebrook and Mike Levin proposed that maybe this kind of information concentrating bottleneck architecture also has application to consciousness in the form of an internal screen.
1221942	1231408	163	Maxwell	0.99986	So the idea was that the information that I bring to bear, to parse my sensory stream and make sense of what is constantly bombarding me, it has to live somewhere.
1231584	1235764	164	Maxwell	1	And so the idea is, well, it lives in this inner screen.
1235882	1241992	165	Maxwell	0.99977	So you basically have an external Markov blanket, which is a Markov blanket just in the usual sense.
1242126	1253912	166	Maxwell	0.94	And then the idea is well within the set of internal states that are kind of partitioned off from the organisms due to the organism's Markov blanket.
1253976	1258830	167	Maxwell	0.99975	Then you would have an internal Markov blanket structure within those internal states.
1259440	1261852	168	Maxwell	1	This is prediction six from their great paper.
1261906	1266348	169	Maxwell	0.62993	Minimal physicalism internal awareness requires internal boundaries.
1266444	1276144	170	Maxwell	1	And there's this interesting connection to integrated information theory I am agnostic with respect to IIT, so we're not going to go there today.
1276182	1284036	171	Maxwell	0.884	But for those of you who are interested, this kind of inner loop mechanism seems to generate positive integrated information.
1284138	1286470	172	Maxwell	0.99999	So there's an interesting connection there.
1286920	1291332	173	Maxwell	1	Before I move on to Neurophysiology, I'll hand things over to Mao.
1291396	1292968	174	Maxwell	0.99999	If you wanted to add anything.
1293134	1305950	175	Mahault	0.63763	Yeah, actually I was literally about to type something that this is actually also connected to some neomaterialist formulations of folding onto itself.
1306720	1311470	176	Mahault	0.99972	So maybe this is something worth digging into a little later in the talk.
1312480	1313228	177	Maxwell	0.99995	Awesome.
1313394	1314376	178	Maxwell	0.90387	Then we shall.
1314488	1319920	179	Maxwell	0.68	And I believe that Ali is also a co author on the paper and we have him.
1319990	1322604	180	Maxwell	0.99944	So congratulations, by the way, on the preprint.
1322732	1325728	181	Maxwell	1	I saw it released and Mao has told me about it.
1325814	1332704	182	Maxwell	0.78604	I'm really happy to see such serious philosophical work being done with the Free Energy Principle as the basis.
1332752	1336496	183	Maxwell	1	I think you should be very happy with the end result and proud.
1336688	1341080	184	Maxwell	0.99871	But now let me get back to my monologue.
1341580	1346756	185	Maxwell	0.57795	So rather our Mao and my diet.
1346868	1348036	186	Maxwell	0.93412	It's not really a dialogue.
1348068	1349992	187	Maxwell	0.91721	It's sort of like I don't know how to call it.
1350046	1355816	188	Maxwell	0.94913	Anyway, I'm thinking in French.
1355848	1357768	189	Maxwell	1	I have the words in French, I promise.
1357944	1374716	190	Maxwell	0.97605	So now that we've, you know, reviewed in a very much too short, way too brutally fast fashion the Free Energy Principle and its core formulations, we're now going to derive a model of consciousness by applying it to the known neurophysiology of the brain.
1374748	1375650	191	Maxwell	0.99987	Are you ready?
1376340	1377392	192	Maxwell	0.69126	You buckled up?
1377446	1378290	193	Maxwell	0.99976	Okay, good.
1378740	1383440	194	Maxwell	0.99954	So we have just said that the FEP can be used to model things that have boundaries.
1383520	1392520	195	Maxwell	1	I submit to you that the brain is a thing with boundaries and importantly, a lot, many, several internal boundaries.
1393980	1399236	196	Maxwell	0.99679	So in particular, we know that the brain has a very sparse structure.
1399428	1403628	197	Maxwell	0.99974	So if you think of just the raw numbers, right?
1403714	1410860	198	Maxwell	0.94338	There are roughly on the order of 100 and 5160 billion neurons in the brain.
1411360	1425410	199	Maxwell	1	But each neuron only makes about something like, I want to say five figures, because I've spent so long, ten to the five connections, right?
1429300	1437520	200	Maxwell	0.99848	My neurophysiology is a bit far behind me, but it's something on the order of a few thousand to maybe tens of thousands of connections per neuron.
1437600	1443640	201	Maxwell	0.99441	So obviously, if you just think about it, most neurons are not connected to each other, not directly.
1444140	1448756	202	Maxwell	1	And furthermore, the brain has a hierarchical structure.
1448948	1451252	203	Maxwell	0.85	And when you think about it, what is a hierarchy?
1451316	1454524	204	Maxwell	0.76	A hierarchy is a sparse connectivity structure, right?
1454562	1468096	205	Maxwell	0.99994	So if you think about a hierarchy of connectivity, what having a hierarchical structure means, at the end of the day, this isn't some statement about power dynamics where things at the top of the hierarchy are more important than things at the bottom.
1468198	1474284	206	Maxwell	0.99973	Your cortical neurons don't drain more juice than other parts of the brain.
1474332	1476080	207	Maxwell	0.83	The neurons in those parts.
1477300	1488420	208	Maxwell	0.99998	What we're talking about is a regular sparse pattern of connectivity, where I only make connections to the layers directly below me and to the layers directly above me.
1488490	1497290	209	Maxwell	0.99883	What I want to suggest now is that you can understand the sparseness as a set of nested Markov blankets, and that's going to do a lot of heavy lifting for us.
1497660	1501316	210	Maxwell	0.99917	So the discussions here are based on two papers.
1501428	1507464	211	Maxwell	0.97	One by Fields and colleagues called neurons as hierarchies of quantum reference frames.
1507512	1508348	212	Maxwell	0.59916	It's really cool.
1508434	1509804	213	Maxwell	0.53	I recommend it.
1509922	1516780	214	Maxwell	0.66	And also a paper by Inesh Ipolito, myself and our colleagues on Markov blankets in the brain.
1516860	1534256	215	Maxwell	0.99932	So this is going to be a much too short summary of those discussions, but basically, you can start with individual neurons and then talk about their Markov blankets to bring it back to something that I was saying earlier, but that I didn't emphasize while we were going through the slides.
1534448	1539888	216	Maxwell	1	The Markov blanket identifies dynamical dependencies, not necessarily physical boundaries.
1539984	1545816	217	Maxwell	0.99998	So it's a statistical boundary it's not necessarily like the boundaries of a wall, like a cell.
1545998	1566270	218	Maxwell	1	In the case of formalizing individual neurons with Markov blanket we would associate the post synaptic conductance with the internal states, the post synaptic voltage with the active states, the presynaptic conductance to external states and the presynaptic voltage to sensory states.
1566580	1572656	219	Maxwell	0.99999	You have some equations of motion that tell you how each of these quantities change and what they depend on.
1572838	1589124	220	Maxwell	1	And you'll notice that this has the dependency structure of a Markov blanket where the internal states only depend on sensory active and internal states, the active states only depend on internal states, and so on.
1589162	1601400	221	Maxwell	0.99997	So it respects the dependency structures that we were discussing a bit earlier, where again, the sensory states can only depend on other blanket states and external states and so on.
1601470	1606760	222	Maxwell	0.99995	So here we have a nice dynamic Markov blanket that we carve around our neurons.
1606920	1609500	223	Maxwell	1	And then there are two directions that we can go.
1609650	1624640	224	Maxwell	0.86801	We can ascend the scales towards canonical microcircuits and then cortical columns, individual brain regions, whole brain networks and so on.
1624710	1632180	225	Maxwell	1	And at each of these successive scales of self organization you can similarly identify Markov blanket.
1632760	1640600	226	Maxwell	0.99999	If you want to discuss this in more detail, you can go see the paper by Inesh and myself and colleagues.
1642060	1653576	227	Maxwell	0.99996	You can also go from the individual neuron down towards gated channels, towards synapses dendrites and the soma.
1653608	1658376	228	Maxwell	0.98314	So the body of the cell, all of these things have successive Markov blanket.
1658568	1665724	229	Maxwell	1	And so all throughout the brain's organization at the different scales at which itself organizes.
1665772	1670156	230	Maxwell	0.99999	You have this nice structure of nested Markov blankets, of Markov blankets?
1670188	1671676	231	Maxwell	1	Of Markov blankets.
1671868	1677020	232	Maxwell	0.61299	So that's one clear immediate sense in which there are these blankets.
1677100	1685204	233	Maxwell	1	And you can start to think of these blankets as screens in the way that we just were talking about.
1685322	1692468	234	Maxwell	1	A slightly more illustrative example of what we're talking about here is Markov blankets and predictive coding.
1692564	1695892	235	Maxwell	0.99997	This is a figure pretty typical in the predictive coding literature.
1695956	1716028	236	Maxwell	0.99999	What it tells you is that the brain has a series of levels or layers, where superordinate layers are basically passing predictions about sensory input onto subordinate layers and subordinate layers are shuffling prediction error back up to the superordinate layers.
1716124	1722844	237	Maxwell	0.8323	This is probably like I'm almost embarrassed again to discuss this at the active inference institute.
1722892	1726976	238	Maxwell	0.95681	I'm sure everyone is quite familiar with these things already.
1727158	1734500	239	Maxwell	1	The novelty that we are introducing here is to say well, each of these layers is connected to each other via a Markov blanket.
1734920	1745764	240	Maxwell	0.93	And so that's I think like a key insight is that each of these layers has internal states and communicates to other layers through what you can formalize as a Markov blanket.
1745812	1757660	241	Maxwell	0.99984	So you can understand at any given scale of brain activity, you can understand the different levels of message passing as successively nested screens.
1758240	1767884	242	Maxwell	1	The cool thing is that what each of these screens is doing in some sense is course graining, the stuff in the screen below.
1768082	1773296	243	Maxwell	0.98329	So in some sense each screen is kind of implicitly contained in the following one.
1773318	1781780	244	Maxwell	0.64	And what you end up having is a kind of nested structure of screens of screens of screens of screens, which is, I think, pretty cool.
1781850	1788740	245	Maxwell	0.99996	We recover, as you'll note in this figure, the inner screen hypothesis.
1789080	1793288	246	Maxwell	0.87323	Each of these, this is probably a better way to visualize it.
1793374	1799316	247	Maxwell	0.96597	You have at the left the kind of external Markov blanket of the organism.
1799428	1804348	248	Maxwell	0.62075	It is segregating or carving out a set of internal states.
1804434	1816380	249	Maxwell	1	And what we're saying is these internal states have a layered level structure, a sparse structure that we can formalize using nested Markov blanket.
1817140	1822288	250	Maxwell	0.92	And like I was saying, each screen successively coarse grains the next screen.
1822454	1847480	251	Maxwell	1	And this gives some flesh to this notion of contextual computing, this idea that really what the brain is, is an organ of context where each layer is providing context to the layer below and where each layer is attuning to increasingly higher order, slower and more physically widespread regularities.
1848940	1861640	252	Maxwell	0.97319	So one thing that we're proposing here, which is a novel hypothesis that we intend to test empirically over the next few years, is that this architecture has two special layers.
1861720	1867532	253	Maxwell	1	In some sense you can think about it as write only layers.
1867596	1887220	254	Maxwell	0.99994	So if you're thinking about the stack, the sensory periphery or the sensory bottom, in one sense can only write in one direction, it can only write into the system and the topmost level can only write downwards.
1887560	1889488	255	Maxwell	0.999	This is a key architectural feature.
1889584	1896340	256	Maxwell	1	One thing to point out is that in the paper we associated the topmost level to structures like the hippocampus.
1896420	1903000	257	Maxwell	0.99987	We don't need to suggest that the hippocampus is uniquely the top of this hierarchy.
1903080	1911320	258	Maxwell	1	Rather there is probably a whole bulk of structures that basically cannot any longer be coarse grained.
1911400	1914108	259	Maxwell	0.99998	So you kind of have like an executive level top.
1914194	1919516	260	Maxwell	0.98	And what's particular about this top is that it can only write down into the stack.
1919628	1933312	261	Maxwell	0.99912	So its function really is to be about and monitor the other layers of the stack, implementing a form of covert action which trickles down throughout the stack.
1933456	1936612	262	Maxwell	0.96785	So, Mahault, I saw you write some stuff.
1936746	1938916	263	Maxwell	0.99999	Would you like to add?
1939018	1950330	264	Mahault	0.99951	Yeah, so I think one of the things that's important to highlight is why some things can only write up and some things can only write down.
1951340	1973772	265	Mahault	0.96	And what this means for irreducible, the irreducible mark of blanket, which is the part where experience happens because there's a counter that and some future questions that are going to happen that relates to superstructures and then why don't we experience the consciousness of a superstructure?
1973916	1977730	266	Mahault	0.99682	So I think it might be important to dig into that a little bit.
1978360	1979110	267	Maxwell	0.9998	Absolutely.
1980360	1981444	268	Maxwell	0.80586	Thank you.
1981642	1988020	269	Maxwell	0.51861	So, yeah, to summarize then, there are basically two, right, only layers.
1988520	1998260	270	Maxwell	0.99999	As you ascend the layers which are successively coarse graining each other, there is an irreducible screen that can't further be coarse grained.
1998420	2003024	271	Maxwell	1	We believe that this corresponds to something like a naturalized Homunculus.
2003092	2007660	272	Maxwell	1	And we're calling this perspective (with an intentional provocation) -
2008000	2021772	273	Maxwell	0.99992	"we're calling this perspective ""Neocartesian,"" in the sense that we may have in some sense identified the processes that make it seem as if there was something like a Homunculus."
2021836	2024416	274	Maxwell	0.99515	Obviously we're not - or maybe not
2024438	2032950	275	Maxwell	0.99945	obviously! It's worth saying we are not falling into the Homunculus fallacy because we're not claiming that the topmost layers perceive themselves.
2033640	2043080	276	Maxwell	0.99985	So the buck stops with the top layers and the top layers can only perceive themselves vicariously by acting through other layers.
2043500	2056088	277	Maxwell	1	And we associate this action of layers of internal Markov blankets on each other with attention in particular and other neuromodulatory effects.
2056264	2078252	278	Maxwell	0.87222	So I mean the overall picture is one where consciousness is intrinsically related to overt and covert actions, to the overt acting and sensing associated with the external Markov blanket and with the covert actions that are being deployed within the stack and in particular that are issued by the very top set of levels.
2078316	2081164	279	Maxwell	0.99739	As I said, this is not necessarily a strict hierarchy.
2081212	2084304	280	Maxwell	0.99994	It could be a hierarchy with several different tops.
2084432	2090156	281	Maxwell	0.99998	But this integrated top structure we believe could be associated with a naturalized Homunculus.
2090288	2097880	282	Maxwell	0.63568	I'm going to skip through the rest and thank you for your attention.
2103260	2105364	283	Maxwell	0.99934	Unless Mahault wants to add something.
2105502	2113672	284	Mahault	0.56955	Just one thing is, I think to put it in simpler terms as well, the two layers that can only write can't store memories.
2113816	2123148	285	Mahault	0.98085	Because that's right, memories is not just an encoding, it's a process of retrieval.
2123324	2142436	286	Mahault	1	And it requires interactions between different levels, which is why the lowest levels are only interacting with things which are external and therefore can't necessarily store and can't make direct interactions with anything else within the entity itself, and the highest level as well.
2142538	2148170	287	Mahault	0.95798	So there is no memories being encoded at these two levels, which is why they're right only and not.
2149260	2151370	288	Mahault	0.96	I think that helps a little bit.
2152780	2153352	289	Maxwell	0.99993	Thank you.
2153406	2154650	290	Maxwell	0.99347	Yeah, I would agree.
2155680	2157576	291	Maxwell	0.75043	So thank you all for your attention.
2157688	2160392	292	Maxwell	0.9997	Thank you in particular, Dan, for the invitation.
2160456	2169280	293	Maxwell	0.99955	It's always great to be at the A-Double-I! And yeah, we were looking forward to this discussion.
2174960	2183084	294	Mahault	1	I think Daniel said he wasn't going to do too much animation, so if
2183122	2187410	295	Mahault	0.99863	people have…
2187410	2195400	295	Maxwell	0.5	Are you going to do any facilitation at all, Dan?
2195400	2196150	296	Mahault	0.63635	Yeah.
2196840	2197348	297	MARIA LUIZA IENNACO	0.92234	Okay.
2197434	2201670	298	Maria	0.88728	So thanks Maxwell and Mahault for the amazing talk!
2202940	2210600	299	Maria	0.9999	There are so many interesting things to dig on in this paper, I don't know even where to start.
2210670	2214810	300	Maria	0.65254	But I do have one question too, actually, in particular.
2215280	2225896	301	Maria	0.63526	So: Does this inner screen model imply a kind of proto-panpsychism or a more restricted bio-psychism?
2226088	2236348	302	Maria	0.88	I mean, do you think the type of nested Holographic structure described by the model all exists in biological systems?
2236524	2247430	303	Maria	0.99	And regardless of the answer, would you think that it generalizes to larger systems comprising these systems, like populations and colonies and so on?
2247960	2248756	304	Maxwell	1	Maybe I can take
2248778	2250070	305	Maxwell	1	a quick stab at that.
2250760	2260920	306	Maxwell	0.86142	So we think that the Free Energy Principle itself commits you to a kind of I don't know what the right word is.
2261070	2262696	307	Maxwell	0.99997	We're writing a paper now.
2262878	2268280	308	Maxwell	0.99999	We're struggling with the exact coinage, but it's not quite a pen psychism.
2268620	2277260	309	Maxwell	0.95978	It's a pen representationalism or a pen tracking ism, if you'll allow me, the absolutely disgusting neologism.
2277600	2286140	310	Maxwell	0.99999	Basically what the FEP implies is that anything that has a boundary, it looks as if it's tracking what's beyond the boundary.
2286220	2291716	311	Maxwell	0.99749	So at a very basic level, the FEP kind of licenses this talk about anything.
2291898	2298660	312	Maxwell	0.73535	So anything whatsoever looks as if it's tracking what's across the boundary by virtue of existing.
2299240	2308008	313	Maxwell	0.98391	So at a very basic level, if I see a rock outside, I know that it's not 1000 degrees Celsius outside.
2308094	2308730	314	Maxwell	0.99978	Right.
2309100	2314676	315	Maxwell	1	The fact that a rock has a specific structure entails something about its environment.
2314868	2319464	316	Maxwell	0.90748	Likewise, I can see you, Maria, you are not wearing a winter parka.
2319512	2327696	317	Maxwell	1	And I can infer from that that it's probably room temperature around you and not like you're not somewhere in Antarctica or wherever else.
2327798	2332464	318	Maxwell	0.98182	So this kind of basic tracking relationship applies to everything.
2332582	2346432	319	Maxwell	0.99997	What we've tried to do in this paper is to start spelling out more explicitly what the difference is between just rocks and rock stars in some sense.
2346486	2351744	320	Maxwell	0.7408	Like, what is the special kind of structure that you need to add to the Markov blanket?
2351792	2357028	321	Maxwell	0.59	And what you'll notice is that you get consciousness by making the overall structure more sparse.
2357124	2369608	322	Maxwell	0.99174	So as you make more of the connectivity zero, you get all of these weird things that pop up, one of which is we think like this consciousness structure.
2369784	2377180	323	Maxwell	0.41154	Mao has thought about this maybe more than I have, so I'd be curious to get her perspective.
2377780	2387170	324	Mahault	0.44394	Well, so I know that people are a little bit wary of panpsychism, so we usually add the term proto in front of it.
2387940	2393860	325	Mahault	0.74	And so the idea is that we have to deconceptualize what consciousness means.
2393930	2399030	326	Mahault	1	And oftentimes what we mean is something that resembles what humans do.
2399800	2411770	327	Mahault	1	And we have to be a little bit if we take our formalism consciousness can become emergent at the scales where humans are.
2412380	2421660	328	Mahault	0.99999	But it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist at lower scales, where the inertia or the entropy generated by policies is lower.
2421810	2428844	329	Mahault	0.898	So if you think of a rock, its policy is pretty much maintained bonds.
2428892	2429472	330	Mahault	0.74701	You know what I mean?
2429526	2430480	331	Mahault	0.98325	There's nothing else.
2430550	2439324	332	Mahault	1	The scale at which some kind of thing exists and changes is much different than you deciding to have coffee.
2439452	2450804	333	Mahault	0.50496	But in effect, your cells could be something that we could consider exist, closer to something that a rock does and even lower just the proteins that make up your system.
2450922	2476060	334	Mahault	0.61395	So if we understand that there is nestedness and that the conscious process happens once you have this capacity to exchange information across layers, anything that has the stacking of layers in a nested fashion is in effect, proto conscious.
2476400	2481056	335	Mahault	0.83796	But we have to be very careful about what we load into.
2481158	2484370	336	Mahault	0.57	The term conscious, I think, is mainly the question.
2485300	2486832	337	Maxwell	0.96636	I'm sharing my screen here.
2486886	2493860	338	Maxwell	1	This is from a paper on path integrals, particular kinds and strange particles.
2494440	2501856	339	Maxwell	0.99968	So it is a typology of different kinds of Markov blankets and different kinds of particles.
2502048	2510890	340	Maxwell	0.97579	So something like a rock, it still has a Markov blanket, but its Markov blanket is not partitioned into sensory and active states.
2511340	2520364	341	Maxwell	1	There are no states that have this property that active states have that they affect the external world that are not affected by it.
2520402	2521230	342	Maxwell	0.99998	In return.
2521840	2524220	343	Maxwell	0.53	A rock just has sensory states.
2524290	2528290	344	Maxwell	1	If I kick a rock, unless it's radioactive, it's not going to act on me.
2529780	2532940	345	Maxwell	0.98964	It only has the inference part of active inference.
2533020	2538050	346	Maxwell	0.99814	It's only kind of changing its state as a response to the forces that are acting on it.
2538660	2543412	347	Maxwell	0.99444	Active particles are particles that have both sensory and active states.
2543466	2546550	348	Maxwell	0.79	And you might think, for example, of a cell.
2547720	2550420	349	Maxwell	0.77	A cell has this kind of structure.
2551320	2559960	350	Maxwell	0.99949	Particles like ourselves have additional sparseness in the Markov blanket, in particular, what we call strange particles.
2561420	2569660	351	Maxwell	1	The internal states of strange particles do not have direct access to the active states of strange particles, and therefore they need to be inferred.
2570160	2572344	352	Maxwell	0.99	And this is what gets you planning.
2572392	2588064	353	Maxwell	1	At the end of the day, a strange particle can only exist by kind of inferring itself into existence precisely because there are no direct connections between the active and the internal states.
2588182	2597584	354	Maxwell	0.98606	So as you remove connectivity from the overall structure from here to here, you're adding sparseness.
2597632	2600100	355	Maxwell	0.99999	From here to here, you're adding sparseness.
2600520	2609320	356	Maxwell	0.9925	As you make the system more and more sparse, you get more and more interesting behavior to emerge from the system.
2609470	2624460	357	Maxwell	0.98	And you can think of the topmost structure that we were describing as an instance of this broader architecture where the topmost layer doesn't have direct access to the active states of the system.
2624530	2632160	358	Maxwell	0.56	And therefore, it kind of has to go through the entire bulk of the system to infer itself into existence.
2635420	2644580	359	Mahault	0.83644	So there's a few hands up there on Google where you can see the people who share hand.
2644750	2645084	360	Mahault	0.99699	Okay.
2645122	2647390	361	Mahault	0.99989	So, Ali, I think you raised your hand first.
2650400	2651004	362	Ali	0.91663	Yes.
2651122	2656370	363	Ali	0.99996	Thank you again for your crystal clear and really illuminating talk.
2658180	2666996	364	Ali	0.63727	I've written down three questions, but maybe I'll begin with probably the most basic and naive one.
2667178	2678470	365	Ali	0.99712	So in some of the earlier literature on active inference and the FEP, there was this emphasis on distinguishing between generative process and generative model.
2679180	2691352	366	Ali	0.99997	But in this paper, in figure one, which you also shown in your slides, we don't see any generative process in the diagram.
2691416	2696300	367	Ali	0.99245	So where does generative process fit into this diagram?
2697120	2707968	368	Ali	0.82214	Because the way I see it, it's basically somehow included in the generative model or I don't know.
2708134	2712480	369	Ali	0.91206	What is the distinction between these two concepts?
2713060	2720660	370	Maxwell	0.99665	So you'll have to forgive some of the earlier literature for this, there's some terminological inconsistency.
2721880	2730568	371	Maxwell	1	The only two constructs that are at play here are the generative model and the variational density that's encoded by internal states.
2730734	2731770	372	Maxwell	0.99984	That's it.
2732140	2740170	373	Maxwell	0.75255	So it is not the case that the FEP is about how the generative models the generative process.
2740720	2748984	374	Maxwell	0.99	A lot of this language comes from previous Bayesian approaches and in particular, the helmholtz machine.
2749112	2750860	375	Maxwell	0.99802	In the helmholtz machine.
2751600	2754808	376	Maxwell	0.95316	So helmholtz machines are some of the earlier predictive coding machines.
2754904	2772916	377	Maxwell	1	And in the helmholtz machine, basically you have a forward pass that connects the sensory end to basically the top of the predictive hierarchy and then a backwards pass connecting top of the model back to the sensory end.
2773018	2780950	378	Maxwell	0.97	And in a helmholtz machine, you would call the forward pass a recognition model and the backwards pass a generative model.
2781640	2790884	379	Maxwell	1	The forwards passes a recognition model because you're inputting some data and then basically by the time the information trickles up to the top, you have recognized what caused the data.
2791022	2805744	380	Maxwell	0.51	And the backwards pass is called a generative model for the reasons that are sometimes invoked in the predictive coding literature where you're basically generating possible sensoria given a certain configuration of states.
2805942	2811280	381	Maxwell	0.89875	So we don't use recognition and generative in that sense anymore.
2812180	2813820	382	Maxwell	1	And I apologize.
2813900	2821536	383	Maxwell	0.99986	In some previous publications, I've been a bit sloppy in the way that I use my language and I've used the term recognition density.
2821648	2830410	384	Maxwell	0.73505	What's really at stake is and I'll share my screen just to help make the point.
2831180	2832890	385	Maxwell	0.89885	It's what it says here.
2833980	2836664	386	Maxwell	0.99382	So you have your generative model, right?
2836702	2839524	387	Maxwell	0.99978	Your generative model is a joint probability density.
2839572	2841820	388	Maxwell	0.99999	So what is a joint probability density?
2842240	2860670	389	Maxwell	0.99939	Well, you have a bunch of different basically states that your system is defined over and you have a probability density that the shape of which captures the way that states can change over time.
2861040	2864816	390	Maxwell	0.82907	So, like, if I change this way, then I need to change in that way.
2864838	2867120	391	Maxwell	1	And that's what this shape encodes.
2867960	2879320	392	Maxwell	0.96	And what the FEP says is if my generative model has a certain sparseness, if it has Markov blanket, then there's this additional probability density that I can define.
2879820	2883370	393	Maxwell	0.99996	It is parameterized by the internal states of the system.
2884220	2886356	394	Maxwell	0.99832	It's called the variational density.
2886548	2892350	395	Maxwell	1	And this is like my probabilistic best guess about what's causing my external states.
2892960	2905516	396	Maxwell	1	At no point do you need to appeal to any other bits of generative process when you're actually coding these models up in MATLAB or in Python.
2905628	2910930	397	Maxwell	0.99993	What we call the generative process is just the equations of motion that govern external states.
2911540	2918964	398	Maxwell	0.99236	So if you actually hand code one of these one day, your generative process might include like, Newtonian physics and whatever else.
2919002	2925510	399	Maxwell	0.79482	It's sort of just like what is the process that actually animates the dynamics of external states?
2927720	2939368	400	Maxwell	0.99973	In some very simple models, like in the ones used by Miguel Aguilera and colleagues, you're looking at linear dissipative systems and they don't have any dynamics right.
2939454	2943020	401	Maxwell	0.95238	So basically, the system kind of just dissipates.
2943440	2947116	402	Maxwell	1	A linear dissipative system is a dampened spring physically, right?
2947138	2950476	403	Maxwell	0.99965	So it just goes spring and then it dissipates to the fixed point.
2950578	2959570	404	Maxwell	0.53638	So similarly, you may or may not have dynamics to the external states and that's what gets harnessed in the generative process.
2960100	2960992	405	Maxwell	0.86435	This should be clear.
2961046	2961264	406	Maxwell	0.50556	Yeah.
2961302	2962028	407	Maxwell	0.99939	Sorry. Mahault.
2962124	2977280	408	Mahault	0.93583	No, I mean, I think what the question that Ali is asking also has some important correlates that often get asked to us, like what's the difference between consciousness or dreaming?
2977440	2985000	409	Mahault	1	Or what's the difference between a dead system that decays or being psychotic?
2985740	3006192	410	Mahault	1	And I think what Maxwell is saying is our system currently doesn't say anything about your actual connection to the real world other than a thing, which is successful at being a thing, is probably well joined relative to its needs to the world.
3006326	3024180	411	Mahault	1	And therefore your relation to reality has probably got a better grasp if you are functional for a longer amount of time, this minus senescence.
3024840	3029392	412	Mahault	0.79815	So yeah, does that kind of help also, Ali?
3029456	3030070	413	Ali	0.99992	Yes.
3031800	3032950	414	Ali	0.99869	Thank you both.
3033640	3035860	415	Ali	0.8363	It really makes a lot more sense now.
3035930	3037110	416	Ali	0.97228	Thank you so much.
3037480	3039024	417	Maxwell	0.96309	Well, it's my pleasure.
3039072	3042764	418	Maxwell	1	And remember, model just means joint probability density here.
3042802	3043390	419	Maxwell	0.99972	Right?
3045520	3060508	420	Maxwell	0.83303	There's a criminally underappreciated paper that Karl wrote in Entropy in 2012 called {the} “A Free Energy Principle for Biological Systems,” which is where a lot of the Markov blanket story comes from.
3060668	3064882	5	Maxwell	1	And in that paper, Karl refers to the generative model as just the generative density.
3064946	3068386	6	Maxwell	0.99997	So it's basically saying there's an underlying probability density;
3068498	3073770	7	Maxwell	0.96315	it describes the way that the dynamics are being generated just generally;
3076030	3095470	8	Maxwell	0.7	and then if that density has the appropriate structure, meaning if it has like, zeros in the right places, then you can define this other tracking density that approximates the generative model or density.
3099490	3106160	9	Ali	0.98	And I also have a follow up question, which I'll ask after Samuel and Thale's questions.
3107090	3111040	10	Samuel	1	Okay, thanks for the excellent talk.
3113350	3118050	11	Samuel	0.29701	I'm a professor at the State University of Minas Gerais.
3119270	3123410	12	Samuel	0.51839	I'm a philosopher, cognitive scientist, psychologist.
3125290	3128930	13	Samuel	0.94527	So I work mainly on reasoning.
3129010	3149200	14	Samuel	0.95593	But by reading your paper, what strikes me as most promising is the possibility of solving the hard problem of consciousness, if this goes right in progressing this model.
3149890	3166910	15	Samuel	0.99999	But maybe an important part of that depends on exactly what is meant by holograms, and exactly what this brings into a theory as an explanation,
3166990	3167618	16	Samuel	0.87391	right?
3167784	3185462	17	Samuel	0.54631	So during your presentation, you were talking something about that there's a difference between holography in the sense of bringing light to something to make a projection; but you said that might be related as well.
3185596	3206522	18	Samuel	0.58581	So I'm quite curious about how to use this concept and how to understand it in a more folk-psychology sense; and also like where it comes from, because I'm not a physicist.
3206586	3212980	19	Samuel	0.96252	So does it depend on string theory to be correct?
3213910	3218100	20	Samuel	0.99636	Could you dive in a little more on this concept first?
3221350	3223460	21	Maxwell	0.93938	Mahault, I think this is more a “you” question.
3224950	3228274	22	Mahault	0.52588	So for the holographic screen theory.
3228322	3232610	23	Mahault	0.71076	So basically, remember, Maxwell really gave a good explanation.
3232690	3235814	24	Mahault	0.52	I kind of thought I had answered your question, but I'm going to give a little bit.
3235852	3248282	25	Mahault	0.54541	So the boundary between any two mutually separation systems, a and B, is the holographic screen that encodes the eigenvalues of the interaction that couples A and B.
3248336	3255630	26	Mahault	0.99119	So this is very similar to how a hologram encodes information about 3D objects onto a 2D surface.
3256530	3268894	27	Mahault	0.67313	So A hologram stores information about the phase and the amplitude of light reflected from an object, and this allows the reconstruction of a 3D image from a 2D surface.
3269022	3279830	28	Mahault	0.52	And so here, similarly, the holographic screen encodes information about a system's interaction with its environment, which allows for the prediction and control of the system's behavior.
3281610	3286226	29	Samuel	0.85	Yeah, but does it maybe allow for the creation of an image?
3286338	3287740	30	Samuel	0.98642	That's the sort of question.
3289870	3292330	31	Mahault	0.84	Yeah, this is where we're giving it some thought, actually.
3292400	3296794	32	Mahault	0.99892	So the creation of an image is a complex idea because what's an image, right?
3296832	3316020	33	Mahault	1	But effectively, there is some work being done into information geometry and how that may potentially interact with matter in order to transmit information, basically.
3316390	3349600	34	Mahault	1	And so it's possible that the reconstruction of information is done through fields being changed such that the modalities you have through your senses, such as sight, hearing, touch, are relative to the way that the information needs to be transmitted in terms of amplitude and velocity, et cetera, which, in effect, gives you something like light.
3350290	3355502	35	Mahault	0.96121	But that research is still relatively early.
3355636	3357562	36	Mahault	0.80671	So, yes, it is promising.
3357626	3359434	37	Mahault	0.99999	It is leading in that direction.
3359562	3375350	38	Mahault	0.99971	It's probably one of the most interesting formalism because it touches on the connection between dynamics, matter, and how information allows for matter to be organized.
3376010	3379446	39	Mahault	0.99999	But all those pieces haven't properly been put together.
3379548	3383560	40	Mahault	0.99996	It is heading there, though.
3384570	3394614	41	Maxwell	0.92063	I would just add: So the original monstrosity of a paper had a section on explaining where qualia come from based on the statistical patterns of the input.
3394742	3397082	42	Maxwell	0.99998	But as Mahault said, it was very early work.
3397136	3399754	43	Maxwell	1	And, I mean, the core model was more or less developed.
3399802	3416260	44	Maxwell	0.99998	So we decided to spin that out as a separate thing and then develop the inner screen model of consciousness per se, to flesh out a little bit or to add some flesh to what Mahault was saying, which is already pretty meaty as it is.
3417990	3427218	45	Maxwell	1	Have you heard of these experiments where they take a little pad with little pins on it and they basically reconstruct?
3427314	3437782	46	Maxwell	0.65481	Well, they plug a camera on your head and they put this little pad on your tongue, and they blindfold you, and they basically have you navigate.
3437846	3449182	47	Maxwell	1	And the camera generates a kind of grayscale version of the image, but with the little pins in terms of how far they push in.
3449316	3453230	48	Maxwell	0.9845	Samuel, are you seeing the image that I'm discussing?
3453700	3453790	48	Samuel	0.5	No.
3453790	3455834	49	Maxwell	0.93369	You have a little pad.
3455882	3460410	50	Maxwell	0.74877	It has little pins that can push at various depths.
3460490	3470046	51	Maxwell	1	And what you can do is basically translate the image from the camera into a different array of, like, assorted pins.
3470158	3482582	52	Maxwell	1	And so, yeah, you put this on your tongue, and if you blindfold yourself and use this camera for about 20 to 30 minutes, the brain eventually recognizes that, oh, this is supposed to go to the visual area.
3482716	3486662	53	Maxwell	0.61	And then you start to see through your tongue.
3486806	3498570	54	Maxwell	0.56974	In some weird way, the body actually recognizes the statistical frequencies of the pins actually pushing onto your tongue.
3498930	3525160	55	Maxwell	0.99691	This is experienced not as, like, a physical sensation, but actually visually like you start to experience an impoverished, grayscale visual field just from the sensations that are being fed to your tongue, which suggests that there's something deeply deep about the statistical structures of the signals that are being processed and the way that the qualia show up in your experience.
3528010	3536680	56	Maxwell	0.98554	But this is still, like, super far off, and I wouldn't have the pretension to claim that we've cracked where qualia come from just yet.
3538510	3542220	57	Samuel	1	Yeah, I get what you're saying now.
3542990	3548358	58	Samuel	0.99975	Different patterns can make different quality.
3548544	3553760	59	Samuel	0.97747	You don't need different magic to have different quality.
3554290	3560960	60	Samuel	0.89195	But yeah, I was wondering how that related to the holograms, but okay.
3561510	3564130	61	Samuel	0.97844	It's something in development, as you're saying.
3564200	3569220	62	Samuel	0.99999	Maybe I should let someone go and then I'll go back to these consciousness questions.
3569910	3570660	63	Mahault	0.98691	Sure.
3571030	3572770	64	Mahault	0.80846	So, Thales.
3574550	3575698	65	Thales	0.76942	Well, thank you all.
3575784	3578450	66	Thales	0.79041	It was a great presentation and great test, by the way.
3578520	3579114	67	Thales	0.2843	IMAX.
3579182	3579766	68	Thales	0.98508	Thank you.
3579868	3580760	69	Thales	0.99819	Hi, everyone.
3581210	3584374	70	Thales	0.99495	I'm sorry, you guys are facing like a black screen right now.
3584412	3585254	71	Thales	0.99962	My camera is off.
3585292	3585974	72	Thales	0.91301	Sorry.
3586172	3586920	73	Thales	0.99	Okay.
3587850	3592954	74	Thales	0.84723	I'm an anthropologist psychologist, so I'm kind of an outsider in here.
3592992	3599326	75	Thales	0.99921	I'm not from the Active Inference Lab too. So I study it, but I'm not a specialist in it.
3599428	3605230	76	Thales	0.99387	So my questions are kind of broad and they're actually really simple.
3605300	3609710	77	Thales	0.82278	But I think that I'm only allowed to make one question right per row.
3612150	3621618	78	Thales	0.97971	Actually, my first question will be something that Maria was talking about before this meeting started.
3621704	3628326	79	Thales	0.91959	So in the article account, consciousness is an attribute of things that possesses an reducible marker blanket, right.
3628428	3632882	80	Thales	0.97956	With active states, exerting influence and over external dynamics.
3632946	3643590	81	Thales	0.62135	So when applying to the neurophysiological space of the human brain, talking about neuromodulatory influence over neuronal dynamics.
3644110	3655390	82	Thales	0.99	And with that in mind, I would like to know, could you speculate a little bit on the implications of this characterization of consciousness for how it might emerge during infant or field development.
3656850	3658720	83	Maxwell	0.72336	That's a great set of questions.
3661990	3673220	84	Maxwell	1	I gave a version of this talk to Luis Pasoa's group at the Neuroscience and Philosophy Salon, and Anna Shaunika asked a similar question.
3675610	3677746	85	Maxwell	0.85706	Mahault probably has a better response.
3677778	3681670	86	Maxwell	0.78	I would point you in the direction of the work of Anna Shaunika.
3682730	3689340	87	Maxwell	0.99996	She has some really cool work on co embodiment and cohomeostasis and pregnancy and this kind of thing.
3691070	3699882	88	Maxwell	1	I confess that I need to think about the way that presumably you could just continue extending this outwards.
3699946	3700222	89	Maxwell	0.53981	Right.
3700276	3713694	90	Maxwell	0.99991	So we've talked about inner screens and there's like an external screen, but presumably you could just reapply this whole screen talk in the other direction on the other side of yeah, exactly.
3713812	3714810	91	Maxwell	0.68	The first prior.
3714890	3721970	92	Maxwell	0.63279	Well, the first prior is one of those papers, but she's got like another set of papers.
3722390	3724246	93	Maxwell	0.51	Yeah, this might be it.
3724268	3724840	94	Maxwell	0.56787	Right.
3726410	3733734	95	Mahault	1	One thing to also consider is the sparseness aspect of our model.
3733932	3753630	96	Mahault	0.92937	So as you develop, you prune connections and you become more and more sparse, which gives you more path approximations to the way that information gets agglomerated to form patterns that are recognizable.
3754690	3779078	97	Mahault	1	And so perhaps this has something to do with the emergence of a moment where you sort of come online because there's something like an irreducible mark of blanket that emerges by virtue of having pruned enough such that you can now make sense of the stimuli relative to some couplings in time.
3779244	3785158	98	Mahault	1	Rather than just hungry, there might be something to that effect.
3785244	3790742	99	Mahault	0.99826	However, we need to be careful again, with infants.
3790806	3797190	100	Mahault	0.62373	What we mean about consciousness, like, do you mean selfhood?
3797350	3810554	101	Mahault	0.98	Do you mean the capacity to reflect on selfhood, or do you mean the capacity to learn and act on the world, which is closer to where we're headed?
3810682	3828834	102	Mahault	1	Because while babies may not necessarily have this capacity to reflect on their selfhood right away, they do have the capacity to react to signals and act on the signals in order to get to a point where their preferred states are enacted.
3828882	3833000	103	Mahault	0.99992	So baby is hungry, cries, food comes.
3833530	3842140	104	Mahault	0.99758	So there is a degree to which a baby, much like a cell, has a degree of consciousness relative to our model.
3842990	3848970	105	Maxwell	0.99772	So I'd also point you in the direction of Roslyn Moran's work on the aging brain.
3849890	3861890	106	Maxwell	0.89383	She's got some cool work that suggests that the precision of our model increases over time, which has to do a little bit with what Miles discussing earlier.
3862550	3871794	107	Maxwell	0.99998	We know just from neuroanatomy that the process of pruning brain connections only accelerates through time.
3871912	3876790	108	Maxwell	0.93	And basically that means that you're disconnecting certain things from certain others.
3876860	3877142	109	Maxwell	0.99844	Right?
3877196	3885960	110	Maxwell	0.96075	Like expertise has more to do with understanding what is not connected to what than understanding what is connected to what.
3886510	3898730	111	Maxwell	0.82	And so, yeah, there is probably a kind of developmental course whereby the model becomes sparser and sparser and sparser and sparser and more and more precise.
3899490	3904842	112	Maxwell	0.99753	But this is a very cool direction for exploration.
3904986	3909040	113	Maxwell	1	I don't know if I have anything more cogent to say at this time about it.
3911510	3912370	114	Maxwell	0.97928	Pleasure.
3914550	3919422	115	Mahault	0.99242	So I know Ali wanted a second go, and so did Samuel.
3919486	3921778	116	Mahault	1	Does anybody else have other questions?
3921864	3924760	117	Mahault	0.99407	Because no other hands are raised at this time.
3927850	3930598	118	Mahault	0.816	So we have one more hand, I
3930604	3931160	119	Mahault	0.97927	think.
3934730	3942060	120	Ali	0.98773	Actually, you basically answered my other questions, so thank you so much.
3944110	3944762	121	Mahault	0.98079	Awesome.
3944896	3948090	122	Mahault	0.92293	So then Thales has his hand up again.
3948160	3950926	123	Mahault	0.98739	Maria says her hand up, and Samuel has hand up.
3950948	3951774	124	Mahault	0.99982	So Thales first,
3951812	3952590	125	Mahault	1	I suppose.
3954930	3960640	126	Thales	0.73	I don't know guys like to Maria first, because I just know.
3962470	3964370	127	Mahault	0.99985	Sure, go ahead, Maria.
3966550	3967460	128	Mahault	0.90311	All right.
3969350	3977158	129	Maria	0.99	I didn't say before, but I am a psychologist and master in philosophy, and now I'm doing PhD in philosophy as well.
3977324	3980454	130	Maria	1	And it's not really a question.
3980572	4003246	131	Maria	1	I would just like to understand better what is memory in your inner mother, because I understand the information passing and the middle layers or levels that contain the information.
4003348	4014770	132	Maria	0.988	But how exactly do we construct, for example, the narrative self or something that we remember from a long time, or episodic memory?
4015830	4018338	133	Maria	1	I didn't understand it very well in the paper.
4018424	4020580	134	Maria	0.99989	So if you could just shed some.
4021990	4028790	135	Maxwell	0.67368	It's a computer science processing, information processing notion of memory.
4029290	4036874	136	Maxwell	0.99563	So you get some data and you need to parse it into things that are causing that data.
4036992	4045354	137	Maxwell	0.95062	Well, presumably you need to leverage some beliefs or knowledge about how to parse that data.
4045472	4047900	138	Maxwell	1	And that comes in the form of information.
4048270	4059102	139	Maxwell	0.99856	Basically, you need to have some capacity to reduce the entropy of your observations and to kind of carve things out into things.
4059236	4066478	140	Maxwell	1	And the inner screen serves as the locus where the information is encoded.
4066574	4073466	141	Maxwell	0.96754	So that's the cool thing about the quantum version of the Markov blanket formulation.
4073598	4083094	142	Maxwell	0.50436	It tells you where all of the information that characterizes the coupling across two bulks where it lives, basically.
4083212	4092940	143	Maxwell	0.79	I mean, to get a little bit more technical, the Markov blanket itself is constituted by the degrees of freedom that couple the two systems together.
4094030	4107918	144	Maxwell	0.9	And, yeah, you can think of this as an array of bits that answer yes no questions about are the two systems communicating across this channel yes or no?
4108004	4118258	145	Maxwell	0.55	And in some sense, the state of the blanket at any given time gives you all of the information that you need to characterize the coupling in terms of these yes no questions.
4118344	4122926	146	Maxwell	0.99941	So all of the classical information that you need to characterize the coupling lives on the blanket.
4123038	4133794	147	Maxwell	0.81	And, yes, having an internal blanket means that you can have an internal store of such answers to yes no questions that you can then use to parse the sensory stream.
4133922	4140540	148	Maxwell	0.99995	But in a kind of standard computer architecture, it's just saying that you have a memory register, right?
4141790	4142346	149	Maxwell	0.58	Yeah.
4142448	4147578	150	Maxwell	0.99994	You need to store some of the information that you're processing somewhere so that you can deploy it.
4147664	4151040	151	Maxwell	1	And the idea is that it lives on this internal screen.
4153730	4154830	152	Maxwell	0.99986	Does that help?
4154980	4157950	153	Maria	0.95	And in this case, it would be the hippocampus.
4159250	4164302	154	Maxwell	0.99	Yeah, all of the inner screens encode information in this sense.
4164356	4164814	155	Maxwell	0.99199	Right.
4164932	4173038	156	Maxwell	1	The point of having inner screen structure at all is to kind of retain information to parse your sensory stream.
4173134	4183270	157	Maxwell	1	And yeah, structures like the hippocampus, like these upper brain stem structures, what used to be called the limbic brain and so on, we think that these are all at the top.
4183340	4192330	158	Maxwell	1	The idea, right, is that so you have your sensory motor end, then you have your prefrontal cortex, which is the controller for the sensory motor end.
4192400	4197562	159	Maxwell	0.67686	It's a controller in the sense that its main function is to inhibit activity in the sensory motor area.
4197696	4215810	160	Maxwell	0.99994	But if the main function of prefrontal cortex is to go to the rest of the brain, then there is also a part of the brain whose main function it is to go to the prefrontal cortex, and that is these are these upper regions that we're describing.
4216230	4221490	161	Maxwell	0.86764	So, yes, the memory registers live in this whole stack.
4222150	4228098	162	Maxwell	0.62495	Ultimately, the point about memory is less unique to this apex structure.
4228194	4237590	163	Maxwell	0.99998	What is unique to these top structures, though, is the right only kind of directionality that they don't have any context,
4237670	4238300	164	Maxwell	0.9897	Right?
4238670	4245014	165	Maxwell	0.99999	There is no higher structure that can provide memory to these top layers.
4245062	4246682	166	Maxwell	0.99999	So all they can do is act,
4246816	4247500	167	Maxwell	0.95302	Right?
4248350	4257966	168	Maxwell	0.99994	In particular, they act in a kind of covert fashion on other layers of the brain, I think would be the answer to that.
4258068	4260160	169	Maxwell	0.51217	Mahault, did you want to add anything to that?
4264710	4271250	170	Mahault	0.99923	You touched on the notion of selfhood and how the narrative self unfolds over time and leverages memory.
4271750	4294074	171	Mahault	1	And our model basically established what selfhood the process of selfing is because according to our model and very alike, very like Thomas Metzinger's model of selfhood, it's a process, not a thing.
4294272	4309262	172	Mahault	0.97147	So selfing is the process by which the internal states are capable of mapping to the relevant external states such that they can act in such a way as to fulfill their own needs.
4309396	4314610	173	Mahault	0.99999	This is also very close to what Neil Seth said about the Beast machine.
4315670	4339900	174	Mahault	0.9	And so if you have nested structure and each of these nested structure has a timescale say so you have structures that happen on the milliseconds and some timescales that happen on the scale of a sentence and then some structures that track much longer timescales like your life goal and in your ancestry and stuff like that.
4340270	4352810	175	Mahault	0.95795	You find that memory is just the storing the binning of the relevant information at the timescale at which it is relevant.
4352970	4362766	176	Mahault	1	And so you can retrieve the relevant information for the shorter timescales because it acts as a prior for the lower timescale.
4362878	4365246	177	Mahault	0.99988	Does that help for the narrative?
4365278	4366900	178	Maria	0.74974	So yes.
4367430	4368420	179	Maria	0.99991	Thank you.
4369990	4370740	180	Mahault	0.99999	Awesome.
4375110	4376354	181	Mahault	0.73631	… Sure, go ahead, Samuel.
4376392	4412190	182	Samuel	0.84299	Yeah, about the going back to the Band psychiatrist problem and how you describe consciousness, I think it's very well, it's old in the literature that you can have information processing which is not conscious, but it's mental in some sense in other animals or the beings which are not biological beings.
4412790	4423970	183	Samuel	0.99996	But when you describe your models, I know you have this level also but you also have a level of phenomenal awareness or phenomenal consciousness which you are describing.
4424490	4433880	184	Samuel	0.62	And I think that's the most particularly important part of the model, the phenomenal awareness part.
4436010	4443846	185	Samuel	0.62	And it's the part of the model that can contribute to something new to me in a sense that wasn't described.
4443878	4453950	186	Samuel	0.99643	So I'm glad you mentioned Matzinger because Matsinger is one of the few who have described consciousness as a virtual reality.
4456690	4477430	187	Samuel	0.98	And what I think is interesting about describing consciousness as a virtual reality is that it makes a difference between mental information processing or unconscious information processing and those processes that are conscious because they are simulated somehow.
4481610	4492620	188	Samuel	0.76874	So an interesting thing of having a different language to speak of conscious events is that we can then explain why they are different.
4494670	4508062	189	Samuel	0.9991	We can explain why we have images in our head or something like that, and why these images seem to have causal powers, if they have at all.
4508196	4536638	190	Samuel	0.99616	So when I imagine something, I can make my hand move or something like that and you can describe this only with electrical information or something like that, but it doesn't explain why we have different information processes with consciousness and those without consciousness.
4536754	4546314	191	Samuel	0.99	And I know all theory of consciousness have a distinction between the unconscious and the conscious level.
4546512	4555002	192	Samuel	1	But adding something like the metaphysics of virtual reality would explain the metaphysics of causation.
4555066	4558160	193	Samuel	0.99816	For instance, if you're playing a video game.
4559410	4567150	194	Samuel	0.99923	Does the content of that game matter for causation?
4567510	4572370	195	Samuel	0.99986	Or is it just the information that's stored in the computer that matters?
4574090	4579030	196	Samuel	0.75454	There's a variable there which means a sword.
4579370	4582520	197	Samuel	0.99951	Does it meaning a sword make any difference at all?
4583450	4589270	198	Samuel	0.99	And I think that's something that hasn't been very much discussed in philosophy.
4589350	4600560	199	Samuel	0.64178	So David Chalmers has just written a book recently about virtual reality, but it doesn't apply to consciousness yet.
4601250	4626926	200	Samuel	0.65	And I think if you guys find something in physics that's different, as you guys are trying to do, as you admitted having that aim, then maybe there could be some sort of different physical explanation to conscious causation.
4627038	4629400	201	Samuel	0.99987	So I would like you guys to comment on that.
4629930	4631206	202	Maxwell	0.98181	That's really interesting.
4631388	4637190	203	Maxwell	0.98614	We draw on medsinger's work, on opacity and transparency.
4638730	4645222	204	Maxwell	0.94134	So in medsinger's work, just for the audience, there are two kinds of cognitive processes.
4645286	4657102	205	Maxwell	0.99998	There are transparent processes that we are not aware of as cognitive processes per se, and then there are opaque processes which we are.
4657156	4663150	206	Maxwell	0.98749	So, for instance, the metaphor comes from a transparent or opaque window.
4663490	4672018	207	Maxwell	1	And most of the time, the window just lets you see through it towards whatever is on the other side, but sometimes it's a bit grimy, and then you see the window itself.
4672184	4688714	208	Maxwell	0.93	And so, similarly, there are some processes that mainly deliver things in the world, and then there are other processes that deliver mental processes to us as kind of the object of our perception in some sense.
4688912	4700560	209	Maxwell	0.5458	So these are processes like attention or attentional processing, or paying attention to your own attentional state.
4700930	4705310	210	Maxwell	0.99996	These processes make other processes opaque.
4706210	4716398	211	Maxwell	0.21531	"Terrence Deacon, the anthropologist, also talks about similar phenomena in terms of, like, absent absence and what he calls ""absential phenomena."""
4716574	4723410	212	Maxwell	0.99968	So there's a sense in which this top layer, what it does is implement opacification.
4724330	4730354	213	Maxwell	0.9688	So the top layer can only be about other layers in the stack.
4730482	4745580	214	Maxwell	0.57	And this kind of reversal of the flow of information is, we think, the key to understanding the way that mental processes are made available for introspection at all.
4746510	4749898	215	Maxwell	0.96	Yeah, so that's how I would respond.
4750074	4752078	216	Maxwell	0.97856	Mahault, I saw you turn your camera on.
4752164	4754606	217	Maxwell	1	Do you have more to…
4754628	4756640	218	Mahault	0.98091	No, I don't have more to answer that question.
4757810	4758560	219	Maxwell	0.99971	Cool.
4760850	4764640	220	Mahault	0.70713	So, Thales, do you have another question?
4765810	4787110	221	Thales	0.49	Yeah, I know guys have already discussed some of this before, especially on Twitter, but if you can just repeat it, because if I understood it right when applying the model to human neurobiology, the article kind of seems to account within central neurosystem.
4787870	4789434	222	Maxwell	0.99454	Could you repeat the last thing?
4789552	4791498	223	Maxwell	0.99991	You broke up pretty bad on my.
4791584	4795594	224	Thales	0.8205	Sorry, my laptop is really okay.
4795792	4800460	225	Thales	1	The article seems to align itself to a more modular account of the central nervous system.
4801550	4810160	226	Thales	0.99999	But in contrast to modeler accounts, there are some dynamic distributor approaches that suggest that there are no parts of the brain with dedicated functions, right?
4810690	4816590	227	Thales	0.99999	But regions with various capacities present in software assembled test specific coalitions.
4816750	4822658	228	Thales	0.99974	So these coalitions sometimes are termed like transiently assembled local neuronal subsystems, right?
4822824	4825730	229	Maxwell	0.99	Yeah, we're big fans of big fans.
4826410	4827158	230	Thales	1	Yeah, exactly.
4827244	4840758	231	Thales	0.9863	So these approaches specialism is only a functional footprint and brain functions never the result of fixed networks implementing specific processes, but the result of high order relations between regions.
4840854	4845500	232	Thales	0.98062	So my question with that in mind, knowing that you guys know these kind of approaches, right?
4846110	4855130	233	Thales	0.99	Do I think that the level erco structure implied by the model could be cash out in terms of transient collisions built on the flight, such as flow talents?
4855570	4856078	234	Maxwell	0.99993	Yes.
4856164	4859486	235	Maxwell	0.83	I mean, we have a paper doing that from 2020.
4859588	4865278	236	Maxwell	0.67458	It's called neural and phenotypic representations under the Free Energy Principle.
4865374	4871342	237	Maxwell	0.9	And it is one of our lesser known papers.
4871406	4873620	238	Maxwell	0.99999	Let me just put it in the chat quickly.
4875050	4888070	239	Maxwell	0.9	And so what we show in this paper is that it's possible to simulate the transient formation of Markov blankets that basically track stimulus features.
4888410	4891834	240	Maxwell	0.99485	So there are a lot of moving parts to what you were saying.
4891872	4900400	241	Maxwell	0.99998	On the one hand, yes, you can totally use the Markov blanket formalism to model the transient formation and assembly of these.
4901330	4911630	242	Maxwell	1	I would also add that there's a new perspective on modularity that opens up via the Free Energy Principle.
4913910	4927400	243	Maxwell	0.99895	It's best explored in this paper by Thomas Parr Inesh Ipolito and a few others called modules or mean fields, where the argument and again, this dovetails nicely with what Mike Anderson and his group are doing currently.
4927930	4934978	244	Maxwell	1	The argument is that the specialization of brain regions is not functional, it's computational.
4935074	4945414	245	Maxwell	0.95	And this is effectively what Mike Anderson and company are arguing is that each patch of the brain is specialized in converting certain patterns into other patterns.
4945542	4960026	246	Maxwell	0.99883	It's not like you have a visual region or I think Mike's example is the Broca's area, which is associated with the production of language is actually activated in more non linguistic tasks than in linguistic tasks.
4960138	4970770	247	Maxwell	0.99973	So what that suggests is that each brain area is kind of like contributing certain stereotyped forms of computation to the overall process that's unfolding in the brain.
4971270	4976194	248	Maxwell	0.99	And in the Free Energy Principle literature, you can understand that as a kind of factorization.
4976322	4976614	249	Maxwell	0.94676	Right?
4976652	4986746	250	Maxwell	0.99277	So what and where we have two different streams in the brain, the dorsal and the ventral, which handle what I am seeing and where I am seeing.
4986848	4995238	251	Maxwell	1	And basically the idea is that this anatomical segregation of pathways corresponds to a factorization and inference.
4995334	4998054	252	Maxwell	0.99999	Where you are and what you are are independent.
4998102	4998806	253	Maxwell	0.84344	You could be here.
4998848	4999920	254	Maxwell	0.99713	You could be here.
5003090	5005920	255	Maxwell	0.99	I think I've tried to yeah.
5006930	5009054	256	Mahault	0.99765	So that was a really good answer.
5009172	5014660	257	Mahault	0.97334	I'm going to try and say it a little bit differently and see what sticks to the wall.
5015510	5022386	258	Mahault	0.95371	So each hierarchical level of the brain has markup blankets, right?
5022408	5032870	259	Mahault	0.99377	So remember, these things are nested and they exchange with other levels according to the dependency structures of the mark of blankets.
5033370	5036682	260	Mahault	0.53	And so this is like hierarchical predictive coding, right?
5036736	5045580	261	Mahault	0.99997	So ascending prediction errors can be read as active states, while descending can constitute sensory states from the point of view of a given level.
5047150	5057690	262	Mahault	0.99994	So using this factorization that Maxwell just mentioned, some brain regions become specialized to encode distinct probability factors that are statistically independent.
5057850	5071810	263	Mahault	0.78	And this creates a sort of physiological separation of brain regions, which imply that the information encoded in these regions is conditionally independent of that encoded in other distinct regions.
5072870	5077510	264	Mahault	0.99617	So it allows for the formation of new functions as the brain regions interact.
5078650	5081990	265	Mahault	0.7809	So we get to the point of mental action.
5082330	5104346	266	Mahault	0.99999	This is enabled by the existence of a subsystem that is both irreducible, so there exists no further mark of blanket partitions of the internal states and complex or expressive enough to act like a suitably flexible meta controller.
5104538	5108074	267	Mahault	0.99978	So this metacontroller coordinates overt and covert action.
5108122	5114142	268	Mahault	0.99964	That's the last part of what Maxwell explained, which could be seen as forming transient connections.
5114206	5114530	269	Mahault	0.67481	Right?
5114600	5118050	270	Mahault	0.99942	So that's the point of precision weighting.
5118470	5133138	271	Mahault	0.99878	So the nested scales of increasingly large ensembles of neurons basically form coherently, and so they also have their own Markov blankets.
5133314	5145446	272	Mahault	0.99979	So we can generalize different nested connectivity structures in the brain, where we find formally identical patterns at subordinate levels and superordinate scales.
5145638	5150494	273	Mahault	0.77447	So does that help restructure what Maxwell said?
5150532	5151120	274	Mahault	0.99998	Basically.
5152850	5154334	275	Thales	0.98397	Yes, it did.
5154532	5155280	276	Mahault	0.99962	Awesome.
5157010	5161166	277	Mahault	0.53627	So Samuel still has his hand up.
5161188	5163300	278	Mahault	1	I think Ali also has his hand up.
5164230	5165970	279	Mahault	0.96772	Ali didn't go yet.
5166040	5168100	280	Mahault	0.92039	Samuel, do you mind if Ali goes first?
5170150	5171460	281	Samuel	0.64772	Sure, go ahead.
5173770	5174470	282	Ali	0.54338	Thank you.
5174540	5187530	283	Ali	0.58	Yeah, I just wanted to make a couple of comments about the notion of self evidencing or self modeling that's just been discussed.
5187870	5204720	284	Ali	0.53518	Because, you see, sometimes in philosophical literature, the sensibility of secondary properties are usually they're divided into the sensibility of things in itself and sensibility of things for itself.
5206210	5213780	285	Ali	0.99981	But under these conditions, some philosophers believe that real sensation would not be possible.
5214150	5221794	286	Ali	0.6723	Or as Arthur Rimbo famously put it, I is an other.
5221912	5222674	287	Ali	0.98589	Right.
5222872	5254382	288	Ali	0.99999	But in some recent developments, particularly in process materialism, through the work of people like Thomas Neal, Emmanuel Delanden, Karen Broad, they've tried to somehow overcome this issue, this philosophical distinction between in itself and for itself, by introducing the notion of self receptivity, or, in other words, a capacity to be affected and to affect at the same time.
5254516	5270994	289	Ali	0.99999	Because by introducing self receptivity, then the sensation of each sensed point in the flow can become itself as an other to itself.
5271192	5277634	290	Ali	1	So basically, that distinction between in itself and for itself would be dismantled effectively.
5277762	5300062	291	Ali	1	And that's why it can provide more reliable way to discuss the notion of real sensation, or real even subjectivity, as a flow that just folds on itself and comprises both in itself and by itself.
5300196	5321220	292	Ali	1	And that's also why I believe FEP and active inference can provide, even on the more philosophical note, more reliable way to talk about what it means to sense and be sensed at the same time.
5324230	5325634	293	Maxwell	0.83	I find that very compelling.
5325682	5331606	294	Maxwell	1	I know you and Mahault have been working together, so I think Mahault might have something more insightful than I think.
5331628	5332760	295	Maxwell	0.99992	That's great, though.
5339850	5340840	296	Mahault	1	I agree.
5342730	5353766	297	Mahault	1	I think I like linking these ideas to we wrote in the consciousness text by basically saying that your screen is the folding onto itself.
5353868	5354230	298	Mahault	0.99984	Right.
5354300	5363740	299	Mahault	0.4298	It's going to be seen as the wrapping inside another form the consciousness is riped into the form, is wrapped in the form of the mind.
5365950	5396150	300	Mahault	0.99	And so if you partition internal and external states, and the marker blankets has these different kind of active and sensory states, you can see how the folding basically happens through this loop that isn't necessarily happening, because it's not only happening at one scale, does not have to be non simultaneous.
5396810	5407930	301	Mahault	0.99978	We consider that these things are separated in time simply because we're thinking of one timescale.
5408430	5422880	302	Mahault	0.98482	But so if we add this notion of interaction, we can highlight the dynamic and relational nature of consciousness to refer to the process where the agent and its environment actively shape one another.
5425010	5434862	303	Mahault	0.99982	So the mind creating an inner screen here just reflects its understanding of the world and of itself through like, basically of the world through its own filter.
5434926	5437666	304	Mahault	1	And the filter is a reflection of itself.
5437848	5450470	305	Mahault	0.84786	It's just that, effectively, if there are errors, you need to be able to model what parts of your filter created potentially the error.
5452110	5462860	306	Mahault	0.89054	So, yeah, does that help kind of flesh out this idea of folding onto itself and incoming sensory data?
5468720	5473916	307	Mahault	0.84	I think this question was for Ali or Maxwell, so one of you has.
5473938	5476424	308	Maxwell	0.99	To decide whether I thought it was for Ally.
5476472	5477516	309	Ali	0.99884	That was great.
5477698	5479070	310	Mahault	0.99	Okay, cool.
5480560	5481840	311	Ali	0.75	Yeah, that was great.
5481910	5482530	312	Ali	0.99916	Thanks.
5483620	5484080	313	Mahault	0.99997	Awesome.
5484150	5486530	314	Mahault	0.99833	So, Samuel, I think you have a question.
5487380	5503990	315	Samuel	0.99546	Yes, my final question, I was mostly talking about the hard problem, of course, because I also buy the predictive processing story, and I agree with what you guys are saying.
5505160	5511370	316	Samuel	1	But one issue that I have with the predictive processing story is that.
5513500	5513864	317	Maxwell	0.62729	We.
5513902	5518456	318	Samuel	0.99999	Can apply it to explanations in various ways.
5518638	5531760	319	Samuel	0.53027	So sometimes, like, sometimes you can it seems we can tell any story with the same theory, and it's hard to know which one is true if you can tell multiple stories.
5532180	5538064	320	Samuel	0.97782	So I think that's a problem with predictive processing in general.
5538262	5552980	321	Samuel	0.96	And you can explain, for instance, autism in different ways, and I think people have tried that for your model unconsciousness.
5553400	5557050	322	Samuel	0.99915	How can we know that any of that is true?
5557580	5559016	323	Samuel	0.99976	How empirical is it?
5559038	5571896	324	Samuel	0.78	And during the talk, you guys mentioned something that you were going to test something based on this, which was very promising, and I would like you to comment on that.
5572078	5583708	325	Mahault	0.63496	So Maxwell, he has a really cool paper on the map territory fallacy policy, which I think is part of the answer here.
5583794	5585644	326	Mahault	0.97	And we've also written some.
5585842	5587996	327	Mahault	0.98501	So I'll let Maxwell dig into it.
5588018	5588536	328	Mahault	0.9999	Probably was.
5588578	5590064	329	Mahault	0.99997	Going to be a very fleshed out answer.
5590102	5594352	330	Mahault	0.99998	So I'll give a very small answer which he's going to blow out of the water afterwards.
5594416	5595030	331	Maria	0.99927	But.
5597160	5604580	332	Mahault	1	There are some things we can do to test whether the predictions made by our model actually come to fruition.
5605400	5610824	333	Mahault	0.5922	So that's one way to test the empirical validity of a model.
5610942	5613384	334	Mahault	0.53321	But to keep in mind a model is just a model.
5613422	5621710	335	Mahault	0.97	And so since you have multiple realizability effectively, what really only matters is whether your model actually has any predictive power.
5623120	5644720	336	Mahault	0.99903	So here let's say that we can examine whether the brain structure and function reflect the nested and hierarchical organization which is predicted by our model or whether interventions that alter the brain structure or function lead to changes in conscious experience as we predicted.
5645460	5656916	337	Mahault	0.6929	Or for instance, we can test which parts of the brain relate to which scale of elements that are perceived and then make predictions about the contents of consciousness and their neural correlates to see how well it maps.
5656948	5659290	338	Mahault	0.99873	So these are things that we could empirically test.
5661420	5664730	339	Maxwell	0.8703	I'll just add a bit of meta flavor to that.
5665260	5669976	340	Maxwell	0.94753	So remember, I started with the distinction between dynamics, mechanics and principles.
5670088	5673740	341	Maxwell	0.75608	Personally, I don't like the verbiage of predictive processing.
5675200	5682012	342	Maxwell	0.77839	Frankly, I don't think it the term refers to anything specific when people use the term rigorously.
5682076	5696016	343	Maxwell	0.90728	So Andy Clark introduced the term in his 2013 paper Whatever Next because he wanted to talk about some broad kind of approach, prediction involving approach to explaining cognition.
5696128	5700468	344	Maxwell	1	But at the time he didn't want to commit to any specific implementation of the idea.
5700554	5705440	345	Maxwell	0.99925	So he was like, here's predictive coding, here's hierarchical predictive coding.
5705520	5713828	346	Maxwell	0.99992	But as I'm sure you know, predictive coding makes very specific predictions about the neuronal implementation of the theory.
5713924	5722540	347	Maxwell	0.99983	So in particular, predictive coding assumes that there are distinct neuronal subpopulations that encode the error and the prediction error.
5723120	5737424	348	Maxwell	0.99675	He didn't necessarily want to commit to one version of that because who knows, maybe it's the same sub populations that issue predictions and prediction errors at different times and you have some kind of time based rate coding or whatever going on.
5737622	5741890	349	Maxwell	0.99935	He also at the time didn't want to commit to the Free Energy Principle per se.
5745400	5749200	350	Maxwell	0.83825	But predictive processing doesn't really denote a specific theory.
5749360	5760516	351	Maxwell	0.56	And one of the problems that emerged is there's a whole bunch of literature presenting accounts that are consistent with predictive processing, which doesn't mean anything really.
5760698	5767464	352	Maxwell	0.72641	It just means, hey, you can kind of wave your hands around and this kind of looks like a prediction if you kind of look at it the right way.
5767662	5775336	353	Maxwell	1	I think the more rigorous way to understand this is to bring it back to the math and say that there are principles, mechanics and dynamics.
5775448	5778860	354	Maxwell	0.9997	So there's some phenomenon that we want to explain.
5778930	5781056	355	Maxwell	0.95933	We have a formal description of it.
5781078	5789040	356	Maxwell	0.9999	This might be like a data set or whatever else describing the actual values of whatever system you're considering.
5789380	5800912	357	Maxwell	1	The Free Energy Principle is deployed to construct specific generative models which provide you with the equations of motion that explain that behavior.
5800976	5801156	358	Maxwell	0.99771	Right?
5801178	5810040	359	Maxwell	0.5576	So the generative model is, in effect, a set of linked equations of motions that you see here with these dependence relationships.
5812460	5828044	360	Maxwell	0.99861	So when you actually commit to a specific generative model, then you are in a terrain where you can bring empirical evidence to kind of decide, validate or to falsify the model.
5828162	5833512	361	Maxwell	0.85705	So I would draw your attention to the Free Energy Principle.
5833656	5836716	362	Maxwell	1	We know the Free Energy Principle is true for mathematical reasons.
5836748	5847284	363	Maxwell	0.99997	It would be as silly to try to invalidate the FEP empirically as it would be to try to falsify calculus by trying to observe some phenomenon in the empirical world.
5847402	5849328	364	Maxwell	0.99986	It is true mathematically.
5849504	5854980	365	Maxwell	0.53	And then you use that principle to derive specific models which are then testable.
5855320	5858890	366	Maxwell	0.99738	So I don't know if we've gone all the way here.
5859260	5865130	367	Maxwell	0.9998	So this is somewhere still kind of in between an in principle explanation and a specific model.
5865500	5875224	368	Maxwell	1	To get to more fleshed out empirical predictions of the sort that now was discussing, we would have to get a bit more specific, which we're doing kind of in parallel.
5875352	5885232	369	Maxwell	1	I don't feel ready to discuss the exact predictions and the ways that we'll be discussing them or exploring them, testing them.
5885366	5887020	370	Maxwell	0.99994	This is very much work in progress.
5887100	5897876	371	Maxwell	1	I can tell you it'll involve psychedelics, but that's pretty much where I'm not comfortable extending any more than that.
5897978	5901540	372	Maxwell	0.73	I feel like I might expose a flank that's not ready to be exposed.
5904360	5904820	373	Samuel	0.99564	Perfect.
5904890	5907300	374	Samuel	0.99067	Thanks for that pleasure.
5908680	5911364	375	Maxwell	1	And that brings us to the end.
5911562	5913416	376	Maxwell	0.16935	Thales, you have your hand up again.
5913518	5917400	377	Maxwell	1	Do you want to hop on?
5917550	5918730	378	Thales	0.97	Do we have time?
5919100	5921610	379	Maxwell	0.65	Yeah, I think we have time for one more question.
5922940	5924492	380	Thales	0.887	Daniel, do you want to ask something?
5924546	5926270	381	Thales	0.94839	Because I really asked two times.
5927040	5927644	382	Thales	0.99	Okay.
5927762	5936224	383	Thales	0.99929	Actually, I would like if you guys could delve a little bit deeper in the implications of Maria's first question.
5936422	5966596	384	Thales	0.75498	It's the other side of the coin related to the protopan psychics, the population level conscious or conscious processes in complex organisms sharing phenotype, for example, like end colonies, or in a more speculative sense, like complex organisms aligned and shared, like a distributed generative model in niche building processes,
5966708	5966984	385	Thales	0.50756	right?
5967022	5974172	386	Thales	0.99395	So as Maxwell once said, the other side of the natural selection process.
5974306	5992930	387	Thales	0.636	So given the sparsity and given the transient conversions that these populations are in this specific moment, specific process, can we speculate something about consciousness at this level?
5993560	5994550	388	Thales	0.99602	Thank you.
5996920	5997492	389	Mahault	0.97262	All right.
5997546	6002644	390	Mahault	0.78	I think Maxwell is staying quiet because he expects me to sort of start answering the question.
6002762	6003430	391	Maxwell	0.9999	Correct.
6004920	6010970	392	Mahault	0.95732	So we've done a lot of work in simulating large scale systems, right?
6011420	6026184	393	Mahault	0.99194	So we've simulated niche, we've simulated interaction between one, two, or more actors, what it means for belief sharing, propagation, the formation of mark of blankets, et cetera.
6026312	6051540	394	Mahault	0.58	And so I think the true question would be how transient are the mark of blankets at the level of superstructures and how does it enable those structures to be able to encode information at the level of the interaction between different scales?
6052120	6073132	395	Mahault	0.99898	"So I do think that given our model you can assume that a system is conscious by virtue of having nested parts which can read and write where a superordinate entity level of the structure is ""write only"" and the lower level is also ""write only."""
6073186	6087760	396	Mahault	0.89	And through this sort of boundary of the entity and the interactions between the parts of the entity you have what resembles a conscious process at which you have some degree of perception.
6089540	6094908	397	Mahault	1	The really interesting question there becomes what becomes the irreducible parts?
6095094	6106310	398	Mahault	0.99981	So if you could be understood a little bit like a cell if you as a human, your irreducibility is that your cell as a part of a larger system,
6108280	6113028	399	Mahault	0.99993	what experiences at the system level?
6113194	6116532	400	Mahault	0.92	And I think that's a really truly interesting question.
6116578	6123552	401	Mahault	0.97829	If we look at ants, for instance, ants on their own don't do much computation, right?
6123622	6134240	402	Mahault	0.99998	But ants at a hive then become much more interesting and they behave in a coordinated fashion, which can look as if they were making much more complex computation.
6134336	6136160	403	Mahault	1	And you could say the same for your cells.
6136256	6141632	404	Mahault	0.98405	Your cells in themselves, they have a very simple process, very simple computation.
6141712	6151204	405	Mahault	0.99997	But together, through these large scale emerging coordinating patterns, some of them become your skin, some of them become your brain.
6151348	6171392	406	Mahault	0.93	And the conscious part that you are experiencing at the scale at which you can understand consciousness currently, that's where most information is lost such that the irreducible part of your consciousness is the parts that can become opaque.
6172132	6176322	407	Mahault	0.61561	So I think I've answered most of your question.
6178292	6189812	408	Maxwell	0.86	I would maybe just add that this is not fully chartered territory and I think there may be some agreements and disagreements.
6190632	6207144	409	Maxwell	0.71159	I'm always wary of the intentional misattribution fallacy where we attribute intentionality or mental properties to things that don't end up having them.
6207278	6231664	410	Maxwell	1	I think that the kind of minimal intentionality pan, intentionalism pan, representationalism, whatever you want to call it, that follows from the free energy principle gets you a lot of the intelligent looking behavior without having to posit that there is actually something it's like to be a city or whatever.
6231798	6255192	411	Maxwell	1	What makes me skeptical of the idea that there is such a thing is that what we are suggesting is that what's necessary for consciousness in the stronger kind of agential sense is an external Markov blanket that insulates a bunch of internal states and then that these internal states in turn have this kind of nested structure.
6255532	6264236	412	Maxwell	1	And that's what I don't think there is in say, like a city or like a higher order kind of cultural I'd have to think about this.
6264274	6268204	413	Maxwell	0.95778	So you're kind of pushing at the limits of where I'm comfortable thinking.
6268338	6269948	414	Maxwell	0.99999	Which is appreciated, by the way.
6269970	6272242	415	Maxwell	0.99987	Thank you for the challenging questions.
6273812	6278002	416	Maxwell	0.90055	Yeah, but I think there's room for disagreement and I might be wrong about this.
6278692	6282700	417	Maxwell	0.55	I uh think we just have to keep pushing to find out who's correct.
6282886	6288372	418	Maxwell	0.82716	But I find what Mahault said interesting and compelling and intriguing.
6288872	6294822	419	Maxwell	1	I am just intellectually conservative at this point in my life, being an old man.
6297372	6310172	420	Mahault	0.95784	This is why I think it's a little bit complicated to fully answer that question because we have metaphorical tools but we don't have anything ready yet to go any further.
6311392	6336928	421	Mahault	1	One thing that I like to think about is the only way you're ever going to experience maybe what it's like to be part of a consciousness which is entailed by something more than you is having connection to sort of hyper feed hive mind thing and being kind of pushed and pulled.
6336960	6355256	422	Mahault	0.99998	So if you've ever been part of what a mob or if you are on Twitter and you see people piling on to something and then you talk to them and they're like, I kind of blacked out, I don't know what happened.
6355454	6363144	423	Mahault	0.99997	Because you can't at this part of the hierarchy compute the entirety of what happened.
6363278	6382192	424	Mahault	1	All you can do is understand sort of your path that was part of a larger network of web of paths which themselves, given the priors of the superstructures you're embedded in are kind of sort of going somewhere and represent.
6384292	6384656	425	Mahault	1	the
6384694	6393152	426	Mahault	0.97193	error push of all the people that share a similar type of model that therefore constitutes a cultural direction.
6393652	6404744	427	Mahault	0.57415	So that’s the best way I think we can understand hyper-priors as a function of what it might be like to be a city sort of thing.
6404798	6409082	428	Mahault	0.9999	But that's as far as I can take this metaphor for now.
6410752	6411502	429	Daniel	0.99993	Awesome!
6412032	6414412	430	Daniel	0.99999	Does anyone want to give a final thought?
6414482	6420940	431	Daniel	0.99888	Otherwise, I'll just list just a few points that I found really cool about the discussion and kind of places it takes us at the end.
6421026	6422280	432	Daniel	0.96545	Anyone else want to give us?
6422306	6427442	433	Maxwell	1	I just want to say that the hard problem is really hard and it's called like that for a reason.
6429732	6435184	434	Maxwell	1	I think we're hopefully moving in the direction of making this less mysterious.
6435248	6445732	435	Maxwell	0.66271	But all of this should be taken as very preliminary investigations, really trying to sketch out the bare bones of an explanation.
6446332	6452762	436	Maxwell	0.8	And yeah, there is far more work ahead of us than behind us, I think.
6453132	6455272	437	Maxwell	0.92	Now, any final thoughts?
6457472	6460222	438	Mahault	0.95	I like to think about it in the opposite terms.
6462512	6475740	439	Mahault	0.90613	In terms of the future of evolution can be understood through what it's like to have language and what it's like to have larger scale cognition.
6475836	6481632	440	Mahault	1	And therefore yes, of course, this is very preliminary research, but it's cool to dream.
6485032	6485540	441	Daniel	0.99935	Awesome.
6485626	6486768	442	Daniel	0.9998	Any guest?
6486800	6487216	443	Daniel	0.58387	Maria?
6487264	6487792	444	Daniel	0.623	Samuel?
6487872	6489412	445	Daniel	0.29981	Ali? Thales?
6491672	6493382	446	Thales	0.88499	Yeah, quick one.
6495692	6500616	447	Thales	0.95118	So any prediction on when the other two preference will come out?
6500654	6502282	448	Thales	0.85663	I'm really interested in it.
6505772	6523762	449	Maxwell	0.64323	Inshallah the Mum paper will be released early July right now, reasonably, and then the other one has to do with extending outwards and that might be like another year.
6524772	6537332	450	Maxwell	1	I don't think that's coming soon, but hopefully revisions to this paper will be coming out also over the summer and yeah, I would anticipate July.
6539112	6540756	451	Maxwell	0.96918	Hopefully. We'll see.
6540874	6542822	452	Maxwell	0.80891	There's a lot going on right now!
6545452	6546200	453	Daniel	0.60086	Awesome.
6546366	6549144	454	Daniel	0.49	All right… Samuel, please.
6549198	6555562	455	Samuel	1	I just want to say thank you to everyone for answering my questions.
6556972	6561852	456	Maxwell	0.9941	Well, thank you for your attention, your kind comments and your interest.
6562002	6567000	457	Maxwell	0.9992	It was really fun to discuss and I think you asked a lot of important questions.
6567000	6576012	390	Daniel	0.5	Thales, or anyone else.
6576012	6595772	458	Thales	0.99809	Yeah, I also wanted to thank you so much for having I mean, I know that these kinds of discussions can have lots of implications in many, many other areas, but it was really illuminating and clarifying.
6597572	6599216	459	Maxwell	0.91188	You're too kind, my friend.
6599334	6600562	460	Maxwell	0.99993	Thank you very much.
6601812	6603522	461	Maxwell	0.88833	Yeah, this has been fun. Genuinely!
6603892	6606720	462	Daniel	0.90101	Awesome!
6606806	6609392	463	Daniel	0.9	All right, I'll just give a few comments.
6610552	6614928	464	Daniel	0.86	All right, so first, yes, congratulations to all for the recent papers.
6614960	6621732	465	Daniel	0.96693	It's really exciting to see a kind of continuum and integration with all these different threads.
6622472	6629496	466	Daniel	1	The way that we think of physics and the physics of information and the history and the philosophy of the physics of information.
6629694	6648462	467	Daniel	0.99999	That kind of a gradient might be reimagined such that there's a clearer understanding of when it's the firmware or the kernel of in the tradition of as I see you at all writing sometimes in versus interpretations and that's maybe situational but that's a gray area.
6649552	6653184	468	Daniel	0.99622	Reminds me of the instrumentalist realism debates of 2021.
6653238	6671332	469	Daniel	0.58449	Your with the map and the territory which has been developed out so much further and just the ability, especially in a situation in a model specific way to separate out the intelligence or information structure or the behavior from any kind of qualia type discussion.
6672172	6686948	470	Daniel	1	The recent developments with Chris Fields at all and the waste energy and where free energy goes and the kind of saying like one has forgotten more than someone else has learned.
6687060	6701580	471	Daniel	0.59076	So just the idea that to have awareness, there has to be that discardle and then that might be related to the irreversibility and the time consciousness that also you've been developing the Eco Evo devo components and just multiscale
6701596	6712348	472	Daniel	0.99773	biology, connecting it to traditions of thought and work in biology, which is big, but that's kind of how we retro Grandparent back into biology.
6712540	6742536	473	Daniel	0.98894	Promisingly with the ways that multiscale systems are already considered and then also just the recent developments in category theory and the primacy of the relational and the physics as information processing and then the way that that enables very knowledgeable individuals like you all to come from a lot of the philosophy and the history and all these other threads to come together with the actual modeling in a very satisfying way.
6742654	6747068	474	Daniel	0.7981	So thank you all for the stream and really looking forward to next steps.
6747140	6747762	475	Thales	0.21	
6748932	6749500	476	Thales	0.68771	Bye.
6749596	6750144	477	Mahault	0.99706	Thank you.
6750198	6751072	478	Thales	0.99845	Bye bye.
6752852	6753360	479	Thales	0.99541	Thanks.
6753446	6753692	480	Thales	0.58782	Bye.
