6570	37762	00:06	It's June 19, 2023. We're going to have a presentation and a discussion with Maxwell Ramstead and Mal Abarasan here. Looking forward to your presentation, setting some of the context. Thank you to all of our guests.	Maxwell Ramstead and Mao Abarasan join us for presentation	Presentation and Discussion
37826	291240	00:37	Maxwell Ramstead: Today, I will be discussing our new preprint called the Inner Screen Model of Consciousness. It is about an application of the free energy principle to the problem, the conundrum of consciousness. The overall aim across the papers is to present something like a minimal, unifying model of consciousness premised on the freeenergy principle.

291390	430960	04:51	We're trying to identify a parsimonious mathematical structure that underwrites the different accounts of consciousness that have been developed based on the free energy principle. This model would have determinable descriptions that can be made more specific. It integrates current approaches to consciousness by highlighting their common assumptions.	We are developing a minimal unifying model for consciousness studies	The minimal Unifying Model for Consciousness
431120	640260	07:11	There's a standard distinction in physics that one can leverage between dynamics, mechanics and principles. The free energy principle is at the basis of another kind of mechanics that is becoming known as Bayesian mechanics.

640700	1286470	10:40	There are two main formulations of the free energy principle in the literature. The classical and the quantum. Both rest on this apparatus of the Markov blanket. If boundaries exist in the physical system, then the bulk across the boundary is going to be tracking whatever is beyond the boundary.

1286920	1336496	21:26	The paper is also connected to some neomaterialist formulations of folding onto itself. I'm really happy to see such serious philosophical work being done with the free energy principle as the basis. I think you should be very happy with the end result and proud.	Mao: I think you should be very happy with the end result	Neurophysiology 6, The free energy principle
1336688	1979110	22:16	We're going to derive a model of consciousness by applying the free energy principle to the known neurophysiology of the brain. What I want to suggest now is that you can understand the sparseness as a set of nested Markov blankets.	Free energy principle can be used to model things that have boundaries	Bradley's Markov blankets in the brain
1980360	2210600	33:00	As you ascend the layers which are successively coarse graining each other, there is an irreducible screen that can't further be coarse grained. We believe that this corresponds to something like a naturalized Homunculus. There are so many interesting things to dig on in this paper.

2210670	2656370	36:50	Do you think the type of nested Holographic structure described by the model all exists in biological systems? And regardless of the answer, would you think that it generalizes to larger systems?

2658180	3060890	44:18	Ali: In some of the earlier literature on active inference, there was this emphasis on distinguishing between generative process and generative model. The only two constructs that are at play here are theGenerative model and the variational density that's encoded by internal states. It makes a lot more sense now.
