00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:07,607
DANIEL FRIEDMAN: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:10,170
Daniel: It's June 19, 2023.

3
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:13,447
We're going to have a presentation and a

4
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:13,447
discussion with Maxwell Ramstead and

5
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:17,851
Mahault Albarracin here.

6
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:20,137
So thank you, Maxwell and Mahault, for

7
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,202
joining.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,395
Looking forward to your presentation,

9
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:22,395
setting some of the context, and then

10
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:26,745
thank you to all of our guests.

11
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:28,992
You'll have an opportunity to introduce

12
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:28,992
yourself and give some background when

13
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:33,397
you first give reflections.

14
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:35,659
So on to the slides.

15
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:36,759
Maxwell.

16
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:37,872
MAXWELL RAMSTEAD: Excellent.

17
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:40,134
Maxwell: Well, maybe now and I can just

18
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:40,134
briefly reintroduce ourselves for those

19
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:44,554
of us watching at home.

20
00:00:44,572 --> 00:00:47,828
So, hey, folks, my name is Maxwell

21
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:48,903
Ramstead.

22
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:52,321
I am the director of Research versus AI.

23
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,720
I am a scholar in the tradition of active

24
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:56,720
inference and an expert on the Free

25
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,575
Energy Principle.

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:01,682
Yeah.

27
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,819
And Mahault,

28
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:04,939
would you please?

29
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:06,121
MAHAULT ALBARRACIN: Sure.

30
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:07,207
Mahault: So.

31
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:08,385
My name is Mahault Albarracin.

32
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,567
I work at Versus with Maxwell.

33
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,851
I'm Director of Product for Research and

34
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:13,851
development, but I'm also doing a PhD in

35
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:17,285
cognitive computing.

36
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:20,553
I worked in social sciences and in

37
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:20,553
artificial intelligence in the artificial

38
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:25,018
intelligence field.

39
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:27,278
And I've specifically tried to apply

40
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:27,278
active inference to more socially

41
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:27,278
grounded questions and sometimes more

42
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:27,278
abstract and representational questions,

43
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:27,278
diving all the way down to the philosophy

44
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:40,550
that can be attached to it.

45
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:44,939
Maxwell: Thank you, Mal.

46
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:47,022
So, yeah, I'm very pleased to present

47
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:48,030
this work.

48
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,068
Today, Mao and I will be discussing our

49
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:51,068
new preprint called the Inner Screen

50
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:57,125
Model of Consciousness.

51
00:01:57,126 --> 00:02:00,095
And it is about basically an application

52
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:00,095
of the Free Energy Principle to the

53
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:06,152
problem, the conundrum of consciousness.

54
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:09,187
So just to give a little bit of

55
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:09,187
background and now I'll just be walking

56
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:09,187
through the slides, if at any point you

57
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:09,187
want to jump in and add complete correct,

58
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:20,298
please feel free to do so.

59
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:25,339
This is work that started in late last

60
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:27,369
year and continued throughout the year.

61
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:30,396
It's preoccupied us quite a bit, actually,

62
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,409
, over the last while.

63
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:35,443
Mao and I are the lead authors on this,

64
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:35,443
what has now become a series of papers,

65
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:35,443
with one more preprint coming out,

66
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:35,443
hopefully before the end of the month,

67
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:35,443
and another in the works, hopefully

68
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:35,443
before the end of the year, with the same

69
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:51,600
core group of authors.

70
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:54,635
So obviously Mao, as well as Adam Saffron,

71
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:54,635
, Alex Keefer, Brendan Klein, Chris

72
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:59,682
Fields and Karl Friston.

73
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:02,657
And the follow up papers include a bunch

74
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:04,671
of other authors.

75
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:07,706
So we've been working with some pretty

76
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:07,706
cool folks on this, folks listed here and

77
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:12,752
others.

78
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:14,770
Yeah.

79
00:03:14,772 --> 00:03:16,795
So the overall aim across the two or

80
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:16,795
three papers is to present something like

81
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:16,795
a minimal, unifying model of

82
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:16,795
consciousness premised on the Free Energy

83
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:24,874
Principle.

84
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,899
In the paper that we're discussing today,

85
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:26,899
we are presenting, as I was intimating a

86
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:26,899
moment ago, a model of consciousness that

87
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:26,899
follows directly from applying the Free

88
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:26,899
Energy Principle to well understood human

89
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:37,006
neurophysiology.

90
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:41,045
The take home message of today's talk is

91
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:44,074
that, well, let me take one step back.

92
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:46,098
There has been a lot of discussion in the

93
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:46,098
literature over the last decade about

94
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:46,098
whether the Free Energy Principle has

95
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:46,098
anything unique to teach us about

96
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:53,168
consciousness.

97
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,194
And there have been responses pro and

98
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,200
contra.

99
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,173
And I think that the question up until

100
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,192
recently was just unsettled.

101
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:04,213
We would like to suggest a positive

102
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:05,229
response to that question.

103
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:08,255
And as such, one of the take home

104
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:08,255
messages is that actually, yes, a model

105
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:08,255
of consciousness can be directly derived

106
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:08,255
from the Free Energy Principle applied to

107
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:17,347
explain known neuroanatomy.

108
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:21,389
And I guess the kind of technical message,

109
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:21,389
, the technical part of the takeaway is

110
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:21,389
that consciousness has or is isomorphic

111
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:21,389
to a nested holographic mathematical

112
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:34,513
structure.

113
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:38,552
So this sounds like a mouthful, might

114
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:39,569
sound a little crazy.

115
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:43,607
We are going to unpack this presently.

116
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:48,653
Now, did you want to add anything to

117
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:48,656
that?

118
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,681
Mahault: No, all good.

119
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:52,693
Maxwell: Excellent.

120
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:55,725
So the original paper that we wrote

121
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:55,725
turned into, like a 24,000 word

122
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:55,725
monstrosity of a paper, and it was

123
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:55,725
elephantine both in the sense that it was

124
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:55,725
very large and also in the sense that of

125
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:55,725
the soupy parable of the blind men and

126
00:04:55,725 --> 00:05:11,825
the elephant.

127
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:13,848
What we're trying to do is in some sense,

128
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:13,848
identify a parsimonious mathematical

129
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:13,848
structure that underwrites the different

130
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:13,848
accounts of consciousness that have been

131
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:13,848
developed based on the Free Energy

132
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:22,937
Principle.

133
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,963
I'll spare you the original paper

134
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:26,970
structure.

135
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:28,994
I said a moment ago that we were

136
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:31,021
developing a minimal unifying model.

137
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:34,056
This is a notion that was proposed by our

138
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:34,056
friend and colleague Vanya Visa, I

139
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:40,116
believe, a few years ago now, in 2020.

140
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:43,149
And Vanya at the time was noticing, well,

141
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:43,149
the field of consciousness studies is

142
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:43,149
replete with a bunch of different models

143
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:43,149
and theories, and there seems to be no

144
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:43,149
end in sight to the multiplication of

145
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:57,285
these theories.

146
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:00,257
And the idea is maybe what the field

147
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:00,257
needs is not one additional N plus one

148
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:00,257
theory of consciousness, but rather a

149
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:00,257
minimal unifying model by which Vanya

150
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:00,257
means a model that specifies only

151
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:16,415
necessary properties of consciousness.

152
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,437
So this doesn't come with, like, a strong

153
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:18,437
sufficiency claim, really, like, what are

154
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:18,437
the kind of rudimentary building blocks

155
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:18,437
that are necessary for consciousness in

156
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:25,505
general.

157
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,528
This model would have determinable

158
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:27,528
descriptions that can be made more

159
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:30,549
specific.

160
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,572
So it's kind of a base model that can be

161
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:32,572
expanded to cover different varieties of

162
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:35,606
conscious experience.

163
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:37,628
And finally, that it's minimal and

164
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:37,628
unifying in the sense that it integrates

165
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:37,628
current approaches to consciousness in no

166
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:37,628
small part by highlighting their common

167
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:45,709
assumptions.

168
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:50,751
So kind of pointing to a least common

169
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:53,784
denominator of all existing accounts.

170
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:56,815
And so what we have tried to do in this

171
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:56,815
paper is to well, in this series of

172
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:56,815
papers is to engage in this analysis and

173
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:56,815
this mummy analysis, if you will, for

174
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:56,815
theories of consciousness premised on the

175
00:06:56,815 --> 00:07:10,899
Free Energy Principle directly.

176
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,923
So it's worth quickly discussing the Free

177
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:14,933
Energy Principle.

178
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:17,960
I'm almost embarrassed to do this at the

179
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Active Inference Institute, but it's

180
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:17,960
always worth going through this very

181
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,010
quickly.

182
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:24,038
So there's a standard distinction in

183
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:24,038
physics that one can leverage between

184
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:29,085
dynamics, mechanics and principles.

185
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:32,110
The Free Energy Principle, as it says on

186
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,124
the tin is a principle.

187
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,161
So principles are kind of the foundation

188
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:37,161
of a hierarchy of theory building in

189
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:41,206
science, as it were.

190
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:43,228
Top of the hierarchy are formal

191
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:43,228
descriptions of behavior what are known

192
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:47,265
as dynamics.

193
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,295
So if you're applying dynamical systems

194
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:50,295
theory to understand the time evolution

195
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:50,295
of some system, you're in the realm of

196
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:56,353
dynamics.

197
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:59,382
Arguably, folks like Kepler and Galileo

198
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,346
were also in the realm of dynamics.

199
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,370
So I see some empirical phenomenon and I

200
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:04,370
produce a formal description of that

201
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,397
behavior.

202
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,427
Mechanics comes into play when we move

203
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:09,427
from Kepler and Galileo to Newton, when

204
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:09,427
we move from merely describing some

205
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:09,427
behavior to providing equations of motion

206
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:09,427
that allow us to explain why that

207
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:09,427
behavior has the particular shape that it

208
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:24,570
does.

209
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:27,605
So classical mechanics, for example,

210
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:27,605
gives us an account of gravitational

211
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:27,605
force and explains why orbits are shaped

212
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:35,681
the way they do.

213
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,711
So if galileo and kepler just noticed the

214
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:38,711
shape of orbits and provided a formal

215
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:38,711
description of them, newton explains

216
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:38,711
where that shape comes from in some sense,

217
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:38,711
, and principles, in turn, explain where

218
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:51,840
mechanics come from.

219
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:53,867
So classical mechanics come from the

220
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:53,867
principle of least action or stationary

221
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:53,867
action, which, very roughly speaking, is

222
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:53,867
the principle according to which no more

223
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:53,867
or no less energy is used than necessary

224
00:08:53,867 --> 00:09:07,947
to perform some physical movements.

225
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:08,956
That kinetic.

226
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:11,983
And potential energies balance out such

227
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:11,983
that the true paths of a system through

228
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:11,983
its state space are those for which that

229
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:18,052
balance equals zero.

230
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:21,085
The principle of least action explains

231
00:09:21,085 --> 00:09:24,115
where classical mechanics comes from.

232
00:09:24,116 --> 00:09:25,126
In some sense.

233
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:28,156
And similarly, the Free Energy Principle

234
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:28,156
is at the basis of another kind of

235
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:28,156
mechanics that is becoming known as

236
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:34,218
Bayesian mechanics.

237
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:36,237
You can think of the Free Energy

238
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:36,237
Principle as having the same relation to

239
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:36,237
Bayesian mechanics as the principle of

240
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:43,305
least action has to classical mechanics.

241
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:46,338
And Bayesian mechanics is the physics of

242
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,355
probabilistic beliefs.

243
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:51,381
So it's a physics that connects the

244
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:51,381
properties of the system that you're

245
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:51,381
considering the physical properties of

246
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:57,441
the system.

247
00:09:57,445 --> 00:10:01,426
In particular, the information entropy of

248
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:01,426
states of a system to the connects the

249
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:01,426
thermodynamic entropy of the states of a

250
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:01,426
system to the information entropy of the

251
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:01,426
beliefs that a system has about the

252
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:20,616
systems to which it is coupled.

253
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:21,620
Here.

254
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,648
A probabilistic belief means a

255
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:23,648
probability density in a very general

256
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:28,690
sense.

257
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:30,710
We're not assuming some kind of

258
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,710
contentful motion of belief like you

259
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,748
might find in philosophy.

260
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:34,752
Really.

261
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:36,775
This is about kind of a tracking relation.

262
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:36,775
.

263
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:39,800
But we'll get that to that in actually,

264
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,812
just a few slides.

265
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,833
There are two main formulations of the

266
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,851
Free Energy Principle in the literature.

267
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,871
The classical and the quantum.

268
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:50,909
Both rest on this apparatus of the Markov

269
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:50,916
blanket.

270
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:54,950
The Markov blanket definitionally is the

271
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,976
degrees of freedom that separate.

272
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:59,000
But couple two systems.

273
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:02,971
Or rather, two things within a larger

274
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:02,978
system.

275
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:06,010
It's effectively a statistical boundary

276
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,010
that allows us to say that, well, given

277
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,010
this boundary, the inside is independent

278
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:13,087
of the outside.

279
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:18,133
The way that we express the dependencies.

280
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:18,133
.

281
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:21,166
So taking one step back quickly, this is

282
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:21,166
a dynamic systems approach to cognition,

283
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:21,166
to self organizing systems, and to

284
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:30,252
physical systems more generally.

285
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:33,280
It is a dynamical systems approach in the

286
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,280
sense that we're using the tools of

287
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,280
dynamical systems theory to examine the

288
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,280
time evolution of a system, its

289
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:41,369
trajectory in its state space.

290
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,401
And in this context, a generative model

291
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:45,401
is used to encode the relations of

292
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:45,401
dependence that obtain in the time

293
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:52,476
evolution of the system.

294
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,526
So this is important and I've been kind

295
00:11:57,526 --> 00:11:57,526
of making this point maybe ad nauseam for

296
00:11:57,526 --> 00:12:06,554
the last, I guess, half decade.

297
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:08,578
But the generative model is not a model

298
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:10,593
that you have in your head.

299
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:15,642
It is a statistical model that represents

300
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:15,642
the conditional dependence structure of

301
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:15,642
the entire system that you're considering.

302
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:20,697
.

303
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:25,744
So this is an environment agent system in

304
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,766
the broadest sense.

305
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:31,803
And the Free Energy Principle says that

306
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,803
if a specific sparseness structure

307
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,803
obtains so if things are disconnected in

308
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,803
a special way, then it'll look as if the

309
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,803
subsets that are disconnected are

310
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:45,941
tracking each other.

311
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:49,979
So more technically, we partition our

312
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,000
system into particles.

313
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:54,030
Particles are basically internal states

314
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,030
shrouded behind their Markov blanket,

315
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,030
where the Markov blanket is composed of

316
00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:01,040
sensory states and active states.

317
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,074
Sensory states affect internal states but

318
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:04,074
are not affected by internal states and

319
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:04,074
active states affect external states but

320
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:13,169
are not affected by external states.

321
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:19,227
This separation of causal dependence and

322
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:19,227
this structure intervening between the

323
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:19,227
two bulk subsets of the system is really

324
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:28,318
critical.

325
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:31,347
The Free Energy Principle says if my

326
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:31,347
generative model, which encodes all of

327
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:31,347
the dependencies of the system, if my

328
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:31,347
generative model contains a Markov

329
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:31,347
blanket in the sense that we just defined,

330
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:31,347
, then we are basically licensed in our

331
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:31,347
interpretation of internal states as

332
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:31,347
basically tracking external states where

333
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:31,347
tracking has a specific mathematical

334
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:52,558
definition.

335
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,589
In this context, tracking means to encode

336
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:56,589
the parameters of some probabilistic

337
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:00,578
belief about external states.

338
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,603
So to the extent that we want to call

339
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:03,603
this representation, we should note that

340
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:03,603
this is not a representation in the

341
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:03,603
typical tele semantic sense of having

342
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:03,603
some internal states track some external

343
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:14,711
features.

344
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:18,757
What we're saying is that basically if I

345
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:18,757
have a Markov blanket, then my internal

346
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:18,757
states are basically shaping a belief

347
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:26,832
about the external world.

348
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,857
And I think that's really critical to

349
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:29,865
understand.

350
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,899
And this is where the inference and the

351
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,911
modeling bit comes from.

352
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,932
This kind of tracking relationship,

353
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:36,932
formally speaking, is approximate daisy

354
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:39,963
and inference.

355
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,986
So basically, in a nutshell, the Free

356
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:41,986
Energy Principle says in our physical

357
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:41,986
universe as we understand it, with the

358
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:41,986
usual mechanics running in the background,

359
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:49,064
, right?

360
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:52,089
Classical relativistic, quantum and

361
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:52,089
statistical, if boundaries exist in the

362
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:52,089
physical system, then the bulk across the

363
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:52,089
boundary is going to be tracking whatever

364
00:14:52,089 --> 00:15:02,134
is beyond the boundary.

365
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:05,160
So in a nutshell, this is what the Free

366
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,174
Energy Principle says.

367
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:08,193
Now, I noticed you put some stuff in the

368
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:08,196
chat.

369
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:10,216
Would you mind using your voice to

370
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:11,224
compliment.

371
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:13,244
Mahault: Yeah, I was just saying that

372
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:13,244
this part that you were just explaining

373
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:17,284
often seems kind of esoteric to people.

374
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,312
But it's critical to understand the

375
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:20,312
sparseness of the coupling because then

376
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:20,312
you kind of start understanding where

377
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:26,372
perspective comes from.

378
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:29,409
And if you have perspective, you also

379
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:29,409
have the capacity to assess causality

380
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:29,409
starting from a point and extending

381
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:39,506
outwards to something else.

382
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:43,542
And this is true from any so that's what

383
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,557
I wanted to add.

384
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:45,568
Maxwell: Thank you, Mala.

385
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,589
I think that's useful addition.

386
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:49,602
Yeah.

387
00:15:49,602 --> 00:15:51,625
So this is the classical formulation of

388
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,642
the Free Energy Principle.

389
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:57,683
There is a new hip funky formulation that

390
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:57,683
has become available over the last half

391
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:57,683
decade due to Chris Fields, Jim

392
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:57,683
Glazebrook and their colleagues, the so

393
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:57,683
called quantum information theoretic

394
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:13,779
formulation of the FEP.

395
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:13,788
Fear not.

396
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,812
This doesn't appeal directly to quantum

397
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:16,818
mechanics.

398
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:19,844
Rather, it appeals to the tools that have

399
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:19,844
been used to extend information theory in

400
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:19,844
the context of quantum mechanics, which

401
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:19,844
allow you to calculate like all sorts of

402
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:19,844
funky wave equations and propagation

403
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:30,957
operators and all that.

404
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,975
We don't have to get into the details.

405
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:34,996
Basically, it's just a way to reframe

406
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:35,005
what I just said.

407
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:37,025
So what I just said is if there's a

408
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:37,025
boundary in my physical system, then the

409
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:37,025
things across the boundary will look as

410
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:43,087
if they're tracking each other.

411
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:47,127
Another way of saying that is, well, this

412
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:47,127
boundary is a kind of screen green takes

413
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:47,127
on a particular sense in quantum

414
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:56,214
information theory.

415
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,249
We don't necessarily have to get into the

416
00:16:59,249 --> 00:16:59,249
details of it, but basically you can

417
00:16:59,249 --> 00:16:59,249
think of these degrees of freedom that

418
00:16:59,249 --> 00:16:59,249
couple the two systems as a kind of

419
00:16:59,249 --> 00:16:59,249
probabilistic surface and you can think

420
00:16:59,249 --> 00:16:59,249
of the bulk across either side of the

421
00:16:59,249 --> 00:16:59,249
boundary as in alternation reading and

422
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:18,375
writing information onto the blanket.

423
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:21,403
So any Markov blanket whatsoever can be

424
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:21,403
construed as a classical information

425
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:21,403
channel or a screen and in effect, all of

426
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:21,403
the classical information that you need

427
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:21,403
to describe the way that things across

428
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:32,519
the boundary.

429
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,546
So the so called bulk of the system,

430
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:35,546
couple to one another, is contained on

431
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:39,586
the boundary.

432
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:42,613
It encodes the classical information that'

433
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:42,613
's necessary to describe the couplings

434
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:45,647
within the system.

435
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,697
This is holography.

436
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:53,722
This is the hologram.

437
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:55,741
Not in the sense of Holography.

438
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,773
Although we might discuss senses in which

439
00:17:58,773 --> 00:17:58,773
these things are intertwined, we're using

440
00:17:58,773 --> 00:17:58,773
the word Hologram in the sense of the

441
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:07,804
Holographic principle from physics.

442
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:10,833
The Holographic principle is a principle

443
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:10,833
that was originally discovered in the

444
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:15,884
context of black hole thermodynamics.

445
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,907
And what it basically tells us is

446
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:17,907
necessarily from the point of view of an

447
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:21,946
external observer.

448
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:25,983
Some bulk in physical space can only

449
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:25,983
contain as much information as can fit

450
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:30,003
onto its surface.

451
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,005
So this echoes what we were just

452
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,007
discussing about Markov blanket.

453
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:37,010
The physical reason is that if a bulk

454
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,010
collapses into a black hole and the bulk

455
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,010
contained any more information than could

456
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,010
be fit onto its boundary then we would

457
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:49,022
basically be losing information.

458
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:51,024
And that would violate the conservation

459
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:51,024
of classical information also known as

460
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:51,024
the principle of unitarity in quantum

461
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:51,024
mechanics which basically says that

462
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:59,032
information is never lost.

463
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:04,031
So we're using the word Hologram in that

464
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:05,032
sense.

465
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:07,034
This is different from the sense of

466
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
Hologram everyone has seen, like the

467
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:10,037
Hologram of Tupac.

468
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:12,039
Or does that make me look seem old at the

469
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,041
Super Bowl a few years ago?

470
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,043
Or maybe Pokemon cards, maybe that also

471
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:18,045
makes me seem old now.

472
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:20,047
I don't know what the kids are doing, but

473
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:20,047
you've seen like red baseball cards and

474
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:20,047
stuff like that with different

475
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:20,047
superimposed picture layers that become

476
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:28,055
visible as you move.

477
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,057
That's not the sense of Hologram that's

478
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:31,058
at stake.

479
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:34,061
Although maybe so we'll get to why, but

480
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:34,061
we'll focus on the Hologram theoretic

481
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:38,065
formulation.

482
00:19:38,065 --> 00:19:41,068
So, to summarize, in the Holographic

483
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
principle version of the Free Energy

484
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
Principle, the quantum information

485
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
theoretic version of the principle, all

486
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
of the classical information that I need

487
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
as an external observer to characterize

488
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
the coupling between two subsystems of a

489
00:19:41,068 --> 00:20:00,081
larger system exist on the boundary.

490
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:02,083
And that's a pretty remarkable physical

491
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,084
fact.

492
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:07,088
And a few years ago, Chris Fields, Jim

493
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
Glazebrook and Mike Levin proposed that

494
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
maybe this kind of information

495
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
concentrating bottleneck architecture

496
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
also has application to consciousness in

497
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:21,102
the form of an internal screen.

498
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:24,105
So the idea was that the information that

499
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
I bring to bear, to parse my sensory

500
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
stream and make sense of what is

501
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
constantly bombarding me, it has to live

502
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:31,112
somewhere.

503
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:34,115
And so the idea is, well, it lives in

504
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:35,116
this inner screen.

505
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:38,119
So you basically have an external Markov

506
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,119
blanket, which is a Markov blanket just

507
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:41,122
in the usual sense.

508
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:45,126
And then the idea is well within the set

509
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:45,126
of internal states that are kind of

510
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:45,126
partitioned off from the organisms due to

511
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:53,134
the organism's Markov blanket.

512
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:56,137
Then you would have an internal Markov

513
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:56,137
blanket structure within those internal

514
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,139
states.

515
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,136
This is prediction six from their great

516
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:01,136
paper.

517
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:04,139
Minimal physicalism internal awareness

518
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,141
requires internal boundaries.

519
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:09,144
And there's this interesting connection

520
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
to integrated information theory I am

521
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
agnostic with respect to IIT, so we're

522
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:16,151
not going to go there today.

523
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,153
But for those of you who are interested,

524
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:18,153
this kind of inner loop mechanism seems

525
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:18,153
to generate positive integrated

526
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:24,159
information.

527
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,161
So there's an interesting connection

528
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:26,161
there.

529
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:29,164
Before I move on to Neurophysiology, I'll

530
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,166
hand things over to Mao.

531
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,167
If you wanted to add anything.

532
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,171
Mahault: Yeah, actually I was literally

533
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
about to type something that this is

534
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
actually also connected to some

535
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:36,171
neomaterialist formulations of folding

536
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:45,180
onto itself.

537
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:49,184
So maybe this is something worth digging

538
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,186
into a little later in the talk.

539
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,188
Maxwell: Awesome.

540
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,189
Then we shall.

541
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,192
And I believe that Ali is also a co

542
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,194
author on the paper and we have him.

543
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,191
So congratulations, by the way, on the

544
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:02,191
preprint.

545
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:05,194
I saw it released and Mao has told me

546
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:05,194
about it.

547
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,197
I'm really happy to see such serious

548
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:08,197
philosophical work being done with the

549
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:12,201
Free Energy Principle as the basis.

550
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:15,204
I think you should be very happy with the

551
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:16,205
end result and proud.

552
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:21,210
But now let me get back to my monologue.

553
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,215
So rather our Mao and my diet.

554
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,217
It's not really a dialogue.

555
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:29,218
It's sort of like I don't know how to

556
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:29,218
call it.

557
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:35,224
Anyway, I'm thinking in French.

558
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:37,226
I have the words in French, I promise.

559
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:40,229
So now that we've, you know, reviewed in

560
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:40,229
a very much too short, way too brutally

561
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:40,229
fast fashion the Free Energy Principle

562
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:40,229
and its core formulations, we're now

563
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:40,229
going to derive a model of consciousness

564
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:40,229
by applying it to the known

565
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:54,243
neurophysiology of the brain.

566
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,244
Are you ready?

567
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:57,246
You buckled up?

568
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:58,247
Okay, good.

569
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,244
So we have just said that the FEP can be

570
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:01,244
used to model things that have boundaries.

571
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:03,246
.

572
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:06,249
I submit to you that the brain is a thing

573
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
with boundaries and importantly, a lot,

574
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:12,255
many, several internal boundaries.

575
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:17,260
So in particular, we know that the brain

576
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,262
has a very sparse structure.

577
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:23,265
So if you think of just the raw numbers,

578
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:23,266
right?

579
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:27,270
There are roughly on the order of 100 and

580
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,273
5160 billion neurons in the brain.

581
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:34,277
But each neuron only makes about

582
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
something like, I want to say five

583
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
figures, because I've spent so long, ten

584
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:45,288
to the five connections, right?

585
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:51,294
My neurophysiology is a bit far behind me,

586
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:51,294
, but it's something on the order of a

587
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:51,294
few thousand to maybe tens of thousands

588
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:57,300
of connections per neuron.

589
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,297
So obviously, if you just think about it,

590
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:00,297
most neurons are not connected to each

591
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:03,300
other, not directly.

592
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:06,303
And furthermore, the brain has a

593
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:08,305
hierarchical structure.

594
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,307
And when you think about it, what is a

595
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:11,308
hierarchy?

596
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,310
A hierarchy is a sparse connectivity

597
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,311
structure, right?

598
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:16,313
So if you think about a hierarchy of

599
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:16,313
connectivity, what having a hierarchical

600
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:16,313
structure means, at the end of the day,

601
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:16,313
this isn't some statement about power

602
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:16,313
dynamics where things at the top of the

603
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:16,313
hierarchy are more important than things

604
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:28,325
at the bottom.

605
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:31,328
Your cortical neurons don't drain more

606
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:34,331
juice than other parts of the brain.

607
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:36,333
The neurons in those parts.

608
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:39,336
What we're talking about is a regular

609
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:39,336
sparse pattern of connectivity, where I

610
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:39,336
only make connections to the layers

611
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:39,336
directly below me and to the layers

612
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:48,345
directly above me.

613
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:50,347
What I want to suggest now is that you

614
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
can understand the sparseness as a set of

615
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:50,347
nested Markov blankets, and that's going

616
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:57,354
to do a lot of heavy lifting for us.

617
00:24:57,354 --> 00:25:00,351
So the discussions here are based on two

618
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:01,352
papers.

619
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:03,354
One by Fields and colleagues called

620
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:03,354
neurons as hierarchies of quantum

621
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:07,358
reference frames.

622
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:08,359
It's really cool.

623
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,360
I recommend it.

624
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,363
And also a paper by Inesh Ipolito, myself

625
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:12,363
and our colleagues on Markov blankets in

626
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:16,367
the brain.

627
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:19,370
So this is going to be a much too short

628
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
summary of those discussions, but

629
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
basically, you can start with individual

630
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
neurons and then talk about their Markov

631
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
blankets to bring it back to something

632
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
that I was saying earlier, but that I

633
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
didn't emphasize while we were going

634
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:34,385
through the slides.

635
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:36,387
The Markov blanket identifies dynamical

636
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:36,387
dependencies, not necessarily physical

637
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:39,390
boundaries.

638
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,393
So it's a statistical boundary it's not

639
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:42,393
necessarily like the boundaries of a wall,

640
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:45,396
, like a cell.

641
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:48,399
In the case of formalizing individual

642
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
neurons with Markov blanket we would

643
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
associate the post synaptic conductance

644
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
with the internal states, the post

645
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
synaptic voltage with the active states,

646
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
the presynaptic conductance to external

647
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
states and the presynaptic voltage to

648
00:25:48,399 --> 00:26:06,411
sensory states.

649
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,413
You have some equations of motion that

650
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
tell you how each of these quantities

651
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:12,417
change and what they depend on.

652
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:15,420
And you'll notice that this has the

653
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
dependency structure of a Markov blanket

654
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
where the internal states only depend on

655
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
sensory active and internal states, the

656
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,420
active states only depend on internal

657
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:29,434
states, and so on.

658
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,436
So it respects the dependency structures

659
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:31,436
that we were discussing a bit earlier,

660
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:31,436
where again, the sensory states can only

661
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:31,436
depend on other blanket states and

662
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:41,446
external states and so on.

663
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:43,448
So here we have a nice dynamic Markov

664
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:43,448
blanket that we carve around our neurons.

665
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:46,451
.

666
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:49,454
And then there are two directions that we

667
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:49,454
can go.

668
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:53,457
We can ascend the scales towards

669
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:53,457
canonical microcircuits and then cortical

670
00:26:53,457 --> 00:26:53,457
columns, individual brain regions, whole

671
00:26:53,457 --> 00:27:04,463
brain networks and so on.

672
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:07,466
And at each of these successive scales of

673
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:07,466
self organization you can similarly

674
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:12,471
identify Markov blanket.

675
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:15,474
If you want to discuss this in more

676
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:15,474
detail, you can go see the paper by Inesh

677
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:20,479
and myself and colleagues.

678
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:25,484
You can also go from the individual

679
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
neuron down towards gated channels,

680
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:33,492
towards synapses dendrites and the soma.

681
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:35,494
So the body of the cell, all of these

682
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:38,497
things have successive Markov blanket.

683
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:41,499
And so all throughout the brain's

684
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:41,499
organization at the different scales at

685
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:45,504
which itself organizes.

686
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:47,506
You have this nice structure of nested

687
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:50,509
Markov blankets, of Markov blankets?

688
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:51,510
Of Markov blankets.

689
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,513
So that's one clear immediate sense in

690
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:57,515
which there are these blankets.

691
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:59,518
And you can start to think of these

692
00:27:59,518 --> 00:27:59,518
blankets as screens in the way that we

693
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:05,518
just were talking about.

694
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,520
A slightly more illustrative example of

695
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:07,520
what we're talking about here is Markov

696
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,525
blankets and predictive coding.

697
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,527
This is a figure pretty typical in the

698
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,528
predictive coding literature.

699
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:19,532
What it tells you is that the brain has a

700
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:19,532
series of levels or layers, where

701
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:19,532
superordinate layers are basically

702
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:19,532
passing predictions about sensory input

703
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:19,532
onto subordinate layers and subordinate

704
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:19,532
layers are shuffling prediction error

705
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:36,548
back up to the superordinate layers.

706
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,551
This is probably like I'm almost

707
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:38,551
embarrassed again to discuss this at the

708
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:42,555
active inference institute.

709
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,558
I'm sure everyone is quite familiar with

710
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,559
these things already.

711
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,562
The novelty that we are introducing here

712
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:49,562
is to say well, each of these layers is

713
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:49,562
connected to each other via a Markov

714
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:54,567
blanket.

715
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,570
And so that's I think like a key insight

716
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:57,570
is that each of these layers has internal

717
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:57,570
states and communicates to other layers

718
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:57,570
through what you can formalize as a

719
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:05,572
Markov blanket.

720
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:08,575
So you can understand at any given scale

721
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:08,575
of brain activity, you can understand the

722
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:08,575
different levels of message passing as

723
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:17,584
successively nested screens.

724
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:21,588
The cool thing is that what each of these

725
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:21,588
screens is doing in some sense is course

726
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:27,594
graining, the stuff in the screen below.

727
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:30,597
So in some sense each screen is kind of

728
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:30,597
implicitly contained in the following one.

729
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:33,600
.

730
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,602
And what you end up having is a kind of

731
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:35,602
nested structure of screens of screens of

732
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:35,602
screens of screens, which is, I think,

733
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:41,608
pretty cool.

734
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:45,612
We recover, as you'll note in this figure,

735
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:48,615
, the inner screen hypothesis.

736
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:51,618
Each of these, this is probably a better

737
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:53,620
way to visualize it.

738
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,623
You have at the left the kind of external

739
00:29:56,623 --> 00:29:59,626
Markov blanket of the organism.

740
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:02,623
It is segregating or carving out a set of

741
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:04,625
internal states.

742
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:07,628
And what we're saying is these internal

743
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:07,628
states have a layered level structure, a

744
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:07,628
sparse structure that we can formalize

745
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:16,637
using nested Markov blanket.

746
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:19,640
And like I was saying, each screen

747
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:19,640
successively coarse grains the next

748
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,643
screen.

749
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:25,646
And this gives some flesh to this notion

750
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:25,646
of contextual computing, this idea that

751
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:25,646
really what the brain is, is an organ of

752
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:25,646
context where each layer is providing

753
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:25,646
context to the layer below and where each

754
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:25,646
layer is attuning to increasingly higher

755
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:25,646
order, slower and more physically

756
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:47,668
widespread regularities.

757
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:51,672
So one thing that we're proposing here,

758
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
which is a novel hypothesis that we

759
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
intend to test empirically over the next

760
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
few years, is that this architecture has

761
00:30:51,672 --> 00:31:01,676
two special layers.

762
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:05,680
In some sense you can think about it as

763
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,682
write only layers.

764
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:11,686
So if you're thinking about the stack,

765
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
the sensory periphery or the sensory

766
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
bottom, in one sense can only write in

767
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
one direction, it can only write into the

768
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
system and the topmost level can only

769
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:27,702
write downwards.

770
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:29,704
This is a key architectural feature.

771
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:31,706
One thing to point out is that in the

772
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:31,706
paper we associated the topmost level to

773
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:36,711
structures like the hippocampus.

774
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:39,713
We don't need to suggest that the

775
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:39,713
hippocampus is uniquely the top of this

776
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:43,717
hierarchy.

777
00:31:43,718 --> 00:31:46,721
Rather there is probably a whole bulk of

778
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
structures that basically cannot any

779
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:51,726
longer be coarse grained.

780
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:53,728
So you kind of have like an executive

781
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:54,729
level top.

782
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,731
And what's particular about this top is

783
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:56,731
that it can only write down into the

784
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:59,734
stack.

785
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:03,732
So its function really is to be about and

786
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:03,732
monitor the other layers of the stack,

787
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:03,732
implementing a form of covert action

788
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:03,732
which trickles down throughout the stack.

789
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:13,742
.

790
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:16,745
So, Mahault, I saw you write some stuff.

791
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:18,747
Would you like to add?

792
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:21,750
Mahault: Yeah, so I think one of the

793
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,750
things that's important to highlight is

794
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,750
why some things can only write up and

795
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:30,759
some things can only write down.

796
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,763
And what this means for irreducible, the

797
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:34,763
irreducible mark of blanket, which is the

798
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:34,763
part where experience happens because

799
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:34,763
there's a counter that and some future

800
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:34,763
questions that are going to happen that

801
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:34,763
relates to superstructures and then why

802
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:34,763
don't we experience the consciousness of

803
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:53,782
a superstructure?

804
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:56,785
So I think it might be important to dig

805
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:57,786
into that a little bit.

806
00:32:58,787 --> 00:32:59,788
Maxwell: Absolutely.

807
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:01,784
Thank you.

808
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:04,787
So, yeah, to summarize then, there are

809
00:33:04,787 --> 00:33:08,791
basically two, right, only layers.

810
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,793
As you ascend the layers which are

811
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
successively coarse graining each other,

812
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
there is an irreducible screen that can't

813
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:18,801
further be coarse grained.

814
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:20,803
We believe that this corresponds to

815
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:23,806
something like a naturalized Homunculus.

816
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:25,808
And we're calling this perspective (with

817
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:27,810
an intentional provocation) -

818
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,813
"we're calling this perspective ""

819
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
"Neocartesian,"" in the sense that we may

820
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
have in some sense identified the

821
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:30,813
processes that make it seem as if there

822
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:41,824
was something like a Homunculus."

823
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:44,827
Obviously we're not - or maybe not

824
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:46,829
obviously! It's worth saying we are not

825
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:46,829
falling into the Homunculus fallacy

826
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:46,829
because we're not claiming that the

827
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:52,835
topmost layers perceive themselves.

828
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:56,839
So the buck stops with the top layers and

829
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:56,839
the top layers can only perceive

830
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:56,839
themselves vicariously by acting through

831
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:03,840
other layers.

832
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,844
And we associate this action of layers of

833
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:07,844
internal Markov blankets on each other

834
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:07,844
with attention in particular and other

835
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:16,853
neuromodulatory effects.

836
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:18,855
So I mean the overall picture is one

837
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
where consciousness is intrinsically

838
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
related to overt and covert actions, to

839
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
the overt acting and sensing associated

840
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
with the external Markov blanket and with

841
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
the covert actions that are being

842
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
deployed within the stack and in

843
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
particular that are issued by the very

844
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:38,875
top set of levels.

845
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,877
As I said, this is not necessarily a

846
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:41,878
strict hierarchy.

847
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:43,880
It could be a hierarchy with several

848
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,881
different tops.

849
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:46,883
But this integrated top structure we

850
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
believe could be associated with a

851
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:50,887
naturalized Homunculus.

852
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:54,891
I'm going to skip through the rest and

853
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,894
thank you for your attention.

854
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,896
Unless Mahault wants to add something.

855
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,898
Mahault: Just one thing is, I think to

856
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:07,898
put it in simpler terms as well, the two

857
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:07,898
layers that can only write can't store

858
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:13,904
memories.

859
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:17,908
Because that's right, memories is not

860
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:17,908
just an encoding, it's a process of

861
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:23,914
retrieval.

862
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,916
And it requires interactions between

863
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
different levels, which is why the lowest

864
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
levels are only interacting with things

865
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
which are external and therefore can't

866
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
necessarily store and can't make direct

867
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
interactions with anything else within

868
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:25,916
the entity itself, and the highest level

869
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:42,933
as well.

870
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,935
So there is no memories being encoded at

871
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:44,935
these two levels, which is why they're

872
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,939
right only and not.

873
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,942
I think that helps a little bit.

874
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:53,944
Maxwell: Thank you.

875
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:54,945
Yeah, I would agree.

876
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,948
So thank you all for your attention.

877
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,950
Thank you in particular, Dan, for the

878
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,945
invitation.

879
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:04,949
It's always great to be at the A-Double-

880
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:04,949
-I! And yeah, we [were] looking forward

881
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:09,954
to this discussion.

882
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:19,964
Mahault: I think Daniel said he wasn't

883
00:36:19,964 --> 00:36:23,968
going to do too much animation, so if

884
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:27,972
people have…

885
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:31,976
Maxwell: Are you going to do any

886
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:35,980
facilitation at all, Dan?

887
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,981
Mahault: Yeah.

888
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:37,982
MARIA LUIZA IENNACO: Okay.

889
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:40,985
Maria: So thanks Maxwell and Mahault for

890
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:41,986
the amazing talk!

891
00:36:42,987 --> 00:36:46,991
There are so many interesting things to

892
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:46,991
dig on in this paper, I don't know even

893
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:50,995
where to start.

894
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:53,998
But I do have one question too, actually,

895
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:54,999
in particular.

896
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,004
So: Does this inner screen model imply a

897
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
kind of proto-panpsychism or a more

898
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:05,004
restricted bio-psychism?

899
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:09,008
I mean, do you think the type of nested

900
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:09,008
Holographic structure described by the

901
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:16,015
model all exists in biological systems?

902
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:19,018
And regardless of the answer, would you

903
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
think that it generalizes to larger

904
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
systems comprising these systems, like

905
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:27,026
populations and colonies and so on?

906
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:28,027
Maxwell: Maybe I can take

907
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:30,029
a quick stab at that.

908
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:33,032
So we think that the Free Energy

909
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:33,032
Principle itself commits you to a kind of

910
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:40,039
I don't know what the right word is.

911
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,041
We're writing a paper now.

912
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:45,044
We're struggling with the exact coinage,

913
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:48,047
but it's not quite a pen psychism.

914
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:51,050
It's a pen representationalism or a pen

915
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,050
tracking ism, if you'll allow me, the

916
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:57,056
absolutely disgusting neologism.

917
00:37:57,056 --> 00:38:00,053
Basically what the FEP implies is that

918
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
anything that has a boundary, it looks as

919
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
if it's tracking what's beyond the

920
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:06,059
boundary.

921
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:09,062
So at a very basic level, the FEP kind of

922
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:11,064
licenses this talk about anything.

923
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:14,067
So anything whatsoever looks as if it's

924
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
tracking what's across the boundary by

925
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:18,071
virtue of existing.

926
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:22,075
So at a very basic level, if I see a rock

927
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:22,075
outside, I know that it's not 1000

928
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:28,080
degrees Celsius outside.

929
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:28,081
Right.

930
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:31,084
The fact that a rock has a specific

931
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:31,084
structure entails something about its

932
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:34,087
environment.

933
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:37,090
Likewise, I can see you, Maria, you are

934
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,092
not wearing a winter parka.

935
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:41,094
And I can infer from that that it's

936
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:41,094
probably room temperature around you and

937
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:41,094
not like you're not somewhere in

938
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:47,100
Antarctica or wherever else.

939
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,102
So this kind of basic tracking

940
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:52,105
relationship applies to everything.

941
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:56,109
What we've tried to do in this paper is

942
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:56,109
to start spelling out more explicitly

943
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:56,109
what the difference is between just rocks

944
00:38:56,109 --> 00:39:06,113
and rock stars in some sense.

945
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:08,115
Like, what is the special kind of

946
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,115
structure that you need to add to the

947
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:11,118
Markov blanket?

948
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,120
And what you'll notice is that you get

949
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,120
consciousness by making the overall

950
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,124
structure more sparse.

951
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:20,127
So as you make more of the connectivity

952
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:20,127
zero, you get all of these weird things

953
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:20,127
that pop up, one of which is we think

954
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:29,136
like this consciousness structure.

955
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:32,139
Mao has thought about this maybe more

956
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:32,139
than I have, so I'd be curious to get her

957
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:37,144
perspective.

958
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:40,147
Mahault: Well, so I know that people are

959
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
a little bit wary of panpsychism, so we

960
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
usually add the term proto in front of it.

961
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:47,154
.

962
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:50,157
And so the idea is that we have to

963
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:50,157
deconceptualize what consciousness means.

964
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:53,160
.

965
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,163
And oftentimes what we mean is something

966
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:59,165
that resembles what humans do.

967
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:03,164
And we have to be a little bit if we take

968
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:03,164
our formalism consciousness can become

969
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:11,172
emergent at the scales where humans are.

970
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:15,176
But it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist

971
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:15,176
at lower scales, where the inertia or the

972
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:21,182
entropy generated by policies is lower.

973
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:25,186
So if you think of a rock, its policy is

974
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:28,189
pretty much maintained bonds.

975
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:29,190
You know what I mean?

976
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,191
There's nothing else.

977
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:33,194
The scale at which some kind of thing

978
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:33,194
exists and changes is much different than

979
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:39,200
you deciding to have coffee.

980
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,202
But in effect, your cells could be

981
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
something that we could consider exist,

982
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
closer to something that a rock does and

983
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:41,202
even lower just the proteins that make up

984
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:50,211
your system.

985
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:54,215
So if we understand that there is

986
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:54,215
nestedness and that the conscious process

987
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:54,215
happens once you have this capacity to

988
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:54,215
exchange information across layers,

989
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:54,215
anything that has the stacking of layers

990
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:54,215
in a nested fashion is in effect, proto

991
00:40:54,215 --> 00:41:16,231
conscious.

992
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:19,234
But we have to be very careful about what

993
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:21,236
we load into.

994
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:23,238
The term conscious, I think, is mainly

995
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:24,239
the question.

996
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,241
Maxwell: I'm sharing my screen here.

997
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:30,245
This is from a paper on path integrals,

998
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:33,248
particular kinds and strange particles.

999
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:37,252
So it is a typology of different kinds of

1000
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:37,252
Markov blankets and different kinds of

1001
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:41,256
particles.

1002
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:44,259
So something like a rock, it still has a

1003
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
Markov blanket, but its Markov blanket is

1004
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
not partitioned into sensory and active

1005
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:50,265
states.

1006
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:53,268
There are no states that have this

1007
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:53,268
property that active states have that

1008
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:53,268
they affect the external world that are

1009
00:41:53,268 --> 00:42:00,269
not affected by it.

1010
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:01,270
In return.

1011
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,273
A rock just has sensory states.

1012
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:06,275
If I kick a rock, unless it's radioactive,

1013
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,277
, it's not going to act on me.

1014
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:12,281
It only has the inference part of active

1015
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:12,281
inference.

1016
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:15,284
It's only kind of changing its state as a

1017
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:15,284
response to the forces that are acting on

1018
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:18,287
it.

1019
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:21,290
Active particles are particles that have

1020
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,292
both sensory and active states.

1021
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:26,295
And you might think, for example, of a

1022
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:26,295
cell.

1023
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:30,299
A cell has this kind of structure.

1024
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,303
Particles like ourselves have additional

1025
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:34,303
sparseness in the Markov blanket, in

1026
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:34,303
particular, what we call strange

1027
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:39,308
particles.

1028
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,312
The internal states of strange particles

1029
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:43,312
do not have direct access to the active

1030
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:43,312
states of strange particles, and

1031
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:49,318
therefore they need to be inferred.

1032
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,321
And this is what gets you planning.

1033
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:55,324
At the end of the day, a strange particle

1034
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
can only exist by kind of inferring

1035
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
itself into existence precisely because

1036
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:55,324
there are no direct connections between

1037
00:42:55,324 --> 00:43:08,331
the active and the internal states.

1038
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:11,334
So as you remove connectivity from the

1039
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:11,334
overall structure from here to here, you'

1040
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:17,340
're adding sparseness.

1041
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,342
From here to here, you're adding

1042
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:20,343
sparseness.

1043
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:23,346
As you make the system more and more

1044
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:23,346
sparse, you get more and more interesting

1045
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:29,352
behavior to emerge from the system.

1046
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:31,354
And you can think of the topmost

1047
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:31,354
structure that we were describing as an

1048
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:31,354
instance of this broader architecture

1049
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:31,354
where the topmost layer doesn't have

1050
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:31,354
direct access to the active states of the

1051
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:44,367
system.

1052
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:47,370
And therefore, it kind of has to go

1053
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:47,370
through the entire bulk of the system to

1054
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:52,375
infer itself into existence.

1055
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:59,382
Mahault: So there's a few hands up there

1056
00:43:59,382 --> 00:43:59,382
on Google where you can see the people

1057
00:43:59,382 --> 00:44:04,381
who share hand.

1058
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:05,382
Okay.

1059
00:44:05,382 --> 00:44:07,384
So, Ali, I think you raised your hand

1060
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
first.

1061
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:11,387
Ali: Yes.

1062
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:14,391
Thank you again for your crystal clear

1063
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:16,393
and really illuminating talk.

1064
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:21,398
I've written down three questions, but

1065
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:21,398
maybe I'll begin with probably the most

1066
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:26,403
basic and naive one.

1067
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:29,406
So in some of the earlier literature on

1068
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:29,406
active inference and the FEP, there was

1069
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:29,406
this emphasis on distinguishing between

1070
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:38,415
generative process and generative model.

1071
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:43,420
But in this paper, in figure one, which

1072
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
you also shown in your slides, we don't

1073
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
see any generative process in the diagram.

1074
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:51,428
.

1075
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:55,432
So where does generative process fit into

1076
00:44:55,432 --> 00:44:56,433
this diagram?

1077
00:44:57,434 --> 00:45:01,432
Because the way I see it, it's basically

1078
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
somehow included in the generative model

1079
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:07,438
or I don't know.

1080
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:11,442
What is the distinction between these two

1081
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,443
concepts?

1082
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,446
Maxwell: So you'll have to forgive some

1083
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:15,446
of the earlier literature for this, there'

1084
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:20,451
's some terminological inconsistency.

1085
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,455
The only two constructs that are at play

1086
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
here are the generative model and the

1087
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
variational density that's encoded by

1088
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:30,461
internal states.

1089
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,462
That's it.

1090
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,466
So it is not the case that the FEP is

1091
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:35,466
about how the generative models the

1092
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:40,471
generative process.

1093
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,474
A lot of this language comes from

1094
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:43,474
previous Bayesian approaches and in

1095
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:48,479
particular, the helmholtz machine.

1096
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,481
In the helmholtz machine.

1097
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,484
So helmholtz machines are some of the

1098
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:54,485
earlier predictive coding machines.

1099
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:58,489
And in the helmholtz machine, basically

1100
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
you have a forward pass that connects the

1101
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
sensory end to basically the top of the

1102
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
predictive hierarchy and then a backwards

1103
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:58,489
pass connecting top of the model back to

1104
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:12,497
the sensory end.

1105
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:15,500
And in a helmholtz machine, you would

1106
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:15,500
call the forward pass a recognition model

1107
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:15,500
and the backwards pass a generative model.

1108
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:20,505
.

1109
00:46:21,506 --> 00:46:23,508
The forwards passes a recognition model

1110
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
because you're inputting some data and

1111
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
then basically by the time the

1112
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
information trickles up to the top, you

1113
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:30,515
have recognized what caused the data.

1114
00:46:31,515 --> 00:46:33,518
And the backwards pass is called a

1115
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:33,518
generative model for the reasons that are

1116
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:33,518
sometimes invoked in the predictive

1117
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:33,518
coding literature where you're basically

1118
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:33,518
generating possible sensoria given a

1119
00:46:33,518 --> 00:46:45,530
certain configuration of states.

1120
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,533
So we don't use recognition and

1121
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:51,536
generative in that sense anymore.

1122
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:53,538
And I apologize.

1123
00:46:53,538 --> 00:46:56,541
In some previous publications, I've been

1124
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:56,541
a bit sloppy in the way that I use my

1125
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:56,541
language and I've used the term

1126
00:46:56,541 --> 00:47:01,540
recognition density.

1127
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:06,545
What's really at stake is and I'll share

1128
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:10,549
my screen just to help make the point.

1129
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,551
It's what it says here.

1130
00:47:13,552 --> 00:47:16,555
So you have your generative model,

1131
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:16,555
right?

1132
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:18,557
Your generative model is a joint

1133
00:47:18,557 --> 00:47:19,558
probability density.

1134
00:47:19,558 --> 00:47:21,560
So what is a joint probability density?

1135
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:25,564
Well, you have a bunch of different

1136
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
basically states that your system is

1137
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
defined over and you have a probability

1138
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
density that the shape of which captures

1139
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:25,564
the way that states can change over time.

1140
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:40,579
.

1141
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,582
So, like, if I change this way, then I

1142
00:47:43,582 --> 00:47:44,583
need to change in that way.

1143
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:47,586
And that's what this shape encodes.

1144
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:50,589
And what the FEP says is if my generative

1145
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,589
model has a certain sparseness, if it has

1146
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,589
Markov blanket, then there's this

1147
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,589
additional probability density that I can

1148
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:59,598
define.

1149
00:47:59,598 --> 00:48:01,594
It is parameterized by the internal

1150
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:03,596
states of the system.

1151
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:06,599
It's called the variational density.

1152
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,602
And this is like my probabilistic best

1153
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:09,602
guess about what's causing my external

1154
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:12,605
states.

1155
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:16,609
At no point do you need to appeal to any

1156
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:16,609
other bits of generative process when you'

1157
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:16,609
're actually coding these models up in

1158
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:25,618
MATLAB or in Python.

1159
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:27,620
What we call the generative process is

1160
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:27,620
just the equations of motion that govern

1161
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,623
external states.

1162
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:33,626
So if you actually hand code one of these

1163
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:33,626
one day, your generative process might

1164
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:33,626
include like, Newtonian physics and

1165
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:38,631
whatever else.

1166
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:41,634
It's sort of just like what is the

1167
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:41,634
process that actually animates the

1168
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:45,638
dynamics of external states?

1169
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,643
In some very simple models, like in the

1170
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:50,643
ones used by Miguel Aguilera and

1171
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:50,643
colleagues, you're looking at linear

1172
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:50,643
dissipative systems and they don't have

1173
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:59,652
any dynamics right.

1174
00:48:59,652 --> 00:49:02,649
So basically, the system kind of just

1175
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:03,650
dissipates.

1176
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,652
A linear dissipative system is a dampened

1177
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:07,654
spring physically, right?

1178
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:08,655
So it just goes spring and then it

1179
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,657
dissipates to the fixed point.

1180
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:13,660
So similarly, you may or may not have

1181
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660
dynamics to the external states and that'

1182
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,660
's what gets harnessed in the generative

1183
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:19,666
process.

1184
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:20,667
This should be clear.

1185
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
Yeah.

1186
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:22,669
Sorry. Mahault.

1187
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:25,672
Mahault: No, I mean, I think what the

1188
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
question that Ali is asking also has some

1189
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
important correlates that often get asked

1190
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
to us, like what's the difference between

1191
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:37,684
consciousness or dreaming?

1192
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:41,688
Or what's the difference between a dead

1193
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:45,691
system that decays or being psychotic?

1194
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:49,696
And I think what Maxwell is saying is our

1195
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:49,696
system currently doesn't say anything

1196
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:49,696
about your actual connection to the real

1197
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:49,696
world other than a thing, which is

1198
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:49,696
successful at being a thing, is probably

1199
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:49,696
well joined relative to its needs to the

1200
00:49:49,696 --> 00:50:06,707
world.

1201
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:11,712
And therefore your relation to reality

1202
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:11,712
has probably got a better grasp if you

1203
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:11,712
are functional for a longer amount of

1204
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:24,725
time, this minus senescence.

1205
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:28,729
So yeah, does that kind of help also,

1206
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:29,730
Ali?

1207
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,731
Ali: Yes.

1208
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:32,733
Thank you both.

1209
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:35,736
It really makes a lot more sense now.

1210
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:37,738
Thank you so much.

1211
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:39,739
Maxwell: Well, it's my pleasure.

1212
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,742
And remember, model just means joint

1213
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:42,743
probability density here.

1214
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:43,744
Right?

1215
00:50:45,746 --> 00:50:48,749
There's a criminally underappreciated

1216
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
paper that Karl wrote in Entropy in 2012

1217
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
called {the} “A Free Energy Principle for

1218
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:48,749
Biological Systems,” which is where a lot

1219
00:50:48,749 --> 00:51:00,755
of the Markov blanket story comes from.

1220
00:51:00,755 --> 00:51:02,757
And in that paper, Karl refers to the

1221
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:02,757
generative model as just the generative

1222
00:51:02,757 --> 00:51:04,759
density.

1223
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:06,761
So it's basically saying there's an

1224
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:08,763
underlying probability density;

1225
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:11,766
it describes the way that the dynamics

1226
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:13,768
are being generated just generally;

1227
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:19,774
and then if that density has the

1228
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
appropriate structure, meaning if it has

1229
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
like, zeros in the right places, then you

1230
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
can define this other tracking density

1231
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:19,774
that approximates the generative model or

1232
00:51:19,774 --> 00:51:35,790
density.

1233
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:42,797
Ali: And I also have a follow up question,

1234
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
, which I'll ask after Samuel and Thale's

1235
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:46,801
questions.

1236
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:50,805
Samuel: Okay, thanks for the excellent

1237
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:51,805
talk.

1238
00:51:53,808 --> 00:51:56,811
I'm a professor at the State University

1239
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:58,812
of Minas Gerais.

1240
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:02,811
I'm a philosopher, cognitive scientist,

1241
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:03,812
psychologist.

1242
00:52:05,814 --> 00:52:08,817
So I work mainly on reasoning.

1243
00:52:09,818 --> 00:52:13,822
But by reading your paper, what strikes

1244
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:13,822
me as most promising is the possibility

1245
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:13,822
of solving the hard problem of

1246
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:13,822
consciousness, if this goes right in

1247
00:52:13,822 --> 00:52:29,838
progressing this model.

1248
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:34,842
But maybe an important part of that

1249
00:52:34,842 --> 00:52:34,842
depends on exactly what is meant by

1250
00:52:34,842 --> 00:52:34,842
holograms, and exactly what this brings

1251
00:52:34,842 --> 00:52:46,855
into a theory as an explanation,

1252
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:47,856
right?

1253
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:50,859
So during your presentation, you were

1254
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:50,859
talking something about that there's a

1255
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:50,859
difference between holography in the

1256
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:50,859
sense of bringing light to something to

1257
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:50,859
make a projection; but you said that

1258
00:52:50,859 --> 00:53:05,868
might be related as well.

1259
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:10,873
So I'm quite curious about how to use

1260
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:10,873
this concept and how to understand it in

1261
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:10,873
a more folk-psychology sense; and also

1262
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:10,873
like where it comes from, because I'm not

1263
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:26,889
a physicist.

1264
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:31,894
So does it depend on string theory to be

1265
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:32,895
correct?

1266
00:53:33,896 --> 00:53:36,899
Could you dive in a little more on this

1267
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:38,901
concept first?

1268
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:42,905
Maxwell: Mahault, I think this is more a

1269
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:43,906
“you” question.

1270
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:47,910
Mahault: So for the holographic screen

1271
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:48,911
theory.

1272
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:50,913
So basically, remember, Maxwell really

1273
00:53:50,913 --> 00:53:52,915
gave a good explanation.

1274
00:53:52,915 --> 00:53:54,917
I kind of thought I had answered your

1275
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:54,917
question, but I'm going to give a little

1276
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:55,918
bit.

1277
00:53:55,918 --> 00:53:58,921
So the boundary between any two mutually

1278
00:53:58,921 --> 00:53:58,921
separation systems, a and B, is the

1279
00:53:58,921 --> 00:53:58,921
holographic screen that encodes the

1280
00:53:58,921 --> 00:53:58,921
eigenvalues of the interaction that

1281
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:08,925
couples A and B.

1282
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:11,928
So this is very similar to how a hologram

1283
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:11,928
encodes information about 3D objects onto

1284
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:15,932
a 2D surface.

1285
00:54:16,933 --> 00:54:19,936
So A hologram stores information about

1286
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:19,936
the phase and the amplitude of light

1287
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:19,936
reflected from an object, and this allows

1288
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:19,936
the reconstruction of a 3D image from a

1289
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:28,945
2D surface.

1290
00:54:29,945 --> 00:54:31,948
And so here, similarly, the holographic

1291
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:31,948
screen encodes information about a system'

1292
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:31,948
's interaction with its environment,

1293
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:31,948
which allows for the prediction and

1294
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:39,956
control of the system's behavior.

1295
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:44,961
Samuel: Yeah, but does it maybe allow for

1296
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:46,963
the creation of an image?

1297
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:47,964
That's the sort of question.

1298
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:51,968
Mahault: Yeah, this is where we're giving

1299
00:54:51,968 --> 00:54:52,969
it some thought, actually.

1300
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:54,971
So the creation of an image is a complex

1301
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:56,973
idea because what's an image, right?

1302
00:54:56,973 --> 00:55:01,972
But effectively, there is some work being

1303
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:01,972
done into information geometry and how

1304
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:01,972
that may potentially interact with matter

1305
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:01,972
in order to transmit information,

1306
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:16,987
basically.

1307
00:55:16,987 --> 00:55:19,990
And so it's possible that the

1308
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
reconstruction of information is done

1309
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
through fields being changed such that

1310
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
the modalities you have through your

1311
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
senses, such as sight, hearing, touch,

1312
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
are relative to the way that the

1313
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
information needs to be transmitted in

1314
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
terms of amplitude and velocity, et

1315
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
cetera, which, in effect, gives you

1316
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:49,020
something like light.

1317
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:54,025
But that research is still relatively

1318
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:55,026
early.

1319
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:57,028
So, yes, it is promising.

1320
00:55:57,028 --> 00:55:59,030
It is leading in that direction.

1321
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:03,028
It's probably one of the most interesting

1322
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:03,028
formalism because it touches on the

1323
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:03,028
connection between dynamics, matter, and

1324
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:03,028
how information allows for matter to be

1325
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:15,040
organized.

1326
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,043
But all those pieces haven't properly

1327
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:19,044
been put together.

1328
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:23,048
It is heading there, though.

1329
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:26,051
Maxwell: I would just add: So the

1330
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:26,051
original monstrosity of a paper had a

1331
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:26,051
section on explaining where qualia come

1332
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:26,051
from based on the statistical patterns of

1333
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:34,059
the input.

1334
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:36,061
But as Mahault said, it was very early

1335
00:56:36,061 --> 00:56:37,062
work.

1336
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:38,063
And, I mean, the core model was more or

1337
00:56:38,063 --> 00:56:39,064
less developed.

1338
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:42,067
So we decided to spin that out as a

1339
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
separate thing and then develop the inner

1340
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
screen model of consciousness per se, to

1341
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
flesh out a little bit or to add some

1342
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:42,067
flesh to what Mahault was saying, which

1343
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:56,081
is already pretty meaty as it is.

1344
00:56:57,082 --> 00:57:01,080
Have you heard of these experiments where

1345
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,080
they take a little pad with little pins

1346
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:07,086
on it and they basically reconstruct?

1347
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:10,089
Well, they plug a camera on your head and

1348
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:10,089
they put this little pad on your tongue,

1349
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:10,089
and they blindfold you, and they

1350
00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:17,096
basically have you navigate.

1351
00:57:17,096 --> 00:57:20,099
And the camera generates a kind of

1352
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
grayscale version of the image, but with

1353
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:20,099
the little pins in terms of how far they

1354
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:29,108
push in.

1355
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:32,111
Samuel, are you seeing the image that I'm

1356
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:33,112
discussing?

1357
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:33,112
Samuel: No.

1358
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:35,114
Maxwell: You have a little pad.

1359
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:38,117
It has little pins that can push at

1360
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:40,119
various depths.

1361
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:43,122
And what you can do is basically

1362
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
translate the image from the camera into

1363
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
a different array of, like, assorted pins.

1364
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:50,128
.

1365
00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:52,131
And so, yeah, you put this on your tongue,

1366
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:52,131
, and if you blindfold yourself and use

1367
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:52,131
this camera for about 20 to 30 minutes,

1368
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:52,131
the brain eventually recognizes that, oh,

1369
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:52,131
this is supposed to go to the visual area.

1370
00:57:52,131 --> 00:58:02,135
.

1371
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:05,138
And then you start to see through your

1372
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:06,139
tongue.

1373
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:10,143
In some weird way, the body actually

1374
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:10,143
recognizes the statistical frequencies of

1375
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:10,143
the pins actually pushing onto your

1376
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:18,151
tongue.

1377
00:58:18,151 --> 00:58:21,154
This is experienced not as, like, a

1378
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:21,154
physical sensation, but actually visually

1379
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:21,154
like you start to experience an

1380
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:21,154
impoverished, grayscale visual field just

1381
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:21,154
from the sensations that are being fed to

1382
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:21,154
your tongue, which suggests that there's

1383
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:21,154
something deeply deep about the

1384
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:21,154
statistical structures of the signals

1385
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:21,154
that are being processed and the way that

1386
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:45,178
the qualia show up in your experience.

1387
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,183
But this is still, like, super far off,

1388
00:58:50,183 --> 00:58:50,183
and I wouldn't have the pretension to

1389
00:58:50,183 --> 00:58:50,183
claim that we've cracked where qualia

1390
00:58:50,183 --> 00:58:56,189
come from just yet.

1391
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:01,188
Samuel: Yeah, I get what you're saying

1392
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:02,189
now.

1393
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:07,194
Different patterns can make different

1394
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:08,195
quality.

1395
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:12,199
You don't need different magic to have

1396
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:13,200
different quality.

1397
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:17,204
But yeah, I was wondering how that

1398
00:59:17,204 --> 00:59:20,207
related to the holograms, but okay.

1399
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,210
It's something in development, as you're

1400
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,211
saying.

1401
00:59:24,211 --> 00:59:26,213
Maybe I should let someone go and then I'

1402
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:26,213
'll go back to these consciousness

1403
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:29,216
questions.

1404
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:30,217
Mahault: Sure.

1405
00:59:31,217 --> 00:59:32,219
So, Thales.

1406
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:35,222
Thales: Well, thank you all.

1407
00:59:35,222 --> 00:59:37,224
It was a great presentation and great

1408
00:59:37,224 --> 00:59:38,225
test, by the way.

1409
00:59:38,225 --> 00:59:39,226
IMAX.

1410
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:39,226
Thank you.

1411
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:40,227
Hi, everyone.

1412
00:59:41,228 --> 00:59:43,230
I'm sorry, you guys are facing like a

1413
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:44,231
black screen right now.

1414
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:45,232
My camera is off.

1415
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:45,232
Sorry.

1416
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:46,233
Okay.

1417
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:50,237
I'm an anthropologist psychologist, so I'

1418
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:52,239
'm kind of an outsider in here.

1419
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:55,242
I'm not from the Active Inference Lab too.

1420
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:55,242
. So I study it, but I'm not a specialist

1421
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:59,246
in it.

1422
00:59:59,246 --> 01:00:02,537
So my questions are kind of broad and

1423
01:00:02,537 --> 01:00:05,225
they're actually really simple.

1424
01:00:05,295 --> 01:00:07,913
But I think that I'm only allowed to make

1425
01:00:07,913 --> 01:00:09,070
one question right per row.

1426
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:15,635
Actually, my first question will be

1427
01:00:15,635 --> 01:00:15,635
something that Maria was talking about

1428
01:00:15,635 --> 01:00:21,259
before this meeting started.

1429
01:00:21,268 --> 01:00:23,494
So in the article account, consciousness

1430
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:23,494
is an attribute of things that possesses

1431
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:28,929
an reducible marker blanket, right.

1432
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,196
With active states, exerting influence

1433
01:00:30,196 --> 01:00:32,385
and over external dynamics.

1434
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:34,576
So when applying to the

1435
01:00:34,576 --> 01:00:34,576
neurophysiological space of the human

1436
01:00:34,576 --> 01:00:34,576
brain, talking about neuromodulatory

1437
01:00:34,576 --> 01:00:43,454
influence over neuronal dynamics.

1438
01:00:44,506 --> 01:00:46,721
And with that in mind, I would like to

1439
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:46,721
know, could you speculate a little bit on

1440
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:46,721
the implications of this characterization

1441
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:46,721
of consciousness for how it might emerge

1442
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:55,633
during infant or field development.

1443
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:58,966
Maxwell: That's a great set of questions.

1444
01:00:58,966 --> 01:00:58,966
.

1445
01:01:01,698 --> 01:01:05,001
I gave a version of this talk to Luis

1446
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:05,001
Pasoa's group at the Neuroscience and

1447
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:05,001
Philosophy Salon, and Anna Shaunika asked

1448
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:13,820
a similar question.

1449
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:17,272
Mahault probably has a better response.

1450
01:01:17,276 --> 01:01:20,525
I would point you in the direction of the

1451
01:01:20,525 --> 01:01:21,664
work of Anna Shaunika.

1452
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,997
She has some really cool work on co

1453
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:24,997
embodiment and cohomeostasis and

1454
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:29,431
pregnancy and this kind of thing.

1455
01:01:31,603 --> 01:01:34,926
I confess that I need to think about the

1456
01:01:34,926 --> 01:01:34,926
way that presumably you could just

1457
01:01:34,926 --> 01:01:39,484
continue extending this outwards.

1458
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:40,518
Right.

1459
01:01:40,523 --> 01:01:43,795
So we've talked about inner screens and

1460
01:01:43,795 --> 01:01:43,795
there's like an external screen, but

1461
01:01:43,795 --> 01:01:43,795
presumably you could just reapply this

1462
01:01:43,795 --> 01:01:43,795
whole screen talk in the other direction

1463
01:01:43,795 --> 01:01:53,086
on the other side of yeah, exactly.

1464
01:01:53,087 --> 01:01:54,097
The first prior.

1465
01:01:54,098 --> 01:01:57,128
Well, the first prior is one of those

1466
01:01:57,128 --> 01:01:57,128
papers, but she's got like another set of

1467
01:01:57,128 --> 01:02:01,109
papers.

1468
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:04,132
Yeah, this might be it.

1469
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:04,138
Right.

1470
01:02:06,154 --> 01:02:10,191
Mahault: One thing to also consider is

1471
01:02:10,191 --> 01:02:13,227
the sparseness aspect of our model.

1472
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:17,267
So as you develop, you prune connections

1473
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:17,267
and you become more and more sparse,

1474
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:17,267
which gives you more path approximations

1475
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:17,267
to the way that information gets

1476
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:17,267
agglomerated to form patterns that are

1477
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:33,425
recognizable.

1478
01:02:34,436 --> 01:02:37,468
And so perhaps this has something to do

1479
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:37,468
with the emergence of a moment where you

1480
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:37,468
sort of come online because there's

1481
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:37,468
something like an irreducible mark of

1482
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:37,468
blanket that emerges by virtue of having

1483
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:37,468
pruned enough such that you can now make

1484
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:37,468
sense of the stimuli relative to some

1485
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:59,680
couplings in time.

1486
01:02:59,681 --> 01:03:02,657
Rather than just hungry, there might be

1487
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:05,681
something to that effect.

1488
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:09,722
However, we need to be careful again,

1489
01:03:09,722 --> 01:03:10,737
with infants.

1490
01:03:10,737 --> 01:03:14,778
What we mean about consciousness, like,

1491
01:03:14,778 --> 01:03:17,801
do you mean selfhood?

1492
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:20,837
Do you mean the capacity to reflect on

1493
01:03:20,837 --> 01:03:20,837
selfhood, or do you mean the capacity to

1494
01:03:20,837 --> 01:03:20,837
learn and act on the world, which is

1495
01:03:20,837 --> 01:03:30,935
closer to where we're headed?

1496
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,966
Because while babies may not necessarily

1497
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:33,966
have this capacity to reflect on their

1498
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:33,966
selfhood right away, they do have the

1499
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:33,966
capacity to react to signals and act on

1500
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:33,966
the signals in order to get to a point

1501
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:33,966
where their preferred states are enacted.

1502
01:03:33,966 --> 01:03:48,117
.

1503
01:03:48,118 --> 01:03:53,159
So baby is hungry, cries, food comes.

1504
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:56,194
So there is a degree to which a baby,

1505
01:03:56,194 --> 01:03:56,194
much like a cell, has a degree of

1506
01:03:56,194 --> 01:04:02,191
consciousness relative to our model.

1507
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:05,224
Maxwell: So I'd also point you in the

1508
01:04:05,224 --> 01:04:05,224
direction of Roslyn Moran's work on the

1509
01:04:05,224 --> 01:04:08,259
aging brain.

1510
01:04:09,268 --> 01:04:12,298
She's got some cool work that suggests

1511
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:12,298
that the precision of our model increases

1512
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:12,298
over time, which has to do a little bit

1513
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:21,388
with what Miles discussing earlier.

1514
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:25,428
We know just from neuroanatomy that the

1515
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:25,428
process of pruning brain connections only

1516
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:31,487
accelerates through time.

1517
01:04:31,488 --> 01:04:33,509
And basically that means that you're

1518
01:04:33,509 --> 01:04:33,509
disconnecting certain things from certain

1519
01:04:33,509 --> 01:04:36,537
others.

1520
01:04:36,538 --> 01:04:37,541
Right?

1521
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,565
Like expertise has more to do with

1522
01:04:39,565 --> 01:04:39,565
understanding what is not connected to

1523
01:04:39,565 --> 01:04:39,565
what than understanding what is connected

1524
01:04:39,565 --> 01:04:45,629
to what.

1525
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:49,666
And so, yeah, there is probably a kind of

1526
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:49,666
developmental course whereby the model

1527
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:49,666
becomes sparser and sparser and sparser

1528
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:58,756
and sparser and more and more precise.

1529
01:04:59,764 --> 01:05:03,744
But this is a very cool direction for

1530
01:05:03,744 --> 01:05:04,758
exploration.

1531
01:05:04,759 --> 01:05:06,779
I don't know if I have anything more

1532
01:05:06,779 --> 01:05:09,800
cogent to say at this time about it.

1533
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:12,833
Pleasure.

1534
01:05:14,855 --> 01:05:17,888
Mahault: So I know Ali wanted a second go,

1535
01:05:17,888 --> 01:05:19,904
, and so did Samuel.

1536
01:05:19,904 --> 01:05:21,927
Does anybody else have other questions?

1537
01:05:21,928 --> 01:05:24,953
Because no other hands are raised at this

1538
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:24,957
time.

1539
01:05:27,988 --> 01:05:30,015
So we have one more hand, I

1540
01:05:30,015 --> 01:05:31,021
think.

1541
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:38,094
Ali: Actually, you basically answered my

1542
01:05:38,094 --> 01:05:42,130
other questions, so thank you so much.

1543
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:44,157
Mahault: Awesome.

1544
01:05:44,158 --> 01:05:48,190
So then Thales has his hand up again.

1545
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:50,213
Maria says her hand up, and Samuel has

1546
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:50,218
hand up.

1547
01:05:50,218 --> 01:05:51,227
So Thales first,

1548
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:52,235
I suppose.

1549
01:05:54,258 --> 01:05:58,291
Thales: I don't know guys like to Maria

1550
01:05:58,291 --> 01:06:00,256
first, because I just know.

1551
01:06:02,274 --> 01:06:04,293
Mahault: Sure, go ahead, Maria.

1552
01:06:06,315 --> 01:06:07,324
All right.

1553
01:06:09,343 --> 01:06:11,367
Maria: I didn't say before, but I am a

1554
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:11,367
psychologist and master in philosophy,

1555
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:11,367
and now I'm doing PhD in philosophy as

1556
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:17,421
well.

1557
01:06:17,423 --> 01:06:20,454
And it's not really a question.

1558
01:06:20,455 --> 01:06:25,502
I would just like to understand better

1559
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:25,502
what is memory in your inner mother,

1560
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:25,502
because I understand the information

1561
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:25,502
passing and the middle layers or levels

1562
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:43,682
that contain the information.

1563
01:06:43,683 --> 01:06:46,714
But how exactly do we construct, for

1564
01:06:46,714 --> 01:06:46,714
example, the narrative self or something

1565
01:06:46,714 --> 01:06:46,714
that we remember from a long time, or

1566
01:06:46,714 --> 01:06:54,797
episodic memory?

1567
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:57,828
I didn't understand it very well in the

1568
01:06:57,828 --> 01:06:58,832
paper.

1569
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:00,795
So if you could just shed some.

1570
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:04,835
Maxwell: It's a computer science

1571
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:04,835
processing, information processing notion

1572
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:08,877
of memory.

1573
01:07:09,882 --> 01:07:12,914
So you get some data and you need to

1574
01:07:12,914 --> 01:07:12,914
parse it into things that are causing

1575
01:07:12,914 --> 01:07:16,958
that data.

1576
01:07:16,959 --> 01:07:20,992
Well, presumably you need to leverage

1577
01:07:20,992 --> 01:07:20,992
some beliefs or knowledge about how to

1578
01:07:20,992 --> 01:07:25,043
parse that data.

1579
01:07:25,044 --> 01:07:27,068
And that comes in the form of information.

1580
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:27,068
.

1581
01:07:28,072 --> 01:07:31,106
Basically, you need to have some capacity

1582
01:07:31,106 --> 01:07:31,106
to reduce the entropy of your

1583
01:07:31,106 --> 01:07:31,106
observations and to kind of carve things

1584
01:07:31,106 --> 01:07:39,180
out into things.

1585
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:43,221
And the inner screen serves as the locus

1586
01:07:43,221 --> 01:07:46,254
where the information is encoded.

1587
01:07:46,255 --> 01:07:49,282
So that's the cool thing about the

1588
01:07:49,282 --> 01:07:49,282
quantum version of the Markov blanket

1589
01:07:49,282 --> 01:07:53,324
formulation.

1590
01:07:53,325 --> 01:07:56,358
It tells you where all of the information

1591
01:07:56,358 --> 01:07:56,358
that characterizes the coupling across

1592
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:03,360
two bulks where it lives, basically.

1593
01:08:03,362 --> 01:08:05,383
I mean, to get a little bit more

1594
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:05,383
technical, the Markov blanket itself is

1595
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:05,383
constituted by the degrees of freedom

1596
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:12,459
that couple the two systems together.

1597
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,504
And, yeah, you can think of this as an

1598
01:08:17,504 --> 01:08:17,504
array of bits that answer yes no

1599
01:08:17,504 --> 01:08:17,504
questions about are the two systems

1600
01:08:17,504 --> 01:08:17,504
communicating across this channel yes or

1601
01:08:17,504 --> 01:08:27,608
no?

1602
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:30,630
And in some sense, the state of the

1603
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:30,630
blanket at any given time gives you all

1604
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:30,630
of the information that you need to

1605
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:30,630
characterize the coupling in terms of

1606
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:38,712
these yes no questions.

1607
01:08:38,713 --> 01:08:40,731
So all of the classical information that

1608
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:40,731
you need to characterize the coupling

1609
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:42,758
lives on the blanket.

1610
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,783
And, yes, having an internal blanket

1611
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:45,783
means that you can have an internal store

1612
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:45,783
of such answers to yes no questions that

1613
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:45,783
you can then use to parse the sensory

1614
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:53,867
stream.

1615
01:08:53,868 --> 01:08:56,890
But in a kind of standard computer

1616
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:56,890
architecture, it's just saying that you

1617
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:00,875
have a memory register, right?

1618
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:02,893
Yeah.

1619
01:09:02,894 --> 01:09:04,915
You need to store some of the information

1620
01:09:04,915 --> 01:09:04,915
that you're processing somewhere so that

1621
01:09:04,915 --> 01:09:07,945
you can deploy it.

1622
01:09:07,946 --> 01:09:09,969
And the idea is that it lives on this

1623
01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:11,980
internal screen.

1624
01:09:13,007 --> 01:09:14,018
Does that help?

1625
01:09:14,019 --> 01:09:17,042
Maria: And in this case, it would be the

1626
01:09:17,042 --> 01:09:17,049
hippocampus.

1627
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:21,089
Maxwell: Yeah, all of the inner screens

1628
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:24,112
encode information in this sense.

1629
01:09:24,113 --> 01:09:24,117
Right.

1630
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:27,142
The point of having inner screen

1631
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:27,142
structure at all is to kind of retain

1632
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:27,142
information to parse your sensory stream.

1633
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:33,200
.

1634
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:35,225
And yeah, structures like the hippocampus,

1635
01:09:35,225 --> 01:09:35,225
, like these upper brain stem structures,

1636
01:09:35,225 --> 01:09:35,225
what used to be called the limbic brain

1637
01:09:35,225 --> 01:09:35,225
and so on, we think that these are all at

1638
01:09:35,225 --> 01:09:43,302
the top.

1639
01:09:43,302 --> 01:09:45,327
The idea, right, is that so you have your

1640
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:45,327
sensory motor end, then you have your

1641
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:45,327
prefrontal cortex, which is the

1642
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:52,392
controller for the sensory motor end.

1643
01:09:52,393 --> 01:09:54,413
It's a controller in the sense that its

1644
01:09:54,413 --> 01:09:54,413
main function is to inhibit activity in

1645
01:09:54,413 --> 01:09:57,445
the sensory motor area.

1646
01:09:57,446 --> 01:10:00,415
But if the main function of prefrontal

1647
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:00,415
cortex is to go to the rest of the brain,

1648
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:00,415
then there is also a part of the brain

1649
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:00,415
whose main function it is to go to the

1650
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:00,415
prefrontal cortex, and that is these are

1651
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:00,415
these upper regions that we're describing.

1652
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:15,567
.

1653
01:10:16,572 --> 01:10:19,607
So, yes, the memory registers live in

1654
01:10:19,607 --> 01:10:21,624
this whole stack.

1655
01:10:22,631 --> 01:10:25,661
Ultimately, the point about memory is

1656
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:28,690
less unique to this apex structure.

1657
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:31,721
What is unique to these top structures,

1658
01:10:31,721 --> 01:10:31,721
though, is the right only kind of

1659
01:10:31,721 --> 01:10:31,721
directionality that they don't have any

1660
01:10:31,721 --> 01:10:37,785
context,

1661
01:10:37,786 --> 01:10:38,792
Right?

1662
01:10:38,796 --> 01:10:41,828
There is no higher structure that can

1663
01:10:41,828 --> 01:10:45,859
provide memory to these top layers.

1664
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,876
So all they can do is act,

1665
01:10:46,877 --> 01:10:47,884
Right?

1666
01:10:48,893 --> 01:10:51,922
In particular, they act in a kind of

1667
01:10:51,922 --> 01:10:51,922
covert fashion on other layers of the

1668
01:10:51,922 --> 01:10:51,922
brain, I think would be the answer to

1669
01:10:51,922 --> 01:10:57,989
that.

1670
01:10:58,990 --> 01:10:59,008
Mahault, did you want to add anything to

1671
01:10:59,008 --> 01:11:00,951
that?

1672
01:11:04,997 --> 01:11:06,018
Mahault: You touched on the notion of

1673
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:06,018
selfhood and how the narrative self

1674
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:11,062
unfolds over time and leverages memory.

1675
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:16,112
And our model basically established what

1676
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:16,112
selfhood the process of selfing is

1677
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:16,112
because according to our model and very

1678
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:16,112
alike, very like Thomas Metzinger's model

1679
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:16,112
of selfhood, it's a process, not a thing.

1680
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:34,290
.

1681
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:37,324
So selfing is the process by which the

1682
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:37,324
internal states are capable of mapping to

1683
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:37,324
the relevant external states such that

1684
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:37,324
they can act in such a way as to fulfill

1685
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:49,442
their own needs.

1686
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:52,473
This is also very close to what Neil Seth

1687
01:11:52,473 --> 01:11:54,495
said about the Beast machine.

1688
01:11:55,506 --> 01:11:58,535
And so if you have nested structure and

1689
01:11:58,535 --> 01:11:58,535
each of these nested structure has a

1690
01:11:58,535 --> 01:11:58,535
timescale say so you have structures that

1691
01:11:58,535 --> 01:11:58,535
happen on the milliseconds and some

1692
01:11:58,535 --> 01:11:58,535
timescales that happen on the scale of a

1693
01:11:58,535 --> 01:11:58,535
sentence and then some structures that

1694
01:11:58,535 --> 01:11:58,535
track much longer timescales like your

1695
01:11:58,535 --> 01:11:58,535
life goal and in your ancestry and stuff

1696
01:11:58,535 --> 01:12:19,688
like that.

1697
01:12:20,692 --> 01:12:24,733
You find that memory is just the storing

1698
01:12:24,733 --> 01:12:24,733
the binning of the relevant information

1699
01:12:24,733 --> 01:12:24,733
at the timescale at which it is relevant.

1700
01:12:24,733 --> 01:12:32,817
.

1701
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:35,847
And so you can retrieve the relevant

1702
01:12:35,847 --> 01:12:35,847
information for the shorter timescales

1703
01:12:35,847 --> 01:12:35,847
because it acts as a prior for the lower

1704
01:12:35,847 --> 01:12:42,917
timescale.

1705
01:12:42,918 --> 01:12:45,942
Does that help for the narrative?

1706
01:12:45,942 --> 01:12:46,958
Maria: So yes.

1707
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:48,973
Thank you.

1708
01:12:49,989 --> 01:12:50,996
Mahault: Awesome.

1709
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,052
… Sure, go ahead, Samuel.

1710
01:12:56,053 --> 01:13:01,040
Samuel: Yeah, about the going back to the

1711
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,040
Band psychiatrist problem and how you

1712
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,040
describe consciousness, I think it's very

1713
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,040
well, it's old in the literature that you

1714
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,040
can have information processing which is

1715
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,040
not conscious, but it's mental in some

1716
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,040
sense in other animals or the beings

1717
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:32,351
which are not biological beings.

1718
01:13:32,357 --> 01:13:35,384
But when you describe your models, I know

1719
01:13:35,384 --> 01:13:35,384
you have this level also but you also

1720
01:13:35,384 --> 01:13:35,384
have a level of phenomenal awareness or

1721
01:13:35,384 --> 01:13:35,384
phenomenal consciousness which you are

1722
01:13:35,384 --> 01:13:43,469
describing.

1723
01:13:44,474 --> 01:13:48,511
And I think that's the most particularly

1724
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:48,511
important part of the model, the

1725
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:53,568
phenomenal awareness part.

1726
01:13:56,589 --> 01:13:58,618
And it's the part of the model that can

1727
01:13:58,618 --> 01:13:58,618
contribute to something new to me in a

1728
01:13:58,618 --> 01:14:03,608
sense that wasn't described.

1729
01:14:03,608 --> 01:14:06,636
So I'm glad you mentioned Matzinger

1730
01:14:06,636 --> 01:14:06,636
because Matsinger is one of the few who

1731
01:14:06,636 --> 01:14:06,636
have described consciousness as a virtual

1732
01:14:06,636 --> 01:14:13,709
reality.

1733
01:14:16,736 --> 01:14:19,765
And what I think is interesting about

1734
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:19,765
describing consciousness as a virtual

1735
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:19,765
reality is that it makes a difference

1736
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:19,765
between mental information processing or

1737
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:19,765
unconscious information processing and

1738
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:19,765
those processes that are conscious

1739
01:14:19,765 --> 01:14:37,943
because they are simulated somehow.

1740
01:14:41,985 --> 01:14:44,014
So an interesting thing of having a

1741
01:14:44,014 --> 01:14:44,014
different language to speak of conscious

1742
01:14:44,014 --> 01:14:44,014
events is that we can then explain why

1743
01:14:44,014 --> 01:14:52,095
they are different.

1744
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:58,154
We can explain why we have images in our

1745
01:14:58,154 --> 01:14:58,154
head or something like that, and why

1746
01:14:58,154 --> 01:14:58,154
these images seem to have causal powers,

1747
01:14:58,154 --> 01:15:08,190
if they have at all.

1748
01:15:08,191 --> 01:15:12,231
So when I imagine something, I can make

1749
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:12,231
my hand move or something like that and

1750
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:12,231
you can describe this only with

1751
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:12,231
electrical information or something like

1752
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:12,231
that, but it doesn't explain why we have

1753
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:12,231
different information processes with

1754
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:12,231
consciousness and those without

1755
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:36,476
consciousness.

1756
01:15:36,477 --> 01:15:40,511
And I know all theory of consciousness

1757
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:40,511
have a distinction between the

1758
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:46,572
unconscious and the conscious level.

1759
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:49,608
But adding something like the metaphysics

1760
01:15:49,608 --> 01:15:49,608
of virtual reality would explain the

1761
01:15:49,608 --> 01:15:55,659
metaphysics of causation.

1762
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:57,686
For instance, if you're playing a video

1763
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:58,691
game.

1764
01:15:59,703 --> 01:16:05,704
Does the content of that game matter for

1765
01:16:05,704 --> 01:16:07,721
causation?

1766
01:16:07,725 --> 01:16:09,748
Or is it just the information that's

1767
01:16:09,748 --> 01:16:12,773
stored in the computer that matters?

1768
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:18,832
There's a variable there which means a

1769
01:16:18,832 --> 01:16:19,840
sword.

1770
01:16:19,843 --> 01:16:21,863
Does it meaning a sword make any

1771
01:16:21,863 --> 01:16:22,874
difference at all?

1772
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:26,913
And I think that's something that hasn't

1773
01:16:26,913 --> 01:16:29,942
been very much discussed in philosophy.

1774
01:16:29,943 --> 01:16:33,982
So David Chalmers has just written a book

1775
01:16:33,982 --> 01:16:33,982
recently about virtual reality, but it

1776
01:16:33,982 --> 01:16:40,055
doesn't apply to consciousness yet.

1777
01:16:41,062 --> 01:16:45,109
And I think if you guys find something in

1778
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:45,109
physics that's different, as you guys are

1779
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:45,109
trying to do, as you admitted having that

1780
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:45,109
aim, then maybe there could be some sort

1781
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:45,109
of different physical explanation to

1782
01:16:45,109 --> 01:17:06,259
conscious causation.

1783
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,280
So I would like you guys to comment on

1784
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:09,283
that.

1785
01:17:09,289 --> 01:17:11,301
Maxwell: That's really interesting.

1786
01:17:11,303 --> 01:17:15,343
We draw on medsinger's work, on opacity

1787
01:17:15,343 --> 01:17:17,361
and transparency.

1788
01:17:18,377 --> 01:17:21,403
So in medsinger's work, just for the

1789
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:21,403
audience, there are two kinds of

1790
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:25,441
cognitive processes.

1791
01:17:25,442 --> 01:17:28,476
There are transparent processes that we

1792
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:28,476
are not aware of as cognitive processes

1793
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:28,476
per se, and then there are opaque

1794
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:37,560
processes which we are.

1795
01:17:37,561 --> 01:17:40,594
So, for instance, the metaphor comes from

1796
01:17:40,594 --> 01:17:43,621
a transparent or opaque window.

1797
01:17:43,624 --> 01:17:45,643
And most of the time, the window just

1798
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:45,643
lets you see through it towards whatever

1799
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:45,643
is on the other side, but sometimes it's

1800
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:45,643
a bit grimy, and then you see the window

1801
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:52,709
itself.

1802
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:54,737
And so, similarly, there are some

1803
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:54,737
processes that mainly deliver things in

1804
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:54,737
the world, and then there are other

1805
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:54,737
processes that deliver mental processes

1806
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:54,737
to us as kind of the object of our

1807
01:17:54,737 --> 01:18:08,817
perception in some sense.

1808
01:18:08,819 --> 01:18:12,859
So these are processes like attention or

1809
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:12,859
attentional processing, or paying

1810
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:20,935
attention to your own attentional state.

1811
01:18:20,939 --> 01:18:24,974
These processes make other processes

1812
01:18:24,974 --> 01:18:25,982
opaque.

1813
01:18:26,991 --> 01:18:28,001
"Terrence Deacon, the anthropologist,

1814
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:28,001
also talks about similar phenomena in

1815
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:28,001
terms of, like, absent absence and what

1816
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:36,009
he calls ""absential phenomena."""

1817
01:18:36,009 --> 01:18:39,012
So there's a sense in which this top

1818
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:39,012
layer, what it does is implement

1819
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:43,016
opacification.

1820
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:48,021
So the top layer can only be about other

1821
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:50,023
layers in the stack.

1822
01:18:50,023 --> 01:18:54,027
And this kind of reversal of the flow of

1823
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
information is, we think, the key to

1824
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
understanding the way that mental

1825
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:54,027
processes are made available for

1826
01:18:54,027 --> 01:19:05,032
introspection at all.

1827
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:09,036
Yeah, so that's how I would respond.

1828
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,039
Mahault, I saw you turn your camera on.

1829
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,041
Do you have more to…

1830
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,043
Mahault: No, I don't have more to answer

1831
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:16,043
that question.

1832
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,045
Maxwell: Cool.

1833
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:23,050
Mahault: So, Thales, do you have another

1834
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,051
question?

1835
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:28,055
Thales: Yeah, I know guys have already

1836
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:28,055
discussed some of this before, especially

1837
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:28,055
on Twitter, but if you can just repeat it,

1838
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:28,055
, because if I understood it right when

1839
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:28,055
applying the model to human neurobiology,

1840
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:28,055
the article kind of seems to account

1841
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:47,074
within central neurosystem.

1842
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:49,076
Maxwell: Could you repeat the last

1843
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:49,076
thing?

1844
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:51,078
You broke up pretty bad on my.

1845
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:55,082
Thales: Sorry, my laptop is really okay.

1846
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,084
The article seems to align itself to a

1847
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:57,084
more modular account of the central

1848
01:19:57,084 --> 01:20:00,081
nervous system.

1849
01:20:01,082 --> 01:20:03,084
But in contrast to modeler accounts,

1850
01:20:03,084 --> 01:20:03,084
there are some dynamic distributor

1851
01:20:03,084 --> 01:20:03,084
approaches that suggest that there are no

1852
01:20:03,084 --> 01:20:03,084
parts of the brain with dedicated

1853
01:20:03,084 --> 01:20:10,091
functions, right?

1854
01:20:10,091 --> 01:20:12,093
But regions with various capacities

1855
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:12,093
present in software assembled test

1856
01:20:12,093 --> 01:20:16,097
specific coalitions.

1857
01:20:16,097 --> 01:20:19,100
So these coalitions sometimes are termed

1858
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:19,100
like transiently assembled local neuronal

1859
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,103
subsystems, right?

1860
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:25,106
Maxwell: Yeah, we're big fans of big fans.

1861
01:20:25,106 --> 01:20:25,106
.

1862
01:20:26,107 --> 01:20:27,108
Thales: Yeah, exactly.

1863
01:20:27,108 --> 01:20:29,110
So these approaches specialism is only a

1864
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,110
functional footprint and brain functions

1865
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,110
never the result of fixed networks

1866
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,110
implementing specific processes, but the

1867
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:29,110
result of high order relations between

1868
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:40,121
regions.

1869
01:20:40,121 --> 01:20:42,123
So my question with that in mind, knowing

1870
01:20:42,123 --> 01:20:42,123
that you guys know these kind of

1871
01:20:42,123 --> 01:20:45,126
approaches, right?

1872
01:20:46,127 --> 01:20:48,129
Do I think that the level erco structure

1873
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:48,129
implied by the model could be cash out in

1874
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:48,129
terms of transient collisions built on

1875
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:55,136
the flight, such as flow talents?

1876
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:56,137
Maxwell: Yes.

1877
01:20:56,137 --> 01:20:59,139
I mean, we have a paper doing that from

1878
01:20:59,139 --> 01:20:59,140
2020.

1879
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,136
It's called neural and phenotypic

1880
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:01,136
representations under the Free Energy

1881
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:05,140
Principle.

1882
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:11,146
And it is one of our lesser known papers.

1883
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:11,146
.

1884
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:13,148
Let me just put it in the chat quickly.

1885
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,153
And so what we show in this paper is that

1886
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:18,153
it's possible to simulate the transient

1887
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:18,153
formation of Markov blankets that

1888
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:28,163
basically track stimulus features.

1889
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:30,165
So there are a lot of moving parts to

1890
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:31,166
what you were saying.

1891
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:34,169
On the one hand, yes, you can totally use

1892
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:34,169
the Markov blanket formalism to model the

1893
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:34,169
transient formation and assembly of these.

1894
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:40,175
.

1895
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:44,179
I would also add that there's a new

1896
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:44,179
perspective on modularity that opens up

1897
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:51,186
via the Free Energy Principle.

1898
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:56,191
It's best explored in this paper by

1899
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:56,191
Thomas Parr Inesh Ipolito and a few

1900
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:56,191
others called modules or mean fields,

1901
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:56,191
where the argument and again, this

1902
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:56,191
dovetails nicely with what Mike Anderson

1903
01:21:56,191 --> 01:22:07,196
and his group are doing currently.

1904
01:22:07,196 --> 01:22:10,199
The argument is that the specialization

1905
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:10,199
of brain regions is not functional, it's

1906
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:14,203
computational.

1907
01:22:15,204 --> 01:22:17,206
And this is effectively what Mike

1908
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:17,206
Anderson and company are arguing is that

1909
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:17,206
each patch of the brain is specialized in

1910
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:17,206
converting certain patterns into other

1911
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:25,214
patterns.

1912
01:22:25,214 --> 01:22:28,217
It's not like you have a visual region or

1913
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:28,217
I think Mike's example is the Broca's

1914
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:28,217
area, which is associated with the

1915
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:28,217
production of language is actually

1916
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:28,217
activated in more non linguistic tasks

1917
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:40,228
than in linguistic tasks.

1918
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:42,231
So what that suggests is that each brain

1919
01:22:42,231 --> 01:22:42,231
area is kind of like contributing certain

1920
01:22:42,231 --> 01:22:42,231
stereotyped forms of computation to the

1921
01:22:42,231 --> 01:22:42,231
overall process that's unfolding in the

1922
01:22:42,231 --> 01:22:50,239
brain.

1923
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,241
And in the Free Energy Principle

1924
01:22:52,241 --> 01:22:52,241
literature, you can understand that as a

1925
01:22:52,241 --> 01:22:56,245
kind of factorization.

1926
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:56,245
Right?

1927
01:22:56,245 --> 01:22:59,248
So what and where we have two different

1928
01:22:59,248 --> 01:22:59,248
streams in the brain, the dorsal and the

1929
01:22:59,248 --> 01:22:59,248
ventral, which handle what I am seeing

1930
01:22:59,248 --> 01:23:06,249
and where I am seeing.

1931
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:09,252
And basically the idea is that this

1932
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
anatomical segregation of pathways

1933
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
corresponds to a factorization and

1934
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:15,258
inference.

1935
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:17,260
Where you are and what you are are

1936
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:18,261
independent.

1937
01:23:18,261 --> 01:23:18,261
You could be here.

1938
01:23:18,261 --> 01:23:19,262
You could be here.

1939
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:25,268
I think I've tried to yeah.

1940
01:23:26,269 --> 01:23:29,272
Mahault: So that was a really good answer.

1941
01:23:29,272 --> 01:23:29,272
.

1942
01:23:29,272 --> 01:23:31,274
I'm going to try and say it a little bit

1943
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:31,274
differently and see what sticks to the

1944
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:34,277
wall.

1945
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:39,282
So each hierarchical level of the brain

1946
01:23:39,282 --> 01:23:42,285
has markup blankets, right?

1947
01:23:42,285 --> 01:23:45,288
So remember, these things are nested and

1948
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:45,288
they exchange with other levels according

1949
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:45,288
to the dependency structures of the mark

1950
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:52,295
of blankets.

1951
01:23:53,296 --> 01:23:55,298
And so this is like hierarchical

1952
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:56,299
predictive coding, right?

1953
01:23:56,299 --> 01:23:58,301
So ascending prediction errors can be

1954
01:23:58,301 --> 01:23:58,301
read as active states, while descending

1955
01:23:58,301 --> 01:23:58,301
can constitute sensory states from the

1956
01:23:58,301 --> 01:24:05,302
point of view of a given level.

1957
01:24:07,304 --> 01:24:09,306
So using this factorization that Maxwell

1958
01:24:09,306 --> 01:24:09,306
just mentioned, some brain regions become

1959
01:24:09,306 --> 01:24:09,306
specialized to encode distinct

1960
01:24:09,306 --> 01:24:09,306
probability factors that are

1961
01:24:09,306 --> 01:24:17,314
statistically independent.

1962
01:24:17,314 --> 01:24:20,317
And this creates a sort of physiological

1963
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:20,317
separation of brain regions, which imply

1964
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:20,317
that the information encoded in these

1965
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:20,317
regions is conditionally independent of

1966
01:24:20,317 --> 01:24:31,328
that encoded in other distinct regions.

1967
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:35,332
So it allows for the formation of new

1968
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:37,334
functions as the brain regions interact.

1969
01:24:38,335 --> 01:24:41,338
So we get to the point of mental action.

1970
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:45,342
This is enabled by the existence of a

1971
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:45,342
subsystem that is both irreducible, so

1972
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:45,342
there exists no further mark of blanket

1973
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:45,342
partitions of the internal states and

1974
01:24:45,342 --> 01:24:45,342
complex or expressive enough to act like

1975
01:24:45,342 --> 01:25:04,355
a suitably flexible meta controller.

1976
01:25:04,355 --> 01:25:06,357
So this metacontroller coordinates overt

1977
01:25:06,357 --> 01:25:08,359
and covert action.

1978
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:10,361
That's the last part of what Maxwell

1979
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:10,361
explained, which could be seen as forming

1980
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:14,365
transient connections.

1981
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:14,365
Right?

1982
01:25:14,365 --> 01:25:17,368
So that's the point of precision

1983
01:25:17,368 --> 01:25:18,369
weighting.

1984
01:25:18,369 --> 01:25:22,373
So the nested scales of increasingly

1985
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:22,373
large ensembles of neurons basically form

1986
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:22,373
coherently, and so they also have their

1987
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:33,384
own Markov blankets.

1988
01:25:33,384 --> 01:25:36,386
So we can generalize different nested

1989
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:36,386
connectivity structures in the brain,

1990
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:36,386
where we find formally identical patterns

1991
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:36,386
at subordinate levels and superordinate

1992
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:45,396
scales.

1993
01:25:45,396 --> 01:25:49,400
So does that help restructure what

1994
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,401
Maxwell said?

1995
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:51,402
Basically.

1996
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:54,405
Thales: Yes, it did.

1997
01:25:54,405 --> 01:25:55,406
Mahault: Awesome.

1998
01:25:57,407 --> 01:26:01,406
So Samuel still has his hand up.

1999
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,408
I think Ali also has his hand up.

2000
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,410
Ali didn't go yet.

2001
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,413
Samuel, do you mind if Ali goes first?

2002
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:11,416
Samuel: Sure, go ahead.

2003
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,419
Ali: Thank you.

2004
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:18,423
Yeah, I just wanted to make a couple of

2005
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:18,423
comments about the notion of self

2006
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:18,423
evidencing or self modeling that's just

2007
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:27,432
been discussed.

2008
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:30,435
Because, you see, sometimes in

2009
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:30,435
philosophical literature, the sensibility

2010
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:30,435
of secondary properties are usually they'

2011
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:30,435
're divided into the sensibility of

2012
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:30,435
things in itself and sensibility of

2013
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:44,449
things for itself.

2014
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,453
But under these conditions, some

2015
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:48,453
philosophers believe that real sensation

2016
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:53,458
would not be possible.

2017
01:26:54,459 --> 01:27:00,459
Or as Arthur Rimbo famously put it, I is

2018
01:27:00,459 --> 01:27:01,460
an other.

2019
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,461
Right.

2020
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:05,464
But in some recent developments,

2021
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:05,464
particularly in process materialism,

2022
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:05,464
through the work of people like Thomas

2023
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:05,464
Neal, Emmanuel Delanden, Karen Broad,

2024
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:05,464
they've tried to somehow overcome this

2025
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:05,464
issue, this philosophical distinction

2026
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:05,464
between in itself and for itself, by

2027
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:05,464
introducing the notion of self

2028
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:05,464
receptivity, or, in other words, a

2029
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:05,464
capacity to be affected and to affect at

2030
01:27:05,464 --> 01:27:34,493
the same time.

2031
01:27:34,493 --> 01:27:39,498
Because by introducing self receptivity,

2032
01:27:39,498 --> 01:27:39,498
then the sensation of each sensed point

2033
01:27:39,498 --> 01:27:39,498
in the flow can become itself as an other

2034
01:27:39,498 --> 01:27:50,509
to itself.

2035
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:53,512
So basically, that distinction between in

2036
01:27:53,512 --> 01:27:53,512
itself and for itself would be dismantled

2037
01:27:53,512 --> 01:27:57,516
effectively.

2038
01:27:57,516 --> 01:28:01,514
And that's why it can provide more

2039
01:28:01,514 --> 01:28:01,514
reliable way to discuss the notion of

2040
01:28:01,514 --> 01:28:01,514
real sensation, or real even subjectivity,

2041
01:28:01,514 --> 01:28:01,514
, as a flow that just folds on itself and

2042
01:28:01,514 --> 01:28:20,533
comprises both in itself and by itself.

2043
01:28:20,533 --> 01:28:24,537
And that's also why I believe FEP and

2044
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
active inference can provide, even on the

2045
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
more philosophical note, more reliable

2046
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:24,537
way to talk about what it means to sense

2047
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:41,554
and be sensed at the same time.

2048
01:28:44,557 --> 01:28:45,558
Maxwell: I find that very compelling.

2049
01:28:45,558 --> 01:28:47,560
I know you and Mahault have been working

2050
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:47,560
together, so I think Mahault might have

2051
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:51,564
something more insightful than I think.

2052
01:28:51,564 --> 01:28:52,565
That's great, though.

2053
01:28:59,572 --> 01:29:00,567
Mahault: I agree.

2054
01:29:02,569 --> 01:29:05,572
I think I like linking these ideas to we

2055
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:05,572
wrote in the consciousness text by

2056
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:05,572
basically saying that your screen is the

2057
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:13,580
folding onto itself.

2058
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:14,581
Right.

2059
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:16,583
It's going to be seen as the wrapping

2060
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:16,583
inside another form the consciousness is

2061
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:16,583
riped into the form, is wrapped in the

2062
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:23,590
form of the mind.

2063
01:29:25,592 --> 01:29:29,596
And so if you partition internal and

2064
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:29,596
external states, and the marker blankets

2065
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:29,596
has these different kind of active and

2066
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:29,596
sensory states, you can see how the

2067
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:29,596
folding basically happens through this

2068
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:29,596
loop that isn't necessarily happening,

2069
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:29,596
because it's not only happening at one

2070
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:29,596
scale, does not have to be non

2071
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:56,623
simultaneous.

2072
01:29:56,623 --> 01:30:00,621
We consider that these things are

2073
01:30:00,621 --> 01:30:00,621
separated in time simply because we're

2074
01:30:00,621 --> 01:30:07,628
thinking of one timescale.

2075
01:30:08,629 --> 01:30:10,631
But so if we add this notion of

2076
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:10,631
interaction, we can highlight the dynamic

2077
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:10,631
and relational nature of consciousness to

2078
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:10,631
refer to the process where the agent and

2079
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:10,631
its environment actively shape one

2080
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:22,643
another.

2081
01:30:25,645 --> 01:30:27,648
So the mind creating an inner screen here

2082
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:27,648
just reflects its understanding of the

2083
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:27,648
world and of itself through like,

2084
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:27,648
basically of the world through its own

2085
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:34,655
filter.

2086
01:30:34,655 --> 01:30:37,658
And the filter is a reflection of itself.

2087
01:30:37,658 --> 01:30:37,658
.

2088
01:30:37,658 --> 01:30:41,662
It's just that, effectively, if there are

2089
01:30:41,662 --> 01:30:41,662
errors, you need to be able to model what

2090
01:30:41,662 --> 01:30:41,662
parts of your filter created potentially

2091
01:30:41,662 --> 01:30:50,671
the error.

2092
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:56,677
So, yeah, does that help kind of flesh

2093
01:30:56,677 --> 01:30:56,677
out this idea of folding onto itself and

2094
01:30:56,677 --> 01:31:02,677
incoming sensory data?

2095
01:31:08,683 --> 01:31:11,686
I think this question was for Ali or

2096
01:31:11,686 --> 01:31:13,688
Maxwell, so one of you has.

2097
01:31:13,688 --> 01:31:15,690
Maxwell: To decide whether I thought it

2098
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:16,691
was for Ally.

2099
01:31:16,691 --> 01:31:17,692
Ali: That was great.

2100
01:31:17,692 --> 01:31:19,694
Mahault: Okay, cool.

2101
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:21,696
Ali: Yeah, that was great.

2102
01:31:21,696 --> 01:31:22,697
Thanks.

2103
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:24,699
Mahault: Awesome.

2104
01:31:24,699 --> 01:31:26,701
So, Samuel, I think you have a question.

2105
01:31:27,702 --> 01:31:30,705
Samuel: Yes, my final question, I was

2106
01:31:30,705 --> 01:31:30,705
mostly talking about the hard problem, of

2107
01:31:30,705 --> 01:31:30,705
course, because I also buy the predictive

2108
01:31:30,705 --> 01:31:30,705
processing story, and I agree with what

2109
01:31:30,705 --> 01:31:43,718
you guys are saying.

2110
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,723
But one issue that I have with the

2111
01:31:48,723 --> 01:31:51,726
predictive processing story is that.

2112
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:53,728
Maxwell: We.

2113
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:57,732
Samuel: Can apply it to explanations in

2114
01:31:57,732 --> 01:31:58,733
various ways.

2115
01:31:58,733 --> 01:32:01,730
So sometimes, like, sometimes you can it

2116
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:01,730
seems we can tell any story with the same

2117
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:01,730
theory, and it's hard to know which one

2118
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:01,730
is true if you can tell multiple stories.

2119
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:11,740
.

2120
01:32:12,741 --> 01:32:15,744
So I think that's a problem with

2121
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:18,747
predictive processing in general.

2122
01:32:18,747 --> 01:32:23,751
And you can explain, for instance, autism

2123
01:32:23,751 --> 01:32:23,751
in different ways, and I think people

2124
01:32:23,751 --> 01:32:23,751
have tried that for your model

2125
01:32:23,751 --> 01:32:32,761
unconsciousness.

2126
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:36,765
How can we know that any of that is

2127
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:37,766
true?

2128
01:32:37,766 --> 01:32:39,767
How empirical is it?

2129
01:32:39,767 --> 01:32:42,770
And during the talk, you guys mentioned

2130
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:42,770
something that you were going to test

2131
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:42,770
something based on this, which was very

2132
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:42,770
promising, and I would like you to

2133
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:51,780
comment on that.

2134
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:55,784
Mahault: So Maxwell, he has a really cool

2135
01:32:55,784 --> 01:32:55,784
paper on the map territory fallacy policy,

2136
01:32:55,784 --> 01:32:55,784
, which I think is part of the answer

2137
01:32:55,784 --> 01:33:03,786
here.

2138
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:05,788
And we've also written some.

2139
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:07,790
So I'll let Maxwell dig into it.

2140
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:08,791
Probably was.

2141
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:10,793
Going to be a very fleshed out answer.

2142
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:12,795
So I'll give a very small answer which he'

2143
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:12,795
's going to blow out of the water

2144
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:14,797
afterwards.

2145
01:33:14,797 --> 01:33:15,798
Maria: But.

2146
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,802
Mahault: There are some things we can do

2147
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:19,802
to test whether the predictions made by

2148
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:24,807
our model actually come to fruition.

2149
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:28,811
So that's one way to test the empirical

2150
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:30,813
validity of a model.

2151
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:32,815
But to keep in mind a model is just a

2152
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:33,816
model.

2153
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:35,818
And so since you have multiple

2154
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:35,818
realizability effectively, what really

2155
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:35,818
only matters is whether your model

2156
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:41,824
actually has any predictive power.

2157
01:33:43,826 --> 01:33:45,828
So here let's say that we can examine

2158
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:45,828
whether the brain structure and function

2159
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:45,828
reflect the nested and hierarchical

2160
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:45,828
organization which is predicted by our

2161
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:45,828
model or whether interventions that alter

2162
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:45,828
the brain structure or function lead to

2163
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:45,828
changes in conscious experience as we

2164
01:33:45,828 --> 01:34:04,841
predicted.

2165
01:34:05,842 --> 01:34:07,844
Or for instance, we can test which parts

2166
01:34:07,844 --> 01:34:07,844
of the brain relate to which scale of

2167
01:34:07,844 --> 01:34:07,844
elements that are perceived and then make

2168
01:34:07,844 --> 01:34:07,844
predictions about the contents of

2169
01:34:07,844 --> 01:34:07,844
consciousness and their neural correlates

2170
01:34:07,844 --> 01:34:16,853
to see how well it maps.

2171
01:34:16,853 --> 01:34:18,855
So these are things that we could

2172
01:34:18,855 --> 01:34:19,856
empirically test.

2173
01:34:21,858 --> 01:34:23,860
Maxwell: I'll just add a bit of meta

2174
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:24,861
flavor to that.

2175
01:34:25,862 --> 01:34:26,863
So remember, I started with the

2176
01:34:26,863 --> 01:34:26,863
distinction between dynamics, mechanics

2177
01:34:26,863 --> 01:34:29,866
and principles.

2178
01:34:30,867 --> 01:34:32,869
Personally, I don't like the verbiage of

2179
01:34:32,869 --> 01:34:33,870
predictive processing.

2180
01:34:35,872 --> 01:34:38,874
Frankly, I don't think it the term refers

2181
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:38,874
to anything specific when people use the

2182
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:42,878
term rigorously.

2183
01:34:42,879 --> 01:34:45,882
So Andy Clark introduced the term in his

2184
01:34:45,882 --> 01:34:45,882
2013 paper Whatever Next because he

2185
01:34:45,882 --> 01:34:45,882
wanted to talk about some broad kind of

2186
01:34:45,882 --> 01:34:45,882
approach, prediction involving approach

2187
01:34:45,882 --> 01:34:56,892
to explaining cognition.

2188
01:34:56,893 --> 01:34:58,895
But at the time he didn't want to commit

2189
01:34:58,895 --> 01:34:58,895
to any specific implementation of the

2190
01:34:58,895 --> 01:35:00,891
idea.

2191
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:03,894
So he was like, here's predictive coding,

2192
01:35:03,894 --> 01:35:05,896
here's hierarchical predictive coding.

2193
01:35:05,896 --> 01:35:07,898
But as I'm sure you know, predictive

2194
01:35:07,898 --> 01:35:07,898
coding makes very specific predictions

2195
01:35:07,898 --> 01:35:07,898
about the neuronal implementation of the

2196
01:35:07,898 --> 01:35:13,904
theory.

2197
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:16,907
So in particular, predictive coding

2198
01:35:16,907 --> 01:35:16,907
assumes that there are distinct neuronal

2199
01:35:16,907 --> 01:35:16,907
subpopulations that encode the error and

2200
01:35:16,907 --> 01:35:22,913
the prediction error.

2201
01:35:23,914 --> 01:35:25,916
He didn't necessarily want to commit to

2202
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:25,916
one version of that because who knows,

2203
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:25,916
maybe it's the same sub populations that

2204
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:25,916
issue predictions and prediction errors

2205
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:25,916
at different times and you have some kind

2206
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:25,916
of time based rate coding or whatever

2207
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:37,928
going on.

2208
01:35:37,928 --> 01:35:39,930
He also at the time didn't want to commit

2209
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,932
to the Free Energy Principle per se.

2210
01:35:45,936 --> 01:35:47,938
But predictive processing doesn't really

2211
01:35:47,938 --> 01:35:49,940
denote a specific theory.

2212
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,942
And one of the problems that emerged is

2213
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:51,942
there's a whole bunch of literature

2214
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:51,942
presenting accounts that are consistent

2215
01:35:51,942 --> 01:35:51,942
with predictive processing, which doesn't

2216
01:35:51,942 --> 01:36:00,945
mean anything really.

2217
01:36:00,945 --> 01:36:02,947
It just means, hey, you can kind of wave

2218
01:36:02,947 --> 01:36:02,947
your hands around and this kind of looks

2219
01:36:02,947 --> 01:36:02,947
like a prediction if you kind of look at

2220
01:36:02,947 --> 01:36:07,952
it the right way.

2221
01:36:07,952 --> 01:36:09,954
I think the more rigorous way to

2222
01:36:09,954 --> 01:36:09,954
understand this is to bring it back to

2223
01:36:09,954 --> 01:36:09,954
the math and say that there are

2224
01:36:09,954 --> 01:36:15,960
principles, mechanics and dynamics.

2225
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,963
So there's some phenomenon that we want

2226
01:36:18,963 --> 01:36:18,963
to explain.

2227
01:36:18,963 --> 01:36:21,966
We have a formal description of it.

2228
01:36:21,966 --> 01:36:23,968
This might be like a data set or whatever

2229
01:36:23,968 --> 01:36:23,968
else describing the actual values of

2230
01:36:23,968 --> 01:36:29,974
whatever system you're considering.

2231
01:36:29,974 --> 01:36:32,977
The Free Energy Principle is deployed to

2232
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:32,977
construct specific generative models

2233
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:32,977
which provide you with the equations of

2234
01:36:32,977 --> 01:36:40,985
motion that explain that behavior.

2235
01:36:40,985 --> 01:36:41,986
Right?

2236
01:36:41,986 --> 01:36:43,988
So the generative model is, in effect, a

2237
01:36:43,988 --> 01:36:43,988
set of linked equations of motions that

2238
01:36:43,988 --> 01:36:43,988
you see here with these dependence

2239
01:36:43,988 --> 01:36:50,994
relationships.

2240
01:36:52,997 --> 01:36:56,001
So when you actually commit to a specific

2241
01:36:56,001 --> 01:36:56,001
generative model, then you are in a

2242
01:36:56,001 --> 01:36:56,001
terrain where you can bring empirical

2243
01:36:56,001 --> 01:36:56,001
evidence to kind of decide, validate or

2244
01:36:56,001 --> 01:37:08,007
to falsify the model.

2245
01:37:08,007 --> 01:37:11,010
So I would draw your attention to the

2246
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:13,012
Free Energy Principle.

2247
01:37:13,012 --> 01:37:15,014
We know the Free Energy Principle is true

2248
01:37:15,014 --> 01:37:16,015
for mathematical reasons.

2249
01:37:16,015 --> 01:37:19,018
It would be as silly to try to invalidate

2250
01:37:19,018 --> 01:37:19,018
the FEP empirically as it would be to try

2251
01:37:19,018 --> 01:37:19,018
to falsify calculus by trying to observe

2252
01:37:19,018 --> 01:37:27,026
some phenomenon in the empirical world.

2253
01:37:27,026 --> 01:37:29,028
It is true mathematically.

2254
01:37:29,028 --> 01:37:32,031
And then you use that principle to derive

2255
01:37:32,031 --> 01:37:34,033
specific models which are then testable.

2256
01:37:35,034 --> 01:37:38,037
So I don't know if we've gone all the way

2257
01:37:38,037 --> 01:37:38,037
here.

2258
01:37:39,038 --> 01:37:41,040
So this is somewhere still kind of in

2259
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:41,040
between an in principle explanation and a

2260
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:45,044
specific model.

2261
01:37:45,044 --> 01:37:47,046
To get to more fleshed out empirical

2262
01:37:47,046 --> 01:37:47,046
predictions of the sort that now was

2263
01:37:47,046 --> 01:37:47,046
discussing, we would have to get a bit

2264
01:37:47,046 --> 01:37:47,046
more specific, which we're doing kind of

2265
01:37:47,046 --> 01:37:55,054
in parallel.

2266
01:37:55,054 --> 01:37:58,057
I don't feel ready to discuss the exact

2267
01:37:58,057 --> 01:37:58,057
predictions and the ways that we'll be

2268
01:37:58,057 --> 01:37:58,057
discussing them or exploring them,

2269
01:37:58,057 --> 01:38:05,058
testing them.

2270
01:38:05,058 --> 01:38:07,060
This is very much work in progress.

2271
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:10,063
I can tell you it'll involve psychedelics,

2272
01:38:10,063 --> 01:38:10,063
, but that's pretty much where I'm not

2273
01:38:10,063 --> 01:38:10,063
comfortable extending any more than that.

2274
01:38:10,063 --> 01:38:17,070
.

2275
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:20,073
I feel like I might expose a flank that's

2276
01:38:20,073 --> 01:38:21,074
not ready to be exposed.

2277
01:38:24,077 --> 01:38:24,077
Samuel: Perfect.

2278
01:38:24,077 --> 01:38:27,080
Thanks for that pleasure.

2279
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:31,084
Maxwell: And that brings us to the end.

2280
01:38:31,084 --> 01:38:33,086
Thales, you have your hand up again.

2281
01:38:33,086 --> 01:38:37,090
Do you want to hop on?

2282
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:38,091
Thales: Do we have time?

2283
01:38:39,092 --> 01:38:40,093
Maxwell: Yeah, I think we have time for

2284
01:38:40,093 --> 01:38:41,094
one more question.

2285
01:38:42,095 --> 01:38:44,097
Thales: Daniel, do you want to ask

2286
01:38:44,097 --> 01:38:44,097
something?

2287
01:38:44,097 --> 01:38:46,099
Because I really asked two times.

2288
01:38:47,099 --> 01:38:47,100
Okay.

2289
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,103
Actually, I would like if you guys could

2290
01:38:50,103 --> 01:38:50,103
delve a little bit deeper in the

2291
01:38:50,103 --> 01:38:56,109
implications of Maria's first question.

2292
01:38:56,109 --> 01:38:59,112
It's the other side of the coin related

2293
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
to the protopan psychics, the population

2294
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
level conscious or conscious processes in

2295
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
complex organisms sharing phenotype, for

2296
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
example, like end colonies, or in a more

2297
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
speculative sense, like complex organisms

2298
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
aligned and shared, like a distributed

2299
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
generative model in niche building

2300
01:38:59,112 --> 01:39:26,133
processes,

2301
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:26,133
right?

2302
01:39:27,133 --> 01:39:30,137
So as Maxwell once said, the other side

2303
01:39:30,137 --> 01:39:34,141
of the natural selection process.

2304
01:39:34,141 --> 01:39:37,144
So given the sparsity and given the

2305
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:37,144
transient conversions that these

2306
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:37,144
populations are in this specific moment,

2307
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:37,144
specific process, can we speculate

2308
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:37,144
something about consciousness at this

2309
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:52,159
level?

2310
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:54,161
Thank you.

2311
01:39:56,163 --> 01:39:57,164
Mahault: All right.

2312
01:39:57,164 --> 01:39:59,166
I think Maxwell is staying quiet because

2313
01:39:59,166 --> 01:39:59,166
he expects me to sort of start answering

2314
01:39:59,166 --> 01:40:02,163
the question.

2315
01:40:02,163 --> 01:40:03,164
Maxwell: Correct.

2316
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:07,168
Mahault: So we've done a lot of work in

2317
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:10,171
simulating large scale systems, right?

2318
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:14,175
So we've simulated niche, we've simulated

2319
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:14,175
interaction between one, two, or more

2320
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:14,175
actors, what it means for belief sharing,

2321
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:14,175
propagation, the formation of mark of

2322
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:26,187
blankets, et cetera.

2323
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:30,191
And so I think the true question would be

2324
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:30,191
how transient are the mark of blankets at

2325
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:30,191
the level of superstructures and how does

2326
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:30,191
it enable those structures to be able to

2327
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:30,191
encode information at the level of the

2328
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:51,212
interaction between different scales?

2329
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:55,216
"So I do think that given our model you

2330
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:55,216
can assume that a system is conscious by

2331
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:55,216
virtue of having nested parts which can

2332
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:55,216
read and write where a superordinate

2333
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:55,216
entity level of the structure is ""write

2334
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:55,216
only"" and the lower level is also ""

2335
01:40:55,216 --> 01:41:13,228
"write only."""

2336
01:41:13,228 --> 01:41:16,231
And through this sort of boundary of the

2337
01:41:16,231 --> 01:41:16,231
entity and the interactions between the

2338
01:41:16,231 --> 01:41:16,231
parts of the entity you have what

2339
01:41:16,231 --> 01:41:16,231
resembles a conscious process at which

2340
01:41:16,231 --> 01:41:27,242
you have some degree of perception.

2341
01:41:29,244 --> 01:41:31,246
The really interesting question there

2342
01:41:31,246 --> 01:41:31,246
becomes what becomes the irreducible

2343
01:41:31,246 --> 01:41:34,249
parts?

2344
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:38,253
So if you could be understood a little

2345
01:41:38,253 --> 01:41:38,253
bit like a cell if you as a human, your

2346
01:41:38,253 --> 01:41:38,253
irreducibility is that your cell as a

2347
01:41:38,253 --> 01:41:46,261
part of a larger system,

2348
01:41:48,263 --> 01:41:53,267
what experiences at the system level?

2349
01:41:53,268 --> 01:41:55,270
And I think that's a really truly

2350
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:56,271
interesting question.

2351
01:41:56,271 --> 01:41:59,274
If we look at ants, for instance, ants on

2352
01:41:59,274 --> 01:41:59,274
their own don't do much computation,

2353
01:41:59,274 --> 01:42:03,272
right?

2354
01:42:03,272 --> 01:42:06,275
But ants at a hive then become much more

2355
01:42:06,275 --> 01:42:06,275
interesting and they behave in a

2356
01:42:06,275 --> 01:42:06,275
coordinated fashion, which can look as if

2357
01:42:06,275 --> 01:42:06,275
they were making much more complex

2358
01:42:06,275 --> 01:42:14,283
computation.

2359
01:42:14,283 --> 01:42:16,285
And you could say the same for your cells.

2360
01:42:16,285 --> 01:42:16,285
.

2361
01:42:16,285 --> 01:42:18,287
Your cells in themselves, they have a

2362
01:42:18,287 --> 01:42:18,287
very simple process, very simple

2363
01:42:18,287 --> 01:42:21,290
computation.

2364
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:24,293
But together, through these large scale

2365
01:42:24,293 --> 01:42:24,293
emerging coordinating patterns, some of

2366
01:42:24,293 --> 01:42:24,293
them become your skin, some of them

2367
01:42:24,293 --> 01:42:31,300
become your brain.

2368
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:34,303
And the conscious part that you are

2369
01:42:34,303 --> 01:42:34,303
experiencing at the scale at which you

2370
01:42:34,303 --> 01:42:34,303
can understand consciousness currently,

2371
01:42:34,303 --> 01:42:34,303
that's where most information is lost

2372
01:42:34,303 --> 01:42:34,303
such that the irreducible part of your

2373
01:42:34,303 --> 01:42:34,303
consciousness is the parts that can

2374
01:42:34,303 --> 01:42:51,320
become opaque.

2375
01:42:52,321 --> 01:42:55,324
So I think I've answered most of your

2376
01:42:55,324 --> 01:42:56,325
question.

2377
01:42:58,327 --> 01:43:01,324
Maxwell: I would maybe just add that this

2378
01:43:01,324 --> 01:43:01,324
is not fully chartered territory and I

2379
01:43:01,324 --> 01:43:01,324
think there may be some agreements and

2380
01:43:01,324 --> 01:43:09,332
disagreements.

2381
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:14,337
I'm always wary of the intentional

2382
01:43:14,337 --> 01:43:14,337
misattribution fallacy where we attribute

2383
01:43:14,337 --> 01:43:14,337
intentionality or mental properties to

2384
01:43:14,337 --> 01:43:27,350
things that don't end up having them.

2385
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:29,352
I think that the kind of minimal

2386
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:29,352
intentionality pan, intentionalism pan,

2387
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:29,352
representationalism, whatever you want to

2388
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:29,352
call it, that follows from the free

2389
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:29,352
energy principle gets you a lot of the

2390
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:29,352
intelligent looking behavior without

2391
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:29,352
having to posit that there is actually

2392
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:29,352
something it's like to be a city or

2393
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:51,374
whatever.

2394
01:43:51,374 --> 01:43:54,377
What makes me skeptical of the idea that

2395
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:54,377
there is such a thing is that what we are

2396
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:54,377
suggesting is that what's necessary for

2397
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:54,377
consciousness in the stronger kind of

2398
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:54,377
agential sense is an external Markov

2399
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:54,377
blanket that insulates a bunch of

2400
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:54,377
internal states and then that these

2401
01:43:54,377 --> 01:43:54,377
internal states in turn have this kind of

2402
01:43:54,377 --> 01:44:15,392
nested structure.

2403
01:44:15,392 --> 01:44:18,395
And that's what I don't think there is in

2404
01:44:18,395 --> 01:44:18,395
say, like a city or like a higher order

2405
01:44:18,395 --> 01:44:18,395
kind of cultural I'd have to think about

2406
01:44:18,395 --> 01:44:24,401
this.

2407
01:44:24,401 --> 01:44:26,403
So you're kind of pushing at the limits

2408
01:44:26,403 --> 01:44:28,405
of where I'm comfortable thinking.

2409
01:44:28,405 --> 01:44:29,406
Which is appreciated, by the way.

2410
01:44:29,406 --> 01:44:32,409
Thank you for the challenging questions.

2411
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:35,412
Yeah, but I think there's room for

2412
01:44:35,412 --> 01:44:35,412
disagreement and I might be wrong about

2413
01:44:35,412 --> 01:44:38,414
this.

2414
01:44:38,415 --> 01:44:41,418
I uh think we just have to keep pushing

2415
01:44:41,418 --> 01:44:42,419
to find out who's correct.

2416
01:44:42,419 --> 01:44:45,422
But I find what Mahault said interesting

2417
01:44:45,422 --> 01:44:48,425
and compelling and intriguing.

2418
01:44:48,425 --> 01:44:51,428
I am just intellectually conservative at

2419
01:44:51,428 --> 01:44:54,431
this point in my life, being an old man.

2420
01:44:57,434 --> 01:44:59,436
Mahault: This is why I think it's a

2421
01:44:59,436 --> 01:44:59,436
little bit complicated to fully answer

2422
01:44:59,436 --> 01:44:59,436
that question because we have

2423
01:44:59,436 --> 01:44:59,436
metaphorical tools but we don't have

2424
01:44:59,436 --> 01:45:10,441
anything ready yet to go any further.

2425
01:45:11,442 --> 01:45:15,445
One thing that I like to think about is

2426
01:45:15,445 --> 01:45:15,445
the only way you're ever going to

2427
01:45:15,445 --> 01:45:15,445
experience maybe what it's like to be

2428
01:45:15,445 --> 01:45:15,445
part of a consciousness which is entailed

2429
01:45:15,445 --> 01:45:15,445
by something more than you is having

2430
01:45:15,445 --> 01:45:15,445
connection to sort of hyper feed hive

2431
01:45:15,445 --> 01:45:15,445
mind thing and being kind of pushed and

2432
01:45:15,445 --> 01:45:36,467
pulled.

2433
01:45:36,467 --> 01:45:40,471
So if you've ever been part of what a mob

2434
01:45:40,471 --> 01:45:40,471
or if you are on Twitter and you see

2435
01:45:40,471 --> 01:45:40,471
people piling on to something and then

2436
01:45:40,471 --> 01:45:40,471
you talk to them and they're like, I kind

2437
01:45:40,471 --> 01:45:40,471
of blacked out, I don't know what

2438
01:45:40,471 --> 01:45:55,486
happened.

2439
01:45:55,486 --> 01:45:58,489
Because you can't at this part of the

2440
01:45:58,489 --> 01:45:58,489
hierarchy compute the entirety of what

2441
01:45:58,489 --> 01:46:03,488
happened.

2442
01:46:03,488 --> 01:46:06,491
All you can do is understand sort of your

2443
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:06,491
path that was part of a larger network of

2444
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:06,491
web of paths which themselves, given the

2445
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:06,491
priors of the superstructures you're

2446
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:06,491
embedded in are kind of sort of going

2447
01:46:06,491 --> 01:46:22,507
somewhere and represent.

2448
01:46:24,509 --> 01:46:24,509
the

2449
01:46:24,509 --> 01:46:27,512
error push of all the people that share a

2450
01:46:27,512 --> 01:46:27,512
similar type of model that therefore

2451
01:46:27,512 --> 01:46:33,518
constitutes a cultural direction.

2452
01:46:33,518 --> 01:46:36,521
So that’s the best way I think we can

2453
01:46:36,521 --> 01:46:36,521
understand hyper-priors as a function of

2454
01:46:36,521 --> 01:46:36,521
what it might be like to be a city sort

2455
01:46:36,521 --> 01:46:44,529
of thing.

2456
01:46:44,529 --> 01:46:47,532
But that's as far as I can take this

2457
01:46:47,532 --> 01:46:49,534
metaphor for now.

2458
01:46:50,535 --> 01:46:51,536
Daniel: Awesome!

2459
01:46:52,536 --> 01:46:53,538
Does anyone want to give a final

2460
01:46:53,538 --> 01:46:54,539
thought?

2461
01:46:54,539 --> 01:46:56,541
Otherwise, I'll just list just a few

2462
01:46:56,541 --> 01:46:56,541
points that I found really cool about the

2463
01:46:56,541 --> 01:46:56,541
discussion and kind of places it takes us

2464
01:46:56,541 --> 01:47:00,539
at the end.

2465
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:02,541
Anyone else want to give us?

2466
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:04,543
Maxwell: I just want to say that the hard

2467
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:04,543
problem is really hard and it's called

2468
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:07,546
like that for a reason.

2469
01:47:09,548 --> 01:47:12,551
I think we're hopefully moving in the

2470
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:12,551
direction of making this less mysterious.

2471
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:15,554
.

2472
01:47:15,554 --> 01:47:18,557
But all of this should be taken as very

2473
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:18,557
preliminary investigations, really trying

2474
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:18,557
to sketch out the bare bones of an

2475
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:25,564
explanation.

2476
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:30,569
And yeah, there is far more work ahead of

2477
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:32,571
us than behind us, I think.

2478
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:35,574
Now, any final thoughts?

2479
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:39,578
Mahault: I like to think about it in the

2480
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:40,579
opposite terms.

2481
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:46,585
In terms of the future of evolution can

2482
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:46,585
be understood through what it's like to

2483
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:46,585
have language and what it's like to have

2484
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:55,594
larger scale cognition.

2485
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:58,597
And therefore yes, of course, this is

2486
01:47:58,597 --> 01:47:58,597
very preliminary research, but it's cool

2487
01:47:58,597 --> 01:48:01,594
to dream.

2488
01:48:05,598 --> 01:48:05,598
Daniel: Awesome.

2489
01:48:05,598 --> 01:48:06,599
Any guest?

2490
01:48:06,599 --> 01:48:07,600
Maria?

2491
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:07,600
Samuel?

2492
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,602
Ali? Thales?

2493
01:48:11,604 --> 01:48:13,606
Thales: Yeah, quick one.

2494
01:48:15,608 --> 01:48:18,611
So any prediction on when the other two

2495
01:48:18,611 --> 01:48:20,613
preference will come out?

2496
01:48:20,613 --> 01:48:22,615
I'm really interested in it.

2497
01:48:25,618 --> 01:48:29,622
Maxwell: Inshallah the Mum paper will be

2498
01:48:29,622 --> 01:48:29,622
released early July right now, reasonably,

2499
01:48:29,622 --> 01:48:29,622
, and then the other one has to do with

2500
01:48:29,622 --> 01:48:29,622
extending outwards and that might be like

2501
01:48:29,622 --> 01:48:43,636
another year.

2502
01:48:44,637 --> 01:48:47,640
I don't think that's coming soon, but

2503
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:47,640
hopefully revisions to this paper will be

2504
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:47,640
coming out also over the summer and yeah,

2505
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:57,650
I would anticipate July.

2506
01:48:59,652 --> 01:49:00,647
Hopefully. We'll see.

2507
01:49:00,647 --> 01:49:02,649
There's a lot going on right now!

2508
01:49:05,652 --> 01:49:06,653
Daniel: Awesome.

2509
01:49:06,653 --> 01:49:09,656
All right… Samuel, please.

2510
01:49:09,656 --> 01:49:12,659
Samuel: I just want to say thank you to

2511
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:15,662
everyone for answering my questions.

2512
01:49:16,663 --> 01:49:18,665
Maxwell: Well, thank you for your

2513
01:49:18,665 --> 01:49:18,665
attention, your kind comments and your

2514
01:49:18,665 --> 01:49:21,668
interest.

2515
01:49:22,668 --> 01:49:24,671
It was really fun to discuss and I think

2516
01:49:24,671 --> 01:49:27,673
you asked a lot of important questions.

2517
01:49:27,673 --> 01:49:36,682
Daniel: Thales, or anyone else.

2518
01:49:36,682 --> 01:49:39,686
Thales: Yeah, I also wanted to thank you

2519
01:49:39,686 --> 01:49:39,686
so much for having I mean, I know that

2520
01:49:39,686 --> 01:49:39,686
these kinds of discussions can have lots

2521
01:49:39,686 --> 01:49:39,686
of implications in many, many other areas,

2522
01:49:39,686 --> 01:49:39,686
, but it was really illuminating and

2523
01:49:39,686 --> 01:49:55,702
clarifying.

2524
01:49:57,704 --> 01:49:59,706
Maxwell: You're too kind, my friend.

2525
01:49:59,706 --> 01:50:00,701
Thank you very much.

2526
01:50:01,702 --> 01:50:03,704
Yeah, this has been fun. Genuinely!

2527
01:50:03,704 --> 01:50:06,707
Daniel: Awesome!

2528
01:50:06,707 --> 01:50:09,710
All right, I'll just give a few comments.

2529
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:09,710
.

2530
01:50:10,711 --> 01:50:13,714
All right, so first, yes, congratulations

2531
01:50:13,714 --> 01:50:14,715
to all for the recent papers.

2532
01:50:14,715 --> 01:50:17,718
It's really exciting to see a kind of

2533
01:50:17,718 --> 01:50:17,718
continuum and integration with all these

2534
01:50:17,718 --> 01:50:21,722
different threads.

2535
01:50:22,723 --> 01:50:24,725
The way that we think of physics and the

2536
01:50:24,725 --> 01:50:24,725
physics of information and the history

2537
01:50:24,725 --> 01:50:24,725
and the philosophy of the physics of

2538
01:50:24,725 --> 01:50:29,730
information.

2539
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:31,732
That kind of a gradient might be

2540
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:31,732
reimagined such that there's a clearer

2541
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:31,732
understanding of when it's the firmware

2542
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:31,732
or the kernel of in the tradition of as I

2543
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:31,732
see you at all writing sometimes in

2544
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:31,732
versus interpretations and that's maybe

2545
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:48,749
situational but that's a gray area.

2546
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:52,753
Reminds me of the instrumentalist realism

2547
01:50:52,753 --> 01:50:53,754
debates of 2021.

2548
01:50:53,754 --> 01:50:56,756
Your with the map and the territory which

2549
01:50:56,756 --> 01:50:56,756
has been developed out so much further

2550
01:50:56,756 --> 01:50:56,756
and just the ability, especially in a

2551
01:50:56,756 --> 01:50:56,756
situation in a model specific way to

2552
01:50:56,756 --> 01:50:56,756
separate out the intelligence or

2553
01:50:56,756 --> 01:50:56,756
information structure or the behavior

2554
01:50:56,756 --> 01:51:11,766
from any kind of qualia type discussion.

2555
01:51:12,767 --> 01:51:15,770
The recent developments with Chris Fields

2556
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:15,770
at all and the waste energy and where

2557
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:15,770
free energy goes and the kind of saying

2558
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:15,770
like one has forgotten more than someone

2559
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:26,781
else has learned.

2560
01:51:27,782 --> 01:51:29,784
So just the idea that to have awareness,

2561
01:51:29,784 --> 01:51:29,784
there has to be that discardle and then

2562
01:51:29,784 --> 01:51:29,784
that might be related to the

2563
01:51:29,784 --> 01:51:29,784
irreversibility and the time

2564
01:51:29,784 --> 01:51:29,784
consciousness that also you've been

2565
01:51:29,784 --> 01:51:29,784
developing the Eco Evo devo components

2566
01:51:29,784 --> 01:51:41,796
and just multiscale

2567
01:51:41,796 --> 01:51:44,799
biology, connecting it to traditions of

2568
01:51:44,799 --> 01:51:44,799
thought and work in biology, which is big,

2569
01:51:44,799 --> 01:51:44,799
, but that's kind of how we retro

2570
01:51:44,799 --> 01:51:52,807
Grandparent back into biology.

2571
01:51:52,807 --> 01:51:55,810
Promisingly with the ways that multiscale

2572
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
systems are already considered and then

2573
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
also just the recent developments in

2574
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
category theory and the primacy of the

2575
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
relational and the physics as information

2576
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
processing and then the way that that

2577
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
enables very knowledgeable individuals

2578
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
like you all to come from a lot of the

2579
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
philosophy and the history and all these

2580
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
other threads to come together with the

2581
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:55,810
actual modeling in a very satisfying way.

2582
01:51:55,810 --> 01:52:22,831
.

2583
01:52:22,831 --> 01:52:24,833
So thank you all for the stream and

2584
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:27,836
really looking forward to next steps.

2585
01:52:28,837 --> 01:52:29,838
Bye.

2586
01:52:29,838 --> 01:52:30,839
Mahault: Thank you.

2587
01:52:30,839 --> 01:52:31,840
Thales: Bye bye.

2588
01:52:32,841 --> 01:52:33,842
Thanks.

2589
01:52:33,842 --> 01:52:33,842
Bye.
