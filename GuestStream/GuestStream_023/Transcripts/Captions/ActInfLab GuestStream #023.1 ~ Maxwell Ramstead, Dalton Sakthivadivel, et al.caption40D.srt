1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:09,109
Hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:14,247
It is June 13th, 2022,
and we're here in Acton Lab.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,752
Guest stream number 23.1
with Maxwell and Dalton.

4
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:22,255
We're talking about
rebooting the three energy principal

5
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,258
literature and their recent publication.

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,129
So I'll pass it to the two of you
to provide

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,233
just an initial introduction
and some context for the paper.

8
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,635
Before we jump into some specific parts.

9
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,605
Maxwell First.

10
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:39,406
Cool.

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,342
My name is Maxwell Ramstad.

12
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,310
I am the director of research

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,782
at the Viruses Research Lab,
where we specialize

14
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,585
in probabilistic approaches
to artificial intelligence

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,456
and of late, most of my research

16
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,260
has been on the physics
foundations of the free energy principle.

17
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,496
And I'm very,

18
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:07,333
very much looking forward
to having this conversation.

19
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,070
Awesome. And Dalton.

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,438
Sure.

21
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,307
Okay. Well, I'm Dalton.

22
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,943
I'm a mathematician and physicist.

23
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:19,846
So right

24
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,583
now, I'm I'm at Stony
Brook University in New York.

25
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,553
I'm also at the verses lab

26
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,755
where we're doing
some work on the free energy principle.

27
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:29,722
Right now,

28
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:34,394
my research interests are about formal
approaches to biological physics

29
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,931
and mathematical foundations of complex
systems and these kinds of questions.

30
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:42,569
One of the most interesting
frameworks in this sphere is the free

31
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,339
energy principle, and that's how
I've gotten involved in this literature.

32
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,442
Awesome.

33
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,544
So maybe in the same order,

34
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,447
what brought us to this paper?

35
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,750
What was the gap
that this paper stepped into

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,020
and how did this team arise
around the paper?

37
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,791
And I'll bring it up on the screen
as well.

38
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,926
Good question.

39
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:11,397
Well, I think the paper does
a bunch of different things.

40
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,802
The first I mean, we've presented this
as rebooting the free energy

41
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,903
principle literature.

42
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,672
I think

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,242
over the last it's

44
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,045
been almost two decades
now since the FFP has been a thing.

45
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,549
I think the first paper was circa
2005 ish

46
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,553
and the framework

47
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,991
or the the field of study
that has emerged around the free energy

48
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:43,263
principle has changed a lot over the last
two decades, in no small part

49
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,833
in terms of the self-understanding
that we have

50
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:51,237
as a community of practitioners
working with these techniques.

51
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:56,242
And I mean,
as they pointed out a while back,

52
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,245
I think the last time that really

53
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,748
the Occupy literature had been surveyed

54
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,653
in a systematic fashion
to kind of present where we were at,

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,191
where we are, kind of like State of
the Art was probably Karl's

56
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,695
monograph from 2019th January 2019.

57
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,766
I mean, you know, both of you were part
of this international physics

58
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,367
reading group that we had.

59
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:26,072
This was not
this is not a simple piece to read. And

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,943
yet, since then, there hasn't really been

61
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,379
basically a summary
of where the literature is.

62
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,183
So on the one hand,
we were aiming to reboot the literature

63
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,087
to to basically summarize

64
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,791
the ways that the free energy
principle had been applied

65
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,494
in the literature and

66
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:53,233
to also present a lot of the progress
that had been made over

67
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,769
the last three years,
a lot of which is due to Delta.

68
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,374
So I think that Segways
nicely into the it's a download

69
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,076
well.

70
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,245
Too generous by far as usual.

71
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,946
But yeah.

72
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,283
So Maxwell raises a good point that there

73
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,719
hasn't been really

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,824
an effort to tie together
all the different threads

75
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,493
since probably 2019.

76
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,663
And one of the reasons why

77
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,533
I mean, that's that's a long time,
but it's not overly long.

78
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:32,038
However, in the last couple of years,
there have been some pretty

79
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,242
serious advances in the state
of the mathematics and the physics

80
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,244
behind the free energy principle.

81
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,880
So now, you know, three years

82
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,783
later, we're in 2022, it's
not a long time.

83
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,553
But nevertheless, there have been
big developments that really

84
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,824
beg this kind of a survey to be done.

85
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,094
And so that was one of the aims,
at least of the paper,

86
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:58,264
was to draw together
all the different threads, to unify them,

87
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:03,903
make them a bit more cohesive and
and present the free energy principle

88
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,006
as we're conceptualizing it today
in a very top

89
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,043
to bottom fashion.

90
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:14,814
Though, before we jump into the sections
and the arguments

91
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,885
and the claims in the paper, which I'm
sure will cover a lot of these updates,

92
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,855
I'd just love to hear
what is the free energy principle,

93
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:28,027
what is active inference,
and how are they related?

94
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,197
I mean, I guess

95
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,200
in the most general sense,
the free energy principle

96
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,171
is a statement
that says that we can understand

97
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:43,710
the dynamics of self-organizing systems
as following a path

98
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,447
of least surprising
in the most general sense.

99
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,551
And then in that context, it's good
that you ask the question.

100
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,886
I think that there are at least two

101
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,056
uses of the term
active inference in the literature.

102
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:58,958
The one that I tended

103
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:03,329
to use is a very broad sense,
which is just like active

104
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,866
inference is specifying
a path of least action

105
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,203
for what are called autonomous states.

106
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,173
So like the active
and internal states of systems

107
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,044
that are considered
things under the free energy formulation.

108
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:24,016
Active inference is also been used
to refer to a class of specific,

109
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:27,120
partially observable
Markov decision process models

110
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,057
that have been deployed,
and most of the implement

111
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,060
in Silico implementations
of the Free Energy Principle.

112
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,698
Rely on these and I think this has led
to a little bit of confusion

113
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,135
in that, you know, when folks say

114
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:48,241
active inference is a general theory able
to account for self-organization.

115
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,878
They're not they're not saying
this specific class of pump

116
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,248
models as effectively, you know,
repurpose people for everything.

117
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,117
So, yeah, I would say that

118
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:02,622
this is the first sense that I outlined
is the sense in which we say that active

119
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,625
inference is a corollary
of the free energy principle.

120
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,096
And yeah,
I mean, in its most general form,

121
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,598
the free energy
principle is just the statement

122
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,202
and an alternative statement
or a restatement

123
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,438
of the principle of stationary action.

124
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,974
Where the action is defined
as a surprise will

125
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,044
in effect.

126
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:25,878
Great.

127
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:29,215
Dalton, same questions to you.

128
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,885
Yeah, I think Max pretty much covered it.

129
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,423
So as I mentioned, you know,
my background is actually not in the

130
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,561
free energy principle, not originally,
and it's not even in machine learning.

131
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:46,699
So I have come at this literature
with a bit of a different set

132
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,269
of ideas and traditions and tools.

133
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,473
And so as a result,
I can't really talk about

134
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,775
active, intrinsic,
and I'm not totally familiar with it,

135
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,213
but I can talk about the free energy
principle at length.

136
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,081
I'll try to be brief.

137
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,451
So to me, the free energy

138
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:10,623
principle is a statement
that random dynamical systems

139
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,194
do on average unsurprising things.

140
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,164
And and it's a very simple statement.

141
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,201
All it means is that
if you have a random dynamical system

142
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,371
and it's trying to get

143
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,074
to some place in state space,

144
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,776
that is not surprising to it.

145
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:37,116
So some preferred region of state space,
maybe a particular phenotype, maybe

146
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,686
a particular morphological blueprint,
something like this.

147
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,624
The free energy
principle is a statement of

148
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:48,995
not only that that happens,
but also a set of tools to model

149
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,298
how that happens, how the systems
get to these kinds of attractors.

150
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,970
And there is this very interesting way
in which the

151
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,475
the getting to that attractor
can be read as inference.

152
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:03,876
And this is where these

153
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:08,281
all these connections in literature
appear to things like active inference.

154
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,916
You can talk about how systems actually

155
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,352
get themselves to that attractor
as a perception of action problem,

156
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,088
and you can model it
using this very famous

157
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,526
variational free energy bound,
and you can show, okay, when the system

158
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,964
is encoding some sort of belief
about its environment and about itself,

159
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,233
when it does this inference,

160
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,003
you have the minimization of some upper
bound on surprise.

161
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:36,375
So. So the system is at least doing
unsurprising things at the level of

162
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,679
its not exceeding some kind of
intrinsic surprising

163
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,482
that some of the early formulations,
some of the more recent formulations

164
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,350
take it even further.

165
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,021
And you say the surprise of full stuff of
of some trajectory of the system

166
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:53,492
is going to be minimized by the system
that's going to take on average,

167
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:58,030
the system is going to do what
it expects to do, which in this case is

168
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,268
get to some region in the state space
that it prefers to inhabit.

169
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,272
What makes that not a tautology

170
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,607
and what makes it something

171
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,243
that we can actually operationalize
and ask interesting questions about

172
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,080
is the fact that there
is this nice connection to inference.

173
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,216
There are all of these explicit
mathematical tools

174
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,085
that we can use to talk about

175
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,989
surprise and minimization,
not just as the kind of information

176
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,225
theoretic statement of systems
that aren't surprising,

177
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,928
but systems that aren't surprised

178
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,999
do unsurprising things that ends up
a little bit more nuanced than that. And

179
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:37,069
so so to me, the free energy principle
is this whole host of results about

180
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,505
random dynamical

181
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,675
systems
and especially random dynamical systems

182
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,977
which are organized
or which self-organize.

183
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,246
I think that is

184
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,881
how I would think of it.

185
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,916
And it's and it's got some physics and

186
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,186
stuff
that that we can actually talk about

187
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,390
in that context. Awesome.

188
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,492
Thanks both for those great answers.

189
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,997
I'm pulling up the paper
and so many things in what you said.

190
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,365
I just wanted to follow up on.

191
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,869
But let's follow the main
line of the paper.

192
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,237
And wherever you think

193
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,273
there are some dots
that could be connected or any questions

194
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:18,744
arising or areas of future research
or the connection to applications

195
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:22,381
that you're working on or other people
might think about getting involved in.

196
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:26,619
We can just take those little cul
de sacs from the main line.

197
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,022
So I have the paper up

198
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,024
on Bayesian

199
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,062
mechanics, a physics of and by beliefs.

200
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,863
The two of you are the first authors.

201
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,200
There's also Connor Hynes, Magnus Coote,
all Baron Milledge,

202
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,337
Lancelot, D'Costa, Brandon
Klein and Karl Friston.

203
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,741
Any just overview notes on again

204
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,711
like what led to this team
or anything like that?

205
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:57,917
While we're on this first page, well.

206
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:03,522
From my perspective, you know, Dublin
and I have been talking a lot about this

207
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:09,128
kind of stuff for the last year, year
and a half, two years.

208
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:14,233
And yeah, I won't I won't try to.

209
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,036
I'll try not to be too

210
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,805
overly General Skelton, but I think.

211
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,441
Yeah.

212
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,445
So some of Dalton's work has,
I think, changed

213
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:31,484
the way that we think
about the FFP in particular.

214
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:37,189
We worked with Dalton late in this great
paper towards a geometry and analysis

215
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,292
for Bayesian

216
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:44,230
mechanics is to show that the free energy
principle

217
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,801
and the principle of constrained maximum
entropy are actually dual to each other.

218
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,871
They are two sides of the same coin.

219
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,140
And I you know, I've been

220
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:59,111
I've been following this line of work
for quite some time.

221
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,114
And I think it's foundational
really changes

222
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,783
the way that we think about the ATP.

223
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,686
It moves it from like this,
some might say exotic result

224
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:11,457
from theoretical neurobiology to,

225
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,760
you know, it connects it back up to

226
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:19,431
the foundations of contemporary physics
effectively by showing that,

227
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:24,136
you know, this thing that we understand
and almost take for granted,

228
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,640
you know, maximum entropy inference
procedures turn out to connect up

229
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,710
to this free energy
literature in a non-trivial way.

230
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,313
So I think the paper started out

231
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,851
and it didn't end this way,
but I think we started off trying

232
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:44,223
to write a reader friendly companion
to the work that Dalton had done,

233
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,025
but by the end

234
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,360
of it realized that this was more,

235
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,331
I think, Dalton's paper towards geometry

236
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,167
and analysis for Bayesian mechanics.

237
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,672
I think it stands on its own

238
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,075
as a piece of piece
of mathematical reasoning.

239
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:07,780
So it is an exercise in maximum entropy,
inference, math,

240
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,716
and it shows that you can recover

241
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,118
some of the really core results
of the free energy

242
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,622
formulation, just using the language
of constraint, maximum entropy.

243
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:20,726
In particular, Dalton approves
the approximate Bayesian inference

244
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,864
lemma that had caused so much discussion
in our literature

245
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,633
for the last bit.

246
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,470
And so, you know,
I think the paper grew out of that.

247
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,609
And yeah,
the team is something of a who's

248
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,779
who of like the, you know,
the core contributors to this literature.

249
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,350
And it just from a strategic
point of view, it was important

250
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,553
for us to have like,
you know, allowance to Costa.

251
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,522
Karl Friston, you know, Connor

252
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,092
Hynes and folks that had been,

253
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,795
I think, contributing
to this core formulation

254
00:14:56,795 --> 00:15:01,667
and in particular to the development of,
you know, this new framing

255
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:06,639
of the free energy
stuff of Bayesian mechanics.

256
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,974
So yeah,
I think that the paper grew out of that.

257
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:13,245
And if Dalton's paper is this Dalton's
stance

258
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,982
towards the geometry and analysis
for Bayesian

259
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,753
mechanics is a kind of standalone
piece of mathematical reasoning.

260
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,757
This is more about how this actually fits
into the free energy

261
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,691
principle literature.

262
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,395
So this is very much more a free energy
principle at a richer paper.

263
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,498
And yeah, we

264
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:36,335
were hoping to do as reader
friendly and introduction as we could.

265
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:41,373
There are actually two whole kind
of introductory sections in the paper,

266
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,044
but we ended up doing a lot of,
I think, important work

267
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,514
in that paper, connecting up
to the free energy principle.

268
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,750
I hope that helps. Answer me.

269
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,619
Great answer and welcome.

270
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:58,524
Lars, would you like to give
any overviews or notes before we jump

271
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,795
into the sections of the paper?

272
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,796
Hey, thanks.

273
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,298
Thanks for sending me the link
there. Mexican.

274
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,833
Allow me on here.

275
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,301
No, nothing really to add there.

276
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:09,902
I'm just

277
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,572
here as a spectator of a few questions
as we go down along and maybe concurrence

278
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,406
of the conversation.

279
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,942
But yeah,
thanks for having me on. Awesome.

280
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,477
All right.

281
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,780
So the abstract begins
with a really clear aim.

282
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,117
The aim of this paper is to introduce
a field of study that has emerged

283
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,753
over the last decade
called Bayesian Mechanics.

284
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,923
And we're going to be unpacking
that claim.

285
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,160
So suffice to say, the abstract
very clear and summarizes

286
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,230
some of the core points
that we're going to delve into now.

287
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,034
We're looking now at the contents.

288
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:47,840
So what led to the sections of the paper
being this way

289
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,577
and in this order?

290
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,912
What did you feel like
it was important to include?

291
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,949
What did you feel like
it was important to introduce and why?

292
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:57,883
Okay.

293
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:02,421
Well, so if you look,
I'll actually pull it up in front of me

294
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,190
so that we were all talking
about the same thing

295
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,361
to me. 1/2

296
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,134
and it's viewable in large size
on the live stream.

297
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,137
So yeah, feel free to have your own copy
up, but I'll have whatever section

298
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,205
we're looking at
will be very visible in the lecture.

299
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,540
While.

300
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,942
Maxwell is grabbing his copy.

301
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,212
I'll just give a couple
of contextual remarks.

302
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,516
So, so like Maxwell
described, I mean, originally

303
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,251
I had

304
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:37,322
released this set of results about what
we call approximate Bayesian inference.

305
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:42,728
And so the mathematical basis
for some of the key ideas

306
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,765
in the PHP literature
up until that point anyway

307
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,771
and originally
it was meant to be a much shorter paper

308
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:57,476
that just dissected some of those results
and related them back to the SDP

309
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,480
in a way that was a little more concrete
and a way that people

310
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,316
who actually work on the ACP
might might care a little more about.

311
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,953
Because of course,
the stuff that I wrote about is

312
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,624
a little far removed from the SDP, even
though it's an object and inspiration.

313
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,961
So the results in in that paper,

314
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,863
there is a reading of that paper

315
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,700
where it's formally pretty
distinct from the it. And

316
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,669
so so originally

317
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:29,241
that was the goal is to just give it
some extra physics intuition

318
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,212
and some extra connection
to the actual ethics.

319
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,382
It became something a little bit
different as we were building this out

320
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:41,687
and we realized, okay,
there are a whole set of new results,

321
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:48,660
not only mine, but also from Carl
TMB Group and from others folks.

322
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,897
And they all really should be tied
together nicely.

323
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,933
And part of that is the connecting

324
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,936
the geometry
and analysis paper to the actual FEC.

325
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:02,040
Part of it is actually talking about what
we would

326
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,376
think of the ACP as today

327
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,348
that shaped the table of contents
a little bit

328
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:13,452
because a lot of what we
then wanted to go and say is, okay,

329
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,389
we have this theory
of the free energy principle.

330
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,324
One of the key

331
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:23,428
ideas in the way that we're viewing
the free energy principle today

332
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,065
is that it is just a bit of physics.

333
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:31,270
It is it is much like classical mechanics
or statistical mechanics.

334
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:36,575
It has a set of mathematical results

335
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,645
that sort of hang around it, that
give it a nice foundation,

336
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:45,083
and it applies to specific systems
and describes them in a specific way.

337
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,554
And that was why we began
with both an overview of

338
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,858
what is mechanics, what do we talk about
in physics when we say mechanics?

339
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,061
And also Section three is
what is the free energy principle?

340
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,797
What have we talked about
so far in the literature

341
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,568
and what might we define
as Bayesian mechanics?

342
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,071
So what is what is the physics of beliefs
or systems that carry beliefs?

343
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,576
So that's sort of excuse me,
that sort of shaped

344
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,812
the first maybe 20 pages of the papers.

345
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,482
It's just building out the theory
and the context for the theory

346
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,654
afterwards is
a bit of a sort of change in

347
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,991
our line of attack.

348
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,860
But but you'll see
it does remain very similar.

349
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,831
So I won't get too far ahead of myself

350
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,900
or. Any other notes.

351
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,703
Maxwell Or we can carry on.

352
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,505
I think that's a, that's a great summary.

353
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,473
I think.

354
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,477
Yeah, we, we try to keep

355
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,914
this as self-contained
as possible as a paper.

356
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,084
So, you know, the two

357
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,487
introductory sections are meant to

358
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,825
provide some kind of visual

359
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,894
intuition
for a lot of the more formal results

360
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:06,865
that are discussed in the paper
and in the papers that it builds on.

361
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,203
We have, you know,
the artistic brilliance of Brennan

362
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,373
Klein was added to this paper.

363
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,210
So, you know,
I think the the illustrations help.

364
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,581
The idea was that,
you know, based on Dalton's work,

365
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,084
we are formulating
basically a geometry and analysis

366
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,221
for the core results in the three energy
principle literature.

367
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,423
So we thought, let's leverage

368
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,226
the geometric nature of a

369
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,162
lot of these intuitions
to really illustrate them.

370
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:43,168
And so, yeah, that I think
explains a lot of the structure

371
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,405
and the paper ends on some philosophical

372
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:52,778
considerations and hopefully clarifies
some of the confusions

373
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,114
or misunderstandings, understandable

374
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,918
misunderstandings that have arisen.

375
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:00,218
Yeah.

376
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,055
So I think that that does really address

377
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,692
I guess the last thing to point out
is we introduced this

378
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,496
field of study in the last section

379
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,832
that we we call G theory,

380
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,502
which is,
I think, the direction that we're going

381
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:22,841
to be moving in for a while,
which is formulating

382
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,545
the free energy principle
and the Bayesian mechanics

383
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,214
in terms of maximum caliber. So

384
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,318
extending this duality between

385
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,622
the density dynamics formulation,

386
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,760
the free energy principle in terms
of probability densities over states

387
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,529
and maximum

388
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,867
constrained maximum entropy
to paper based formulation.

389
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,938
So past entropy installed caliber
and you can

390
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,441
Dalton is one of the world

391
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,877
specialists in maximum caliber

392
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:04,416
and the maximum caliber is a maximum
path entropy.

393
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,551
So it's the same idea as maximum entropy.

394
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,388
But you're
considering the entropy of paths.

395
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,290
And we have had, you know,

396
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:17,162
the free energy principle started off
as formulated in terms of path.

397
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:21,466
So after all, it is a version
of the principle of stationary action.

398
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,903
It leads us to write down
paths of stationary action.

399
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,840
And so the the ambition now
is to connect these things out

400
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,510
much more formally so that we can

401
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,914
we can handle really genuine

402
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,551
non equilibria, things like wandering

403
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:45,223
marks of blankets and moving attractors
and all that kind of stuff, which find,

404
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,092
you know, a home

405
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:51,229
much more naturally in the language
of maximum caliber than you did.

406
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,731
You want add anything to that, Dalton?

407
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,200
You're really the max cal expert.

408
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,903
No, I think that's

409
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:02,307
that's a good account of one of the key
future directions is,

410
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:06,011
you know, we spend the first half
introducing Bayesian mechanics.

411
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:11,616
We spend the second half talking
about where Bayesian mechanics fits

412
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:16,755
into the rest of statistical mechanics
and high energy physics

413
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:20,826
by connecting it to max sense
and to gauge theories.

414
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,862
And this is where
some of the geometric stuff comes in.

415
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,433
And then that the very last thing we do,
we sort of cap it off by saying,

416
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,604
okay, now, you know, we've talked a lot
about Bayesian mechanics.

417
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:36,808
We've talked a lot about Axiom
entropy, Bayesian mechanics.

418
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,979
But there is in some sense,
much more natural formulation

419
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,849
of Bayesian mechanics
in terms of dynamics,

420
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:47,552
because ultimately that's what
we're thinking about is dynamical systems

421
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:52,190
and the way that they evolve in time
where they flow over their state space.

422
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:56,161
And there's there's a sense in which
not only is

423
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:00,165
it much more natural mathematically,
it just works easier.

424
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,933
It looks prettier.

425
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,035
It's it's it's much nicer.

426
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,071
There's also a sense in which it's it's
meaningless

427
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:10,308
to talk about states of a process
which is constantly in flux.

428
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,247
So limiting
ourselves to densities of states

429
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,416
as exists in the last

430
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,921
couple of years of the literature,

431
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,090
which has in fact
not always been the case.

432
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,326
Some of the early stuff is written
in terms of generalized

433
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,696
coordinates of motion,
which are nothing but a particular way

434
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:36,434
of talking about dynamics
and therefore paths.

435
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:42,641
So there's a sense
in which the recent detour into states

436
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,411
is very limiting, not only mathematically
but conceptually limiting.

437
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,248
And we can see that directly
in the way that it is

438
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,152
handling things like non
microbial processes

439
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:59,157
or processes that change with statistics
that are out of equilibrium.

440
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,961
So, so that the at the very end we say,
you know, we've done all this work

441
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:08,266
that the best next step
is to take all of this

442
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,570
and, and all of the stuff
that we've just done about maximum

443
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,806
entropy based mechanics
and put it in dynamical terms.

444
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,743
And this necessitates
passing to what we call Maxim caliber,

445
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,080
which is also due to James originally.

446
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,149
It's the principle of path entropy,

447
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,453
but eventually, you know,

448
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,489
the goal is
we be able to write all of this stuff

449
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,659
and in particular
we'll be able to generalize

450
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:38,330
what we have written into a language
that's much more dynamical.

451
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,866
And and Max Carroll, we already know,

452
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,270
has demonstrated

453
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,774
an immense success
in treating non-equilibrium processes.

454
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,912
So mathematically, I mean, there's reason
to be very optimistic about what

455
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,315
we will gain when we generalize
that duality that we've talked

456
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,650
about previously.

457
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,886
And so it really does seem like it's it's
the ideal thing to do

458
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,457
in the very near future.

459
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,391
Awesome.

460
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,927
Let's jump into the sections.

461
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:14,733
So section one is the introduction
and just one part

462
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:18,970
that I wanted to highlight
that the footnotes are so informative.

463
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,273
There's some of these motifs
like we set out to make it as simple as

464
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:26,111
possible in four pages was our limit,
but then we ended up innovating this way.

465
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,712
So that's one funny motif.

466
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,348
And then the other funny motif
that I see is

467
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,351
the super informative footnote.

468
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:38,123
Often because maybe it's possible
to just make the claim

469
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:42,027
standalone
and in direct response to somewhere else.

470
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,962
So that's very exciting and interesting.

471
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:49,467
Like footnote one covers
a lot of the prerequisite fields

472
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:55,173
like dynamical systems theory, calculus,
probability and information theory.

473
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:59,344
So I found that to be very interesting
because it helps us understand

474
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,645
where we can come from

475
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,748
and what kinds of backgrounds
we'd want to be learning about.

476
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:07,318
And then also a very important
distinction

477
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,723
of the two meanings of the word belief
in the probabilistic sense

478
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,826
of Bayesian statistics
or the propositional or folk

479
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:18,930
understanding as you write
from philosophy and cognitive science.

480
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:24,069
So I just thought those were
two interesting footnotes and reflected

481
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:28,006
like part of the process
and the discourse around the primary text

482
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:33,378
and how that can be clarified
in this format.

483
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,315
Feel free to make any overall comments
on that or that's

484
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:41,619
just getting to page three.

485
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:46,591
Well, about the prerequisites,
it's a it's a difficult

486
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,829
it's a difficult balance to achieve
in some sense.

487
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,532
Right, because we don't want
to be academic gatekeepers.

488
00:28:54,566 --> 00:29:00,572
No one benefits from gatekeeping, but
these are also highly technical fields.

489
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,142
So, you know,
I've been joking for the last few months.

490
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,011
If you've never taken a derivative,
you're going to have a bad time

491
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,613
in this literature.

492
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:12,784
It's just not the kind of thing
that lends itself to,

493
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,588
you know, surface engagement
in some sense.

494
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,923
Like, it's very and especially with these

495
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,527
these new developments.

496
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:27,799
I mean, there's Dalton's work
that basically shows that the free energy

497
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:31,736
principle is dual to maximum entropy,
maximum and calibrated.

498
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,707
So there's this kind of deep connection
to, I mean, effectively

499
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:40,311
the core of contemporary physics.

500
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,814
And there's these
there are these new results

501
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,418
that show that the free energy
principle is asymptotically equivalent

502
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:50,255
to the principle of unitary
from quantum mechanics.

503
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:52,490
You know, the, there's,

504
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,728
there are these new quantum
formulations of FP that have popped up.

505
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,198
So yeah, I mean,

506
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,735
navigating the space
comfortably presupposes a lot.

507
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,539
And the good news
is that it's hard for everyone.

508
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:12,811
So there's, there's
something to learn for everyone.

509
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,681
You know,
I'd spent the last three years of my life

510
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:20,318
teaching myself like category theory
and gauge theory and stuff,

511
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,721
which turned out to be very useful,
you know, connecting up with Delta and

512
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:25,690
doing all of this work.

513
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,661
But now we're launching ourselves
into quantum theory, which I'm less

514
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,295
familiar with.

515
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,431
So there's something
to find difficult for everyone.

516
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,601
But yeah, it

517
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,704
I really do think that
to fully appreciate

518
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,941
going on here,

519
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,678
some technical prerequisites
are important.

520
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:51,149
Otherwise we're led
to making false assertions.

521
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:55,720
Like I seem to circulate a lot
that dynamical systems approaches

522
00:30:56,287 --> 00:31:00,058
are contradictory
to information theoretic approaches,

523
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,160
which is just nonsense
from a formal point of view.

524
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,330
Information metrics

525
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,266
naturally reemerge
when you're considering, for example,

526
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,837
how do you measure
distance and state space effectively?

527
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,606
It's just yeah.

528
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:19,644
So the, the more mathematical background
one comes with,

529
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,413
I think the easier it is to integrate

530
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,782
into this.

531
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,351
Yeah.

532
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,387
Yes, well, indeed, there's

533
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,391
a lot of encouraging and good news
and hopefully a community

534
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,762
that also values
participation and accessibility as well.

535
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:41,099
So agreed, important general points
there.

536
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,634
Yeah.

537
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,036
Before we move on, I'll say something
really quickly about this.

538
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,642
Just because it's it's a remark
that's actually pretty important to me.

539
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,744
And in fact, Max
was the one who wrote it, but

540
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,046
I didn't even realize.

541
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:59,417
But it is an important clarification
that when we talk about beliefs

542
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,121
and inference,
it's it's much more general than just

543
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,825
an agent or a cognitive object.

544
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,931
The manner in which
we talk about inference and we talk about

545
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,668
carrying beliefs
is this this much more general sense

546
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:22,740
of just two random dynamical systems
that are coupled

547
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,445
and and therefore reflect
the statistics of each other.

548
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,850
So it could be a set
I mean, generically, this is a system

549
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,421
estimating the statistics
of an embedding environment.

550
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:42,160
The very important point is any system
with any noise

551
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:46,264
and in fact, systems
with no noise have statistics.

552
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:51,035
And so any system that estimates
or couples to another system

553
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,673
with statistics can be interpreted
as mathematical inference

554
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:59,310
that one system performs
inference about the other.

555
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,281
The the sort of content that you place on
that idea of inference

556
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:04,983
is very case dependent.

557
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,952
So it's not the case that that so it's
for instance, a cognitive

558
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,789
but it is very much the case that stones
reflect the statistics

559
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,426
of their environment simply
because these two systems are coupled

560
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,495
and their statistics reflect each other.

561
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,098
And so this is what we need
in the sense of talking about agents

562
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:25,203
that carry beliefs
simply is about objects that do this

563
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,906
kind of statistical estimation,
which we think of as inference.

564
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,809
But it's certainly much more general
than simply

565
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,945
something like a reinforcement learning

566
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,782
agent that actually stores
representation of its environment.

567
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,486
It is a representation, but in a much
more trivial sense, in a general case.

568
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,322
Mean I would

569
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:48,393
I would add to that by pointing out
that, you know, Galton was saying that

570
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,830
there were there were disadvantages
to focusing on the density

571
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,834
dynamic formulation which features
Markov blankets and the like.

572
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,204
So markup like are great
and we like them.

573
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:04,675
But I think focusing on them
so much in the literature

574
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,712
over the last several years has obscured
the fact that

575
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:13,418
the free energy principle is at core
a statement about how, you know,

576
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,255
as Dalton was saying earlier, random
dynamical systems coupled to each other.

577
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,592
So, you know, the Merkle
blanket is not something I often hear

578
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,796
and read in the literature,
the markup when it gets to clouds

579
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,031
the organism from its environment.

580
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,467
But it's not
that's not that's not the idea at all.

581
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,104
The Merkle blanket is the set of states

582
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:37,208
via which the organism
and its environment are coupled.

583
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:42,146
And in fact, we,
you know, we made this case in a paper

584
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,183
on a variational approach
to this construction several years ago.

585
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,519
You can basically swap the sensory

586
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,621
and active states

587
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:55,426
of your organism and you get sensory
and active states of an environment.

588
00:34:55,426 --> 00:35:00,098
It is fundamentally a story
about how systems couple

589
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,733
and synchronize each other.

590
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,670
It's not a story about how,

591
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,574
you know, things that exist
are somehow secluded from an environment.

592
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:14,145
It's really a story about how,
yeah, we, we, we,

593
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:19,617
we become a model of our environment,
meaning that we are in tune

594
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,354
with, engaged with and reflecting
the structure of that environment.

595
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,922
This becomes very clear, by the way,

596
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,226
when you look at the quantum formulations
of the free energy principle.

597
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,663
If you take the asymptotic
limit of the free energy principle

598
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,700
so its behavior as time
tends towards infinity

599
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,438
for classical systems
that have space time individuation,

600
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,508
what get is something like
the good regulator theorem.

601
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:48,913
So I become as much as possible as I can,

602
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:54,418
like my environment, you know, modulo
the space time separation.

603
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,889
I can't be my environment because
I'm here, it's there in some sense.

604
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,359
And then what you get in that context
is the statistical mirroring.

605
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,629
But in in the quantum context,
when there is no space

606
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,132
like separation
between systems, the step tends

607
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,736
towards entanglement.

608
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:15,473
So systems
that are related in an FP theoretic way

609
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,176
at the quantum level become entangled.

610
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:22,146
That is precisely what the FDP does,
conforming to the fact

611
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,649
that systems become maximally entangled.

612
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,386
So it really is not a statement about,

613
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,089
you know, how organisms separate
from their environment.

614
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:36,427
It's a statement
about how organisms are things

615
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:40,464
in general self-organizing
systems, individual and couple

616
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,467
simultaneously to their environments,

617
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,837
how that's not a contradiction.

618
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:47,872
Excellent.

619
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:52,443
So as we rush through Section
one and head to Section two,

620
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:56,914
I just wanted to pull out two really
key quotes you wrote in this paper.

621
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:01,485
We discussed the relationship between
dynamics, mechanics and principles.

622
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,089
And then later on page five,

623
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:08,659
you write, Bayesian mechanics
is specialized for particular systems

624
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,762
that have a partition of states
and go on to describe it more.

625
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,799
So as we head towards Section two,

626
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:19,604
an overview of the idea of mechanics
and indeed Bayesian mechanics.

627
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,940
Could you unpack a little bit
by what you mean

628
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,676
dynamics, mechanics and principles.

629
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,278
Sure.

630
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,348
So no. Andrews as everyone,

631
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,451
I think in the literature knows now
wrote this great paper.

632
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,554
The math is not the territory

633
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:40,825
which challenged us to be very clear
about what we meant, really,

634
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,362
when we're talking about free energy
principle and active inference.

635
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:44,996
And then there

636
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:46,530
I think

637
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,134
Mel makes a number of contributions,
but one of their most important

638
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,671
contributions is to differentiate between

639
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,307
the 50 as an uninterrupted

640
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,810
formal structure and the P

641
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:04,982
as it might figure in applications
to model specific kinds of systems.

642
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,152
And now points out that the

643
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:12,156
a lot of the confusion
in the philosophical literature has to do

644
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:15,393
with the fact that the primary literature

645
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,596
often doesn't differentiate between

646
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,499
the just
a mathematical structure of the theory,

647
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:26,070
and then these models interpreted
as representing certain features of

648
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,807
the target system
that we want to make sense of.

649
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:33,711
And that's important
because falsification

650
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,082
or verification, empirical validation
more generally

651
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,552
applies to one kind of thing,
but not the other, right?

652
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:45,456
So the three energy principle, insofar

653
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,760
as it is a mathematical theory
like a formal statement,

654
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:54,965
is no more falsifiable or subject
to empirical verification than calculus

655
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:59,470
would be like you wouldn't you wouldn't
try to falsify the axioms of calculus.

656
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,673
They do or do not apply in formidably
to certain kinds of systems.

657
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,744
So there's a level at which
the core formal results of the figure

658
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,648
have that status,
their mathematical results.

659
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,885
And we can use this to

660
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,589
do some interesting empirical stuff.

661
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,593
So what we wanted to do
is to differentiate

662
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,730
between three kinds of formal things.

663
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,500
In the first class of tools that

664
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,870
no was outlining.

665
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,773
Namely, we distinguish between dynamics,

666
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,943
mechanics and principles.

667
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,112
So the dynamics are descriptive.

668
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:45,149
They are basically a formal description
of some systems behavior.

669
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,152
You might say that like Galilean,

670
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:54,859
mechanics is almost entirely dynamics.

671
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,763
You needed someone like Newton
to come around and say, Well,

672
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,633
there are general equations of motion

673
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,102
that one can write down to account for

674
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,373
sort of how these

675
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,509
how this description

676
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,911
plays out in some sense.

677
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,948
So we move from dynamics to mechanics

678
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,685
in the same way that we move
from description to explanation,

679
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:26,390
from a target phenomenon
that is formalized in a certain way

680
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,726
that we would like to have an explanation

681
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,730
for, to a set of equations of motion
that really account for

682
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,267
how those dynamics come to be.

683
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,003
And then principles in mechanics

684
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,973
tell you how principles tell you why.

685
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:48,245
So usually in physics
we appeal to some symmetry

686
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:53,117
or conservation principle
in order to derive the mechanics

687
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,821
or the mechanical theory
for the systems in question.

688
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,824
So what we're left with is principles,

689
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:03,661
mechanics and dynamics,
all of which are formal theories.

690
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:08,132
And once you have the mechanics,
you can apply it to study

691
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,234
specific kinds of systems empirically.

692
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,038
And that's where
the empirical verification would come in.

693
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,508
So principles are not falsifiable,
they're just bits of math,

694
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:22,146
and you use them to write down
mechanical theories, which,

695
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,916
when interpreted in the right context
and when the variables are mapped on to

696
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,052
things
that are of interest target systems,

697
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:32,189
then they become subject
to empirical evaluation.

698
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:36,594
So hopefully that, you know, clarifies

699
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:40,931
a lot of the model
around it, around the FFP.

700
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:45,002
One of the reasons why we spent so long
outlining the idea of mechanics

701
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:49,006
and physics is that this isn't
some exotic way of thinking about things.

702
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:54,178
This is really just physics,
just straight vanilla

703
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,082
reasoning from physics.

704
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,216
Yeah, I'll stop there.

705
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,552
Nelson has probably some
interesting things that I

706
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,222
not know.

707
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,392
I think. Think you've covered it?

708
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:08,859
Yeah.

709
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,530
It's it's just that there are important
formal differences in physics

710
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,567
between what we would call
the mechanical theory for some object

711
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,671
and a dynamical description
of some object.

712
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,975
And so in this tower of things,

713
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,445
you get ideas,

714
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:31,248
you get theories that sit
at different layers in the tower.

715
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:35,386
This hierarchy ends up being useful
in clarifying

716
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,622
this host of different results

717
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,325
in the app
and where one fits into the other.

718
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:42,693
So it was important.

719
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,362
Take the time to discuss it, but

720
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,933
that was that and that's the whole point
of Section two.

721
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,001
Awesome.

722
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,671
So to also move quickly through

723
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:58,242
Section two on page nine, you're right,
we are concerned here

724
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,778
with what
we have called Bayesian mechanics.

725
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,682
And then you launch into an example

726
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:09,920
of mechanical theory, operationalizing
a mathematical principle, and you provide

727
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,092
some classical statistical
formulations on page ten.

728
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,896
So could you give us an overview of what

729
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,865
the equations on page ten are showing

730
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,802
like, what they do for classical physics,

731
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,805
and what is the analogy
or what is the connection

732
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,307
that this is preparing us
to make with Bayesian mechanics?

733
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:34,645
Yes. Well,
in fact, I have an entire paper

734
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,984
that's about to come out about this,
just like building on the analogy.

735
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,188
So I'll leave that as an Easter egg
for the audience.

736
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,691
Watch out for a classical physics
for the Bayesian mechanic paper.

737
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:50,060
It's, I think, instant classic.

738
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,195
It might be some interest.

739
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:55,199
Yes, might be of some interest,
but yes, on page ten,

740
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,371
we are just giving an example of the
of this kind of formal difference.

741
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:05,542
So you have some kind of principles
in classical physics.

742
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,678
It is the principle that systems

743
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,914
are kind of lazy, you know,

744
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,951
they there is some kind of

745
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,520
an amount of energy
that it takes to get from A

746
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,323
to B, and systems
don't waste that energy.

747
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,593
So they take precisely the shortest path

748
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,462
from A to B or the path of least energy

749
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,134
in in the more technical sense
of the transfer

750
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,803
of potential energy into kinetic energy.

751
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:36,740
So if you have some amount
of stored energy, the transfer of that

752
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,578
into energy of motion
is minimized along the path.

753
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:42,680
That's a very

754
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,150
abstract statement, and there's not a lot

755
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,452
that you can actually do
with that computationally.

756
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:53,157
All you can say is, you know,
systems systems try and get from A to B

757
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,194
using the shortest amount of motion
possible, no extra motion.

758
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,996
So so if you see in FIG.

759
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:03,300
one, for instance,
there are these parts that fly off into

760
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,471
sort of these very strange fluctuations
in the classical world.

761
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:10,708
Those fluctuations don't exist
because classical systems

762
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,445
take this energy
minimizing parabolic path.

763
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,447
And in the dark blue,

764
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,716
what is computational about that?

765
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:22,119
Is that principle of stationary action.

766
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,421
So the principle that you don't waste
energy

767
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:29,193
results in a mechanical theory,

768
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:33,330
a law of motion
for the mechanics of classical objects.

769
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,699
This is what we would call Newton's law.

770
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,301
Newton's second law in particular.

771
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:40,270
It's this Everyone knows F equals
M, it hits

772
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,073
force equals mass times acceleration.

773
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,743
So the idea is that

774
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,846
if you are such a system, if

775
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,082
you minimize the amount of energy
that you take,

776
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,986
then the acceleration of you

777
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,523
must obey precisely
the force being applied to you.

778
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,894
And and so this is your
your law of motion.

779
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,395
This is a mechanical theory.

780
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,464
The dynamics that come out of that

781
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:12,736
are able to be discussed
when you start putting in actual details,

782
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,205
when you plug in whatever force
being applied.

783
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,641
Sorry, that's a dog.

784
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,443
You probably heard it.

785
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,812
What is what is the force
being applied to the system?

786
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,947
What are the initial conditions
for the system?

787
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,349
What is the mass for the system?

788
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,152
All of this extra data
that's giving you trajectories.

789
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:33,524
So an actual model of the system which is
less explanatory and more descriptive.

790
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,793
And this is at the very bottom
of the hierarchy

791
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,896
where you get this dynamical theory
that's got all this extra data in it.

792
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,765
So this is this is very quickly

793
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:45,569
an account of the that hierarchy.

794
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,338
Awesome.

795
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,542
Let's move into section
three and figure two.

796
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:56,180
So the caption is three
phases of Bayesian mechanics.

797
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,850
What are the three of Bayesian mechanics

798
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,853
and what is this figures showing?

799
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:03,420
Well,

800
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,691
it's it's often been suggested

801
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,628
that there are like 17,000 versions
of the free energy principle

802
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,133
and that it's not very clear
what the current version

803
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,434
is and all that stuff.

804
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,336
And some of this is fair

805
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,271
and some of it is
I think some of it is fair

806
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,575
because it is true
that often in the technical papers,

807
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,811
not sufficient care has been given to

808
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,282
making very explicit which assumptions

809
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,385
we're making about the systems
that we're interested in modeling.

810
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:40,958
So what we tried to do in Section
three is to provide

811
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,862
a comprehensive survey of all of the ways
that the free energy

812
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:48,131
principle
has been articulated in the literature.

813
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:52,202
And so it
turns out that there are basically three

814
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:57,307
main ways in which the FFP is applied,
which were representing here.

815
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:01,111
So we've already alluded
to the first distinction.

816
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:07,050
The FFP can either be formulated
in terms of a probability density

817
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:12,189
overstates directly or as a probability

818
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:16,827
density over paths,
so over trajectories of states

819
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:19,897
that we write in
so called generalized coordinates.

820
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,433
And those are importantly different.

821
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,970
So the literature over the last I guess

822
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:31,742
like circa 29, 2012 to 2019 focused

823
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,681
almost exclusively on the density over
states formulation.

824
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,183
And this is where you get

825
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:42,953
the approximate Bayesian inference lemma

826
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:47,090
that's played a pretty critical role
in a lot of these investigations.

827
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,293
This is also where you get

828
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,862
like states that play the role of Markov

829
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:57,134
blankets effectively,
whereas the original

830
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:01,271
formulation of the FFP was in terms
of probability density over power.

831
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:05,309
So you're not, you're
not really so much interested in, in

832
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,246
the dynamics of

833
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,447
the system, just in terms

834
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:14,217
of how probable that states are,
what you're actually interested in is,

835
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:18,055
you know, entire trajectories
that unfold over time.

836
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:24,294
And the the most general paths
formulation doesn't make

837
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:29,833
a lot of the assumptions that have been
criticized over the last little bit.

838
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:32,636
So importantly,

839
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,205
we don't assume the the systems

840
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,341
being described are stationary.

841
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,912
We don't assume that,
you know, and accordingly,

842
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,682
we don't assume that the system has
a non equilibrium, a steady state.

843
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,286
And we're
now returning to this formulation

844
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:53,223
because it's less restrictive,
you know, for reasons that

845
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,193
we should probably detail

846
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,894
better than I can.

847
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,063
So then

848
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,300
within the density overstates formulation

849
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:06,370
and what you get is this kind of mode

850
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:10,107
tracking or mode matching behavior where

851
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:15,379
I mean, essentially
what we're saying is that a system

852
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:19,850
that conforms to the free energy
principle is such that it looks

853
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,520
as if the average internal state

854
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,723
is tracking the average external state or

855
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,992
matching it.

856
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:31,728
And the relevant difference

857
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,831
in that density overstates

858
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:39,603
formulation is that the external mode
that the system is tracking

859
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:43,774
can have dynamics to it or can also not.

860
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,876
And it was important to distinguish

861
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,379
these cases
because a lot of the formal analysis,

862
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,083
so for example are calling in Sussex
released this great paper.

863
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,986
How particular are the physics
of the free energy principle?

864
00:50:56,586 --> 00:51:01,558
And they come to the conclusion
that there's the act doesn't really have

865
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,995
anything to say about the class of system
that they examined.

866
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,731
What is the class of systems
that they examined?

867
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,001
They are looking at linear systems

868
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:15,172
that undergo dissipation effectively.

869
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:20,577
So physically
these are damping springs, right?

870
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,614
So to restate,
if you take away the mathematical

871
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,918
baggage, what they're saying is the Fed
doesn't have anything

872
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,022
particularly interesting to say
about the behavior of Dandan Springs.

873
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,624
So what does a damp spring do?

874
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,894
Well, it starts off
and then it dissipates

875
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:41,064
back to a fixed point being

876
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,935
just through the friction.

877
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:50,774
So the mode towards which the system is
flowing has no dynamics to it.

878
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,975
It is a fixed point.

879
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,944
It just dissipates back to a fixed point.

880
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,481
And what they're showing is
that there is nothing interesting to say

881
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:00,984
from an FP
theoretic perspective about the system.

882
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:06,289
But I mean, the counterpoint
that's sort of there isn't interesting.

883
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:10,427
Anything interesting theoretically
to say about the systems,

884
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:14,131
there isn't any interesting
external dynamics

885
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,300
that the internal dynamics
would be matching.

886
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:23,140
And a lot of these null results,
we use FP technology

887
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,676
to say stuff about a system
and there's nothing interesting to say.

888
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:31,081
Look at systems that have fixed
modes, fixed external nodes.

889
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:34,084
And so, you know, the the idea

890
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,586
is that the ATP applies virtuously

891
00:52:37,387 --> 00:52:40,657
to those systems because there's
nothing interesting to say.

892
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,760
So yeah,

893
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,432
to, to summarize my, my rant, we,
we tried

894
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:53,403
to summarize the main applications
of the FTT in the literature.

895
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:56,706
We identified three and strategically

896
00:52:57,474 --> 00:53:00,677
we point out where some commentators

897
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,679
may have been led astray

898
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,882
by focusing on one rather than the other.

899
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,685
So in particular, a lot of this,

900
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,088
these ideas that the FTT
can handle things like, you know, systems

901
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:15,759
with moving attractors and systems

902
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:20,764
that don't have like a single mode,
that these are understandable

903
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:26,069
characterizations given that basically
since 2000, from 2018 to to the 2012

904
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:31,274
to 2019, we mostly focused on this middle
class of systems.

905
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:34,377
So systems that we're describing in terms

906
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,581
of the density of states
that have a dynamic mode.

907
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:42,118
So it's understandable why people would
focus their attention on that.

908
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,322
But the FFP in its most general

909
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,958
form doesn't make, you know, perhaps

910
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:51,394
problematic assumptions like seasonality.

911
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:55,899
And it yeah, it also applies,
interestingly,

912
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:59,336
to systems that have interesting
external state dynamics.

913
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:01,771
So strategically, I

914
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,140
think that's what we were going for
in this section.

915
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:10,380
And then I believe this is the only place
in the entire literature where

916
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,383
this is reviewed so comprehensively

917
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,752
in terms of this tripartite distinction.

918
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:19,089
So, you know,
I don't mean to be disingenuous

919
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,560
and to suggest that the confusions
that have arisen are only due to,

920
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,864
you know,
just the lack of paying attention.

921
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,100
These things have not been expressed
very clearly.

922
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,003
The assumptions have not always
been stated very clearly.

923
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,639
And yeah,

924
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,442
the the form of the path of least action

925
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,945
in each of these things
looks very different.

926
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,115
So we can also understand
why it might seem like

927
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,550
there are 17 versions
of the three energy principle,

928
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:51,254
but there are.

929
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:52,689
Thank you, Maxwell.

930
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:56,493
As we speed through this section,
I'll just note that formalism

931
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,663
one on page 15 is familiar

932
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,199
and has to do with the flow of states
in the particular partition.

933
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,905
And we've also seen the Helmholtz
decomposition shown in Figure three.

934
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,574
In terms of a decomposition add on

935
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:16,279
into the vertical and the horizontal
that the gradient pursuing

936
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,982
and the solenoid or ice contour
or aspect of flow,

937
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:22,152
those are reviewed in the citations
that are provided here.

938
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,888
So let's get into the newer stuff.

939
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,560
In Section four, you're discussing
some mathematical, mathematical

940
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:34,431
preliminaries on the maximum entropy
principle gauge theory initialization.

941
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,766
But first, yes, last.

942
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:39,369
For moving up

943
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:44,074
the stage of work is a section
three was incredibly.

944
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,909
Illuminating for me personally.

945
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,310
I think the literature in general.

946
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,047
Having the separation out and
there was a question that arose for me

947
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:54,517
and working through this
that I just want to throw out there.

948
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:58,321
I don't want to distract the journey
through the paper too much.

949
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,591
But in moving to this,

950
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,928
you talk about on page 19,

951
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,865
when the FFP is applied to density over
states as opposed to,

952
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,602
we assume a non-equilibrium
steady state density.

953
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:17,207
And then on the next page, page 20,
you see we can view this

954
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,777
mass non-equilibrium city state density
as providing a set of prior

955
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:23,613
preferential preferences
which lead the particular system

956
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,783
to look like it attempts to enact

957
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,285
and bring about these preferences
through action.

958
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,188
If you then move

959
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:36,893
to the path based formulation
where there is known as assumption,

960
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,131
how do you recover these preferences

961
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,800
in in that formulation?

962
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:47,370
Or can you not use that formulation
to describe systems

963
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,373
that are doing actions
that look like better preferences?

964
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,509
Or is there a piece that I'm missing?

965
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:56,312
Does it make sense?

966
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,381
I can take that one.

967
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:01,217
So one of the one of the key

968
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:06,322
deliverables of this third section
is this three faces type thing, right?

969
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:10,093
So the idea of the free energy
principle and,

970
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:14,931
and the mechanical theory
that arises from is we would want a

971
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:20,103
mechanical theory,
a law of motion for Bayesian inference

972
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,672
or for systems that do Bayesian inference

973
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,542
and what it ends up
being is approximate Bayesian inference.

974
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:29,813
And this comes in three flavors load
matching mode tracking or path track.

975
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,981
This is the three phase system.

976
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:35,919
So that I mean, just like you have
different flavors of classical mechanics,

977
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,955
you have things that move continuously,
like satellites in orbit,

978
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:42,392
or you have things that move
and then start moving

979
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,995
like a ball thrown through the air,
eventually returns to the ground

980
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:50,233
and things that sit on the ground
don't move unless they're acted upon.

981
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:54,237
So there are very different flavors
of approximate phase influence and these

982
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:57,607
three are particular the kinds of things
that we're thinking about.

983
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:02,011
So the reason why I give that context
is because we can still

984
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:05,381
imagine preferences
on the paths of a system.

985
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:09,519
A system must evolve
in such a way that it avoids

986
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,323
certain areas of the state space,
given that it remains a system.

987
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:14,824
So, you know,

988
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,495
a human can

989
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:23,566
evolve in such a way that it dips too
far away from its other static bounds.

990
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,468
That's a set points and set

991
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:29,138
and bounced around those set points
in which I can oscillate

992
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:33,209
but too far outside of those bounds
and I'm in trouble.

993
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,179
Likewise, you know,

994
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,248
I can have something like a stone

995
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:42,185
that kind of evolves
through a state space.

996
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:47,190
The stone doesn't have preferences
per se, but it has a definition.

997
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,560
And so we can read not

998
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,563
preferences, but definition is about
what a stone looks like

999
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:56,766
in the same sense
as we understand what a human looks like

1000
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,702
as certain preferences
that guarantee cohesion.

1001
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,438
So the things that are definitional
of a stone

1002
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,809
guarantee
that same kind of cohesion that just

1003
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,513
there's
a type error if you would identify them,

1004
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:13,950
but that, you know, mathematically they
they end up looking very similar.

1005
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:19,088
And what's interesting about that is now
you can talk about preferences

1006
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,725
or you can talk about definitions
along the path of evolution of a system.

1007
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:25,828
Stone must stay roughly together.

1008
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:28,231
It must stay
in this sort of crystalline structure.

1009
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:33,002
If you start hammering away at it,
you turn it into a power.

1010
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,505
This is something that we wouldn't
think of as stone.

1011
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:38,041
So so in the same sense, if a human

1012
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,145
doesn't eat for too long

1013
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,915
and maybe starve to death,
it's it's a really grim example,

1014
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,519
but unfortunately, it's
one of the better ones you can imagine.

1015
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,888
You know, you're
you're drifting too far away from this

1016
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:55,391
state of being satiated

1017
00:59:55,391 --> 01:00:00,330
or having sufficient energy
to maintain cellular

1018
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:04,367
processes and the chemical reactions
that sustain life.

1019
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:08,171
And as a result,
you know, the preference along

1020
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,673
your set of paths has been violated.

1021
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:15,778
So I think, yes, there is a sense in
which even though we have foregone a mass

1022
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:20,383
density per se,
we still have a density of a over paths.

1023
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,885
Not all the states that this density
still expresses

1024
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:27,290
something of a definition for the system
or a set of preferences for the system

1025
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,693
without which we don't have
a conceptualization of that system.

1026
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,696
That's
that's a very long answer to a question.

1027
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,898
But maybe it satisfies, you.

1028
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:37,533
Know, that's that's great.

1029
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:38,201
Thank you so much.

1030
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:41,437
That was really useful. That makes sense.

1031
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:41,938
Thank you.

1032
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:45,842
You can kind of think about it
as these constraints force systems

1033
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:50,380
to basically pick trajectories
that are at the trial of, you know,

1034
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,851
a preference landscape or a constraint
landscape if you want to think about it.

1035
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,553
So you get the same kind of thing
as Dalton was saying.

1036
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:01,424
But it's not the systems aren't
assumed to be stationary, so they're not,

1037
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:07,597
you know, non-equilibrium
steady state distributions per se.

1038
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,900
But there is something analogous

1039
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,438
and a lot of the future work in theory
is precisely about

1040
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:19,075
using the technology of maximum caliber
to really make sense

1041
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:23,046
of this formerly.

1042
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,781
So let's move.

1043
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,916
Into section four.

1044
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:30,820
So in Section four, as noted
and as referenced

1045
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:35,124
to the previous publication,
even there's a discussion that the FP is

1046
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:38,327
dual to the constrained
maximum entropy principle.

1047
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,864
And then one of the ways
that that's pursued in this section

1048
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,735
is through the lens,
or at least related to gauge theory.

1049
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,504
So we're looking at figure four.

1050
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,606
What is gauge theory?

1051
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:51,874
What is category theory?

1052
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:57,680
Dual and how is it being deployed
in this situation?

1053
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,250
So I guess I'll take that one as well.

1054
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,220
Figure four You said yes.

1055
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:05,822
Okay.

1056
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,890
I'll illustration of fiber bundles.

1057
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:10,126
Section two, big mego figures.

1058
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:11,761
Oh, yeah.

1059
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,096
Okay. Yeah.

1060
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,230
Well, mega figure.

1061
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,965
I recognize that name.

1062
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:18,468
I believe that's how we referred to it
internally.

1063
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:19,635
Yeah.

1064
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:22,772
Well so

1065
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:25,108
if you ask me

1066
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:28,511
because I am a mathematician primarily

1067
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,915
if you were to ask me
or if you were to ask the mathematician,

1068
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:37,920
what is the gauge theory, you would
probably get a response roughly.

1069
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,823
Like what gauge theory is the study of

1070
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:45,595
a particular geometric
space called a fiber bundle.

1071
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:49,398
So there is there is a type of space
called the fiber bundle in geometry.

1072
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,502
It looks exactly like that figure.

1073
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:55,104
It's a bunch of fibers pasted on to

1074
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:59,275
something on the bottom,
what we call it, based on a boat

1075
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:02,845
and and studying how these things

1076
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:06,415
behave in a space like this.

1077
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:10,386
How do they behave in the sort of fibers
and how does that reflect

1078
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,688
some kind of behavior
on the basement? Folks,

1079
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:14,791
these are interesting

1080
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:18,427
geometric questions
that arise in the study of fiber

1081
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:21,230
bundles and hence
and what is called gauge theory.

1082
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:25,067
If you're a physicist,
I mean, it turns out that a fiber bundles

1083
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,170
are the natural space.

1084
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,807
We're talking
about classical gauge theory.

1085
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:35,812
So the theory of certain high energy
particles.

1086
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,215
But it's but it's a little bit
more general than that.

1087
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,284
And so if you're a physicist,
this is what you think of.

1088
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,485
You think about

1089
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,622
like gauge photons, but this is only

1090
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:49,826
because fiber bundles are very natural
way of talking about these slits.

1091
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,629
And so it is a little bit more general
what we're talking about in the figure

1092
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:56,732
four is this idea that

1093
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,635
in this space of fibers,

1094
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:05,842
you can kind of trace out surfaces
and that these surfaces are like

1095
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,911
probability densities
over the baseline of thought.

1096
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,248
And in fact, they are just like
probability densities, they are.

1097
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:15,585
So you can formulate probabilities
over a state space

1098
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,321
as an object in a fiber bundle.

1099
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:19,622
And therefore,

1100
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:20,990
if you

1101
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:25,461
have all the technology available to you,
you can draw this very nice case

1102
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:29,398
theoretic interpretation
of what it means to be

1103
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,236
a probability density and therefore,

1104
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:37,073
because the object of Bayesian
mechanics is systems that do inference

1105
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:39,742
and so systems
that estimate probability densities,

1106
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,812
there is a nice stage
theoretic interpretation

1107
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:47,116
to Bayesian mechanics
that hinges pretty much on this picture.

1108
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:52,021
What we would call the gauge
in this situation

1109
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,591
is choice of this J function.

1110
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,960
So you see you have several
different surfaces,

1111
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:02,999
three of them, each of which comes
with a different choice of j.

1112
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:07,303
So the, the idea
of choosing a function in the fibers

1113
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,339
and therefore choosing

1114
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,775
a shape for your service,

1115
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,878
this is what we would think of
as a gauge theory.

1116
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,346
And that's why

1117
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:19,982
I went down this route

1118
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:23,252
in the geometry and analysis paper,
because it ends up

1119
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:27,757
drawing a very nice picture
of what it might mean to

1120
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:34,130
engage in constrained inference.

1121
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:34,997
Awesome.

1122
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:37,466
And could I give a pedestrian or

1123
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,337
so the the bystander the yeah.

1124
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:45,841
The, the more, the less technical
version of it is to gauge theories.

1125
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:49,679
And Dalton, correct me whenever
I say something that's wildly or even

1126
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,782
not so wildly inaccurate,
but gauge theories are basically

1127
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,484
how one would how one articulates

1128
01:05:56,085 --> 01:06:01,257
a symmetry is are conservation
laws and contemporary physics.

1129
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:04,493
So most physics relies on the idea that

1130
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:09,498
some transformations
that are of interest, like the ones

1131
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,268
described by Maxwell's equations,

1132
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,439
have some kind of symmetry
or that concerned.

1133
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:19,542
A slightly better way of going about
it would be to say that,

1134
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:22,845
you know, modern physics is broken up
roughly

1135
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:25,982
into stuff and forces

1136
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,185
and forces act on stuff

1137
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,288
and stuff gets acted on by forces.

1138
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,590
So the

1139
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:38,561
interesting thing in theory is
you can talk about

1140
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:42,531
how a definition of some stuff,
the shape of some stuff

1141
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:47,703
is intimately dependent on the forces
acting on the stuff.

1142
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,240
And so this is where we get this idea of

1143
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,177
we have a particular shape
to our surface.

1144
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,514
We have some,
you know, probabilities over our states,

1145
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,284
but that this is actually defined by the

1146
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:05,354
the the choice of gauge
this this j function.

1147
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:10,559
So our assignment of probability
to states is actually determined

1148
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:14,897
not by probability, but it's determined
by the constraints on those states.

1149
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,399
Certain states are preferable.

1150
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,502
Certain states
not on preferable states get low

1151
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:22,471
probability
preferable states get high probability.

1152
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:27,643
And our notion of ability
is encoded in the choice of j.

1153
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:31,147
It's a function
that constrains different states.

1154
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,516
And so constraints in
this case are like penalties.

1155
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:35,918
That's our assignment of penalties.

1156
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:40,022
So our choice of force is actually what
shapes our assignment of probability.

1157
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:41,557
That's ultimately,

1158
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,361
I think, well, that's
a slightly different way of viewing.

1159
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:50,433
The geometry of the situation is serious
all about these kinds

1160
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:53,169
of what we would call
covariance relationships,

1161
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:56,439
covariance meaning literally two things
burying together.

1162
01:07:56,705 --> 01:08:00,576
If I choose a force, I'm
forced to choose some stuff.

1163
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,879
And likewise, if I choose some stuff

1164
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:06,949
that necessitates
an underlying choice of force.

1165
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:10,319
So gauge covariance
ends up being very helpful

1166
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:14,824
in situations like this.

1167
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:15,724
Thanks.

1168
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,994
Let's see if we can touch
on some of these last figures.

1169
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:19,895
In FIG.

1170
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:25,501
five, we see a vector field on a curve
that's reminding us

1171
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:30,840
of that sort of baseball diamond shape
from earlier with a path of least action.

1172
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:32,808
And in Fig.

1173
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:38,280
six, a probability density is generated
by level sets of the constraint function.

1174
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:43,452
J So either figure five or figure six,
whichever you feel

1175
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:48,157
fits in best here, what is being shown
and where are you going with it?

1176
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,960
How is it connected
to alternative phrasings?

1177
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:53,562
Yeah, I guess I'll just cut to FIG.

1178
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:57,133
six, which is kind of
about this covariance thing.

1179
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:02,271
So if I choose
a particular functional form for J

1180
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:06,509
in this case it's a penalty
that is proportional to distance.

1181
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:10,079
I would expect my assignment
the probability

1182
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:13,649
to fall off roughly a distance function.

1183
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:14,550
So it should.

1184
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,017
It should.

1185
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:16,819
The probability of a state

1186
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,622
should decrease
as the penalty on the state increases.

1187
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,758
So in this case, the probability
of a state should decrease

1188
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:27,630
as I go away from some central point
and it should do so symmetrically.

1189
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:32,568
And so we would expect
a Gaussian density from this.

1190
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:38,908
And it is indeed the case
that you can understand the covariance

1191
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:42,444
as a kind of projecting down
and then lifting back up.

1192
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,481
And what do you get when you do that?

1193
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,751
Well, the stuff in the equation,
the probability

1194
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,620
ends up being defined by you.

1195
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:55,925
We take of the sort of rings
on the j function.

1196
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:59,628
You protect them down,
you get circles on the base manifolds

1197
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,731
when you lift them back up their rings.

1198
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:06,268
And so we know a symmetric
probability density

1199
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:10,039
with a whole bunch of rings
is just a Gaussian probability density.

1200
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:13,275
So, so this figure is kind of capturing

1201
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,979
what does this covariance relationship
actually look like?

1202
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:20,015
How do we actually build stuff
out of forces?

1203
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,284
And it ends up being the case that it's

1204
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:26,689
this very simple recipe of you
push everything down and then you lift

1205
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:30,259
it back up and the lift is E to the J,

1206
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:33,362
so the you place J on to X,

1207
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,564
that's the first step.

1208
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:39,201
Your second step is then you hit it
with this exponential function and e to

1209
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:43,505
the minus x squared is
of course a Gaussian density.

1210
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,141
So that's all that Figure
six is depicting.

1211
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:50,012
It's just zooming in
on one of the objects in FIG.

1212
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:53,315
four. Great.

1213
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:57,886
And I thought on page 34,
also the striking result

1214
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:58,821
that the splitting

1215
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:02,191
of the flow of the system
into vertical and horizontal components

1216
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:06,028
under the constrained maximum entropy
principle is ice and morphic

1217
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:08,063
to the Helmholtz decomposition

1218
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:11,700
of the flow of the autonomous partition
of a particular system.

1219
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:16,438
So for those who are caught up with
the way that the Helmholtz decomposition

1220
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:22,077
was used, for example, in the papers
that we discussed in Live Stream 32

1221
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:25,681
with Markov
blankets and K stochastic chaos,

1222
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:31,654
this is augmenting it or transposing
it into another formalization

1223
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,824
and moving on again quickly.

1224
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:41,697
It's worth pointing out that there is
there are some significant advantages

1225
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:46,802
to reformulating things
in terms of maximum entropy.

1226
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:51,173
I'll I'll I'll let you know Delta
and speak to the more technical

1227
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,943
parts of this but I guess one

1228
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,714
one thing that pops out to me
more politically is that

1229
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,685
maximum entropy
and constrained maximum entropy.

1230
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:07,556
I mean, they are just core parts
of the physicists toolbox.

1231
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:13,495
So the fact that we are able to reproduce
the Helmholtz

1232
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:17,266
decomposition
in terms of the way that flow splits up

1233
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:20,803
in the gauge theoretic formulation,
I think is quite significant.

1234
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:24,573
It gives us an entirely independent line

1235
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:26,809
of reasoning arising at the same results.

1236
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:32,081
So, you know, especially due to some

1237
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:37,353
some work by Martin Beil and colleagues
a few years ago we were not

1238
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:42,024
we were no longer sure
whether some of these results obtained.

1239
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:46,328
You know, there had been doubts thrown on
to the derivations

1240
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:50,799
of the approximate
Bayesian inference lemma in some papers.

1241
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:52,668
Life, as we know is

1242
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,404
from 2013, I believe, is the paper
that they targeted

1243
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:58,507
one way of reading this
is that independent

1244
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:02,611
of all these analyzes, independent of
whether Beil and colleagues are correct

1245
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:07,750
about their criticism of the 2013 paper,
this is an independent derivation

1246
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:12,121
that just follows
from uncontroversial mathematics.

1247
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:15,124
And we're able to re re derive

1248
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:17,493
basically the main core

1249
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:22,598
portions of the formal results
that Carl derived,

1250
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:26,568
the approximate Bayesian inference
lemma, the Helmholtz decomposition.

1251
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,705
And I mean, in some sense,

1252
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,808
the magic is that we understand

1253
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:36,044
now why these arise to begin with.

1254
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:40,449
There's yeah

1255
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,751
I think that the

1256
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,120
the maximum entropy interpretation

1257
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:48,690
in some sense, especially in the gage

1258
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:52,227
theoretic formulation
in some sense tells us,

1259
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,831
well, why, why does approximate

1260
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,700
Bayesian ex-friends work just full stop

1261
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:04,339
and these sets of results explain
effectively why this has to be the case.

1262
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,976
Only my facilitator hat

1263
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:12,181
prevents me from being excited.

1264
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:16,351
Section 5.4 also explored
more in the previous citation.

1265
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:20,255
So the four things that I wanted
to just touch on as briefly

1266
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:25,260
as people wanted as we close
are the three philosophical areas

1267
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:29,565
that are introduced in Section six
and then of course just the appetizer

1268
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:30,933
of G theory.

1269
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:36,538
So page 38, Section six,
The Philosophy of Bayesian Mechanics

1270
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:41,710
6.1 addresses clarifying
the epistemic status of the FP.

1271
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,981
So what were you aiming to bring people's
attention

1272
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:51,086
to and address in 6.1
with this philosophical question?

1273
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:54,490
Well, I think this basically summarizes
the point about dynamics,

1274
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,992
mechanics and principles
that we were making earlier.

1275
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:02,731
So the ACP has been described
variously in various

1276
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:06,301
and sometimes very different ways,
even by its core.

1277
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:10,973
Proponents of Carl introduced
the FP to the world as a theory

1278
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:16,411
of cortical function circa 2005
and then as a unified brain theory

1279
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:20,682
in 2010, which led a lot of people.

1280
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:25,387
And I think not to say this is in bad
faith, it led a lot of people to say,

1281
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:29,591
well, okay, so this is a theory
and so it should be making predictions

1282
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:33,695
and therefore
it should be empirically verifiable.

1283
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:37,132
So I think that the way

1284
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:40,335
that we talked about it
led to a lot of confusion.

1285
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:44,840
And it's been described as a framework,
whatever that means by myself

1286
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,041
included, right?

1287
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,944
So now, Cooper,
we called it the active inference

1288
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:52,347
framework for a long time without really
being specific as to what that meant.

1289
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:53,815
We kind of let all this

1290
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:57,686
this cluster of results,
that kind of agglomerate around the

1291
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:01,823
Rajah and

1292
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,760
colleagues have called this a a trick,

1293
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,865
kind of like the variational auto encoder
trick in machine learning.

1294
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:13,001
So it's a it's a trick
if you can write a bar code blanket

1295
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:16,004
for a system that you can make,
you can write down a model that looks

1296
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,941
that says that the system looks
as if it's performing.

1297
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,742
Bayesian inference.

1298
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,879
It's also been called
a physics of physics, of safety

1299
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,114
and systems of formal ontology.

1300
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,018
So the point is to,
so everyone is kind of right,

1301
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:34,122
you know, these are all in some sense
valid assessments.

1302
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:37,025
And Mel was really the one
who clarified things

1303
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:40,429
initially, I think, by distinguishing
formal structures

1304
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:45,434
from interpreted
empirically available models.

1305
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:50,372
And yeah I think that the first part here
is to say, well,

1306
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:53,942
we can make sense of this model
by appealing to this

1307
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:56,478
tripartite distinction
that we've outlined.

1308
01:16:56,478 --> 01:17:00,349
So by distinguishing dynamics,
descriptions, formal

1309
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:03,485
descriptions of some behavior
that we want to get to, mechanical

1310
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:08,156
theories that explain how the principles
that explain why, and then

1311
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:13,161
what we're calling, I think, empirical
applications, which are basically

1312
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,231
these formal models plus

1313
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:20,535
an assignment or an interpretation
or evaluation of these models in terms

1314
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,672
of the features of folded systems
that we want to explain.

1315
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:25,507
Yeah.

1316
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:28,610
So when they're applied
in that really mechanical theories

1317
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:33,048
become empirical theories
as we write in the ordinary sense.

1318
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:36,952
But yeah,
so hopefully this time to clarify

1319
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,954
as everything around falsification,

1320
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:43,091
how this thing is used and importantly
why this is just standard physics.

1321
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,693
I mean, this isn't

1322
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:48,730
this isn't all that spooky
in terms of the use of mathematics

1323
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:54,336
to make sense of physically relevant
aspects of our universe.

1324
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,239
So that's what we were trying to do
in that section.

1325
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:58,940
Great.

1326
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,343
Really clear. 6.1.

1327
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,146
It reads to me
like it's the tip of an iceberg

1328
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:07,716
with a nice landing and take off strip.

1329
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:11,386
And yes, it's a big iceberg,
but it is an iceberg

1330
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:14,756
and there is a tip that makes sense.

1331
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:19,928
6.2 On page 39, Ellen Goodall and the FP.

1332
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,933
What does the French linguistics
have to do with the FP?

1333
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:26,134
Maxwell

1334
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,870
Well, Dolphin might have some pretty

1335
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:31,206
interesting remarks to make,
but just briefly, I mean,

1336
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,242
I find it kind of ironic that,

1337
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:37,379
you know,
the people who are most critical of

1338
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:41,483
right now, like folks
from the inactive tradition and folks

1339
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:45,654
from the ecological tradition, sometimes
frame their own research, is trying

1340
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:49,491
to, you know, struggle against dualism
in some sense.

1341
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:55,263
But our belief is that they are
intrinsically dualistic frameworks.

1342
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:59,468
So a lot of detail is a French term

1343
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,237
with vitalism.

1344
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:06,174
I don't know how familiar you are
with the history of biology,

1345
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:12,247
but before the 20th century
and the discovery of DNA, most serious

1346
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:16,818
physicist believed in something
like Aristotle's into intellect

1347
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:22,324
so that you had to have some kind of
physical mechanism for purposes in this.

1348
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,361
And a lot of detail
was this kind of vital force

1349
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:30,932
that they believed the vital skills,
animated living systems

1350
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:35,437
and differentiated them from
non-living systems like stones and rocks.

1351
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:40,442
And we believe that one
of the consequences of the perspective

1352
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:44,479
that we're adopting here, building on the
especially the work of Mike

1353
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,583
Levin, who's done amazing
made amazing contributions in this field,

1354
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:52,788
is that it?

1355
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,657
Self-organization and cognition and life.

1356
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:59,261
And these these things that we like
to point out as being distinct from inert

1357
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:03,665
matter
are actually are more on a continuum.

1358
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:06,301
You know,
the Bayesian mechanics says that

1359
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:10,172
basically anything that's a thing

1360
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,474
will exhibit some features of what

1361
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,811
we think of as cognition.

1362
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,813
So it is a massive,

1363
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:21,650
massively deflationary
and absolutely resolute,

1364
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,820
humanistic perspective
that we're advancing here.

1365
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:26,655
Yeah.

1366
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:30,392
Which just, you know, the trying to look

1367
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:34,729
for the boundary between living
and non-living systems is bound to fail.

1368
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:37,566
In some sense there is a continuum.

1369
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:42,204
These processes
that we're interested in are also events

1370
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:46,041
by rocks
and by tornadoes and by crystals.

1371
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:49,077
And it is a question of degree

1372
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:52,681
to which systems act

1373
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:57,986
as cognitive systems.

1374
01:20:57,986 --> 01:20:58,286
Yeah,

1375
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,456
I'm sure GJELTEN
has more interesting things to say about.

1376
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,793
Yes on 6.2.
What else would you add there?

1377
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:10,599
Dalton Well, maybe not more interesting,
perhaps more interesting things to say.

1378
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,969
But. Well, yeah,

1379
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:17,072
I mean,
I think this section is as mostly just

1380
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,743
a recapitulation of footnote
two in a sense,

1381
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:25,447
meaning, you know, we made this statement

1382
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,818
that inference per se, a representation

1383
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:35,090
of some statistics of something else
is this very broad.

1384
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:37,893
The general and any system

1385
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:41,429
that is not a closed
system does inference.

1386
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:47,235
So what that means is, you know, under
the free energy principle, at least what

1387
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:50,972
we've written in that paper,
you know, what we've worked out so far,

1388
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:53,808
there isn't

1389
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,244
a way to talk

1390
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,880
about cognition versus non cognition.

1391
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:02,450
It's more of a spectrum of cognition.

1392
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:06,087
There are certain systems
that are more competent.

1393
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:10,458
This is something
that Carl might call a temporal depth.

1394
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:14,262
So there are systems that are very good
at planning and executing actions

1395
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,131
and there are systems
that are not, you know,

1396
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:19,401
so there's a very clear difference
between humans and stones, for instance.

1397
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:24,406
But that difference isn't in
one does inference and another doesn't.

1398
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:26,875
It's that one does
a bit more complicated inference.

1399
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:27,776
It has

1400
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:29,678
better

1401
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:33,348
or more accurate representations
or more representations.

1402
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,816
Full stop. Maybe.

1403
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:38,687
And it's better at using
those representations to to do action.

1404
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:44,359
But both stones and humans are estimates
of the statistics of the processes

1405
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,862
around them
simply by mathematical construction.

1406
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:51,199
And so there's this very

1407
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:54,302
uncontroversial statement,
or at least it shouldn't be a controversy

1408
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:57,038
that systems things

1409
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,708
in the very most general sense

1410
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:03,378
exhibit this kind of representation based

1411
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:07,682
inference that we would
typically identify as cognition.

1412
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,853
So that was the motivation
for talking about that.

1413
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:15,991
And then Maxwell tied a very nice
bow on it with this great history

1414
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:19,427
of a debate around
very similar questions.

1415
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:23,064
But yeah, it was this idea of a
of a spectrum of cognition.

1416
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:28,770
Awesome and citation 92
there is the 2018 paper

1417
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:32,741
answering Schrodinger's question
so many years ago.

1418
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:37,912
The other Maxwell at all,
who raised that question

1419
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:41,950
and sparked really
a phase transition in the discourse.

1420
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,051
And that was also like one of. The

1421
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:45,186
it was.

1422
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:48,390
One of the papers that really drew me in
and got me excited.

1423
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,426
And so it's amazing
to see what other questions

1424
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:55,563
and answers have been risen 6.3
And then gee,

1425
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:58,266
so 6.3 is a slightly longer section

1426
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,536
and it's on maps and territories.

1427
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:02,837
So yes.

1428
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:08,043
I'm I'm really glad, I'm really glad
that we were able to write this. So

1429
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:13,681
I never found
this particularly confusing, but I it

1430
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,785
it has led to a lot of confusion.

1431
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:21,289
In particular,
there's this entire paper by Thomas

1432
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,758
Linus that just is just confused about

1433
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:27,028
this issue.

1434
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:29,164
I forget what it's called this

1435
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:33,535
living life model or what.

1436
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:34,569
Anyway,

1437
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,972
so folks have said, well, so

1438
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:40,408
is, is the free energy principle

1439
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:46,514
just just a description
that we are, you know,

1440
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:48,850
a model that we are

1441
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:53,254
using to, describe
interesting features of the world.

1442
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:55,890
Or is it saying that

1443
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,127
in a self-organizing systems

1444
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:05,100
actually we are models of the world.

1445
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:09,871
And so, you know, we I never particularly

1446
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:14,242
found this problematic

1447
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:16,277
because I took

1448
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:20,682
this this phrase in the paper,
I think sums it up correctly,

1449
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:24,452
is that the free energy
principle is in some sense a map of that

1450
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:27,856
part of the territory
that looks as if it is a map.

1451
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:30,792
And so

1452
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:34,929
Thomas Metzger
actually retweeted our paper and pointed

1453
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:38,933
to called this nested representation
within which I found interesting.

1454
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:42,704
So yeah, there are these kind of

1455
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:47,609
two distinct levels at play,
but there's no foul play here

1456
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:51,312
because the FFP model is very explicit
about

1457
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:57,018
which parts of the formalism pertain
to our map of the territory

1458
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:01,322
and which parts of the formalism pertain
to the map.

1459
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:07,228
The self-organizing systems
constructing according to our map.

1460
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:12,200
So I think it's important to point out
that there isn't a contradiction here.

1461
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,004
There
owns just these two probability densities

1462
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:19,073
that are at play in the construction,
the density and the density.

1463
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,477
And you can understand
the the generative model

1464
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:25,146
or the density as basically

1465
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:30,685
our of the self-organizing system

1466
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:34,255
in terms of joint probability density

1467
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,159
over state space

1468
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:41,496
or potentially it's a space of paths.

1469
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:46,868
So in that sense, you know, the

1470
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:50,138
the self-organizing system
being its own best

1471
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:52,774
model really means we have a model,

1472
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:57,478
we can explain the systems dynamics
and the the system's

1473
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,250
potential is formalized,

1474
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:05,420
you know, as a as a generative model,

1475
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,423
a joint probability density.

1476
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:11,826
It just so happens
that part of the variables

1477
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:15,363
that are described by that joint
probability density

1478
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,233
played the role of parameter sizing,

1479
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:21,669
additional probability densities

1480
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:26,507
over another subset of variables
described by the generative model.

1481
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:28,376
So there are really these two, I think,

1482
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:32,413
unambiguously different

1483
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:37,619
senses of being a model that are at play.

1484
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:41,623
And yeah,
I don't think this is a sleight of hand

1485
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:46,661
and hopefully we have clarified.

1486
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:47,161
Yeah.

1487
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:50,798
What, what exactly is at stake here.

1488
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:55,903
I think there are some nice connections
to the maximum entropy formulation.

1489
01:27:55,903 --> 01:28:00,308
So as the Delta articulated in the paper
at least

1490
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:05,113
and I know you said you said
as much in discussion today, I think

1491
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:10,518
buy it by flipping to the perspective
of maximization of entropy.

1492
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:13,721
We we effectively recover
our own position

1493
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:16,491
as modelers trying to model the system.

1494
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:21,663
So the the prison through maximum

1495
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:25,133
entropy is adds
this additional clarification that

1496
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,336
yeah we can entirely recover
the perspective of a model

1497
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:32,073
are using maximum entropy modeling
to model a free energy type system

1498
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:36,477
by invoking this duality of perspectives.

1499
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:40,114
And I think that's really important.

1500
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:44,152
Then there's this other piece here
which says that the the maps

1501
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:49,090
that we construct in FFP
and in Max and both adhere

1502
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,459
a kind of epistemic minimalism.

1503
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:56,764
So maximum entropy inference
is basically saying, I'm going to

1504
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,300
or given some data set

1505
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:03,438
the probability density the most that is

1506
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:07,508
the one that best explains the data set
is the one with the highest entropy.

1507
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:08,476
What this means is that

1508
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:12,613
we are building in to that

1509
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:17,118
probability distribution
as little prior information as possible.

1510
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:19,887
It's like starting from the point of view
of maximal ignorance.

1511
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:23,224
Given a few constraints,
what is the underlying probability

1512
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:27,962
density of the FCB
as a similar starting point for?

1513
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:30,932
Maximal ignorance,
which says I can't go beyond the blanket.

1514
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:36,771
I am stuck with the data
that I'm generating and with the way

1515
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:41,275
that I probe the world, this data
generating process to generate my data.

1516
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,911
And there is no going beyond that.

1517
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:46,848
You can't go beyond the blanket
unless you break the blanket,

1518
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:48,649
but then you're just introducing
the new blanket.

1519
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:50,985
So, for example,

1520
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,321
I can't see in your brains,

1521
01:29:53,321 --> 01:29:56,657
I could put you in an MRI machine
and break the blanket,

1522
01:29:56,924 --> 01:30:00,528
but then I'm introducing another
another blanket,

1523
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:05,433
which is this new set of data that I have
to continue making inferences from.

1524
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:10,338
And so, I mean, then the the max

1525
01:30:10,338 --> 01:30:15,476
and kind of emerge as these epistemic li

1526
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:19,747
minimal or

1527
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:23,484
you know, they kind of emerge
as the way that you would construct

1528
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:28,322
a map of the part of the territory
that acts as a map from, a perspective

1529
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,858
from a starting point
of maximal ignorance.

1530
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:32,960
Right?

1531
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,197
And I think that's connected
in the active inference textbook

1532
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:40,368
to figure point one,
the meta Bayesian perspective.

1533
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:44,372
And there it's not described
in the context of maximum entropy,

1534
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:47,875
but it's something very similar with this
nested representation journalism

1535
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:52,747
on any other philosophical notes
before we go to Section seven?

1536
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:55,583
Yeah, that's exactly right.

1537
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:57,485
That's exactly right. Yeah. Yeah.

1538
01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:57,785
I love.

1539
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:03,090
This book.

1540
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:03,891
Yeah.

1541
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:07,695
That anything to add
before we want you to get there?

1542
01:31:08,863 --> 01:31:13,601
No, I think you raised an
interesting point so we can talk about,

1543
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:17,338
you know, when we use the P

1544
01:31:17,338 --> 01:31:21,108
to model a system, what we're doing is

1545
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:25,413
forming a model
of the system where the system forms

1546
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:27,782
a model of its environment.

1547
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:31,052
And so there is
this nested representation with them.

1548
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:34,322
What's interesting
about the maximum entropy

1549
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:37,592
point of view is you can kind of

1550
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:42,363
do allies is if you can, you can take
the sort of mirror image of this thing

1551
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:46,200
and you can ask, okay, well,
we're not interested

1552
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,737
in a model of the system
modeling something.

1553
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:51,772
All we want is a model of the system.

1554
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:55,142
So what does the system look like
when it's creating that model?

1555
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:57,845
Not what does the system's
model look like?

1556
01:31:58,713 --> 01:32:01,682
So this this is the dualisation
aspect of things.

1557
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:04,418
And so you can talk about what
and when you do allies,

1558
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:08,489
you can talk about things
like constraints on agents, states

1559
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:12,093
rather than the predictions
and actions of the agents.

1560
01:32:12,393 --> 01:32:14,228
So it's a bit of a different viewpoint.

1561
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:16,564
It's just emphasizing different

1562
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:21,669
levels, the nest, so to speak,

1563
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:25,473
which is which is kind of interesting

1564
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:28,676
because you do get both
of these perspectives for free

1565
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:32,013
as soon as you commit
to this relational symmetry

1566
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:36,617
of an observer in an environment
and an agent in an environment,

1567
01:32:36,617 --> 01:32:40,388
and how those two things do
model each other.

1568
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:44,125
And that's what you get when you do
aligns things.

1569
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:47,295
That's, that's, yeah, that's,
that's it for me on that section.

1570
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:50,598
I think Max looks pretty much covered
a lot of the important points.

1571
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:54,001
I mean I will say this,

1572
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:57,104
this probably is not obvious

1573
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:01,609
until you look at the mathematical
formula issue

1574
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:06,113
and notice that there are two
you know, as I as I wrote

1575
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:09,984
in that paper from a few years ago,
the FP is a tale of two densities.

1576
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:13,788
And you really need to like

1577
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:19,594
take a look at the math two, understand
that there isn't a

1578
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,330
this isn't like a case of reification.

1579
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:25,366
This is just formulated.

1580
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:30,404
So it it isn't that so simple
that you could just put it in directly

1581
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:32,940
to the graph and say,
Hey, look, here are these two.

1582
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:37,311
But definitely
if you take the time to work through

1583
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:41,082
formalism, there are clearly

1584
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:44,251
these two different senses
of being a model

1585
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:48,889
that are at play,
that are cleanly distinguished

1586
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:54,395
and I think are actually not all
that problematic.

1587
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:54,996
Awesome.

1588
01:33:54,996 --> 01:33:56,097
It's almost like thinking

1589
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:59,233
through other minds highlighted
some of the social consequence

1590
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:03,738
and theory of mind and behavioral aspects
of certain types of cognitive entities.

1591
01:34:03,738 --> 01:34:08,643
But systems
thinking of through about other systems

1592
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:12,747
or infers
thinking through other infers inference

1593
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:17,485
that type of dual view from the inside
view from the outside is again

1594
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,387
what you're suggesting is enabled

1595
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:24,392
by that kind of a commitment
to this foundations and of course

1596
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:28,596
it could be a whole nother gas stream
and perhaps should be on G theory.

1597
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:32,566
But as we close here, what can we say

1598
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:37,738
today on 613, 2022 about G theory

1599
01:34:38,072 --> 01:34:41,042
and what is exciting you all about
how you're going to continue

1600
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:44,645
forward?

1601
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:45,880
Do you want to take this one? Dalton

1602
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:48,649
Yeah, sure.

1603
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:51,952
So, I mean, like I mentioned earlier on,

1604
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,856
there's a lot of really promising stuff
in the literature

1605
01:34:55,856 --> 01:35:01,162
about path integrals and path entropy
and the kind of power

1606
01:35:01,162 --> 01:35:06,967
it has to deal with systems
that we would normally kind of balk at.

1607
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:10,538
And and so it's already very promising.

1608
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:14,141
There's reason to be optimistic
about how this extension

1609
01:35:14,341 --> 01:35:17,878
will benefit us in the future.

1610
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:23,984
So G theory itself is an actual coined
this term to describe the extension

1611
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:27,988
of this duality
from mode matching and max sense

1612
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:31,759
max cow,
which will involve precisely this.

1613
01:35:31,792 --> 01:35:34,962
We'll try to formulate the free energy
principle

1614
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:37,231
in its full generality as dual

1615
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:41,569
entropy, and it's full generality
on paths and so forth.

1616
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:47,007
And so the reason why this
is so exciting is because

1617
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:48,342
there's a

1618
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:50,511
very clear path towards talking about

1619
01:35:51,512 --> 01:35:54,315
systems
that are non stationary, so systems

1620
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:57,918
whose statistics change
more complicated forms of inference,

1621
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:01,188
more complicated forms
of constraints and preferences.

1622
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:05,493
And so it seems like already
it's a much more faithful description

1623
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:10,097
of the kinds of systems that we want
to talk about and extends to things like

1624
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:13,200
more complex systems, things

1625
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,470
like humans potentially.

1626
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:18,572
So so this is really the,

1627
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:21,909
I guess the, the end goal

1628
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:24,645
is to do this dualisation to now build

1629
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:29,116
an f, e
t dual model of something like a brain,

1630
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:32,686
which we know models its environment
in this very complicated way.

1631
01:36:33,053 --> 01:36:36,690
And so the kinds of representations
it does are, very complicated.

1632
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:41,362
So how do we model that, that

1633
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:46,400
that should arise out of maximum caliber
and therefore out of theory?

1634
01:36:47,034 --> 01:36:51,238
And in principle,
eventually we'll have a very faithful,

1635
01:36:52,273 --> 01:36:55,976
very foundational
picture of complex systems.

1636
01:36:56,277 --> 01:36:59,780
But this is a very long term
goal in the short

1637
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:03,150
term,
we just want to get the math to work.

1638
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:05,085
To connect that a bit.

1639
01:37:05,085 --> 01:37:07,354
To Morris's question earlier,

1640
01:37:08,556 --> 01:37:12,993
what does it mean to have a non
stationary density over this?

1641
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,630
Well, I mean, what we're interested in
is the way that the density changes

1642
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:20,901
as a function of the dynamics
so that you really have like these moving

1643
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:24,772
surfaces over a space of paths
or a space of states.

1644
01:37:25,105 --> 01:37:28,776
And to really capture
all of that kind of time dependency

1645
01:37:30,444 --> 01:37:33,981
requires moving from max to max cow

1646
01:37:34,448 --> 01:37:37,051
from states to paths and

1647
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:41,222
all of these kind of more fine grained,

1648
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:45,426
you know, wandering blankets
and moving attractors

1649
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:50,164
and all of that good stuff
should fall fairly naturally out of

1650
01:37:51,332 --> 01:37:52,733
gear theoretic formulation

1651
01:37:52,733 --> 01:37:57,438
of this stuff.

1652
01:37:57,438 --> 01:38:03,210
I like how within FP as we know it,
we have variational free energy f

1653
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:07,281
and then expected free energy takes us
into the future and planning and that's.

1654
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:09,383
G And then we see a little bit of like

1655
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:13,320
free energy principle F
and then G is the next letter.

1656
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,791
So that's a funny little
would no dual analogy.

1657
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:22,296
Well,
if anybody has any closing thoughts,

1658
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:24,331
it would be a great time for that.

1659
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:25,699
But just wanted to say that there's

1660
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:29,670
a lot of appreciation in the chat
and a lot of excitement around this work.

1661
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:32,573
So we hope that you just continue

1662
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:35,943
acting and inferring serving.

1663
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:38,612
That's that's kind of you to say,

1664
01:38:38,612 --> 01:38:38,846
yeah.

1665
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:43,651
Thank you very much
for the invitation to discuss our work.

1666
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:44,852
This has been great.

1667
01:38:45,886 --> 01:38:47,521
And yeah, we,

1668
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:50,424
we look forward to exploring the future

1669
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:54,628
with this whole community
and thanks for your time.

1670
01:38:54,628 --> 01:38:58,966
Our attention and your energy are very,
very positive.

1671
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:01,435
Always a pleasure to be on Active Lab.

1672
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:03,737
And yeah, thanks for the guest.

1673
01:39:03,737 --> 01:39:04,271
Sorry.

1674
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:07,341
Yes, I can only echo that.

1675
01:39:07,641 --> 01:39:10,177
It's been a pleasure. So thank you.

1676
01:39:10,177 --> 01:39:11,045
Thank you.

1677
01:39:11,045 --> 01:39:13,681
Thank you, Maxwell and Dalton at all.

1678
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:15,149
Thank you, Lars, for joining.

1679
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:18,118
And until the next time. Bye.

1680
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:21,789
Made the gradient descent ever
in your favorite method.

1681
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:48,749
And with yours slash rs. By.
