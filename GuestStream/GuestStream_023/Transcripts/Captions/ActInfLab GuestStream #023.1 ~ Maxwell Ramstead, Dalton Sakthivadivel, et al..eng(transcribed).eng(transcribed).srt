1
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,120
hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,280
it is june 13th 2022 and we're here in

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,960
acting lab guest stream number 23.1

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,520
with maxwell and dalton we're talking

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,520
about rebooting the free energy

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,400
principle literature and their recent

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,599
publication

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,480
so i'll pass it to the two of you to

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,519
provide just an initial introduction and

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,760
some context for the paper before we

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,719
jump into some specific parts

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
maxwell first

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,160
cool my name is maxwell ramstad

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,280
i'm the director of research at the

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,440
versus research lab

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,920
where we specialize in probabilistic

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,280
approaches to

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
artificial intelligence

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,079
um

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,640
and of late most of my research has been

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,120
on the physics foundations of the free

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
energy principle

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,359
and yeah very

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,799
very much looking forward to having this

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,360
conversation

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,840
awesome and dalton

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,479
sure um okay well i'm dalton uh i'm a

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,680
mathematician and a physicist

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,200
um

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,000
so right now i'm i'm uh at stony brook

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,320
university in new york i'm also at the

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,040
uh versus lab where we're doing some

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
work on the free energy principle right

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
now my research interests are about

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,400
formal approaches to biological physics

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,240
and mathematical foundations of complex

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
systems and these kinds of questions one

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
of the most interesting frameworks in

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,520
this sphere is the free energy principle

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,200
and that's uh how i've gotten involved

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,159
in this literature

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,439
awesome

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,920
so maybe in the same order

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,880
what brought us to this paper what was

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
the gap that this paper stepped into and

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
how did this team arise around the paper

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,719
and i'll bring it up on the screen as

48
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,880
well

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
it's a good question

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,160
um

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,318
well i i think the paper does a bunch of

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,959
different things um the first i mean

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
we've presented this as rebooting the

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
free energy principle literature um

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,920
i think uh

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,520
yeah over the last

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
it's been almost two decades now since

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
uh the fep has been a thing uh i think

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,879
the first paper was circa 2005 ish

60
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,720
and the

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
framework or the the field of study that

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
has emerged around the free energy

63
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
principle has

64
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,080
changed a lot over the last two decades

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,840
in no small part

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,080
in terms of the self-understanding that

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
we have

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,160
as a community of practitioners working

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,239
with these techniques

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,239
and i mean as dalton

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,080
pointed out a while back

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,040
i think the last time that really

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
the fep literature had been surveyed

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,239
in a systematic fashion to kind of

75
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
present where we were at uh where we

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
where we are currently like the state of

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,080
the art it was probably carl's uh

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,480
monograph from 2019 january 2019 um i

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,519
mean you know

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,560
both of you were part of this

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
international physics reading group that

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
we had uh this was not this is not a

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,680
simple

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
uh piece to read and uh

85
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
yeah since then um there hasn't really

86
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,959
been uh

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,560
basically a summary of where the

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
literature is so on the one hand we were

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
aiming to uh

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,599
reboot the literature

91
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,480
uh

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,519
to

93
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,840
to basically summarize uh the ways that

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
the free energy principle had been

95
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
applied uh in the literature

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,319
and uh

97
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,840
to also present a lot of the uh progress

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
that had been made over the last three

99
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,680
years a lot of which is due to uh dalton

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,879
so i think that segues nicely into the

101
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,319
dalton

102
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,159
well too generous by far as usual but uh

103
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,360
yeah so um maxwell raises a good point

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
that there uh hasn't been

105
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
really

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,959
an effort

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,120
to tie together all the different

108
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,399
threads since probably 2019

109
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,918
and uh

110
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,000
one of the reasons why

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,120
i mean that's

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
that's a long time but it's not overly

113
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,199
long however

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,720
in the last couple of years there have

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,600
been some pretty serious advances in the

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,320
state of the mathematics and the physics

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,960
behind the free energy principle so

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,240
now you know

119
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,960
three years later we're in 2022 it's not

120
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,280
a long time but nevertheless there have

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,040
been big developments that really

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,160
beg this kind of a survey to be done

123
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,320
and so that was one of the aims at least

124
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
of the paper was to draw together all

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
the different threads to unify them make

126
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,000
them a bit more cohesive

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and and present

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
the free energy principle as we're

129
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
conceptualizing it today in a very top

130
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,680
to bottom fashion

131
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
so before we jump into the sections and

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
the arguments and the claims in the

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,000
paper which i'm sure will cover a lot of

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
these updates

135
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
i'd just love to hear

136
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,440
what is the free energy principle

137
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
what is active inference and how are

138
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,080
they related

139
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
i mean i i guess in the most general

140
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,280
sense the free energy principle

141
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
is a statement that says that we can

142
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
understand the the dynamics of

143
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,120
self-organizing systems as following um

144
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
a path of least surprisal in the most

145
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
general sense

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
and then in that context uh it's good

147
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,919
that you ask the question i think that

148
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,840
there are at least two

149
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,080
uses of the term active inference in the

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,199
literature

151
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,160
um the one that i've tended to use is a

152
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,800
very broad sense which is just like

153
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
active inference is specifying a path of

154
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,199
least action

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,000
um for what are called autonomous states

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,479
so like the active and internal states

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,880
of uh systems that can that are

158
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
considered things under the free energy

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
formulation

160
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,039
active inference has also been used to

161
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,840
refer to uh a class of specific

162
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
partially observable markov decision

163
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
process models um that have been

164
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,400
deployed and you know most of the

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
implement in silico implementations of

166
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
the free energy principle rely on these

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
i think this has led to a little bit of

168
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
confusion

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,880
in that you know when folks say

170
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,840
active inference is a general theory uh

171
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,120
it's able to account for

172
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,880
self-organization that they're not talk

173
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,039
they're not saying this specific class

174
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,280
of pond vp models is effectively you

175
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,400
know repurposable for everything um so

176
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
yeah i i would say that

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,039
this is

178
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,800
the first sense that i outlined is the

179
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,479
sense in which we say that active

180
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,400
inference is a corollary of the free

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,280
energy principle um

182
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,919
and yeah i mean in its most general form

183
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,680
the free energy principle is just a

184
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
statement uh

185
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,080
an alternative statement or restatement

186
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,440
of the principle of stationary action

187
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
where the action is defined as a

188
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,560
surprisal

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,039
in effect

190
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,039
great dalton same questions to you

191
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,240
yeah i think um maxwell pretty much um

192
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,520
covered it

193
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
uh so as i mentioned you know my

194
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,440
background is actually not in the free

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
energy principle not originally and it's

196
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,720
not even in

197
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
machine learning

198
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
uh so i've come at this literature with

199
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,840
a bit of a different um set of

200
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,879
ideas and traditions and tools

201
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,039
and so as a result i can't really talk

202
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
about active inference and i'm not

203
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,479
totally familiar with it

204
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,479
but i can talk about the free energy

205
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,599
principle um at length i'll try to be

206
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,560
brief

207
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,360
um so to me the the free energy

208
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
principle is a statement that

209
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
random dynamical systems

210
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,680
uh do on average

211
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,000
unsurprising things

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,319
and and it's a very simple statement all

213
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,840
it means is that

214
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,560
if you have a random dynamical system

215
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,879
and it's trying to

216
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,639
get to some place in state space

217
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,360
that is not surprising to it

218
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,320
so some preferred region of state space

219
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
maybe a particular phenotype maybe a

220
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
particular

221
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,159
morphological blueprint something like

222
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,519
this

223
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,000
the free energy principle is a statement

224
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,880
of

225
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,279
not only that that happens but also a

226
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,920
set of tools to model how that happens

227
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,600
how do systems get to these kinds of

228
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,880
attractors

229
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,760
and there's this very interesting way

230
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
in which

231
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
the

232
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
the getting to that attractor can be

233
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
read as inference

234
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,000
and this is where these all these

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
connections in literature appear to um

236
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,480
things like active inference you can

237
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,080
talk about how systems actually get

238
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,839
themselves to that attractor as a

239
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,920
perception an action problem and you can

240
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,800
model it using this very famous uh

241
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,399
variational free energy bound and you

242
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,279
can show okay when the system is

243
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
encoding some sort of belief about its

244
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,680
environment and about itself that when

245
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,760
it does this inference you have the

246
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,399
minimization of some upper bound on

247
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,040
surprisal so so the system is at least

248
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,080
doing

249
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,959
unsurprising things at the level of

250
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,480
you know it's not exceeding some kind of

251
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
intrinsic surprise

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,920
that's some of the early formulations

253
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,279
some of the more recent formulations

254
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,120
take it even further and you say the

255
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,519
surprising full stop of of some

256
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
trajectory of the system is going to be

257
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,519
minimized by the system so it's going to

258
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,720
take

259
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,800
on average the system is going to do

260
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,519
what it expects to do which in this case

261
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,320
is

262
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
get to some region in the state space

263
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
that it prefers to inhabit

264
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,480
um what makes that not a tautology and

265
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
what makes it something that we can

266
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
actually operationalize and ask

267
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
interesting questions about is the fact

268
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,440
that there is this nice connection to

269
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
inference there are all of these

270
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,680
explicit mathematical tools that we can

271
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,519
use to talk about surprising

272
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,320
minimization not just as the kind of

273
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
information theoretic statement of

274
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,640
systems that aren't surprising

275
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,800
or systems that aren't surprised

276
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,880
due on surprising things it ends up a

277
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
little bit more nuanced than that and so

278
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,560
so to me the free energy principle is

279
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,360
this whole host of results uh about

280
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,480
um

281
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
random dynamical systems and especially

282
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,959
random dynamical systems which are

283
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,839
organized or which self-organize

284
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
think that is uh

285
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,200
how i would think of it and it's and

286
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
it's got some physics and

287
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,519
uh stuff that that we can actually talk

288
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,800
about in that context

289
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,839
awesome thanks both for those great

290
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,560
answers i'm pulling up the paper

291
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,600
and

292
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
so many things in what you said i just

293
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,079
wanted to follow up on but let's follow

294
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,560
the main line of the paper and wherever

295
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,240
you think there's some dots that could

296
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,200
be connected or any questions arising or

297
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,040
areas of future research or the

298
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,959
connection to applications that you're

299
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,040
working on or other people might think

300
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
about getting involved in we can just

301
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,920
take those little cul-de-sacs from the

302
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
main line

303
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,959
so i have the paper up

304
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,480
on bayesian mechanics of physics of and

305
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,279
by beliefs the two of you are the first

306
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,760
authors there's also connor heinz magnus

307
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,120
kudo barron millage lancelot decosta

308
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
brandon klein and carl fristen

309
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
any just overview notes on again like

310
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,279
what led to this team or anything like

311
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,480
that

312
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,360
while we're on this first page

313
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
um well

314
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,519
from my perspective uh you know daldon

315
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,360
and i have been talking a lot about this

316
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
kind of stuff for the last year

317
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,920
year and a half two years

318
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,120
um

319
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,959
and uh

320
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,399
yeah

321
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,639
i i won't i won't try to

322
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,040
i'll try not to be too uh

323
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
overly generous dalton but like i think

324
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,480
uh

325
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
yeah uh

326
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,040
so

327
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,920
some of dalton's work um has i think

328
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,240
changed the way that we uh think about

329
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,560
uh the fep uh

330
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
in particular um

331
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,800
what what dalton did in this great paper

332
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,880
towards a geometry and analysis

333
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,680
for

334
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
bayesian mechanics is to show that the

335
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,120
free energy principle and the principle

336
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
of constrained axon entropy are actually

337
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,680
dual to each other they are two sides of

338
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,760
the same coin

339
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,959
and i i you know i've been um

340
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,760
i've been following this line of uh work

341
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
for uh quite some time and i think it it

342
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
foundationally changes the way that we

343
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,639
think about the fep it moves it from

344
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,120
like this um some might say exotic

345
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,920
result from you know theoretical uh

346
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
neurobiology to uh

347
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,959
you know it connects it back up to

348
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,519
um the foundations of contemporary

349
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,360
physics effectively by showing that you

350
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,800
know

351
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
this thing that we we understand and

352
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480
almost take for granted uh you know

353
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,240
maximum entropy inference procedures

354
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
turn out to connect up to

355
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,560
uh this free energy literature in a

356
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,440
non-trivial way so i think the paper

357
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
started out

358
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,360
and it didn't end this way but i think

359
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
we started off trying to write a

360
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
reader-friendly companion

361
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,120
to uh the work that dalton had done um

362
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
but by the end of it realized that this

363
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
was more um

364
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,680
i think the dalton's paper towards

365
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,320
geometry and analysis for uh bayesian

366
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
mechanics pillars

367
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,800
i think it stands uh on its own as a

368
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,360
piece of mathematical reasoning so it is

369
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,639
an exercise in a maximum of entropy

370
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,959
inference math and it shows that you can

371
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,760
recover uh some of the really core

372
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
results of the free energy formulation

373
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
just using the language of constraint

374
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,600
maximum entropy in particular dalton

375
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,079
approves the approximate bayesian

376
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,240
inference lemma that had uh you know

377
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,160
caused so much discussion in our

378
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,760
literature

379
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
for the last bit

380
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,160
and so you know uh i think the the paper

381
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,800
grew out of that um

382
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,920
and

383
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
yeah the

384
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,959
the team is something of a who's who of

385
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,160
like the

386
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
you know the the core contributors to

387
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,839
this literature and just from a

388
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,399
strategic point of view it was important

389
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,639
for us to have like you know lance

390
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,240
decosta

391
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,920
carl fristen you know connor hines and

392
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,519
folks that had been

393
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,000
i think contributing to this core

394
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,760
formulation and in particular to the

395
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
development of uh

396
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
you know this new framing of the free

397
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,720
energy stuff a bayesian mechanics

398
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
um

399
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
so yeah i think that the paper grew out

400
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,440
of that and if dalton's paper is this

401
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,560
kind of dalton's stent like the towards

402
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,800
the geometry and analysis for bayesian

403
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
mechanics is a kind of standalone piece

404
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,440
of mathematical reasoning this is more

405
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,000
about how this actually fits into the

406
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
free energy principle literature so this

407
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
is very much more a free energy

408
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,759
principle literature paper

409
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,959
um

410
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,839
and yeah we were hoping to do you know

411
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,759
as reader friendly an introduction as we

412
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,480
could uh there are actually two

413
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,639
whole kind of introductory sections in

414
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,040
the paper um but we ended up doing a lot

415
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,079
of i think important work uh in that

416
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,839
paper connecting up to the free energy

417
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,880
principle

418
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,600
i hope that helps answer me

419
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,320
great answer and welcome lars would you

420
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,360
like to give any overviews or notes

421
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
before we jump into the sections of the

422
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
paper

423
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
hey thanks thanks for

424
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,399
sending me the link there maxwell allow

425
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,880
me on here um no nothing really to add

426
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,639
there i'm just here as a spectator i

427
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,560
have a few questions as we go down along

428
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,600
and maybe i can throw into the

429
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,360
conversation but um yeah thanks for

430
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,320
having me on

431
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,360
awesome

432
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,399
all right

433
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,639
so the abstract begins with a really

434
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,880
clear aim the aim of this paper is to

435
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,480
introduce a field of study that has

436
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
emerged over the last decade called

437
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,519
bayesian mechanics and we're going to be

438
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,079
unpacking that claim so suffice to say

439
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,040
the abstract very clear and summarizes

440
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
some of the core points that we're going

441
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,120
to delve into now

442
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,920
we're looking now at the contents

443
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,600
so

444
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,959
what led to the sections the paper being

445
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,079
this way

446
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,440
and in this order

447
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
what did you feel like it was important

448
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,800
to include what did you feel like it was

449
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,240
important to introduce and why

450
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,360
well so

451
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,519
if you look i'll i'll actually pull it

452
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,360
up in front of me so that we uh we're

453
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,839
all talking about the same thing

454
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,439
um

455
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,240
give me one second

456
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,480
and it's viewable in in large size on

457
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,839
the live stream so yeah feel free to

458
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,280
have your own copy up but i'll have

459
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,640
whatever section we're looking at will

460
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
be very visible on the live stream

461
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,160
well uh maxwell is grabbing his copy um

462
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,640
i'll just give a couple of contextual

463
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,679
remarks

464
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
so like maxwell described i mean

465
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
originally

466
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,960
i had released this set of results about

467
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,640
what we call approximate bayesian

468
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,080
inference

469
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,880
and

470
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,039
the sort of mathematical basis for some

471
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,120
of the key ideas

472
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
in the fep literature

473
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,679
up until that point anyway

474
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,480
um

475
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,320
and originally it was

476
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,360
meant to

477
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,039
be a much shorter paper that just

478
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,280
dissected some of those results and

479
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,080
related them back to the fep in a way

480
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,559
that was a little more concrete and a

481
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,240
way that people who actually work on the

482
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,480
ftp might might care a little more about

483
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,640
um because of course the stuff that i

484
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,400
wrote about is

485
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,720
um a little far removed from the fep

486
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,760
even though it's an object of

487
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,919
inspiration for the results in the in

488
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,919
that paper um

489
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,240
there is a reading of that paper where

490
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,120
it's

491
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,559
formally pretty distinct from the fep

492
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,640
so so originally that was the goal is

493
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,520
just give it some extra

494
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,400
physics intuition and some extra

495
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,440
connection to the actual fep

496
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,039
it became something a little bit

497
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,280
different as we were building this out

498
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,840
and we realized okay there are a whole

499
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,039
instead of of new results um not only

500
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,200
mine but also from uh

501
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,480
carl's tnb group and from others folks

502
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,559
and and they all really should be

503
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,440
tied together nicely and part of that is

504
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,520
the you know connecting the geometry and

505
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,080
analysis paper to the actual fep part of

506
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,799
it is actually talking about

507
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,039
what we would think of the fep as today

508
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,240
um

509
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,799
that shaped the table of contents a

510
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,280
little bit because a lot of what we then

511
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,760
wanted to go and say is okay we have

512
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,559
this

513
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,679
theory

514
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,400
of the free energy principle

515
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,559
one of the key ideas

516
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,000
in the way that we're viewing the free

517
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,760
energy principle today

518
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,120
is that it is just a bit of physics it

519
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,600
is it is much like classical mechanics

520
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
or statistical mechanics

521
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,760
um it has a set of mathematical uh

522
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,240
results that sort of hang around it that

523
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,640
give it a nice foundation and it applies

524
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,720
to specific systems and describes them

525
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
in a specific way

526
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,280
and and that was why we began with both

527
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,039
an overview of

528
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,880
what is mechanics what do we talk about

529
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,520
in physics when we say mechanics and

530
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
also section three is what is the free

531
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,880
energy principle what what have we

532
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,120
talked about so far in the literature

533
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
and and what might we define as bayesian

534
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,760
mechanics so what is what is the physics

535
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,799
of beliefs or systems that carry beliefs

536
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,480
so that that's sort of

537
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,640
excuse me that's sort of um shaped the

538
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,039
the first uh maybe 20 pages of the

539
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,000
papers it's just building out the theory

540
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and the context for the theory

541
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,120
afterwards is is a bit of a uh

542
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,760
sort of change in um

543
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,200
our uh

544
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,720
line of attack but

545
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
but you'll see it does remain very

546
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,400
similar so so i won't uh get too far

547
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
ahead of myself

548
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,679
great

549
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,559
any other notes maxwell or we can carry

550
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,360
on

551
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,200
i think that that's a

552
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,080
that's a great summary i think uh

553
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,000
yeah we

554
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
we try to keep this as self-contained as

555
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,919
possible as a paper so you know the the

556
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,720
two

557
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,600
uh

558
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,080
you know introductory sections

559
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,240
uh are meant to

560
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,840
uh provide some kind of visual uh

561
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,320
intuition for a lot of the more formal

562
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,080
results that are discussed in the paper

563
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
and in you know the the papers that it

564
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,039
builds on um we have uh you know the

565
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,159
artistic brilliance of brennan klein uh

566
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,960
that's added uh to this paper so uh you

567
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,720
know i think the the illustrations help

568
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
um the idea was that you know

569
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
based on dalton's work we we are

570
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,200
formulating basically a geometry and

571
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
analysis

572
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
for the core results and the free energy

573
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
principle literature so we thought

574
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,840
let's leverage

575
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,640
uh

576
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,039
the geometric nature of a lot of these

577
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,400
intuitions to really illustrate them

578
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,440
and so

579
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,559
yeah

580
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,480
that i think explains a lot of the

581
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,200
structure and the paper ends on

582
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,080
some philosophical considerations

583
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,919
and hopefully clarifies some of the

584
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,480
confusions or misunderstandings

585
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,600
uh understandable misunderstandings uh

586
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,840
that have arisen um

587
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,400
yeah so i think that no that does really

588
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
address uh i guess the last thing to

589
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,360
point out is uh we we introduced this

590
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,960
uh field of study

591
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,559
uh in the

592
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,159
last section that we uh we call g theory

593
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,120
um which is i think the direction that

594
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
we're going to be moving in for a while

595
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
which uh

596
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,760
is um yeah formulating uh

597
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
the free energy principle in the

598
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,080
bayesian mechanics in terms of maximum

599
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,559
caliber so

600
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,559
extending this duality

601
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,400
between

602
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,520
the

603
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,159
density dynamics formulation of the free

604
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,919
energy principle in terms of that

605
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,720
probability densities over states

606
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,080
and maximum constrained maximum entropy

607
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,440
to path-based uh formulations so

608
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,400
path entropy is called caliber and you

609
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,080
can

610
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,320
dalton is one of the few world

611
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,200
specialists in maximum caliber

612
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,080
uh

613
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,520
and yeah maximum caliber is a maximum

614
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,280
path entropy so it's the same idea as

615
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
maximum entropy but

616
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,760
you're considering the entropy of paths

617
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,720
and

618
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,799
we have had you know the free energy

619
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,400
principle started

620
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
off as a formulated in terms of paths

621
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
after all it is a version of the you

622
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
know the principle of stationary action

623
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
it leads us to write down paths of

624
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,640
stationary action and so the uh

625
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,320
the ambition now is to connect these

626
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,799
things up much more formally so that uh

627
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,880
we can uh

628
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
we can handle

629
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,360
really genuine non-equilibria

630
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,320
uh things like wandering uh markov

631
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,120
blankets and uh yeah moving attractors

632
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,679
and all that kind of stuff which find uh

633
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,240
you know a home much more naturally in

634
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,880
the language of maximum caliber did you

635
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,159
did you want to add anything to that

636
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,559
belton you're really the uh max cal

637
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,080
expert

638
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,400
um no i think that's uh that's a good

639
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,120
account of um one of the key future

640
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,679
directions is you know we spend the

641
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,200
first half introducing bayesian

642
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,320
mechanics

643
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
we spend the second half talking about

644
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,799
where bayesian mechanics fits into the

645
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,520
rest of statistical mechanics and uh

646
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,159
high energy physics by connecting it to

647
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,760
max end and

648
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,520
to gauge theory

649
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,039
and this is where some of the geometric

650
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,720
stuff comes in

651
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,880
and then the the very last thing we do

652
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
we sort of cap it off by saying okay now

653
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,400
you know

654
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,760
we've talked a lot about bayesian

655
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
mechanics we've talked a lot about

656
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,640
maximum entropy bayesian mechanics

657
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,440
but there is in some sense much more

658
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,360
natural formulation of bayesian

659
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,240
mechanics in terms of dynamics because

660
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,679
ultimately that's what we're thinking

661
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,159
about is dynamical systems and the way

662
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,320
that they evolve in time the way that

663
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,720
they flow over their state space

664
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,880
and there's there's a sense in which

665
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,679
not only is it much more natural

666
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,480
mathematically it just works easier it

667
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,840
looks prettier it's so it's much nicer

668
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
there's also a sense in which it's it's

669
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,279
meaningless to talk about states of a

670
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,279
process which is constantly in flux

671
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,240
so

672
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,559
limiting ourselves to densities over

673
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,520
states

674
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,120
as exists in the last

675
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,640
you know couple of years of the

676
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,000
literature

677
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,240
um which has in fact not always been the

678
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,720
case some of the early stuff

679
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,240
is written in terms of generalized

680
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,000
coordinates of motion which are nothing

681
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,400
but a particular way of talking about

682
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,279
dynamics and therefore paths

683
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,320
um

684
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,200
so

685
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
there's a sense in which the the recent

686
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,000
um detour into

687
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
states is very limiting not only

688
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,200
mathematically but conceptually limiting

689
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,039
and we can see that directly in the way

690
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,360
that it is um

691
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
handling things like non-markovian

692
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,720
processes uh or processes that change

693
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
with statistics that are out of

694
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,679
equilibrium

695
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,840
so so at the very end we say you know

696
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,360
we've done all this work

697
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,279
um the the

698
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,640
best next step is to take all of this

699
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,400
and and all this stuff that we've just

700
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,159
done about maximum entropy basic

701
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,799
mechanics and put it in dynamical terms

702
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,200
and this necessitates passing to what we

703
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,400
call maximum caliber which is uh also

704
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,480
due to jains originally it's the

705
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,559
principle of path entropy

706
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,600
um

707
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,279
but uh

708
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,760
eventually you know the goal is we would

709
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,080
be able to write all of this stuff uh

710
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,679
and in particular we'd have to be able

711
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,000
to generalize what we have written

712
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,600
into a language that's much more

713
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,919
dynamical and and uh

714
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,600
and max cal we already know uh has

715
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,600
demonstrated uh an immense uh success in

716
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,159
treating non-equilibrium processes so

717
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,159
mathematically i mean there's reason to

718
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,080
be very optimistic about what we will

719
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,960
gain

720
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,720
when we generalize the duality that

721
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,039
we've talked about previously uh and so

722
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,720
it really does seem like it's it's the

723
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,559
ideal thing to do in the very near

724
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,879
future

725
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,480
awesome

726
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,520
let's jump into the sections

727
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,640
so section one is the introduction

728
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,840
and just one part that uh

729
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,520
i wanted to highlight the footnotes are

730
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,679
so informative there's some of these

731
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,679
motifs like we set out to make it as

732
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,679
simple as possible and four pages was

733
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,039
our limit but then we ended up

734
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,120
innovating this way so that's one funny

735
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,640
motif and then the other funny motif

736
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,919
that i see

737
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,080
is um the super informative footnote

738
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,640
often because maybe it's possible to

739
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,520
just make the claim stand alone and

740
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,000
indirect response to somewhere else so

741
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
that's very exciting and interesting

742
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,880
like

743
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,399
footnote 1

744
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,799
covers a lot of the prerequisite

745
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,840
fields

746
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,200
like dynamical systems theory calculus

747
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,279
probability and information theory so i

748
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,440
found that to be very interesting

749
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,840
because it helps understand where we can

750
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,520
come from and what kinds of backgrounds

751
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,000
we'd want to be learning about and then

752
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,399
also a very important

753
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,760
distinction

754
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,240
of the two meanings of the word belief

755
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,080
in the probabilistic sense of bayesian

756
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,720
statistics or the propositional or folk

757
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,559
understanding as you write from

758
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,919
philosophy and cognitive science so um

759
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,080
just thought those were two interesting

760
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,399
footnotes and and reflected like part of

761
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,880
the process and the discourse around the

762
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,120
primary text and how that can be

763
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,120
clarified in this format

764
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,279
feel free to make any overall comments

765
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,640
on that or that's just getting to page

766
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,559
three

767
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,440
um

768
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,120
well about the um the prerequisites

769
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,919
it's a it's a difficult um

770
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,080
it's a difficult balance to achieve in

771
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
some sense right because

772
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,440
um we don't want to be academic

773
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,520
gatekeepers no one benefits from

774
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,000
gatekeeping but these are also highly

775
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
technical fields

776
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,000
um so you know

777
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,520
i've been joking for you know the last

778
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,960
few months if you've never taken a

779
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,279
derivative you're gonna have a bad time

780
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,760
in this literature it's just not the

781
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,520
kind of thing that lends itself to um

782
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,399
you know

783
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,559
surface engagement in some sense like

784
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,480
it's very and especially with these um

785
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,440
these new developments i mean uh there's

786
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,720
dalton's work uh that basically shows

787
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
that the free energy principle is dual

788
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,000
to uh maximum entropy maximum caliber so

789
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,480
there's this kind of deep connection to

790
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,919
i mean effectively

791
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,480
the the core of contemporary

792
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,679
physics uh and there's the there are

793
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,559
these new results uh that show that the

794
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,720
free energy principle is asymptotically

795
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,799
equivalent to the principle of unitarity

796
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,720
from quantum mechanics

797
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,039
uh you know there's there are these new

798
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,080
quantum formulations of fep that have uh

799
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,279
popped up

800
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,080
so

801
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,159
yeah i mean

802
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,240
navigating the space comfortably

803
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,799
presupposes a lot

804
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,880
and the good news is that it's hard for

805
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,120
everyone so

806
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,399
there's uh

807
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,720
there's something to learn for everyone

808
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,279
uh you know i spent the last uh three

809
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,360
years of my life teaching myself like

810
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,919
category theory and gage theory and

811
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,679
stuff which turned out to be very useful

812
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,440
uh you know connecting up with dalton

813
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,399
and

814
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,159
make doing all of this work but now uh

815
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,480
we're launching ourselves into quantum

816
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,799
theory which i'm less familiar with so

817
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,880
there's something to find difficult for

818
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,840
everyone

819
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,399
but um yeah

820
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,799
it i i really do think that to fully

821
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,640
appreciate

822
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,080
going on here

823
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,520
um

824
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,760
some technical prerequisites are

825
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,720
important um otherwise we're led to

826
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,600
making uh false assertions like i see

827
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,520
this circulate a lot that

828
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,399
dynamical systems approaches uh are

829
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,880
contradictory to uh information

830
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,320
theoretic approaches which is just

831
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,360
nonsense from a formal point of view um

832
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,760
yeah information metrics naturally

833
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
re-emerge when you're considering for

834
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,960
example uh

835
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,200
how do you measure distances in

836
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,480
state space effectively it's just yeah

837
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,200
so

838
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,720
the the more uh mathematical background

839
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,960
one comes with i think the easier it is

840
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,279
to integrate

841
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,519
into this um

842
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,200
yeah

843
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,080
yes well indeed there's a lot of

844
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,640
encouraging and good news and hopefully

845
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,559
a community that also values

846
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,679
participation and accessibility as well

847
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:38,399
so

848
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,600
agreed important general points there

849
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
um yeah before we move on i'll say

850
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,799
something really quickly about this

851
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,880
second book

852
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,120
just because it's it's a remark that's

853
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,960
actually pretty important to me in fact

854
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,679
maxwell's the one who wrote it but uh

855
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,360
i i didn't even realize but it is an

856
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,240
important um clarification that when we

857
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,960
talk about beliefs and an inference

858
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,440
it's it's much more general than just

859
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,279
uh an agent

860
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,120
or a cognitive

861
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,240
object

862
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,279
um

863
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,200
the the manner in which we talk about

864
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,279
inference and we talk about carrying

865
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,159
beliefs is this this much more general

866
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,080
sense of just

867
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,679
two random dynamical systems that

868
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,320
are coupled and and therefore

869
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,480
reflect the statistics of each other so

870
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,760
it could be

871
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,200
a i mean generically this is a system

872
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,120
estimating the statistics of an

873
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,080
embedding environment

874
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,799
the very important point is any system

875
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,840
with any noise and in fact systems with

876
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,279
no noise have statistics and so any

877
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,000
system that estimates or couples to

878
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,640
another system with statistics

879
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,960
can be interpreted as mathematical

880
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,880
inference that one system performs

881
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,200
inference about the other

882
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,919
the the sort of content that you place

883
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,159
on that idea of inference is very case

884
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,159
dependent so it's not the case that that

885
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,480
stones for instance are cognitive but it

886
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
is very much the case that stones

887
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,919
reflect the statistics of their

888
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,320
environment simply because these two

889
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,399
systems are coupled and their statistics

890
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,919
reflect each other and so this is what

891
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,519
we mean in the sense of talking about

892
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,480
agents that carry beliefs simply it is

893
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,440
about objects that do this kind of

894
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,080
statistical estimation which we think of

895
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,760
as inference but it's it's certainly

896
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,320
much more general than simply something

897
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,240
like a reinforcement learning agent that

898
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,480
actually stores representation of its

899
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,720
environment um it is a representation

900
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
but in a much more trivial sense in the

901
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,039
general case

902
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,279
i mean i would i would add to that by

903
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,760
pointing out that um you know dalton was

904
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
saying that we

905
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,360
there were there were disadvantages to

906
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,279
focusing on the density dynamics

907
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,039
formulation which features markov

908
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,919
blankets and the like up so marco

909
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,960
blankets are great and we like them um

910
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,760
but i think uh focusing on them so much

911
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,519
in the literature over the last several

912
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,639
years has obscured the fact that uh the

913
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,199
the free energy principle is at core

914
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,918
a statement about how you know as dalton

915
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,918
was uh saying earlier random dynamical

916
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,320
systems couple to each other so you know

917
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,040
the markov blanket is not some i often

918
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,199
hear and read in the literature um the

919
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,918
markov blanket secludes the organism

920
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,679
from its environment but it's not that's

921
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,839
not that's not the idea at all

922
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,399
uh the markov blanket is the set of

923
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,679
states by which the organism and its

924
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,040
environment are coupled and in fact the

925
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,679
you know we made this case in a neat

926
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,599
paper on a variational approach to niche

927
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,239
construction several years ago

928
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,560
you can basically swap the sensory and

929
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,440
active states uh

930
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,599
of your organism and you get sensory and

931
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,239
active states of an environment it is

932
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,960
fundamentally a story about how uh

933
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,520
systems couple uh and synchronize with

934
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,400
each other uh it's not a story about how

935
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,599
uh

936
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,400
yeah

937
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,320
things that exist or somehow secluded

938
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,160
from an environment it's it's really a

939
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,880
story about how yeah we uh

940
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,079
we

941
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,200
we become a model of our environment

942
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,839
meaning that we are like in tune with

943
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,000
engaged with and reflecting the

944
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,599
structure of that environment this

945
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,119
becomes very clear by the way when you

946
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,880
look at the quantum formulations of the

947
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,960
free energy principle

948
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
if you take the asymptotic limit of the

949
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,920
free energy principle so its behavior is

950
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,640
time tends towards infinity um for

951
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,280
classical systems that have space time

952
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,839
individuation what you get is something

953
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,800
like the good regulator theorem so

954
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,800
i become as much as possible as i can

955
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,240
like my environment uh you know modulo

956
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,200
this space time separation i can't be my

957
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,720
environment because i'm here and it's

958
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,800
there in some sense and then what you

959
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
get in that context is statistical

960
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,440
mirroring but in in the quantum context

961
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,359
when there is no space like separation

962
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,960
between systems the fep tends uh

963
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
towards um entanglement

964
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,320
so systems that uh are related in an fep

965
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,040
theoretic way at the quantum level uh

966
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,280
become entangled that is precisely what

967
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,960
the fep does

968
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,800
conforming to the fep means that systems

969
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,599
become maximally entangled

970
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,400
so it really is not a statement about

971
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,280
you know

972
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,359
how organisms are separate from their

973
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,400
environment

974
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,200
it's a statement about how organisms are

975
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,000
or

976
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,760
things in general self-organizing

977
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,400
systems individuate and couple

978
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
simultaneously to

979
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,400
their environments and how that's not a

980
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
contradiction

981
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,680
excellent um so as we

982
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,599
rush through section one and head to

983
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,599
section two i just wanted to pull out

984
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,240
two really key quotes you wrote in this

985
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,480
paper we discussed the relationship

986
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,640
between dynamics mechanics and

987
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,920
principles

988
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,960
and then

989
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,920
later on page five you write bayesian

990
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,000
mechanics is specialized for particular

991
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,240
systems that have a partition of states

992
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,880
and go on to describe it more so as we

993
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,040
head towards section 2

994
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,920
an overview of the idea of mechanics and

995
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,320
indeed bayesian mechanics could you

996
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,200
unpack a little bit by what you mean

997
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,400
dynamics mechanics and principles

998
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,320
sure um so mel andrews uh as everyone i

999
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,400
think in the literature knows now wrote

1000
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,839
this great paper uh the math is not the

1001
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,160
territory um which challenged us to be

1002
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,200
very clear about what we meant really uh

1003
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,720
when we're talking about the free energy

1004
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,480
principle and active inference and in

1005
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,839
there

1006
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,520
i think mel makes a number of

1007
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
contributions but one of their most

1008
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,240
important contributions is to

1009
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,079
differentiate between

1010
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,440
the fep as an uninterpreted uh formal

1011
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,720
structure

1012
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,400
and the fep

1013
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,040
as it might figure in applications to

1014
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,359
model specific kinds of systems

1015
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,079
and uh mel points out that you know

1016
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,000
the a lot of the confusion in the

1017
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,160
philosophical literature has to do with

1018
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,720
the fact that the the primary ftp

1019
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,640
literature often doesn't differentiate

1020
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
between

1021
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,720
the just the mathematical structure of

1022
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,640
the theory and then these models

1023
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,800
interpreted as representing certain

1024
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,440
features of

1025
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,200
a target system that we want to make

1026
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,880
sense of

1027
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
and that's important because

1028
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
falsification

1029
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,040
uh or verification empirical validation

1030
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,079
more generally um applies to one kind of

1031
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,280
thing but not the other right so uh the

1032
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,440
the free energy principle in so far it

1033
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,079
is as it is a mathematical theory i.e

1034
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,240
like a formal statement

1035
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,640
is no more falsifiable or subject to

1036
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,800
empirical verification than calculus

1037
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,680
would be

1038
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,280
right like you wouldn't you wouldn't try

1039
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,520
to falsify the axioms of calculus they

1040
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,440
do or do not apply informatively to

1041
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,200
certain kinds of systems so there's a

1042
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,680
level at which the core formal results

1043
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,720
of the fpp are have that status

1044
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,760
their mathematical results

1045
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,720
and

1046
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,960
we can use this to

1047
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,880
uh you know do some interesting

1048
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,480
empirical stuff

1049
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,520
so uh what we wanted to do is to

1050
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,640
differentiate between three kinds of uh

1051
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,560
formal things in the first class of

1052
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,480
tools that

1053
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,040
mel was outlining

1054
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,480
namely we distinguish between dynamics

1055
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,880
mechanics and principles

1056
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,200
so the dynamics are descriptive they are

1057
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,640
basically a

1058
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,400
formal description of some systems

1059
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,920
behavior

1060
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,000
you might say that like galilean

1061
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,520
mechanics is

1062
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,040
almost entirely

1063
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,680
dynamics

1064
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,440
you know the

1065
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
you needed someone like newton

1066
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,320
to come around and say well there are uh

1067
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,040
general equations of motion that one can

1068
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,280
write down to account for

1069
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
uh

1070
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,400
sort of how these

1071
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,200
uh

1072
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,359
how this description

1073
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,960
plays out in some sense uh so we move

1074
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,800
from dynamics

1075
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,240
to mechanics

1076
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,000
uh in the same way that we move from

1077
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,280
description to explanation from a target

1078
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,520
phenomenon that is formalized in a

1079
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,760
certain way that we would like to have

1080
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,480
an explanation for to a set of equations

1081
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,599
of motion that really account for

1082
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,079
how those dynamics come to be

1083
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,680
and then principles

1084
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,480
if if mechanics tell you how

1085
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,880
principles tell you why

1086
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
so usually

1087
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,040
in physics we appeal to

1088
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,480
some symmetry or conservation principle

1089
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,160
in order to derive the mechanics or the

1090
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,240
mechanical theory for the the systems in

1091
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,200
question

1092
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,000
so what we're left with is principles

1093
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,480
mechanics and dynamics all of which are

1094
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,119
formal theories and once you have a

1095
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,920
mechanics you can apply it to study

1096
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,040
specific kinds of systems empirically

1097
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,280
and that's where empirical verification

1098
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,440
would come in so principles are not

1099
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,839
falsifiable they're just bits of math

1100
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,240
and you use them to write down

1101
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,319
mechanical theories which when

1102
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,079
interpreted in the right context and

1103
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,839
when the variables are mapped onto

1104
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,440
things that are of interest target

1105
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,680
systems then they become subject to

1106
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,079
empirical evaluation

1107
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,720
so hopefully that um

1108
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,760
you know uh

1109
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,680
clarifies a lot of the model around uh

1110
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,000
around the fep one of the reasons why we

1111
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,920
spent so long you know outlining the

1112
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,599
idea of mechanics and physics is that

1113
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,440
this isn't some exotic

1114
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,520
way of thinking about things this is

1115
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,040
really just physics

1116
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,920
just

1117
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,280
straight

1118
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,720
vanilla

1119
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,839
reasoning from physics um

1120
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,000
yeah i'll stop there dalton has probably

1121
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,839
some interesting things to add

1122
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,920
no i think

1123
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,240
i think you've covered it um

1124
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,079
yeah it's it's just that there are

1125
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,319
important formal differences in physics

1126
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,560
between what we would call a mechanical

1127
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,680
theory for

1128
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,599
some object and a dynamical description

1129
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,599
of some object

1130
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,240
and so in this tower of

1131
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,480
things

1132
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,839
you get

1133
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,599
ideas you get theories that sit at

1134
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,680
different layers in the tower

1135
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,400
this hierarchy ends up being useful in

1136
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,720
clarifying uh

1137
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,640
this host of different results in the

1138
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,760
fep and where one fits into the other so

1139
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,440
it was important to take the time to

1140
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,960
discuss it

1141
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,480
but

1142
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,160
that was that and that's the whole point

1143
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,079
of section two

1144
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,680
awesome so to also move quickly through

1145
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,319
section two on page nine

1146
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,240
you write we are concerned here with

1147
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,119
what we have called bayesian mechanics

1148
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,920
and then you launch into

1149
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
an example of mechanical theory

1150
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,760
operationalizing a mathematical

1151
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,880
principle

1152
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,839
and you provide some

1153
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:14,160
classical statistical formulations on

1154
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,599
page 10.

1155
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,720
so could you give us an overview of what

1156
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,760
the equations on page 10 are showing

1157
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,040
like what they do for classical physics

1158
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
and what is the analogy or what is the

1159
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,800
connection that this is preparing us to

1160
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,200
make with bayesian mechanics

1161
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,000
yes uh well in fact i have an entire

1162
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,520
paper uh

1163
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,920
that's about to come out about this just

1164
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,440
like building on the analogy um so i'll

1165
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,240
uh

1166
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,599
leave that as an easter egg for the

1167
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,440
audience watch out for a classical

1168
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,839
physics for the bayesian mechanic paper

1169
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,920
because i think instant classic

1170
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,000
it might be some interest yeah

1171
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
might be of some interest but yeah so on

1172
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,160
page 10 um

1173
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,400
we are just giving an example of

1174
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,480
the of this kind of formal difference so

1175
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,920
you have um some kind of principle

1176
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,560
in classical physics it is the principle

1177
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,880
that systems um

1178
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,520
are kind of lazy you know they

1179
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,839
there is some kind of uh

1180
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,920
an amount of energy that it takes to get

1181
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,280
from a to b

1182
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,920
and systems don't waste that energy uh

1183
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,720
so they take precisely the shortest path

1184
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,000
from a to b or the path of least energy

1185
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,359
in in the more technical sense of the

1186
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,400
transfer

1187
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,880
of potential energy into kinetic energy

1188
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,400
so if you have some amount of stored

1189
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,440
energy the transfer of that into energy

1190
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,440
of motion is minimized along the path

1191
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,810
that's a very um

1192
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,000
[Music]

1193
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
abstract statement and there's not a lot

1194
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,440
that you can actually do with that

1195
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,359
computationally all you can say is you

1196
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,640
know the systems

1197
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,440
systems uh try and get from a to b

1198
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,520
using the shortest amount of motion

1199
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,000
possible no extra motion so so if you

1200
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,720
see in figure one for instance uh there

1201
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,680
are these paths that fly off into

1202
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,119
sort of these these very strange

1203
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,280
fluctuations in the classical world

1204
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,599
those fluctuations don't exist because

1205
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,240
classical systems take this uh energy

1206
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,640
minimizing uh parabolic path in the

1207
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
darker blue

1208
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,599
what is computational about that is that

1209
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,240
principle of stationary action so the

1210
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,720
principle that you don't waste energy

1211
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,880
um results in

1212
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,000
a

1213
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,880
mechanical theory a law of motion

1214
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,359
for the mechanics of classical objects

1215
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,520
this is what we would call newton's law

1216
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,280
newton's second law in particular it's

1217
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,079
this

1218
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,400
everyone knows f equals m a it's uh

1219
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,440
force equals mass times acceleration

1220
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,960
so the idea is that

1221
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,440
if you are such a system if you

1222
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,599
minimize the amount of energy that you

1223
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,560
take

1224
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,440
then

1225
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,880
the acceleration of you must obey

1226
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,319
precisely the force being applied to you

1227
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,280
uh and um and so this is your your law

1228
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
of motion this is a mechanical theory

1229
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,079
the dynamics that come out of that

1230
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,800
are able to be discussed when you start

1231
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,200
putting in actual details when you plug

1232
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,680
in whatever force being applied

1233
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,160
uh sorry that's a dog you probably heard

1234
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,040
it

1235
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,640
uh what is what is the force being

1236
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,240
applied to the system what are the

1237
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,920
initial conditions for the system what

1238
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,599
is the mass for the system all this

1239
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,119
extra data starts giving you

1240
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,520
trajectories so an actual model of the

1241
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,240
system which is less explanatory and

1242
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,560
more descriptive and this is at the very

1243
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,000
bottom of the hierarchy where you get

1244
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,680
this dynamical theory that's got all

1245
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,680
this extra data in it

1246
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,839
so this is this is very quickly an

1247
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,480
account of the

1248
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,119
that hierarchy

1249
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,240
awesome

1250
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,119
let's move into section three and figure

1251
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,160
two

1252
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,720
so the caption is three faces of

1253
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,560
bayesian mechanics

1254
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,040
what are the three faces of bayesian

1255
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,880
mechanics and what is this figure

1256
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,720
showing

1257
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,319
well

1258
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,119
it's

1259
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,720
it's often been

1260
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,520
suggested that there are like 17 000

1261
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,720
versions of the free energy principle

1262
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,880
and that it's not very clear you know

1263
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,720
what the current version is and all that

1264
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,200
stuff and some of this is fair

1265
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,800
and some of it isn't i think some of it

1266
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,720
is fair because it is true that

1267
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,200
often in the technical papers

1268
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,920
not sufficient care has been given to

1269
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,359
you know ex making very explicit which

1270
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,200
assumptions we're making about the

1271
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,720
systems that we're interested in

1272
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,480
modeling

1273
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,440
um so what we tried to do in section

1274
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,760
three is to provide a comprehensive

1275
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,400
survey of all of the ways that the free

1276
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,040
energy principle has been articulated

1277
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,720
in the literature

1278
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,960
um and so it turns out that there are

1279
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,920
basically three main ways in which the

1280
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,240
fep has been applied which we're

1281
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,000
representing here

1282
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,160
so we've already alluded to the first

1283
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,760
distinction um the fep can either be

1284
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,400
formulated in terms of a probability

1285
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,839
density over states directly

1286
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:10,960
or

1287
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,480
as a probability density over paths

1288
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,040
so over trajectories of states that we

1289
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
write in so-called generalized

1290
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,359
coordinates um

1291
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,280
and those are importantly different um

1292
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,200
so the the literature

1293
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,800
over the last i guess like circa 2009

1294
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,040
2012 to 2019

1295
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,079
focused

1296
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,040
you know

1297
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,160
almost exclusively on the uh density

1298
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,160
over states formulation and this is

1299
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,480
where you get um

1300
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,920
you know the approximate bayesian

1301
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,240
inference lemma that's played uh a

1302
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,160
pretty critical role in a lot of these

1303
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,680
investigations this is also where you

1304
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,480
get

1305
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,440
uh

1306
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,760
like states that play the role of markov

1307
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,920
blankets effectively

1308
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,680
um

1309
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,839
whereas the original formulation of the

1310
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,839
fep was in terms of a probability

1311
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,480
density over paths so you're not you're

1312
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,520
not really

1313
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,000
so much interested in in the you know

1314
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
the the the dynamics of a system just in

1315
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,839
terms of how probable states are what

1316
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,599
you're actually interested in

1317
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,800
is you know entire trajectories uh that

1318
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,559
unfold over time

1319
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,920
and um the the most general you know

1320
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,559
paths formulation doesn't make a lot of

1321
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,480
the um assumptions that have been

1322
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,359
criticized over the last little

1323
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,720
bit so

1324
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,559
importantly uh we don't assume that the

1325
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,520
systems being described are stationary

1326
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,720
um we don't assume that uh

1327
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,240
you know and accordingly we don't assume

1328
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,960
that the system has a non-equilibrium a

1329
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,119
steady state

1330
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,480
and we're now returning to this

1331
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,839
formulation because it's less

1332
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,520
restrictive uh

1333
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,240
you know for reasons that uh the dolphin

1334
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,839
could probably detail uh better than i

1335
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,599
can um so

1336
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,240
then within the density over states

1337
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,680
formulation

1338
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,319
um what you get is this kind of mode

1339
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,520
tracking or mode matching behavior

1340
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,000
where um i mean essentially what we're

1341
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,920
saying is that

1342
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,880
a

1343
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,880
system that conforms to the free energy

1344
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,200
principle is such that it looks as if

1345
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,240
the average internal state is tracking

1346
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,880
the average external state or

1347
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,680
like

1348
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,160
matching it and the the relevant

1349
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,839
difference

1350
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,440
in that

1351
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,760
density over states formulation is that

1352
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,040
the

1353
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,880
external mode that the system is

1354
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,839
tracking can have dynamics to it or can

1355
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,040
also not

1356
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,880
um and it was important to distinguish

1357
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,720
these cases because a lot of the formal

1358
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,480
analysis so for example our colleagues

1359
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,760
at sussex

1360
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,000
released this great paper how particular

1361
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,359
are the physics of the free energy

1362
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,400
principle

1363
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,800
and they come to the conclusion that uh

1364
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,079
there's

1365
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,760
the fep doesn't really have anything

1366
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,599
interesting to say about the class of

1367
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,359
systems that they examined

1368
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,040
what is the class of systems that they

1369
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,400
examined

1370
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,680
they are looking at linear systems uh

1371
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,440
that undergo

1372
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,800
dissipation effectively so uh

1373
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,160
physically these are dampened springs

1374
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,440
right so uh to restate if you take away

1375
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,760
the mathematical uh baggage what they're

1376
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
saying is the fep doesn't have anything

1377
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,160
particularly interesting to say about uh

1378
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,040
the behavior of dampened springs so what

1379
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,599
does a dampened spring do well it starts

1380
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:36,480
off

1381
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,960
and then it dissipates back to

1382
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,599
a fixed point if you're burning

1383
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,880
right like

1384
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,920
just due to friction um so

1385
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,760
the mode

1386
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,680
towards which the system is flowing has

1387
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,000
no dynamics to it it is a fixed point it

1388
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,839
just dissipates back to a fixed point

1389
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,680
and what they're showing is that

1390
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,760
there's nothing interesting to say

1391
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,160
from an fep theoretic perspective about

1392
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,640
those systems but

1393
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,800
i mean the the counterpoint is sort of

1394
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,559
that there isn't interesting anything

1395
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,000
interesting

1396
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,240
theoretically to say about those systems

1397
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,359
there isn't any interesting uh external

1398
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,319
dynamics that uh the internal dynamics

1399
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,000
would be matching

1400
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,800
and a lot of these null results uh where

1401
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,520
we

1402
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,240
we use fvp technology to say stuff about

1403
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,160
a system and there's nothing interesting

1404
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,960
to say look at systems that have fixed

1405
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,839
modes

1406
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,720
fixed external modes and so you know

1407
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,880
the the the idea is that you know the

1408
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,200
fep applies vacuously

1409
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,119
to those systems because there's nothing

1410
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,040
interesting to say

1411
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,640
um so

1412
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,599
yeah

1413
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,319
to

1414
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,960
to summarize my rant

1415
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,920
um

1416
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,000
we uh we tried to

1417
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,240
summarize the main applications of the

1418
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,000
fep in the literature we identified

1419
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,880
three

1420
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,480
um and strategically uh we point out

1421
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,680
where some commentators may have been

1422
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,040
led astray

1423
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,280
uh by focusing on one rather than the

1424
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,480
other so in particular a lot of this

1425
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,559
these ideas that the fep can't handle

1426
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,839
things like you know systems with moving

1427
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,680
attractors and uh you know systems that

1428
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,559
don't have like a single mode um

1429
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,640
that this these are understandable

1430
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,640
characterizations given that basically

1431
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,160
since 2000 from 2018 to 2 sorry 2012 to

1432
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,839
2019

1433
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,640
mostly focused on this middle class of

1434
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,440
systems so systems that uh we're

1435
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,119
describing in terms of the density over

1436
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,720
states uh that have a dynamic mode so

1437
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,319
it's understandable why people would

1438
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,520
focus their attention on that um but the

1439
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,839
fep in its most general form doesn't

1440
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:46,720
make

1441
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,160
you know perhaps problematic assumptions

1442
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,000
like stationarity um and it yeah it it

1443
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,720
also applies interestingly to systems

1444
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,559
that have interesting external state

1445
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,760
dynamics um so strategically i think

1446
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,599
that's what we were going for in this

1447
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:04,559
section

1448
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,680
um and i i believe this is the only

1449
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,040
place in the entire literature where

1450
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,280
this is reviewed so comprehensively in

1451
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,400
terms of this tripartite distinction um

1452
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,000
so you know i i don't mean to be

1453
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,920
disingenuous and to suggest that you

1454
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,720
know

1455
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,880
the confusions that have arisen are only

1456
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,480
due to um

1457
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,160
you know just

1458
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,160
a lack of paying attention these things

1459
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,079
have not been expressed very clearly the

1460
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,000
assumptions have not always been stated

1461
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,079
very clearly and

1462
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,599
yeah

1463
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,960
the the form of uh the path of least

1464
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,559
action in each of these things looks

1465
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,440
very different um so it we can also

1466
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,040
understand why it might seem like there

1467
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,880
are 17 versions of the free energy

1468
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,000
principle

1469
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,040
um but there aren't

1470
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,640
thank you maxwell

1471
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,960
as we speed through this section i'll

1472
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,880
just note that formalism 1 on page 15 is

1473
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,280
familiar and has to do with the flow of

1474
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,520
states in the particular partition

1475
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,400
and we've also seen the helmholtz

1476
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,520
decomposition shown in figure 3 in terms

1477
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,559
of a decomposition on

1478
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,040
into the vertical and the horizontal the

1479
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,119
gradient pursuing and the solenoidal

1480
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,680
isocontour aspect of flow those are

1481
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,200
reviewed in the citations that are

1482
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,680
provided here so let's get into the

1483
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,359
newer stuff

1484
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,720
um

1485
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,880
in section four you're discussing some

1486
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,680
mathematic mathematical preliminaries on

1487
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,280
the maximum entropy principle gage

1488
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,040
theory and dualization but first yes

1489
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,359
lars

1490
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,040
moving on to section 4

1491
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,960
section 3 was

1492
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,280
incredibly illuminating for me

1493
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,559
personally and i think the literature in

1494
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,480
general and having the separation out

1495
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,559
and there was a question that arose for

1496
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,960
me and working through this that

1497
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,880
i just wanted to throw out there

1498
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,799
um i don't want to distract the journey

1499
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,280
through the paper too much but

1500
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,079
in

1501
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,160
moving to this um you talk about on page

1502
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,520
19

1503
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,440
um when the ftp is applied to density

1504
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,079
over states as opposed to path we assume

1505
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,119
a non-equilibrium steady state density

1506
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,040
and then on the next page

1507
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,359
page 20 you see we can view this

1508
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,520
this non-equilibrium study state density

1509
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,359
is providing a set of prior preference

1510
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,040
preferences which lead the particular

1511
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,079
system

1512
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:24,960
um

1513
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,720
to look like it attempts to enact and

1514
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,760
bring about

1515
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,960
these preferences through action if you

1516
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,799
then move to the path-based formulation

1517
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,440
where there is no nest assumption

1518
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,599
how do you recover

1519
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,280
these preferences

1520
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,319
in

1521
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,160
in that formulation

1522
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,319
or can you not use that formulation to

1523
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,799
describe systems that are doing actions

1524
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,400
that look like they have preferences or

1525
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,400
is there a piece that i'm missing does

1526
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,880
that make sense

1527
00:56:55,839 --> 00:57:00,160
um i can take that one so um one of the

1528
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,400
one of the key uh deliverables of this

1529
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,160
third section is

1530
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,559
this three phases type thing right so

1531
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,599
the idea of the free energy principle

1532
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,319
and

1533
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,480
and the mechanical theory that arises

1534
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,359
from it

1535
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,359
is we would want a

1536
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,960
mechanical theory a law of motion for

1537
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,359
bayesian inference or for systems that

1538
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,520
do basic inference and what it ends up

1539
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,440
being is approximate bayesian inference

1540
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,359
and and this comes in three flavors mode

1541
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:28,319
matching

1542
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,160
mode tracking or path track this is the

1543
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,920
the three faces thing

1544
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,079
so that i mean just like you have

1545
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,760
different flavors of classroom mechanics

1546
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,520
you have things that move continuously

1547
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,760
like satellites in orbit or you have

1548
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,880
things that

1549
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,440
move and then stop moving like a bull

1550
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,880
thrown through the air eventually

1551
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,880
returns to the ground and things that

1552
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,200
sit on the ground don't move unless

1553
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,359
they're acted upon so there are very

1554
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,119
different flavors of approximate basin

1555
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,880
infants and these three are in

1556
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,640
particular the kinds of things that

1557
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,040
we're thinking about so

1558
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,799
the reason why i give that context is

1559
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,200
because we can still imagine preferences

1560
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,680
on the paths of a system

1561
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,799
a system must evolve in such a way that

1562
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,720
it avoids certain areas of the state

1563
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,680
space

1564
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,480
given that it remains a system so uh you

1565
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,839
know

1566
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,400
uh a human can't

1567
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,480
evolve in such a way that it dips too

1568
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,880
far away from its allostatic

1569
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,119
bounds there are certain set points and

1570
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,839
certain bounds around those set points

1571
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,319
in which i can oscillate but too far

1572
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,400
outside of those bounds and

1573
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,240
i'm in trouble

1574
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,200
likewise you know i can have something

1575
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,000
like a stone that kind of

1576
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,480
evolves through a state space the stone

1577
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,799
doesn't have preferences per se but it

1578
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:45,839
has

1579
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,599
a definition

1580
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,400
and and so we can read not um

1581
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,400
preferences but definitions about what a

1582
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,559
stone looks like in the same sense as we

1583
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,280
understand what a human looks like as

1584
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,960
certain preferences that guarantee

1585
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,520
cohesion so things that are definitional

1586
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,799
of a stone

1587
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,160
um guarantee that same kind of cohesion

1588
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,760
that just

1589
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,520
there's a type error if you would

1590
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,520
identify them but but you know

1591
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,440
mathematically they end up looking very

1592
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,640
similar

1593
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,559
and and what's interesting about that is

1594
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,280
now you can talk about preferences or

1595
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,280
you can talk about definitions along the

1596
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,359
path of evolution of a system a stone

1597
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,720
must stay

1598
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,559
roughly together it must stay in this

1599
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,640
sort of crystalline structure

1600
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,160
if you start uh

1601
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,559
hammering away at it you turn it into a

1602
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,680
powder this is something that we

1603
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,440
wouldn't think of as a stone

1604
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,400
so so in the same sense if a human

1605
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,520
um

1606
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,880
doesn't eat

1607
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,319
for too long

1608
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,559
and and maybe starves to death it's a

1609
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,359
really grim example but unfortunately um

1610
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,960
it's one of the better ones you can

1611
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,559
imagine you know you're you're drifting

1612
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,200
too far away from this um

1613
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,839
this state of being satiated or having

1614
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,599
sufficient energy to

1615
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,440
maintain um

1616
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,200
cellular uh

1617
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,280
processes and the chemical reactions

1618
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,839
that sustain life and as a result you

1619
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:06,640
know

1620
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,720
the the preference along your set of

1621
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,599
paths uh has been violated um so i think

1622
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,520
yes there is a sense in which even

1623
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,160
though we have forgone a nest density

1624
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,359
per se we still have a density over over

1625
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,000
paths not over states that this density

1626
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,079
still expresses something of a

1627
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,680
definition for the system or a set of

1628
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,240
preferences for the system without which

1629
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,000
we don't have a conceptualization of

1630
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,920
that system

1631
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,280
that's that's a very long answer to your

1632
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,240
question but but maybe it satisfies you

1633
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,079
no that's that's great thank you so much

1634
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,440
it was really useful that makes sense

1635
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,040
you you can kind of think about it as

1636
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,839
these constraints force systems to

1637
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,599
basically pick trajectories that are at

1638
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:48,960
the trial

1639
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,480
of uh you know a preference landscape or

1640
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,079
a constraint landscape if you want to

1641
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,000
think about it so you get the same kind

1642
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,920
of thing as dalton was saying but it's

1643
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,839
not the systems aren't assumed to be

1644
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,240
stationary so they're not um you know

1645
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,319
non-equilibrium steady-state

1646
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,480
distributions per se

1647
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,400
but there is something analogous

1648
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,559
uh and a lot of the uh

1649
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,040
future work in g theory is precisely

1650
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,960
about using the technology of maximum

1651
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,359
caliber to really make sense of this

1652
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,000
formally

1653
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:26,799
um let's move into section four

1654
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,079
so in section four as noted and as

1655
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,880
referenced to the previous publication

1656
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,960
there's a discussion that the fep is

1657
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,119
dueled to the constrained maximum

1658
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,720
entropy principle

1659
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,240
and then one of the ways that that's

1660
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,640
pursued in this section is through the

1661
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,079
lens or at least related to gauge theory

1662
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:46,960
so

1663
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,040
we're looking at figure four

1664
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,440
what is gauge theory what does category

1665
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,760
theory duel and how is it being deployed

1666
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,480
in this situation

1667
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,760
um i guess i'll take that one as well uh

1668
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,599
figure four you said

1669
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,119
yes

1670
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,000
okay

1671
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,640
illustration of fiber bundles sections

1672
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,200
the big mega figures

1673
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,400
oh yeah okay yeah uh well mega fig i i

1674
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,720
recognize that name i i believe that's

1675
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,880
how we refer to it internally

1676
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,640
uh yeah well

1677
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,640
so

1678
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,480
if you ask me

1679
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,680
um because i am a mathematician

1680
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,039
primarily

1681
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,240
uh

1682
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,839
if you were to ask me or if you were to

1683
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:34,000
ask a mathematician what is a gauge

1684
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,520
theory

1685
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,359
you would probably get a response

1686
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,680
roughly like well gage theory is the

1687
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,520
study of

1688
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,160
a particular geometric space called a

1689
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,359
fiber bundle

1690
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,039
so there is there is a type of space

1691
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,000
called the fiber bundle in geometry uh

1692
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,960
it looks exactly like that figure it's a

1693
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,440
bunch of fibers pasted onto

1694
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,079
um something on the bottom uh what we

1695
01:02:58,079 --> 01:02:59,920
call a base manifold

1696
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,079
and uh and studying how do things behave

1697
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,039
in

1698
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,760
a space like this how do they behave in

1699
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,839
the sort of fibers and how does that

1700
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,680
reflect some kind of behavior on the

1701
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,599
base manifold

1702
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,280
these are interesting geometric

1703
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,400
questions

1704
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,720
that arise in the study of fiber bundles

1705
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,440
and hence in what is called gage theory

1706
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,119
if you're a physicist i mean it turns

1707
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,079
out that

1708
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,400
fiber bundles are the natural

1709
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,000
space for talking about um classical uh

1710
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,039
gauge theories so the theory of certain

1711
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:35,039
high-energy particles

1712
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,880
um but it's but it's a little bit more

1713
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,400
general than that

1714
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,559
uh and so if you're a physicist this is

1715
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,960
what you think if you think about um

1716
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,760
like

1717
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,480
gauge bosons uh but but this is only

1718
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,400
because fiber bundles are very natural

1719
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,000
way of talking about these things and so

1720
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
it is a little bit more general

1721
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,520
what we're talking about in the figure

1722
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,720
four is this idea that uh

1723
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,200
in this space of fibers

1724
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,799
uh you can

1725
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:04,240
kind of trace out um surfaces and that

1726
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,720
these surfaces are like probability

1727
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,960
densities over the base manifold and in

1728
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,280
fact they aren't just like probability

1729
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,520
densities they are so you can formulate

1730
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,720
probabilities over a state space as an

1731
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,720
object in a fiber bundle

1732
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,480
and therefore

1733
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,559
if you have all the technology available

1734
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,359
to you you can draw this very nice gauge

1735
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,200
theoretic interpretation

1736
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,240
of what it means to be

1737
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,000
a probability density

1738
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,319
and therefore because the object of

1739
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,400
basic mechanics is systems that do

1740
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,400
inference and so systems that estimate

1741
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,720
probability densities there is a nice

1742
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,799
gauge theoretic interpretation to

1743
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,280
bayesian mechanics that hinges pretty

1744
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,640
much on this picture

1745
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,039
what we would call the the gauge in this

1746
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,319
situation

1747
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,760
is the uh choice of this j function so

1748
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,200
you see you have several different

1749
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,839
surfaces uh three of them each of which

1750
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,559
comes with a different choice of j

1751
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,680
uh so the the idea of choosing a

1752
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,720
function in the fibers

1753
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,960
and therefore choosing a

1754
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,119
shape for your surface

1755
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,119
this is what we would think of as a

1756
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,400
gauge theory and and that's why

1757
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,200
i went down this route in the geometry

1758
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,680
and analysis paper because it ends up

1759
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,480
drawing a very nice picture of what it

1760
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,799
might mean to

1761
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,240
engage in

1762
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,520
constrained inference

1763
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,160
awesome and could i give a pedestrian or

1764
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,880
so the the bystander

1765
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,039
yeah the the more the less technical

1766
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,000
version of it is uh so gage theories and

1767
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
dalton correct me whenever i say

1768
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,760
something that's wildly or even not so

1769
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,160
wildly inaccurate but gage theories are

1770
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,160
basically how one would

1771
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,880
how one articulates

1772
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,039
symmetries or conservation laws and

1773
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,119
contemporary physics

1774
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,400
so most physics relies on the idea that

1775
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,319
um

1776
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,240
some transformations that are of

1777
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,720
interest like the ones uh described by

1778
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,280
maxwell's equations uh

1779
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,760
have some kind of symmetry or or that

1780
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,839
concern i think a slightly better way of

1781
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:19,680
going about it would be to say that you

1782
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,799
know modern physics is broken up roughly

1783
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:23,920
into

1784
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,039
stuff

1785
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:26,480
and forces

1786
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,760
yeah and forces act on stuff

1787
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,680
and stuff gets acted on by forces

1788
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,119
so the interesting thing in gage theory

1789
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,760
is you can talk about how a definition

1790
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,200
of some stuff

1791
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,039
the shape of some stuff

1792
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,000
is intimately dependent on the forces

1793
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,319
acting on the stuff

1794
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,200
and so this is where we get this idea of

1795
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,760
we have a a particular

1796
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,079
shape to our surface we have some you

1797
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,880
know probabilities over our states but

1798
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,839
that this is actually defined by

1799
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,799
the the the choice of gauge this this j

1800
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,079
function so

1801
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,200
our assignment of probability two states

1802
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,039
is actually determined not by

1803
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,200
probability but it's determined by the

1804
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,359
constraints on those states certain

1805
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:16,880
states are preferable certain states are

1806
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,680
not

1807
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,480
unpreferable states get low probability

1808
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,559
preferable states get high probability

1809
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,880
and our notion of preferability is

1810
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,760
encoded in the choice of j it's a

1811
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,079
function that constrains

1812
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,240
different states so constraints in this

1813
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,480
case are like penalties uh so our

1814
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,640
assignment of penalties so our choice of

1815
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,720
force is actually what shapes our

1816
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,640
assignment of probability that's

1817
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,559
ultimately um

1818
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,240
i think uh well that's a slightly

1819
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,400
different way of viewing um the geometry

1820
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,559
of the situation is gage theory is all

1821
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:51,520
about these kinds of what we would call

1822
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,920
covariance relationships covariance

1823
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,920
meaning literally two things varying

1824
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,640
together if i choose a force i'm i'm

1825
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,920
forced to choose

1826
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,119
some stuff

1827
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,760
uh and likewise if i choose some stuff

1828
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,920
that necessitates uh an underlying

1829
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,440
choice of force

1830
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,599
so gauge covariance ends up being very

1831
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,640
helpful

1832
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,839
in situations like this

1833
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,680
thanks

1834
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,679
let's see if we can touch on some of

1835
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,359
these last figures

1836
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:20,880
in figure 5

1837
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,640
we see a vector field on a curve that's

1838
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,880
reminding us of that sort of baseball

1839
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,759
diamond shape from earlier with the path

1840
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,120
of least action

1841
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,120
and in figure 6 a probability density is

1842
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,960
generated by level sets of the

1843
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,719
constraint function

1844
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,238
j so either figure five or figure six

1845
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,198
whichever you feel fits in best here

1846
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,359
what is being shown and where were you

1847
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,520
going with it how is it connected to

1848
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,759
alternative phrasings

1849
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,560
yeah i guess i'll just cut to figure six

1850
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,719
which is kind of about this covariance

1851
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,880
thing so if i choose

1852
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,920
a

1853
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,880
particular functional form for j in this

1854
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,520
case it's a penalty that is proportional

1855
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,120
to distance

1856
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,120
i would expect my assignment of

1857
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,920
probability to fall off

1858
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,080
roughly like a distance function so it

1859
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,080
should it should be probability of a

1860
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,560
state should decrease as the penalty on

1861
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,399
a state increases so in this case the

1862
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,960
probability of a state should decrease

1863
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,158
as i go away from some central point and

1864
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:28,479
it should do so symmetrically and and so

1865
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,279
we would expect a gaussian density from

1866
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:32,479
this

1867
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:35,839
and it is indeed the case that uh you

1868
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,520
can understand

1869
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,560
the covariance as a kind of projecting

1870
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,120
down and then lifting back up

1871
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,679
and what do you get when you do that

1872
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,839
well the stuff in the equation the

1873
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:51,439
probability uh ends up being defined by

1874
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:54,400
where you take all of the sort of rings

1875
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,480
on the the j function you project them

1876
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,600
down

1877
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,080
you get circles on the base manifold

1878
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,560
when you lift them back up they're rings

1879
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,880
and so we know a symmetric

1880
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,199
probability density with a whole bunch

1881
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:09,520
of rings is just a gaussian probability

1882
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,480
density

1883
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,480
so so this this figure is kind of

1884
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,280
capturing um what does this covariance

1885
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,280
relationship actually look like how do

1886
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,320
we actually build stuff out of forces

1887
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,760
and and it ends up being the case that

1888
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,480
it's this very simple recipe of you push

1889
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,840
everything down

1890
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,679
and then you lift it back up

1891
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,560
and the lift is e to the j

1892
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,000
so the so you place j on to x

1893
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,840
uh that's the first step your second

1894
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,120
step is then you hit it with this

1895
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,159
exponential function and e to the minus

1896
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,880
x squared is of course a gaussian

1897
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,440
density so that's all that figure 6 is

1898
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,000
depicting it's just zooming in on one of

1899
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,480
the objects in figure

1900
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,799
4.

1901
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,719
great and i thought um on page 34 also

1902
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,640
the striking result that the splitting

1903
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,560
of the flow of a system into vertical

1904
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,800
and horizontal components under the

1905
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,040
constrained maximum entropy principle is

1906
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,640
isomorphic to the helmholtz

1907
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,880
decomposition of the flow of the

1908
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,120
autonomous partition of a particular

1909
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,760
system so for those who are caught up

1910
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,280
with the way that the helmholtz

1911
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,800
decomposition was used for example in

1912
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,800
the papers that we discussed in live

1913
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,480
stream 32 with markov blankets and chaos

1914
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,600
stochastic chaos this is augmenting it

1915
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,920
or transposing it into

1916
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,239
another formalization

1917
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:33,920
um and

1918
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,120
moving on again quickly um it's worth

1919
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,600
pointing out that there is uh

1920
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,679
there are some significant advantages to

1921
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:43,600
reformulating things in in terms of

1922
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,239
maximum entropy um

1923
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:47,840
uh i'll

1924
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,080
i'll let you know delta and speak to the

1925
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,320
more technical uh

1926
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,400
parts of this but i guess

1927
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,840
one um

1928
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,600
one thing that pops out to me more

1929
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,800
politically is that uh maximum entropy

1930
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,280
and constrained maximum entropy

1931
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,920
i mean they are just core parts of the

1932
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,640
physicist toolbox

1933
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,520
so

1934
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,760
the fact that we are able to

1935
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,719
reproduce the helmholtz decomposition in

1936
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,600
terms of the way that flow splits up in

1937
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,440
the gauge theoretic formulation i think

1938
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,440
is quite significant

1939
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,400
it gives us an entirely independent line

1940
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,320
of reasoning arising at the same results

1941
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,440
so uh you know especially due to

1942
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,800
some

1943
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,600
some work by martin beale and colleagues

1944
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,000
a few years ago we were not we were no

1945
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,600
longer sure whether some of these

1946
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,040
results uh

1947
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,040
obtained you know the

1948
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,280
there had been doubt thrown on to the

1949
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,920
derivations of the approximate bayesian

1950
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,600
inference lemma in some papers uh

1951
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,000
life as we know it from 2013 i believe

1952
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,320
is the paper that they targeted uh one

1953
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,320
way of reading this is that independent

1954
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,640
of all these analyses and independent of

1955
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,800
whether bl and colleagues are correct

1956
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,520
about their criticism of the 2013 paper

1957
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,239
this is an independent derivation that

1958
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,239
just follows from

1959
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,560
uncontroversial mathematics and we're

1960
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,920
able to re-uh re-derive basically the

1961
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,760
the main core uh portions of the formal

1962
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,719
results uh that carl had derived so the

1963
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,040
approximate bayesian inference lemma the

1964
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,640
helmholtz decomposition um and i mean

1965
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,159
in some sense

1966
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:33,040
the the magic is that we understand now

1967
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,400
why these arise to begin with

1968
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,719
uh there's uh

1969
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,320
yeah

1970
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,520
i think they're

1971
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,560
the um

1972
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,080
the maximum entropy interpretation um in

1973
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,640
some sense especially in the the gauge

1974
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,520
theoretic formulation in some sense

1975
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,360
tells us well

1976
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,080
why why does approximate bayesian

1977
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,760
entrance work

1978
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,719
just full stop and these sets of results

1979
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,199
explain you know effectively why this

1980
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,920
has to be the case

1981
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,560
only my facilitator hat prevents me from

1982
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,360
being that excited

1983
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,159
um

1984
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,120
section 5.4 also explored more in the

1985
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,360
previous citation so the four things

1986
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,520
that i wanted to just touch on as

1987
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,719
briefly as people wanted as we close are

1988
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,440
the three philosophical areas that are

1989
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,679
introduced in section six and then of

1990
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:31,199
course just the appetizer of g theory so

1991
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,600
in page 38

1992
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,760
section 6 the philosophy of bayesian

1993
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,040
mechanics

1994
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,080
6.1 addresses clarifying the epistemic

1995
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,800
status of the fep so

1996
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
what were you aiming to

1997
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,199
bring people's attention to and address

1998
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,880
in 6.1 with this philosophical question

1999
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,120
well i think this basically summarizes

2000
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,960
the point about dynamics mechanics and

2001
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,280
principles that we were making earlier

2002
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,840
um you know so the fep has been

2003
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,760
described variously

2004
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,840
in various and sometimes very different

2005
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,960
ways even by like its core proponents so

2006
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,159
carl uh introduced the fdp to the world

2007
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,320
as a theory of cortical function circa

2008
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,760
2005

2009
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,040
and then as a unified brain theory um in

2010
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,440
2010 which

2011
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,760
led a lot of people and i think not to

2012
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,560
um

2013
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,320
this is in bad faith it led a lot of

2014
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,239
people to say well okay so this is a

2015
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:27,440
theory

2016
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,080
and so it should be making predictions

2017
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,520
and therefore

2018
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,239
it should be empirically verifiable uh

2019
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,560
so i think you know the

2020
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,960
the way that we talked about it led to a

2021
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,120
lot of uh confusion and it's been

2022
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,960
described as you know a framework

2023
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,120
whatever that means by myself included

2024
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,159
right

2025
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,320
so meia koopa we called it the active

2026
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,920
inference framework for a long time

2027
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,679
without really being specific as to what

2028
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,600
that meant we kind of meant all this

2029
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,600
this cluster of results that kind of

2030
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,000
agglomerate around the fep

2031
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,159
raja and colleagues have called this a

2032
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,120
trick

2033
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,679
uh kind of like a variational auto

2034
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,080
encoder trick in machine learning so

2035
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,080
it's a it's a trick if you can write a

2036
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,840
markov blanket for a system that you can

2037
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,600
make you can write down a model that

2038
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,920
looks as that says that the system looks

2039
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,040
as if it's performing bayesian inference

2040
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,800
it's also been called a physics a

2041
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,040
physics of sentient systems a formal

2042
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,040
ontology

2043
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,120
um so the point is to say well everyone

2044
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,199
is kind of right you know

2045
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,360
these are all in some sense valid

2046
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,520
assessments and mel is really the one

2047
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,840
who clarified things initially i think

2048
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,719
by distinguishing formal structures

2049
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,080
from interpreted empirically evaluable

2050
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,000
uh models

2051
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,719
and

2052
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,600
um yeah i think the first part here is

2053
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,920
to say well we can make sense of this

2054
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,480
model by appealing to this tripartite

2055
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,560
distinction that we've outlined so by

2056
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,719
distinguishing dynamics

2057
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:00,960
or descriptions formal descriptions of

2058
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,800
some behavior that we want to get to

2059
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,280
mechanical theories that explain how

2060
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,800
and principles that explain why and then

2061
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,400
what we're calling i think empirical

2062
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,159
applications uh which are basically uh

2063
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,400
these formal models plus uh an

2064
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,320
assignment or an interpretation or

2065
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,480
evaluation of these models in terms of

2066
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,239
the features of target systems that we

2067
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,159
want to explain

2068
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:25,199
um

2069
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,520
yeah so when they're applied in that way

2070
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,360
mechanical theories become empirical

2071
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,480
theories uh as we write in the ordinary

2072
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,480
sense

2073
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,239
but yeah so hopefully this kind of

2074
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,760
clarifies everything around

2075
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,400
falsification how this thing is used and

2076
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,480
importantly why this is just standard

2077
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,960
physics i mean this isn't

2078
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,199
this isn't all that spooky in terms of

2079
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,679
the use of mathematics to make sense of

2080
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,679
physically relevant aspects of our

2081
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:52,719
universe

2082
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:54,239
um

2083
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,920
so that's what we were trying to do in

2084
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,840
that

2085
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,120
section great

2086
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,719
really clear 6.1 it reads to me like

2087
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,679
it's the tip of an iceberg with a nice

2088
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:08,719
landing and take off strip and yes it's

2089
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:11,520
a big iceberg but it is an iceberg and

2090
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,480
there is

2091
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,640
a tip that makes sense

2092
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,040
6.2 on page 39

2093
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,640
elon vital

2094
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,360
and the fep

2095
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,679
what does this french linguistics have

2096
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,560
to do with the fep maxwell

2097
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,719
well uh dalton might have some pretty

2098
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:30,400
interesting remarks to make but just

2099
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,000
briefly i mean um

2100
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,320
i find it kind of ironic that uh you

2101
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,080
know the people who are

2102
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,880
most critical of fep right now like

2103
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,040
folks from the inactive tradition and

2104
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,800
folks from the ecological tradition

2105
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,239
sometimes frame

2106
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:47,040
their own research is trying to you know

2107
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,239
struggle against dualism in some sense

2108
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,560
but our belief is that they are

2109
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,480
intrinsically dualistic

2110
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,800
frameworks um so

2111
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,480
elon vitale is a french term

2112
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,360
with

2113
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,120
vitalism i don't know

2114
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,560
how familiar you are with like the

2115
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,520
history of biology but before the 20th

2116
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,360
century in the uh discovery of dna most

2117
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,080
serious uh physicists believed in

2118
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,360
something like aristotle's entire key so

2119
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,760
like that you you had to have some kind

2120
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,120
of physical mechanism for

2121
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,640
propositiveness

2122
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,199
and so ella guitar was this kind of

2123
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,080
vital force that uh they believe the

2124
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,239
vitalists believe animated living

2125
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,520
systems

2126
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,679
and differentiated them from non-living

2127
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:36,640
systems like stones and rocks

2128
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,600
and

2129
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,520
we believe that one of the consequences

2130
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,040
of the perspective that we're adopting

2131
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,679
here and building on you know especially

2132
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,120
the work of mike levin who's done

2133
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,800
amazing uh

2134
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,400
made amazing contributions in this field

2135
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,719
is that it

2136
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,520
self-organization and cognition and life

2137
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,280
and these these things that we like to

2138
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,120
point out as being distinct from inert

2139
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,120
matter are actually are more on a

2140
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,880
continuum

2141
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,520
uh the you know the bayesian mechanic

2142
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,520
says that um

2143
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,080
basically anything that's a thing

2144
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,480
will exhibit some features of what we

2145
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,960
think of as cognition

2146
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,480
um so uh it is a massive massively

2147
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,679
deflationary and absolutely resolutely

2148
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,760
monistic perspective that we're

2149
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,120
advancing here

2150
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,239
uh

2151
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,400
yeah it was just you know

2152
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,520
the um

2153
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,040
trying to look for

2154
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,560
the boundary between living and

2155
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,800
non-living systems is bound to fail in

2156
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,239
some sense

2157
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,560
there is a continuum these processes

2158
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,719
that we're interested in

2159
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,679
are also evidenced by rocks and by

2160
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,280
tornadoes and by crystals and it is a

2161
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,040
question of degree

2162
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,159
uh to which systems uh

2163
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,280
act

2164
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,440
as cognitive systems

2165
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,759
um

2166
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,120
yeah

2167
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,480
i'm sure dalton has more interesting

2168
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,320
things to say about that

2169
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,639
yes on 6.2 what else would you add there

2170
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,639
dalton well maybe not

2171
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:09,040
more interesting perhaps more

2172
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,440
interesting things to say

2173
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,280
but uh

2174
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,760
well yeah i mean i think this section is

2175
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,560
is mostly just um

2176
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,040
a recapitulation of footnote two in a

2177
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,000
sense

2178
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,040
um

2179
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,719
meaning you know we we made this

2180
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:25,760
statement

2181
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,679
that inference

2182
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:31,600
per se representation of some statistics

2183
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,600
of something else

2184
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,320
is this very broad very general thing

2185
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,360
and any system that is not a closed

2186
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,719
system does inference so what that means

2187
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:44,400
is you know under the free energy

2188
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,920
principle

2189
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,000
and at least what we've written in that

2190
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,239
paper was you know what we've worked out

2191
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,600
so far

2192
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,480
uh there isn't uh

2193
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,840
a way to talk about cognition versus

2194
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,199
non-cognition

2195
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,880
it's more of a spectrum of cognition

2196
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,440
there are certain systems that are more

2197
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,520
competent this is something that carl

2198
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,719
might call

2199
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,360
a temporal depth so there are systems

2200
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,040
that are very good at planning and

2201
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,960
executing actions and there are systems

2202
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,560
that are not you know so there's a very

2203
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,080
clear difference between humans and

2204
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,560
stones for instance but that difference

2205
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,159
isn't in

2206
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:24,239
one does inference and another doesn't

2207
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,679
it's that one does a bit more

2208
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,880
complicated inference it has uh

2209
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,840
better or more accurate representations

2210
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,400
or more representations full stop maybe

2211
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,159
uh and it's better at using those

2212
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:39,440
representations to to do action but both

2213
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,719
stones and humans are estimators of the

2214
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,120
statistics of the processes around them

2215
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,320
simply by mathematical construction and

2216
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,000
and so there's this very

2217
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,120
uh

2218
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,960
uncontroversial statement or at least it

2219
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,239
shouldn't be a controversy that systems

2220
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,280
things

2221
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,239
in the very most general sense

2222
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:01,520
exhibit this kind of

2223
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,840
representation-based

2224
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,520
inference that we would typically

2225
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,639
identify

2226
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,800
as cognition

2227
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,120
so that was the motivation for talking

2228
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,199
about that and then maxwell tied a very

2229
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,360
nice bow on it with this uh this great

2230
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,560
history of

2231
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,159
a debate around

2232
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,560
very similar questions uh but yeah it

2233
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,159
was this idea of a spectrum of cognition

2234
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:27,440
awesome and citation 92 there is the

2235
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,679
2018 paper answering schrodinger's

2236
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:30,560
question

2237
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,600
so

2238
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,040
many years ago

2239
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,280
the other maxwell at all

2240
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,960
who raised that question and sparked

2241
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,199
really a phase transition in the

2242
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:42,800
discourse and that was also like one of

2243
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,800
those

2244
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,000
it was one of the papers that really

2245
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,199
drew me in

2246
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,040
and got me excited and so it's amazing

2247
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,239
to see

2248
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:52,080
what other questions and answers have

2249
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,840
been risen

2250
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,199
6.3 and then g so 6.3 is a slightly

2251
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,639
longer section

2252
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:03,199
and it's on maps and territories so yeah

2253
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,960
what is that i'm really glad i'm really

2254
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,040
glad that we were able to

2255
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,480
write this so

2256
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,280
um

2257
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,199
i i never found this particularly

2258
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:15,040
confusing but i i i i it has led to a

2259
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,040
lot of confusion

2260
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,159
um so in particular there's this entire

2261
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,320
paper by thomas van ness that just is

2262
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,080
just confused about

2263
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,040
uh

2264
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,760
this issue uh i forget what it's called

2265
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,080
as the

2266
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,600
living

2267
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,199
life modeled or

2268
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,280
what anyway um

2269
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,239
so

2270
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:39,120
folks have said well so is is the free

2271
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,000
energy principle um

2272
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,400
just just a description

2273
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,440
that we are uh you know

2274
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:50,239
a model that we are using to describe

2275
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:54,480
interesting features of the world or

2276
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,280
is it saying that um

2277
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,120
you know self-organizing systems

2278
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,239
actually

2279
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:01,679
are models

2280
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,360
of the world

2281
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,040
um

2282
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:05,840
and

2283
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,440
so you know

2284
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,159
we

2285
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,239
i never particularly

2286
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:11,440
found this

2287
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,639
problematic

2288
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,080
um

2289
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,600
because i so

2290
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,199
the this phrase uh in in the paper i

2291
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,440
think sums it up correctly uh

2292
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,120
the free energy principle is in some

2293
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,800
sense a map of that part of the

2294
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,120
territory that looks as if

2295
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,560
it is a map

2296
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,120
um and so uh

2297
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,280
thomas metzinger actually retweeted our

2298
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,520
paper and pointed uh called this nested

2299
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,320
representationalism which i found

2300
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,159
interesting

2301
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,120
so

2302
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,800
yeah there are these kind of two

2303
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,199
distinct levels at play

2304
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,840
but there's no foul play here because

2305
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,880
the

2306
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,560
fep model is very explicit about

2307
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,960
which parts of the formalism pertain to

2308
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,320
our map of the territory and which parts

2309
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,480
of the formalism pertain to

2310
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:03,360
the map that self-organizing systems are

2311
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,080
constructing according to our map

2312
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,040
um yeah so i i i think it's important to

2313
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,719
point out that you know there isn't a

2314
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:14,000
contradiction here um that there are

2315
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,840
just these two probability densities

2316
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,360
that are at play in the construction the

2317
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,760
q density and the p density and you can

2318
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,280
understand the

2319
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,159
the generative model or the p density

2320
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:28,480
as basically uh our model of uh

2321
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,280
the

2322
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,760
self-organizing system in terms of uh

2323
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,760
yeah joint probability density uh

2324
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,159
over uh it's it's state space or

2325
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,400
potentially it's a

2326
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,840
space of paths

2327
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,080
um so

2328
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,960
in that sense you know um the

2329
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:47,760
the

2330
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,679
self-organizing system being its own

2331
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:52,239
best model uh really means we have a

2332
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,719
model uh we can explain the system's

2333
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:58,719
dynamics and the the system's uh

2334
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,719
potential uh is is formalized uh you

2335
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:05,360
know as a as a generative model as a

2336
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,560
joint probability density

2337
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,639
it just so happens that part of the

2338
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:13,679
variables that are described by that

2339
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:16,480
joint probability density uh play the

2340
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,040
role of parametrizing

2341
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,159
additional

2342
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:22,400
probability densities over another

2343
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,520
subset

2344
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,080
of variables described by the generative

2345
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,920
model so there are really these two i

2346
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,480
think

2347
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:32,320
unambiguously different

2348
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,760
senses of being a model that are at play

2349
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,600
um

2350
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,560
and

2351
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,600
yeah

2352
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,840
i don't think this is a sleight of hand

2353
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:46,320
and hopefully we have clarified

2354
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,239
yeah what

2355
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:51,600
what exactly is at stake here um i think

2356
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,600
there are some nice connections to the

2357
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,480
maximum entropy uh formulation so as

2358
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,520
dalton

2359
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,040
articulated

2360
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,199
in the paper at least uh

2361
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,040
and no he you said you said as much in

2362
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,920
discussion today um i think you

2363
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,880
by by flipping to the perspective of uh

2364
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,040
maximization of entropy we we

2365
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,840
effectively recover our own position as

2366
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,800
modelers trying to model the system

2367
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,080
um so

2368
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,920
the the the

2369
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,120
prism through maximum entropy is uh adds

2370
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,520
this additional clarification that uh

2371
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,120
yeah we can entirely recover the

2372
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,199
perspective of a model or using maximum

2373
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,360
entropy modeling to model a free energy

2374
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,920
type system by invoking this duality of

2375
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,239
perspectives

2376
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,410
and i think that's really important

2377
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:39,920
[Music]

2378
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,840
then there's this other piece here which

2379
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,360
says that the

2380
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,159
the maps that we construct in fep and in

2381
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:49,840
max end uh both adhere to a kind of

2382
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,000
epistemic minimalism

2383
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,239
so maximum entropy inference is

2384
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,840
basically uh saying i'm going to uh well

2385
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,960
given some data set uh the uh

2386
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,159
probability density that most that is uh

2387
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,840
the one that best explains the data set

2388
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,520
is the one with the highest entropy what

2389
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,360
this means is that

2390
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:13,280
we are uh building in to that uh

2391
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,679
probability distribution as little prior

2392
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:17,440
information as possible it's like

2393
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,639
starting from the point of view of

2394
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:20,320
maximal ignorance given a few

2395
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,400
constraints what is the underlying

2396
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,040
probability density

2397
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,440
the fep has a similar you know starting

2398
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,280
point for maximal ignorance which says i

2399
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,320
can't go beyond the blanket like i i am

2400
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,800
stuck with the data that i'm generating

2401
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,520
and uh with the way that i probe the

2402
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,080
world this data generating process to

2403
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,719
generate my data and th there is no

2404
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:44,639
going beyond that you can't go beyond

2405
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,639
the blanket unless you break the blanket

2406
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:48,080
but then you're just introducing a new

2407
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,199
blanket so for example um you know i i

2408
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:54,000
can't see in your brains um i could put

2409
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,920
you in an fmri machine and break the

2410
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,920
blanket but then i'm i'm really

2411
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,440
introducing another

2412
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,080
another blanket you know which is this

2413
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,000
new set of data that i have to continue

2414
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,800
making inferences from um

2415
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,600
so

2416
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,400
i mean the then the the fep and accent

2417
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,920
kind of emerge as uh these

2418
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,880
epistemically um

2419
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,600
minimalistic or um

2420
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,719
you know

2421
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:22,560
they kind of emerge as the way that you

2422
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,040
would construct a map of the part of the

2423
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,360
territory that acts as a map from a

2424
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,360
perspective from from a starting point

2425
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,239
of maximal ignorance

2426
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,239
great and i think that's connected in

2427
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:36,960
the active inference textbook to figure

2428
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,480
9.1

2429
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,800
the meta bayesian perspective

2430
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,560
and there it's not described in the

2431
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,719
context of maximum entropy but it's

2432
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:46,639
something very similar with this nested

2433
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:48,800
representationalism on

2434
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,280
any other philosophical notes before we

2435
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,600
go to section seven

2436
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,360
yeah that's exactly right

2437
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,600
that's exactly right yeah yeah i love

2438
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,840
this book

2439
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:03,920
um yeah

2440
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,159
is that anything to add before we launch

2441
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,639
into g theory

2442
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,320
no i think you raised an interesting

2443
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:14,159
point um so we can talk about

2444
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:14,960
you know

2445
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:19,520
when we use the fep to model a system

2446
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,000
what we're doing is

2447
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,159
forming a model of the system where the

2448
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:27,600
system forms a model of its environment

2449
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,760
and so there is this nested

2450
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,520
representationalism

2451
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,679
what's interesting about the maximum

2452
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:37,199
entropy point of view is you can um kind

2453
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:38,159
of

2454
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,400
uh dualize it you can you can take the

2455
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,560
sort of mirror image of this thing and

2456
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,120
you can ask okay well

2457
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,520
we're not interested in a model of the

2458
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,320
system modeling something all we want is

2459
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,320
a model of the system so what does the

2460
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,639
system look like when it's creating that

2461
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:57,199
model not what does the system's model

2462
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:58,480
look like

2463
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,639
so this is this is the dualization

2464
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,400
aspect of things and so you can talk

2465
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,800
about and when you dualize you can talk

2466
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,760
about things like constraints on agents

2467
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,800
states

2468
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,280
rather than the predictions and actions

2469
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,960
of the agent so it's a bit of a

2470
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,560
different viewpoint it's just

2471
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,840
emphasizing

2472
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,800
different

2473
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,159
uh

2474
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:20,000
levels of

2475
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,159
the nest so to speak

2476
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:23,120
um

2477
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,360
which is which is kind of interesting

2478
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,280
because you do get both of these

2479
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,120
perspectives for free

2480
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,280
as soon as you commit to this relational

2481
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:34,239
symmetry of an observer in an

2482
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:35,840
environment and an agent in an

2483
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,280
environment and how those two things do

2484
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,960
model each other

2485
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,880
um and that's what you get when you

2486
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,560
dualize things

2487
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,320
uh but that's yeah that's that's it for

2488
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,840
me on that section i think maxwell

2489
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,760
pretty much covered uh a lot of the

2490
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,280
important points

2491
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,400
i i mean i i will say that you know this

2492
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,360
this probably is not obvious

2493
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,600
until you really look at the

2494
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,000
mathematical formulation

2495
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,320
uh and notice that there are two you

2496
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,960
know as i as i wrote in that paper from

2497
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,120
a few years ago the fep is a tale of two

2498
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,480
densities

2499
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,639
um and you really need to

2500
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,560
uh like

2501
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,520
take take a look at the math to

2502
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,400
understand that there isn't a this isn't

2503
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,520
like a case of reification

2504
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,719
this is just formulated so it it it

2505
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,800
isn't so simple that you could just put

2506
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,760
it in a

2507
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,440
direct and a simple graph and say hey

2508
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,280
look here are these two

2509
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,239
uh

2510
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:36,560
but definitely if you take the time to

2511
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,480
work through the um

2512
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,000
the formalism

2513
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,760
there are clearly these two different

2514
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,719
senses of uh being a model that are at

2515
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,800
play um

2516
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,960
that are cleanly distinguished and i

2517
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,199
think are actually not all that

2518
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:54,000
problematic

2519
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,920
awesome it's almost like thinking

2520
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,920
through other minds highlighted some of

2521
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,600
the social consequence and theory of

2522
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,920
mind and behavioral aspects of certain

2523
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,679
types of cognitive entities but systems

2524
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:08,480
thinking of through about other systems

2525
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,840
or infers thinking through other infers

2526
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,120
infra ants

2527
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,520
that type of dual view from the inside

2528
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,679
view from the outside is again what

2529
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:19,760
you're suggesting is enabled by that

2530
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,040
kind of a commitment to these

2531
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,480
foundations

2532
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,679
and

2533
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,600
of course it could be a whole other

2534
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,080
guest stream and perhaps should be on g

2535
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:28,960
theory

2536
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,480
but as we close here what can we say

2537
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,320
today on

2538
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,400
613 2022

2539
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,440
about g theory and what is exciting you

2540
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,880
all about how you're going to continue

2541
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,280
forward

2542
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,199
do you want to take this one dalton

2543
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,760
uh yeah sure uh so

2544
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,400
i mean like i mentioned earlier on um

2545
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,600
there's already a lot of really

2546
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,480
promising stuff in the literature about

2547
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,040
patented girls and path entropy

2548
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,920
and the kind of power it has to deal

2549
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:02,719
with

2550
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,000
systems that we would uh normally kind

2551
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,400
of balk at and

2552
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,320
and so it's it's already very promising

2553
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,639
there's reason to be optimistic about

2554
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:15,199
how this extension will benefit us in

2555
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:16,880
the future

2556
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,679
um

2557
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,639
so g theory itself is is um

2558
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,880
maxwell coined this term to describe the

2559
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,000
uh extension of this duality from

2560
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,280
mode matching and accent max cal

2561
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,760
which will involve um precisely this

2562
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,920
we'll try to formulate um the free

2563
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,400
energy principle in its full generality

2564
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,360
as dual to uh entropy in its full

2565
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:43,119
generality on paths and so forth um

2566
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,880
and and so

2567
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,400
the reason why this is so exciting is

2568
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,800
because already there's a very clear

2569
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,000
path towards talking about um systems

2570
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,400
that are non-stationary so systems whose

2571
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,119
statistics change more complicated forms

2572
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:59,440
of inference uh more complicated forms

2573
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,760
of constraints and preferences

2574
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,159
and so it seems like already it's a much

2575
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:05,840
more faithful description of the kinds

2576
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,920
of systems that we want to talk about

2577
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,280
and extends to things like um

2578
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,199
more complex systems uh things like

2579
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,320
humans potentially um

2580
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,760
so so this is really the uh

2581
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,480
i guess the the end goal is to do this

2582
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,360
dualization to now build

2583
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,560
an fep dual model of something like a

2584
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,719
brain which we know models its

2585
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:32,960
environment in this very complicated way

2586
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,280
and so the kinds of representations it

2587
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,679
does are very complicated so how do we

2588
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:39,119
model that

2589
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:40,800
um

2590
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,679
that that should uh arise out of maximum

2591
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,920
caliber and and therefore out of g

2592
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:46,880
theory

2593
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,199
and in principle you know eventually

2594
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:52,960
we'll have a very faithful uh very

2595
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,080
foundational picture of complex systems

2596
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:59,119
but this is a very um long-term goal

2597
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,560
in the short term we just want to get

2598
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,280
the maths to work

2599
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,320
to connect that a bit to lars's uh

2600
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,199
question earlier uh what does it mean to

2601
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:12,880
have a non-stationary density over paths

2602
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,800
well i mean what we're interested in is

2603
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,719
the way that the density changes as a

2604
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:19,119
function of the dynamics so that you

2605
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,440
really have like these moving surfaces

2606
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,960
over a space of paths or space of states

2607
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,360
and to really capture all of that kind

2608
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,119
of time dependency

2609
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,000
uh

2610
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,040
yeah requires moving from uh accent to

2611
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,159
maxcal uh from states to paths

2612
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:38,000
and um

2613
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,080
all of these kind of more fine-grained

2614
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,280
uh

2615
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,719
you know

2616
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:45,280
wandering blankets and moving attractors

2617
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,360
and all of that good stuff

2618
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,560
should fall

2619
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,800
fairly naturally out of

2620
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,880
yeah g theoretic formulation of this

2621
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,119
stuff

2622
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:01,119
i like how within fep as we know it we

2623
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,760
have variational free energy f and then

2624
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,679
expected free energy takes us into the

2625
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,760
future and planning and that's g and

2626
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,600
then we see a little bit of like free

2627
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,400
energy principal f and then g is the

2628
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,520
next letter so that's a funny little

2629
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,040
would know duel

2630
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,199
analogy um

2631
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:20,239
well

2632
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,320
if anybody has any closing thoughts it

2633
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,639
would be a great time for that but just

2634
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:25,840
wanted to say that there's a lot of

2635
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,239
appreciation in the chat and a lot of

2636
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,400
excitement around this work so we hope

2637
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,760
that you just

2638
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,360
continue

2639
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,760
acting and inferring and serving

2640
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,480
that's that's kind of you to say uh

2641
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,000
yeah thank you very much for the

2642
